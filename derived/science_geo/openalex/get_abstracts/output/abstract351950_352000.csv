https://openalex.org/W1969003435,"miR-17 approximately 92, miR-106b approximately 25, and miR-106a approximately 363 belong to a family of highly conserved miRNA clusters. Amplification and overexpression of miR-1792 is observed in human cancers, and its oncogenic properties have been confirmed in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma. Here we show that mice deficient for miR-17 approximately 92 die shortly after birth with lung hypoplasia and a ventricular septal defect. The miR-17 approximately 92 cluster is also essential for B cell development. Absence of miR-17 approximately 92 leads to increased levels of the proapoptotic protein Bim and inhibits B cell development at the pro-B to pre-B transition. Furthermore, while ablation of miR-106b approximately 25 or miR-106a approximately 363 has no obvious phenotypic consequences, compound mutant embryos lacking both miR-106b approximately 25 and miR-17 approximately 92 die at midgestation. These results provide key insights into the physiologic functions of this family of microRNAs and suggest a link between the oncogenic properties of miR-17 approximately 92 and its functions during B lymphopoiesis and lung development."
https://openalex.org/W2072152932,"The positioning of nucleosomes with respect to DNA plays an important role in regulating transcription. However, nucleosome mapping has been performed for only limited genomic regions in humans. We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in both resting and activated human CD4+ T cells by direct sequencing of nucleosome ends using the Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique. We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-containing and modified nucleosomes are preferentially lost from the -1 nucleosome position. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the nucleosome landscape and its dynamic regulation in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2065330071,"Mammalian cells export most proteins by the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-dependent pathway. However, some proteins are secreted via unconventional, poorly understood mechanisms. The latter include the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL)-1β, IL-18, and IL-33, which require activation by caspase-1 for biological activity. Caspase-1 itself is activated by innate immune complexes, the inflammasomes. Here we show that secretion of the leaderless proteins proIL-1α, caspase-1, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 depends on caspase-1 activity. Although proIL-1α and FGF-2 are not substrates of the protease, we demonstrated their physical interaction. Secretome analysis using iTRAQ proteomics revealed caspase-1-mediated secretion of other leaderless proteins with known or unknown extracellular functions. Strikingly, many of these proteins are involved in inflammation, cytoprotection, or tissue repair. These results provide evidence for an important role of caspase-1 in unconventional protein secretion. By this mechanism, stress-induced activation of caspase-1 directly links inflammation to cytoprotection, cell survival, and regenerative processes.

Caspase-1 is a cysteine protease originally cloned as IL-1β-converting enzyme (Cerretti et al., 1992Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J.

It is an essential regulator of inflammatory responses through its capacity to process and activate proIL-1β, proIL-18, and proIL-33 (Ogura et al., 2006Ogura Y. Sutterwala F.S. Flavell R.A.

IL-1β and IL-18 are potent proinflammatory cytokines, and IL-33 promotes responses mediated by type 2 helper T cells (Dinarello, 2002Dinarello C.A. The IL-1 family and inflammatory diseases.Clin.

Caspase-1 knockout mice cannot activate proIL-1β and proIL-18, and they are resistant to endotoxic shock (Kuida et al., 1995Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.

Therefore, caspase-1 is considered as an “inflammatory” caspase. In contrast to mice lacking the apoptotic caspases-3, -8, or -9, caspase-1-deficient mice show no developmental defects, and cells isolated from these mice are sensitive to most apoptotic inducers (Kuida et al., 1995Kuida K.

Caspase-1 is initially expressed as an inactive precursor. Similar to the activation of the proapoptotic caspases-9 and -8 by the apoptosome or the death-inducing signaling complex, respectively, inflammasome complexes that are required for activation of caspase-1 have been identified (Martinon et al., 2002Martinon F.

Oligomeric NOD-like receptors such as NALP1, NALP3, or IPAF act as stress sensors for inflammasome assembly and subsequent activation of caspase-1, which in turn is responsible for activation of proIL-1β and secretion of the mature cytokine (Mariathasan and Monack, 2007Mariathasan S.

We recently demonstrated that the inflammasome is also responsible for UV-induced secretion of IL-1β from human keratinocytes (Feldmeyer et al., 2007Feldmeyer L. Keller M. Niklaus G. Hohl D.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), suggesting that proIL-1β maturation by the inflammasome is not restricted to professional immune cells. ProIL-1β, proIL-18, and -33 lack a signal peptide, and they are secreted by an unconventional, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi-independent pathway, which is poorly characterized (Qu et al., 2007Qu Y. Franchi L. Nunez G. Dubyak G.R. Nonclassical IL-1 beta secretion stimulated by P2X7 receptors is dependent on inflammasome activation and correlated with exosome release in murine macrophages.J.

Several other leaderless but secreted proteins have been identified, which may leave the cell by a similar pathway as IL-1β (Cleves, 1997Cleves A.E.

Some of them, e.g., the proangiogenic growth factor FGF-2 (basic FGF), clearly fulfill an extracellular function, whereas such a function is less obvious for annexins 1 and 2, galectins, or EBBP/TRIM16 (Rubartelli, 2005Rubartelli A.

Interestingly, caspase-1 and other inflammasome proteins are also released from activated macrophages or UV-irradiated keratinocytes, although all these proteins lack a signal peptide (Martinon et al., 2002Martinon F.

Secretion occurs quickly after activation of the inflammasome, which is thought to prevent apoptosis (Mariathasan et al., 2004Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P.

Inflammatory caspases: linking an intracellular innate immune system to autoinflammatory diseases.Cell. 2004; 117: 561-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The correlation between inflammasome activation and secretion also raises the questions of whether inflammasome activation and unconventional protein secretion are linked and whether the inflammasome and caspase-1 in particular are components of the secretion machinery (Ogura et al., 2006Ogura Y. Sutterwala F.S. Flavell R.A. The inflammasome: first line of the immune response to cell stress.Cell. 2006; 126: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). ProIL-1α, the functional analog of proIL-1β, is also secreted independently of the ER/Golgi system (Dinarello, 1998Dinarello C.A. Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-18, and the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, it is not a substrate of caspase-1 and does not require processing for receptor binding (Dinarello, 1998Dinarello C.A. Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-18, and the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, activated macrophages from caspase-1- or NALP3-deficient mice are not only impaired in IL-1β secretion but also release less IL-1α (Kuida et al., 1995Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Flavell R.A. Altered cytokine export and apoptosis in mice deficient in interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, Li et al., 1995Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. et al.Mice deficient in IL-1 beta-converting enzyme are defective in production of mature IL-1 beta and resistant to endotoxic shock.Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, Sutterwala et al., 2006Sutterwala F.S. Ogura Y. Szczepanik M. Lara-Tejero M. Lichtenberger G.S. Grant E.P. Bertin J. Coyle A.J. Galan J.E. Askenase P.W. Flavell R.A. Critical role for NALP3/CIAS1/Cryopyrin in innate and adaptive immunity through its regulation of caspase-1.Immunity. 2006; 24: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Although it is not known whether this is a direct effect of caspase-1 expression or activity, it raises the possibility that caspase-1 and the inflammasome are generally involved in secretion of leaderless proteins. Here we demonstrate that caspase-1 activation by the inflammasome is directly linked to IL-1α secretion from activated macrophages and UV-irradiated keratinocytes. In addition, secretion of FGF-2 also depends on caspase-1 expression and activity. Both proteins bind to caspase-1, suggesting a role of the protease as a carrier in an ER/Golgi-independent protein secretion pathway. Interestingly, secretion of caspase-1 itself requires enzymatic activity, and caspase-1 inhibition therefore prevents secretion of its binding proteins. Finally, using a proteomics approach, we identified known as well as unknown leaderless proteins, which are secreted in a caspase-1-dependent manner. To confirm the reduced secretion of IL-1α from caspase-1-deficient macrophages (Kuida et al., 1995Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Flavell R.A. Altered cytokine export and apoptosis in mice deficient in interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, Li et al., 1995Li P.

We measured the percentage of released IL-1α and -β by ELISA. As a control for unspecific lysis, we analyzed the ratio between the activity of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the supernatant and the total activity (cell lysate plus supernatant [Figure 1A]). As expected, we found significantly reduced levels of IL-1α in the supernatant of caspase-1-deficient cells, although the reduction in IL-1β secretion was more pronounced (Figure 1A). Activated wild-type macrophages treated with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor (ac-YVAD-cmk) or a pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) showed a similar reduction in IL-1α and -β secretion to caspase-1 knockout macrophages (Figure 1A), demonstrating that the enzymatic activity of caspase-1 is required. In contrast to previous studies (Kuida et al., 1995Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Flavell R.A. Altered cytokine export and apoptosis in mice deficient in interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, Li et al., 1995Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L.

This result may be in part due to a minor crossreactivity of our ELISA with the pro-form of the cytokine or it may indicate that (pro)IL-1β secretion is predominantly but not fully dependent on caspase-1 activity in macrophages. Keratinocytes secrete proIL-1α and -β upon UVB irradiation, and we recently showed that maturation of proIL-1β is inflammasome dependent (Feldmeyer et al., 2007Feldmeyer L. Keller M. Niklaus G. Hohl D. Werner S. Beer H.D. The inflammasome mediates UVB-induced activation and secretion of interleukin-1beta by keratinocytes.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In contrast to macrophages, keratinocytes do not process proIL-1α. This allows a quantitative determination of its secretion, irrespective of differences in the affinity of the ELISA to the pro- or mature forms. siRNA-mediated reduction of caspase-1 levels strongly decreased the secretion of IL-1β as well as of proIL-1α upon irradiation with a physiological dose of 50 mJ/cm2 UVB (Figure 1B). As a positive control we reduced the expression of EBBP/TRIM16, which is an enhancer of IL-1β secretion (Munding et al., 2006Munding C. Keller M. Niklaus G. Papin S. Tschopp J. Werner S. Beer H.D. The estrogen-responsive B box protein: a novel enhancer of interleukin-1beta secretion.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1938-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results revealed that secretion of both types of IL-1 by UVB-irradiated keratinocytes correlates with expression of caspase-1 and EBBP. Furthermore, treatment of keratinocytes with caspase-1 inhibitors strongly inhibited maturation and secretion of proIL-1β and also reduced secretion of proIL-1α to the same extent (Figure 1C). Therefore, efficient secretion of proIL-1α by keratinocytes also depends on caspase-1 activity and not only on expression of the protease. To exclude the possibility that proIL-1α secretion is a result of caspase-1-mediated release of IL-1β or other factors, we incubated keratinocytes with conditioned medium of UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. This treatment did not enhance proIL-1α secretion but rather reduced it (Figure 1D). To determine the specificity of the effect for IL-1 we analyzed the release of various other cytokines from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes using a multiplex cytokine assay. Whereas secretion of IL-1β was clearly reduced by caspase-1 siRNA, secretion of cytokines, which harbor a signal peptide, was not affected (data not shown). Caspase-1 is activated by inflammasome complexes in macrophages and keratinocytes (Ogura et al., 2006Ogura Y. Sutterwala F.S. Flavell R.A. The inflammasome: first line of the immune response to cell stress.Cell. 2006; 126: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Feldmeyer et al., 2007Feldmeyer L. Keller M. Niklaus G. Hohl D. Werner S. Beer H.D. The inflammasome mediates UVB-induced activation and secretion of interleukin-1beta by keratinocytes.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Since macrophages from mice lacking the inflammasome protein NALP3 secrete lower amounts of IL-1α than macrophages from wild-type littermates (Sutterwala et al., 2006Sutterwala F.S. Ogura Y. Szczepanik M. Lara-Tejero M. Lichtenberger G.S. Grant E.P. Bertin J. Coyle A.J. Galan J.E. Askenase P.W. Flavell R.A. Critical role for NALP3/CIAS1/Cryopyrin in innate and adaptive immunity through its regulation of caspase-1.Immunity. 2006; 24: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), we analyzed the influence of several inflammasome proteins on the UVB-induced proIL-1α secretion from keratinocytes by siRNA-mediated knockdown (Figure 1E). Interestingly, knockdown of Asc and NALP3, which are required for proIL-1β maturation, also affected proIL-1α secretion. These results suggest that a common mechanism involving caspase-1 and inflammasome components underlies the secretion of both IL-1 variants. Upon assembly of inflammasome complexes caspase-1 is activated, resulting in the formation of an α2β2 heterotetramer, which consists of two p20 (containing the active site) and two p10 subunits (Dinarello, 1998Dinarello C.A. Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-18, and the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, Ogura et al., 2006Ogura Y. Sutterwala F.S. Flavell R.A. The inflammasome: first line of the immune response to cell stress.Cell. 2006; 126: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Since proIL-1α is not a substrate of the active caspase-1 heterotetramer, it is unclear why secretion of IL-1α is reduced by caspase-1 inhibitors (Figures 1A and 1C). Either the active heterotetramer has secretion-promoting activity or this function can be fulfilled by the heterotetramer, irrespective of its activity. Caspase-1 inhibitors prevent tetramerization of caspase-1 and could therefore block IL-1α secretion by this mechanism. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed experiments with recombinant proteins expressed in COS-1 cells, which allowed us to determine the influence of active or inactive α2β2 heterotetramers with a mutated active site cysteine. First, we compared the effect of wild-type and inactive procaspase-1 on maturation of proIL-1β and secretion of proIL-1α and IL-1β (Figure 2A). As expected, COS-1 cells overexpressing caspase-1 with a mutated active site cysteine (C285A, C285S) secreted less proIL-1α, mature IL-1β, and interestingly also proIL-1β. This was not due to unspecific release after cell lysis, as we found the same amount of β-actin and similar LDH activities in the supernatants of all transfected cells (Figure 2A). Second, transfection of cells with expression vectors encoding the individual p20 and p10 subunits of caspase-1 resulted in formation of an active enzyme as reflected by processing of proIL-1β, and secretion of IL-1β and proIL-1α (Figure 2B). This activity was absent when p10 or p20 were transfected alone. Upon transfection of the inactive p20(C285A) subunit instead of the wild-type subunit, maturation of proIL-1β was hardly detectable. Most importantly, the concentration of IL-1α found in the supernatant under these conditions was also much lower. These results demonstrate that enzymatically active full-length caspase-1 or active heterotetramer are required for efficient secretion of proIL-1α and IL-1β. Since secretion of caspase-1 itself required an intact active site (Figure 2A), we determined if this is also the case for the α2β2 tetramer. For this purpose we transfected cells with Myc-tagged p20. Processing of proIL-1β and secretion of IL-1β and proIL-1α demonstrated the formation of a functional heterotetramer (Figure 2C). Similar to procaspase-1 (Figure 2A), only active p20 was secreted but not the inactive mutants. Furthermore, secretion of p20 was only detected in the presence of the p10 subunit, demonstrating that only the tetramer but not the isolated p20 subunit is secreted (Figure 2D). However, secretion of enzymatically inactive procaspase-1 was restored in the presence of wild-type caspase-1 (Figure 2E). As expected, only caspase-1 induced IL-1β secretion under these conditions, but not caspases-5 or -9 (Figure S1 available online). To further address the role of caspase-1 activity for secretion we performed an siRNA-mediated knockdown of caspase-1 in keratinocytes and restored the levels of caspase-1 by transfection with plasmids encoding either wild-type or active site-mutated caspase-1. Upon UV irradiation, only the wild-type protein restored secretion but not the mutated protein (Figure S2). Similarly, YVAD treatment of keratinocytes before irradiation reduced the secretion of procaspase-1 and particularly of activated caspase-1 (Figure 2F). We conclude from these experiments that procaspase-1 and the α2β2 heterotetramer require enzymatic activity to promote secretion of IL-1 and their own secretion. ASC is an example of an unconventionally secreted protein, which is not a substrate of caspase-1 but a binding partner (Mariathasan et al., 2004Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Differential activation of the inflammasome by caspase-1 adaptors ASC and Ipaf.Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). To determine if proIL-1α binds to caspase-1, we immunoprecipitated IL-1α from lysates of UVB-irradiated or control keratinocytes. Indeed, caspase-1 was present in the precipitate of both samples. Interestingly, the amount of caspase-1 bound to IL-1α was clearly enhanced 30 min after irradiation (Figure 3A). Therefore, UV irradiation enhances direct or indirect association of both proteins and concomitant secretion of IL-1α. Binding was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of proteins overexpressed in COS-1 cells (Figure 3B), indicating a direct interaction. ProIL-1α bound to the p20 subunit of caspase-1 but not to the CARD, which is an adaptor domain for homotypic interactions (Figure 3B). Interaction between proIL-1α and the p20 subunit was independent of the active site cysteine (Figure 3C). The effect of caspase-1 on secretion of both IL-1 variants raises the possibility of a more general role of caspase-1 in unconventional secretion. To address this question we determined if caspase-1 affects release of FGF-2. The latter is a secreted growth factor, although it lacks a signal peptide (Nickel, 2005Nickel W. Unconventional secretory routes: direct protein export across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells.Traffic. 2005; 6: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FGF-2 exhibits a weak homology to IL-1 and shares the same β strand fold (Dinarello, 1998Dinarello C.A. Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-18, and the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We used primary skin-derived fibroblasts to study FGF-2 secretion because expression of this growth factor is very low in macrophages and keratinocytes (data not shown). Irradiation of human fibroblasts with a physiological dose of 5 mJ/cm2 UVA strongly increased FGF-2 secretion (data not shown). Interestingly, knockdown of caspase-1 in fibroblasts significantly reduced FGF-2 secretion compared to cells transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNA corresponding to the unrelated VEGF-A (Figure 4A). The dependence of FGF-2 secretion on caspase-1 expression was confirmed with fibroblasts from caspase-1 knockout mice and wild-type littermates (Figure 4B). Furthermore, treatment of human fibroblasts with caspase-1 inhibitors significantly reduced the amount of secreted FGF-2 (Figure 4C), demonstrating that efficient FGF-2 secretion requires not only caspase-1 expression but also caspase-1 activity. However, UV-induced secretion of FGF-2 was not fully dependent on caspase-1 since low amounts were still secreted in the absence of this proteinase. We next examined a possible interaction between caspase-1 and FGF-2 in UVA-irradiated human fibrob"

This resulted in a developmental block at the pro- to pre-B cell transition. Gene-expression profiling revealed a miR-17∼92 signature in the 3′UTRs of genes upregulated in Dicer-deficient pro-B cells; a top miR-17∼92 target, the proapoptotic molecule Bim, was highly upregulated. Accordingly, B cell development could be partially rescued by ablation of Bim or transgenic expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-2. This allowed us to assess the impact of Dicer deficiency on the V(D)J recombination program in developing B cells. We found intact Ig gene rearrangements in immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and κ chain loci, but increased sterile transcription and usage of DH elements of the DSP family in IgH, and increased N sequence addition in Igκ due to deregulated transcription of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene. To explore the role of Dicer-dependent control mechanisms in B lymphocyte development, we ablated this enzyme in early B cell progenitors.

Accordingly, B cell development could be partially rescued by ablation of Bim or transgenic expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-2.

We found intact Ig gene rearrangements in immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and κ chain loci, but increased sterile transcription and usage of DH elements of the DSP family in IgH, and increased N sequence addition in Igκ due to deregulated transcription of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene. B cell development is dependent on somatic gene rearrangements at the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and Ig light (L) chain loci, which ultimately ensure that the developing B cells express a membrane-bound antibody as an antigen receptor (BCR) (Rajewsky, 1996Rajewsky K. Clonal selection and learning in the antibody system.Nature. 1996; 381: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). In this process, a DHJH and subsequently a VHDHJH joint is assembled in progenitor B (pro-B) cells from multiple VH, DH, and JH elements of the germline IgH locus. If this VHDHJH joint is in the correct reading frame, an IgH chain of class μ (Igμ) is expressed by the pro-B cell together with the “surrogate” light chains λ5 and VpreB as a surface receptor complex called pre-BCR. A phase of clonal expansion follows, and the resulting cellular progeny proceeds, as precursor B (pre-B) cells, to undergo rearrangements of VL and JL elements in the IgL loci. These rearrangements usually begin in the Igκ locus and can subsequently involve Igλ, an additional IgL locus. Further differentiation of the cells depends on the acquisition of an in-frame Ig gene rearrangement in one of the IgL loci. In this event, an IgL chain is expressed, assembles with the Igμ chain to form an antibody molecule, and an immature B cell with a BCR on its surface is born. This cell is ready to join the pool of long-lived mature B cells, if its BCR is not selected against because of autoreactivity. The random nature of V(D)J recombination and the multiplicity of the Ig loci, required for the generation of a diverse antibody repertoire, call for sophisticated mechanisms to guarantee that the differentiating B cells are able to express surface Ig and that this Ig consists of a single molecular species (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These mechanisms include the developmental order of rearrangements from IgH to Igκ to Igλ; sensors for successful (in-frame) rearrangements in the form of the pre-BCR in progenitor cells and the BCR in immature cells; molecular programs for the cells to shut down further rearrangements in a given class of Ig loci, if they have acquired an in-frame rearrangement of that class, and to avoid coexpression of different classes of IgL chains (“allelic and isotype exclusion”); and programming the developing cells for either clonal expansion or for apoptosis if they do not successfully receive the appropriate signals through the pre-BCR and the BCR in concert with other survival signals. While much has been learned about the molecular networks of survival factors, signaling molecules, and transcription factors operating in B cell development, our understanding of the developmental control of V(D)J recombination on the one hand, and that of cell proliferation, death, and survival during differentiation on the other, is still fragmentary (Busslinger, 2004Busslinger M. Transcriptional control of early B cell development.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 55-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. B cell development pathways.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). We were attracted by the possibility that RNA-guided control mechanisms might play a role in this context. Thus, the prevailing hypothesis about the order of gene rearrangements in lymphocyte development postulates that the various Ig loci as well as the V, D, and J elements within them become accessible for the V(D)J recombination machinery because of developmentally controlled changes in chromatin structure (Yancopoulos and Alt, 1985Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Developmentally controlled and tissue-specific expression of unrearranged VH gene segments.Cell. 1985; 40: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that control mechanisms based on endogenous small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a critical role in the epigenetic silencing of genes, repetitive elements, and transposons through chromatin modifications in a variety of lower organisms. Prominent examples are Dicer-dependent silencing of the mating locus and centromeric repeats in fission yeast (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Heterochromatin revisited.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Similarly, considering the mechanism of V(D)J recombination as such, which involves the targeted deletion of large stretches of DNA, RNA-guided elimination of genomic DNA during conjugation in Tetrahymena comes to mind (Yao and Chao, 2005Yao M.C. Chao J.L. RNA-guided DNA deletion in Tetrahymena: an RNAi-based mechanism for programmed genome rearrangements.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 537-559Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Central to this phenomenon is dcl-1, a Dicer-like gene in Tetrahymena required for the processing of germline transcripts into scanRNAs, siRNA-like species complementary to moderately repetitive regions of the genome destined for deletion. With respect to the control of cellular proliferation and life and death decisions, another class of small RNAs, the so-called microRNAs (miRNAs), have been shown to be critically involved in various contexts in lower organisms (Ambros, 2004Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8536) Google Scholar, Bushati and Cohen, 2007Bushati N. Cohen S.M. microRNA functions.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). miRNAs direct posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, typically by annealing to cognate mRNAs and inhibiting their translation and/or stability (Pillai et al., 2007Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Filipowicz W. Repression of protein synthesis by miRNAs: how many mechanisms?.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (884) Google Scholar). miRNAs are on average 22 nucleotides long, but they recognize their targets largely via their “nucleus” or “seed” region encompassing nucleotide positions 2–8 at their 5′ end. Hundreds of miRNAs, many of them evolutionarily conserved, have been identified in mammals (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006Griffiths-Jones S. Grocock R.J. van Dongen S. Bateman A. Enright A.J. miRBase: microRNA sequences, targets and gene nomenclature.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D140-D144Crossref PubMed Scopus (3404) Google Scholar), but their physiological functions are just beginning to be elucidated (Bushati and Cohen, 2007Bushati N. Cohen S.M. microRNA functions.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, Chang and Mendell, 2007Chang T.C. Mendell J.T. microRNAs in vertebrate physiology and human disease.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the case of lymphocytes, there is evidence for a role of individual miRNAs in B and T cell homeostasis and response (Rodriguez et al., 2007Rodriguez A. Vigorito E. Clare S. Warren M.V. Couttet P.

An approach to globally address the importance of siRNA- and miRNA-based control mechanisms in mammalian development makes use of conditional deletion of Dicer. Dicer is the key enzyme in the generation of si- and miRNAs from their double-stranded RNA precursors (Tijsterman et al., 2002Tijsterman M. Ketting R.F. Plasterk R.H. The genetics of RNA silencing.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 489-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Ablation of Dicer in the mouse germline produces a lethal phenotype (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar), and conditional deletion of Dicer in various cell lineages has been shown to have detrimental effects, such as impaired cell proliferation and survival (Cobb et al., 2005Cobb B.S. Nesterova T.B. Thompson E. Hertweck A. O'Connor E. Godwin J. Wilson C.B. Brockdorff N. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Merkenschlager M.

Aberrant T cell differentiation in the absence of Dicer.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Here we use this approach to assess the importance of Dicer in the B cell lineage, by deleting the Dicer gene (dcr-1) conditionally at the earliest stage of B cell development. While this leads to an almost complete block of this developmental process, we can partially rescue B cell development by genetically promoting B cell survival. This opens the way to an assessment of the role of small RNAs generated by Dicer in B cell-specific differentiation processes such as the control of V(D)J recombination. We conditionally deleted dcr-1 in the B cell lineage of mice using the mb1-cre allele, which is expressed and active from the earliest stage of B cell development (Hobeika et al., 2006Hobeika E. Thiemann S. Storch B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. Pelanda R. Reth M. Testing gene function early in the B cell lineage in mb1-cre mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 13789-13794Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analyses in dcrfl/fl; mb1cre/+ mice revealed that in the absence of Dicer, B cell development is almost completely blocked at the pro- to pre-B cell transition (Figures 1A and 1B). In the mutant animals, pro-B cells (B220loIgM−c-kit+CD25−) accumulated in BM, while pre-B cells (B220intIgM−c-kit−CD25+) were significantly reduced (Figure 1B). Immature (B220intIgM+) and mature B cells (B220hiIgM+) were hardly detectable in BM and peripheral lymphoid organs of dcrfl/fl; mb1cre/+ mice (Figures 1A and 3A; data not shown). Annexin V staining revealed no consistent difference in pro-B cells, but a massive increase of preapoptotic pre-B cells in the mutant animals (Figure 1C). Quantification of mature miRNA levels in sorted B cell progenitors by a TaqMan-based miRNA assay revealed a significant depletion of miRNAs already in Dicer KO pro-B cells, but the extent of depletion differed for individual miRNAs. We focused our analysis on four miRNAs that we knew were expressed in pro-B cells (Monticelli et al., 2005Monticelli S. Ansel K.M. Xiao C. Socci N.D. Krichevsky A.M. Thai T.H. Rajewsky N. Marks D.S. Sander C. Rajewsky K. et al.MicroRNA profiling of the murine hematopoietic system.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both pro- and pre-B cells, miR-17 was undetectable upon mb1-cre-mediated dcr-1 deletion (Figure 1D). In contrast, miR-142-3p and -181b were still detectable at low levels in KO pro-B cells (being reduced by 83% and 94%, respectively). Curiously, a fourth miRNA, miR-191, persisted at low but detectable levels in both pro- and pre-B cells following Dicer ablation (73% and 87% reduction, respectively). We conclude that mb1-cre mediated efficient Dicer ablation early on in B cell development, and that mature miRNA levels are strongly reduced in the developing cells from the pro-B cell stage. To assess the extent to which miRNAs control gene expression in B lymphocytes, we followed the microarray profiling approach pioneered by Lim et al., 2005Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs.Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar and Giraldez et al., 2006Giraldez A.J. Mishima Y. Rihel J. Grocock R.J. Van Dongen S. Inoue K. Enright A.J. Schier A.F. Zebrafish MiR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs.Science. 2006; 312: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, to determine signatures of miRNA control in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts upregulated in cells upon Dicer ablation. This approach is based on the ability of miRNAs to promote deadenylation and decay of their cognate mRNA targets (Pillai et al., 2007Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Filipowicz W. Repression of protein synthesis by miRNAs: how many mechanisms?.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (884) Google Scholar). To have sufficient RNA available for these experiments, we generated Abelson virus (v-Abl)-transformed pro-B cell lines from BM of dcrfl/fl; R26R-yfp and dcrfl/+; R26R-yfp mice previously described (Muljo et al., 2005Muljo S.A. Ansel K.M. Kanellopoulou C. Livingston D.M. Rao A. Rajewsky K. Aberrant T cell differentiation in the absence of Dicer.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In these cells, the dcr-1 gene can be deleted in vitro using a transducible Cre protein (Tat-cre), and Cre activity is conveniently monitored by concomitant expression of YFP (Figure 2A). To obtain Dicer KO cells, YFP+ cells from dcrfl/fl; R26R-yfp cultures treated with Tat-cre were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and further propagated in cell culture. As controls, we used nondeleted, YFP− cells sorted from dcrfl/fl; R26R-yfp cultures treated with Tat-cre, and YFP+-deleted cells from dcrfl/+; R26R-yfp cultures. In the Dicer KO pro-B cells, western analysis indicated that Dicer protein was efficiently ablated (Figure 2B), and northern blots demonstrated that the levels of mature miR-17 and -191 were drastically reduced (Figure 2C). Four days after Tat-cre transduction, RNA was isolated from the various sorted cell populations and analyzed on microarrays. We used a previously described approach based on linear regression statistics (Sood et al., 2006Sood P. Krek A. Zavolan M. Macino G. Rajewsky N. Cell-type-specific signatures of microRNAs on target mRNA expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2746-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) to discover genome-wide correlations between Dicer-dependent gene-expression changes and the occurrence of heptamer nucleotide motifs in the 3′UTR of the affected genes (Table S1). Significantly, considering all 16,384 possible heptamer motifs and thus not biasing the analysis toward known miRNA sequences, we obtained highly significant positive correlations between motifs complementary to the 5′ region of several miRNAs and upregulated transcripts in two independent Dicer KO pro-B cell lines (generated from lines 4470 and 4475, both dcrfl/fl; R26R-yfp). No such motifs were found to correlate with gene-expression changes between YFP+ and YFP− cells sorted from dcrfl/+; R26R-yfp pro-B cell cultures. The motif with the best correlation (P value ≈ 0 in both cell cultures) is complementary to nucleotides 2–8 (the nucleus) of miR-142-3p, a miRNA expressed in wild-type (WT) pro-B cells (Table S1; Figure 1D). Of 9032 transcripts analyzed in pro-B cell culture #4470, 411 had their levels elevated by at least 20% upon Dicer ablation. Among these upregulated genes, 31% had the motif complementary to the miR-142-3p nucleus, compared to 14% among all transcripts analyzed. The analysis yielded three additional motifs that match the 5′ region of different members of the miR-17∼92 cluster, with P values between 0 and 10−5 (Table S1). Seventeen known miRNAs, five of which (miR-17, -19a, -20a, -19b, and -92) are part of the miR-17∼92 cluster on mouse chromosome 14, match one of these three motifs, and as such can be divided into three families (Table S2). The nucleus of one of five miRNA members of the miR-17∼92 cluster that our analysis identified as highly significant was present in 63% of upregulated transcripts, compared to 47% among all transcripts analyzed. Thus, genes upregulated in Dicer KO pro-B cells frequently harbored at least one of the four identified motifs in their 3′UTR (Tables S3–S6), and at least some of the corresponding miRNAs are known to be expressed in WT pro-B cells (miR-17, miR-142-3p and miR-92 (Figure 1D; data not shown); miR-19b and miR-20 (Ventura et al., 2008Ventura A. Young A.G. Winslow M.M. Lintault L. Meissner A. Erkeland S.J. Newman J. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Stone J.R. Jaenisch R. Sharp P.A. Jacks T. Targeted deletion reveals essential and overlapping functions of the miR-17∼92 family of miRNA clusters.Cell. 2008; 132 (this issue): 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]). One of the genes identified in this analysis was bim (Figure 2D), a proapoptotic gene known to be critically involved in life-death decisions in lymphocyte development (Hughes et al., 2006Hughes P. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Role of Bim and other Bcl-2 family members in autoimmune and degenerative diseases.Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. 2006; 9: 74-94Google Scholar). Consistently upregulated in Dicer KO B cells in the microarray experiments, mouse bim harbors nine heptamer motifs in its 3′UTR that match miR-17∼92 family members (Figure 2E). Although our method does not rely on evolutionary sequence conservation, in this case at least four of these motifs are conserved in mouse, rat, and human. Furthermore, in the mouse, only a limited number of the ∼18,000 annotated 3′UTRs harbor at least one potential binding site for each of the three distinct miRNA families, the miR-17, miR-19, and miR-92 family, related to the miR-17∼92 cluster (A.K. and N.R., unpublished data). In terms of having the most of these binding sites, the 3′UTR of bim scored in the top 10 out of all annotated 3′UTRs. Bim thus belongs to a small group of genes with a strong potential for combinatorial regulation by the miR-17∼92 cluster. Consistent with this strong prediction, we detected markedly elevated levels of Bim protein in Dicer KO B cells by intracellular flow cytometry using a highly specific antibody (Figures 2F and 2G; data not shown). The strong upregulation of Bim in the developing Dicer-KO B cells could be causally related to the excessive apoptosis observed at the pre-B cell stage (Figure 1C). In normal development, the cells are programmed to die at this stage unless they have undergone an in-frame V(D)J rearrangement in the IgH locus, allowing them to express an Igμ chain in the pre-BCR complex on their surface. Given these circumstances, we tried to rescue the development of Dicer KO B cells following two strategies. The first was to provide the mutant mice with a B cell-specific prosurvival transgene. The Eμ-bcl-2 transgene was chosen for this purpose, as Bim and Bcl-2 are known to be key players in balancing death and survival in B cell development (Hughes et al., 2006Hughes P. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Role of Bim and other Bcl-2 family members in autoimmune and degenerative diseases.Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. 2006; 9: 74-94Google Scholar, Puthalakath and Strasser, 2002Puthalakath H.

Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Cory S. Novel primitive lymphoid tumours induced in transgenic mice by cooperation between myc and bcl-2.Nature. 1990; 348: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In a second approach, we considered the possibility that an inability of the Dicer KO cells to perform ordered Ig gene rearrangements might contribute to the developmental block observed in vivo. We therefore provided the mutant animals with a transgene encoding a hen egg lysozyme (HEL)-specific antibody (IgHEL); BCR-encoding transgenes are known to rescue B cell development in mouse mutants unable to perform V(D)J recombination. A partial rescue of B cell development was observed using either the Bcl-2 or the IgHEL transgene (Figure 3). In both cases, the developmental block imposed by Dicer ablation was partially alleviated, as indicated by a reduced accumulation of pro-B cells (Figure 3B). For the Bcl-2 transgene, this was accompanied by the expected partial restoration of the pre-B cell compartment. This was not evident in the case of the IgHEL rescue, because the prerecombined IgH and Igκ chains drive the cells rapidly into the immature B cell compartment. In the case of both transgenes, significant numbers of Dicer KO B cells made it into the peripheral immune system, although their maturation was clearly hampered. B cell numbers in the spleens of the compound mutant animals were increased 20- and 10-fold, respectively, compared to dcrfl/Δ; mb1cre/+ mice lacking either transgene, but still strongly reduced compared to Dicer-proficient transgenic controls (Figure 4). This appeared in part due to inefficient generation of B220+IgM+ B cells in BM (Figure 3B), and partly to a failure of the peripheral B cells to differentiate from immature (AA4.1+) to mature (AA4.1–) cells (Figure 3A).Figure 4Rescue of Dicer-KO B CellsShow full captionNumber of splenic B cells (B220+IgM+) from ∼1.5-month-old mice is plotted on a log10 scale.

Each point represents data from a single mouse with a horizontal bar representing the average cell number for each group. To confirm that Dicer was ablated in the rescued cells, we quantified mature miRNA levels in B220+ MACS-sorted B cell fractions by northern blotting. Indeed, miR-17 and -191 could not be detected in Dicer KO splenic B cells rescued by Bcl-2 or the IgHEL transgene (Figure S1A). This was confirmed for miR-17 using the more sensitive TaqMan miRNA assay (Figure S1B). However, miRNAs could still be detected in B cell progenitors by this assay, albeit at dramatically reduced levels (Figure S1C). In the case of Eμ-bcl-2tg mice, mature miR-17 levels were reduced 69% in pro-B cells, and became undetectable in pre-B cells upon Dicer ablation; miR-142-3p levels were reduced 54% in pro-B and 97% in pre-B cells; miR-181b levels were reduced 86% in pro-B and 98% in pre-B cells; and miR-191 levels were reduced 80% in pro-B and 97% in pre-B cells. Consistent with the notion that Bim is targeted by miRNAs expressed in the B cell lineage (Figures 2D–2G), intracellular FACS analysis revealed strong upregulation of Bim levels in Dicer-deficient B lineage cells of both Bcl-2 and IgHEL transgenic mice (Figures 5A and S2). This effect was already detectable at the pro-B cell stage (Figures 2G and 5A), suggesting dcr-1 deletion was essentially complete already in pro-B cells of the compound mutant animals and resulted in impaired miRNA control in those cells. To directly assess the role of Dicer mediated control of Bim in B cells, we generated B cell-specific Dicer KO mice on a Bim null genetic background (dcrfl/fl; mb1cre/+; bim−/−). In dcrfl/fl; mb1cre/+; bim+/− mice Bim levels were still elevated above controls (Figure S3), and B cell development was blocked (data not shown). However, complete ablation of Bim resulted in a 25-fold increase of peripheral B cells in the absence of Dicer (Figures 4 and 5B). While B cell numbers were still strongly reduced compared to Dicer proficient littermates, the rescue of B cell development through Bim deficiency was comparable to that by the Bcl-2 transgene (Figures 4, 5B, and 5C). As in the latter case, most B cells generated in the absence of Dicer and Bim exhibited an immature (AA4.1hi) phenotype (Figure 5B). The development of Dicer KO IgM+ B cells in the presence of the Bcl-2 transgene or in the absence of Bim strongly suggests that Dicer does not control the basic mechanism of V(D)J recombination, and that therefore the block of B cell development in the absence of Dicer is partially due to a failure of the cells to respond to survival signals at an early stage because of aberrantly high Bim levels. The rescue of Dicer KO B cells by the Bcl-2 transgene opened the way to determine the impact of Dicer-dependent control mechanisms on V(D)J recombination and its ordered progression in B cell development. We first assessed whether Dicer KO and control B cell populations expressed IgH and IgL variable regions of similar nature and diversity, by amplifying and sequencing VHDHJH and VκJκ joints from B cells of dcrfl/Δ; mb1cre/+; Eμ-bcl-2tg and control mice. The joints isolated from the mutants were highly diverse and indistinguishable in a first approximation from those of the controls in terms of V and J element usage (Table S7). However, upon closer inspection specific footprints of Dicer deficiency became apparent in both the VHDHJH and the VκJκ joints. In the case of the former, we observed a striking redistribution of DH element usage (Figure 6A). While the DSP family of DH elements represents the majority of the DH elements in the germline (6–9 DSP elements out of a total of 10–16 DH elements depending on mouse strain), DSP elements are used in the VHDHJH rearrangements of WT mice in less than half of the cases; most rearrangements use the DFL element(s) upstream or the DQ52 element downstream of the DSP cluster (Bangs et al., 1991Bangs L.A.

In contrast, VHDHJH joints sequenced from rescued Dicer KO B cells displayed DSP family elements in ∼58% of the cases, compared to ∼44% in controls. The usage of another rarely used DH element, DST, was also increased in the mutants, from ∼6% to ∼16%"
https://openalex.org/W2004344365,"BAR superfamily domains shape membranes through poorly understood mechanisms. We solved structures of F-BAR modules bound to flat and curved bilayers using electron (cryo)microscopy. We show that membrane tubules form when F-BARs polymerize into helical coats that are held together by lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. On gel-state membranes or after mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination."
https://openalex.org/W2166053360,"We have followed individual ribosomes as they translate single messenger RNA hairpins tethered by the ends to optical tweezers. Here we reveal that translation occurs through successive translocation--and-pause cycles. The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases--one codon-and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and RNA unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions."

https://openalex.org/W1995651171,"Characterization of previously described intraflagellar transport (IFT) mouse mutants has led to the proposition that normal primary cilia are required for mammalian cells to respond to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signal. Here we describe an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutant mouse, alien (aln), which has abnormal primary cilia and shows overactivation of the SHH pathway. The aln locus encodes a novel protein, THM1 (tetratricopeptide repeat-containing hedgehog modulator-1), which localizes to cilia. aln-mutant cilia have bulb-like structures at their tips in which IFT proteins (such as IFT88) are sequestered, characteristic of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Caenorhabditis elegans retrograde IFT mutants. RNA-interference knockdown of Ttc21b (which we call Thm1 and which encodes THM1) in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells expressing an IFT88-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fusion recapitulated the aln-mutant cilial phenotype, and live imaging of these cells revealed impaired retrograde IFT. In contrast to previously described IFT mutants, Smoothened and full-length glioblastoma (GLI) proteins localize to aln-mutant cilia. We hypothesize that the aln retrograde IFT defect causes sequestration of IFT proteins in aln-mutant cilia and leads to the overactivated SHH signaling phenotype. Specifically, the aln mutation uncouples the roles of anterograde and retrograde transport in SHH signaling, suggesting that anterograde IFT is required for GLI activation and that retrograde IFT modulates this event."

Osteoclasts, which derive from bone marrow cells, are under the control of the immune system.

However, it is unclear how the two signals merge to cooperate in osteoclast differentiation.

Thus, this study reveals the importance of the osteoclastogenic signaling complex composed of tyrosine kinases, which may provide the molecular basis for a new therapeutic strategy. Bone homeostasis depends on balanced action of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts (Karsenty and Wagner, 2002Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Reaching a genetic and molecular understanding of skeletal development.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Tipping the balance in favor of osteoclasts leads to diseases with a low bone mass, whereas impaired osteoclastic bone resorption results in diseases with a high bone mass, including osteopetrosis (Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Genetic regulation of osteoclast development and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Bone reserves calcium and responds to calcium-regulating hormones, but osteoclasts and osteoblasts are not only regulated by the endocrine system. The immune and bone systems share numerous regulatory factors, including cytokines, receptors, signaling molecules, and transcription factors (Theill et al., 2002Theill L.E. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M.

Therefore, the pathology of one system may very well affect the other: it is well documented that enhanced bone resorption is associated with activation of the immune system observed in autoimmune or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis (Theill et al., 2002Theill L.E.

Diseases with impaired immune responses are also associated with bone abnormalities, but it is poorly understood how the immunodeficiencies are functionally related to bone disorders. Hyperimmunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome is characterized by skeletal symptoms such as osteoporosis (Kirchner et al., 1985Kirchner S.G. Sivit C.J. Wright P.F. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome: association with osteoporosis and recurrent fractures.Radiology. 1985; 156: 362PubMed Google Scholar) and scoliosis (Grimbacher et al., 1999Grimbacher B. Holland S.M. Gallin J.I. Greenberg F. Hill S.C. Malech H.L. Miller J.A. O'Connell A.C. Puck J.M. Hyper-IgE syndrome with recurrent infections—an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 692-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), which are partly explained by the abnormality of osteoblasts and osteoclasts caused by the mutation in the STAT3 gene. (Minegishi et al., 2007Minegishi Y. Saito M. Tsuchiya S. Tsuge I. Takada H. Hara T. Kawamura N. Ariga T. Pasic S. Stojkovic O. et al.Dominant-negative mutations in the DNA-binding domain of STAT3 cause hyper-IgE syndrome.Nature. 2007; 448: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (caused by a mutation in the CD40L gene) has a skeletal complication, osteopenia, which is attributed to enhanced osteoclast formation due to the impaired production of interferon-γ by T cells (Lopez-Granados et al., 2007Lopez-Granados E. Temmerman S.T. Wu L. Reynolds J.C. Follmann D. Liu S. Nelson D.L. Rauch F. Jain A. Osteopenia in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome reveals a regulatory role for CD40 ligand in osteoclastogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, exploring the mechanisms underlying skeletal complications in primary immunodeficiencies will be important for understanding the shared mechanisms and crosstalk between immune and bone systems. The osteoclast was the first skeletal cell to be determined to be under the control of the immune system (Horton et al., 1972Horton J.E. Raisz L.G. Simmons H.A. Oppenheim J.J. Mergenhagen S.E. Bone resorbing activity in supernatant fluid from cultured human peripheral blood leukocytes.Science. 1972; 177: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Because osteoclasts originate from bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage precursor cells (BMMs) of hematopoietic lineage, many regulators of osteoclast differentiation are also utilized in the control of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The differentiation of osteoclasts is mainly regulated by three signaling pathways activated by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Asagiri and Takayanagi, 2007Asagiri M. Takayanagi H. The molecular understanding of osteoclast differentiation.Bone. 2007; 40: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Whereas M-CSF promotes the proliferation and survival of BMMs (Ross and Teitelbaum, 2005Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. αvβ3 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor: partners in osteoclast biology.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), RANKL activates the differentiation process by inducing the master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), via the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and c-Fos pathways (Takayanagi et al., 2002Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T.

Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The induction of NFATc1 is also dependent on the calcium signal, which is mediated by the activation of ITAM in adaptor molecules such as DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12) and Fc receptor common γ subunit (FcRγ) (Koga et al., 2004Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T.

The immunomodulatory adapter proteins DAP12 and Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ) regulate development of functional osteoclasts through the Syk tyrosine kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6158-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) in association with costimulatory receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily, including triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells-2 (TREM-2), signal-regulatory protein β1 (SIRPβ1), paired immunoglobulin-like receptor-A (PIR-A), and osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) (Koga et al., 2004Koga T.

Phosphorylation of ITAM results in recruitment of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk, leading to the activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and calcium mobilization (Faccio et al., 2003Faccio R.

PLCγ2 regulates osteoclastogenesis via its interaction with ITAM proteins and GAB2.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but osteoclastogenesis cannot be induced by costimulatory signals alone and requires RANKL stimulation. However, it has been unclear how RANK and ITAM signals merge to cooperatively stimulate the downstream signaling pathway. To identify the molecules activated by RANKL that stimulate the calcium signaling pathway by functioning as an integrator of the RANK and ITAM signals, we focused on nonreceptor tyrosine kinases because PLCγ initiates the calcium signal after tyrosine phosphorylation. Among the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, genome-wide screening revealed Btk and Tec to be highly expressed in osteoclasts. The Tec kinase family, consisting of Bmx, Btk, Itk, Rlk, and Tec, is preferentially expressed in the hematopoietic system. T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling complexes include Itk/Rlk and Tec/Btk, respectively (Schmidt et al., 2004Schmidt U. Boucheron N. Unger B. Ellmeier W. The role of Tec family kinases in myeloid cells.Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2004; 134: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The role of Btk in antibody production is well recognized by the existence of immunodeficiencies, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans (Tsukada et al., 1993Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O. Allen R.C. Klisak I. Sparkes R.S. Kubagawa H. Mohandas T.

Jung S. Sunshine M.J. Hatam F. Xu Y. Baltimore D. Mano H. Littman D.R. Severe B cell deficiency in mice lacking the tec kinase family members Tec and Btk.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and T cells (Itk and Rlk) (Schaeffer et al., 1999Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Sher A. Varmus H.E. Lenardo M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Requirement for Tec kinases Rlk and Itk in T cell receptor signaling and immunity.Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Here we report the crucial role of Btk and Tec in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis based on the genetic evidence obtained from Tec−/−Btk−/− mice. In response to RANKL stimulation, Btk and Tec kinases form a signaling complex required for osteoclastogenesis with adaptor molecules such as BLNK, which also recruits Syk, thus linking the RANK and ITAM signals to phosphorylate PLCγ. This study provides a clear example of immunodeficiency association with abnormal bone homeostasis owing to defects in signaling molecules shared by B cells and osteoclasts. Moreover, therapeutic models suggest that suppression of Tec kinases can serve as a molecular basis for the development of future therapeutic strategies against bone diseases. RANK and ITAM signals cooperate to induce calcium signaling, but it has been unknown how these two signals are integrated. To gain insight into the molecules activated by RANKL that are potentially involved in the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the PLCγ pathway, we performed a genome-wide screening of mRNAs for nonreceptor tyrosine kinases expressed during osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation (Figure 1A). We identified high expression of Src and Syk, whose crucial functions in the osteoclast lineage have been well documented (Soriano et al., 1991Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A.

Interestingly, osteoclasts, but not osteoblasts, express the mRNAs for Btk and Tec at a higher level than that for Src (Figure 1A). The selective expression of Btk and Tec in osteoclast precursor cells was also confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1B) and immunoblot analysis (Figure 1C). The results led us to analyze the bone phenotype of mice deficient in Tec (Ellmeier et al., 2000Ellmeier W. Jung S. Sunshine M.J. Hatam F. Xu Y. Baltimore D. Mano H. Littman D.R. Severe B cell deficiency in mice lacking the tec kinase family members Tec and Btk.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), Btk (Kerner et al., 1995Kerner J.D. Appleby M.W. Mohr R.N. Chien S. Rawlings D.J. Maliszewski C.R. Witte O.N. Perlmutter R.M. Impaired expansion of mouse B cell progenitors lacking Btk.Immunity. 1995; 3: 301-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), or both (Ellmeier et al., 2000Ellmeier W. Jung S. Sunshine M.J. Hatam F. Xu Y. Baltimore D. Mano H. Littman D.R. Severe B cell deficiency in mice lacking the tec kinase family members Tec and Btk.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Microradiological analysis revealed the trabecular bone volume to be normal in Tec−/− mice, minimally increased in Btk−/− mice, and markedly increased in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice (Figure 1D). Microcomputed tomography clearly indicated that the bone volume was greatly enhanced in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice (Figure 1E). Histological analysis revealed the osteoclast number was significantly reduced in the epiphyseal region, and the bone marrow was abnormally filled with trabecular bone in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice (Figure 1F). We also observed cartilage remnants characteristic of osteopetrosis in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice (Figure 1F). Bone morphometric analysis indicated an increase in bone volume associated with a reduced osteoclast number, a decrease in the indicators of osteoclastic bone resorption (Figure 1G), and a normal level of bone formation in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice (Figure 1H). There was no significant difference in the resorption and formation parameters among the wild-type (WT), Tec−/−, and Btk−/− mice (see Figure S1 available online). These results collectively suggest that the increase in bone mass in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice is caused by impaired osteoclastic bone resorption owing to a defect in osteoclast differentiation. Despite the severe defect in osteoclastic bone resorption, the Tec−/−Btk−/− mice had normal tooth eruption, but the results nevertheless suggest that the two kinases play a critically important role in osteoclast differentiation. In vitro osteoclast differentiation was evaluated by counting the multinucleated cells (MNCs) positive for the osteoclast marker tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) after stimulation of BMMs with recombinant RANKL in the presence of M-CSF. Osteoclast differentiation was only minimally affected in Tec−/− cells but was severely impaired in Btk−/− cells and almost completely abrogated in Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 2A). There was no significant difference in M-CSF-dependent proliferation of precursor cells or the rate of apoptosis between WT and Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 2B) or in the number of CD11b+ cells in the M-CSF-stimulated bone marrow cells (data not shown). Therefore, there is no defect in the generation of osteoclast precursor cells in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice, although we observed that the survival of mature macrophages derived from Tec−/−Btk−/− mice was partly impaired when cultured with a low concentration of M-CSF (W.E., unpublished data). RANKL-stimulated induction of NFATc1, the key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, was severely suppressed in Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 2C) and Btk−/− cells (data not shown). We also analyzed the effect of the Tec kinase inhibitor LFM-A13 (Mahajan et al., 1999Mahajan S. Ghosh S. Sudbeck E.A. Zheng Y. Downs S. Hupke M. Uckun F.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9587-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which was designed to specifically bind the ATP-binding site of Btk, and which was revealed subsequently to suppress other Tec kinases additionally (Fernandes et al., 2005Fernandes M.J. Lachance G. Pare G. Rollet-Labelle E. Naccache P.H. Signaling through CD16b in human neutrophils involves the Tec family of tyrosine kinases.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 78: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), on osteoclast differentiation. LFM-A13 strongly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (Figure 2D) and NFATc1 induction (data not shown). In contrast, this compound only slightly affected the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts (Figure S2). Importantly, phosphorylation of Btk and Tec was induced by RANKL stimulation in BMMs (Figure 2E). Thus, the tyrosine kinases Btk and Tec are activated by RANKL and play a crucial role in RANKL-induced signal transduction during osteoclastogenesis. To determine whether impaired osteoclastogenesis in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice is caused by a cell-autonomous mechanism, we evaluated the osteoclastogenesis in the coculture system of bone marrow cells with osteoblasts. In the coculture of bone marrow cells derived from mutant mice with WT osteoblasts, osteoclast formation was not severely affected in Tec−/− or Btk−/− cells but was almost abrogated in Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 3A). In contrast, Tec−/−Btk−/− osteoblasts were normally able to support osteoclastogenesis of WT bone marrow cells (Figure 3B). These results suggest that the impaired osteoclastogenesis in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice is caused by a defect in osteoclast precursor cells. Consistent with the observation that the Btk−/− mice have a normal number of osteoclasts in vivo (Figure S1), Btk−/− cells differentiate into osteoclasts in the coculture system essentially in a normal manner (Figure 3A), indicating that the larger contribution of Btk is observed only under limited in vitro conditions, including the RANKL/M-CSF-stimulated BMM culture system (Figure 2A). Since a similar observation has been made in DAP12−/− cells (Koga et al., 2004Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T. Kodama T. et al.Costimulatory signals mediated by the ITAM motif cooperate with RANKL for bone homeostasis.Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), we infer that Btk is more closely associated with the DAP12-dependent pathway. Since Tec−/−Btk−/− mice have almost no B cells and exhibit severe immunodeficiency (but their T cells are not affected) (Ellmeier et al., 2000Ellmeier W. Jung S. Sunshine M.J. Hatam F. Xu Y. Baltimore D. Mano H. Littman D.R. Severe B cell deficiency in mice lacking the tec kinase family members Tec and Btk.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), it is possible that the impaired osteoclastogenesis is influenced by differences in the B cell number in the bone marrow. Therefore, we examined whether depletion or addition of CD19+ B cells had any effect on osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow cells containing B cells. Osteoclast differentiation was not influenced by the coexistence of B cells in either WT or Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that the impaired osteoclastogenesis in Tec−/−Btk−/− mice is not related to an abnormality of other cell types such as osteoblasts or B cells, supporting the notion that the impaired osteoclast differentiation is caused by a cell-autonomous mechanism. Consistent with this notion, retrovirus-mediated expression of Btk and Tec almost completely recovered the osteoclast differentiation in Tec−/−Btk−/− BMMs. The introduction of Btk into Tec−/−Btk−/− BMMs by retroviral transfer markedly rescued the differentiation blockade, but that of Tec rescued it to a lesser extent (Figure 3D). This result is consistent with the dominant role of Btk in osteoclastogenesis in the BMM culture system (Figure 2A). Tec family kinases contain a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns[3,4,5]P3), a lipid product of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a Tec homology domain, and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (Schmidt et al., 2004Schmidt U. Boucheron N. Unger B. Ellmeier W. The role of Tec family kinases in myeloid cells.Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2004; 134: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A kinase-inactive mutant of Btk (R525Q) that carries a mutation in the kinase domain (Takata and Kurosaki, 1996Takata M. Kurosaki T. A role for Bruton's tyrosine kinase in B cell antigen receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C-γ2.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) did not rescue the osteoclast differentiation blockade, but another mutant (R28C) that harbors a mutation in the PH domain (Takata and Kurosaki, 1996Takata M. Kurosaki T. A role for Bruton's tyrosine kinase in B cell antigen receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C-γ2.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), which causes a certain type of XLA in humans (Tsukada et al., 1993Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O. Allen R.C. Klisak I. Sparkes R.S. Kubagawa H. Mohandas T. Quan S. et al.Deficient expression of a B cell cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in human X-linked agammaglobulinemia.Cell. 1993; 72: 279-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), exhibited a capacity for rescue comparable to the WT Btk (Figure 3E). The results suggest that the function of Btk in osteoclastogenesis requires its kinase activity but does not completely depend on the interaction with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 through the PH domain. How does deficiency of Btk and Tec affect the osteoclastogenic signaling pathways? To address these issues by a systems biology approach, we utilized a systematic protein-protein interaction database created by the Genome Network Project (http://genomenetwork.nig.ac.jp/index.html), in which our laboratory has served as a working member. From this database, we extracted the protein-protein interaction network related to the two major signaling pathways regulating osteoclastogenesis, the RANK and ITAM pathways, with which we merged our original data on the increase in mRNA expression after RANKL stimulation (Figure 4A). The RANK-associated gene network included TRAF6, NF-κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whereas the ITAM (DAP12/FcRγ)-associated gene network included Syk, PLCγ, and Btk/Tec. As expected, the expression of many RANK-associated molecules was upregulated by RANKL stimulation. Interestingly, the expression of many of the genes in the ITAM-associated gene network was also upregulated by RANKL stimulation. Based on these results, together with the observation that Btk and Tec were activated by RANKL (Figure 2E), we hypothesized that Btk and Tec are the molecules that bridge the RANK and ITAM pathways to activate calcium signaling. Notably, RANKL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 was markedly suppressed in Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the RANKL-induced calcium oscillation required for NFATc1 induction was barely observed in Tec−/−Btk−/− cells (Figure 4C). In contrast, we observed a normal level of RANKL-induced activation of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38), IκB kinase α (IKKα), IKKβ, and Akt, all of which are activated downstream of TRAF6 (Wong et al., 1999Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. TRANCE, a TNF family member, activates Akt/PKB through a signaling complex involving TRAF6 and c-Src.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) (Figure 4D). These results indicate that RANKL-activated Btk and Tec are selectively involved in the phosphorylation of PLCγ, and a defect in calcium signaling causes the impaired NFATc1 induction in Tec−/−Btk−/− cells. Thus, Btk and Tec link the RANK signal to calcium signaling in the osteoclast lineage. Since PLCγ activation is known to be dependent on the ITAM signal, another question arises as to how PLCγ activation is regulated by both RANK and ITAM signals. The ITAM-associated gene network indicates that ITAM associates with Syk, which associates with and phosphorylates scaffold proteins such as BLNK (Ishiai et al., 1999Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. BLNK required for coupling Syk to PLCγ2 and Rac1-JNK in B cells.Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because BLNK associates with Btk in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in B cells (Hashimoto et al., 1999Hashimoto S. Iwamatsu A. Ishiai M. Okawa K. Yamadori T. Matsushita M. Baba Y. Kishimoto T. Kurosaki T. Tsukada S. Identification of the SH2 domain binding protein of Bruton's tyrosine kinase as BLNK—functional significance of Btk-SH2 domain in B-cell antigen receptor-coupled calcium signaling.Blood. 1999; 94: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether RANKL-activated Btk is recruited to BLNK in BMMs. The colocalization of Btk and BLNK was increased, at what appeared to be the plasma membrane, after RANKL stimulation (Figure 5A and Figure S3). This translocation was not observed in DAP12−/−FcRγ−/− cells (Figure 5A and Figure S3), suggesting that the ITAM signals are also required for the formation of the Btk-BLNK complex. Consistent with this, immunoblot analysis showed that Btk coimmunoprecipitated with BLNK in BMMs in the presence of RANKL, but the association was abrogated in DAP12−/−FcRγ−/− cells (Figure 5B). Furthermore, Tec kinases were phosphorylated in response to RANKL, even in DAP12−/−FcRγ−/− cells (Figure 5C). Thus, the activation of Btk by RANK and the activation of BLNK by the ITAM signal are both required for the association of Btk with BLNK, which may function as the molecular switch that integrates RANK and ITAM signals. To further investigate the role of BLNK in osteoclastogenesis, we analyzed osteoclast differentiation in BMMs derived from Blnk−/− mice (Hayashi et al., 2003Hayashi K. Yamamoto M. Nojima T. Goitsuka R. Kitamura D. Distinct signalin"

Here, we analyze the genetic and molecular bases of the divergence of body pigmentation patterns between Drosophila yakuba and its sister species Drosophila santomea. We found that loss of pigmentation in D. santomea involved the selective loss of expression of the tan and yellow pigmentation genes. We demonstrate that tan gene expression was eliminated through the mutational inactivation of one specific tan cis-regulatory element (CRE) whereas the Tan protein sequence remained unchanged. Surprisingly, we identify three independent loss-of-function alleles of the tan CRE in the young D. santomea lineage. We submit that there is sufficient empirical evidence to support the general prediction that functional evolutionary changes at pleiotropic loci will most often involve mutations in their discrete, modular cis-regulatory elements."

Involvement of Mec1 and Tel1, the budding yeast homologs of the mammalian ATR and ATM kinases, in meiotic interhomlog bias has been implicated, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Mec1 and Tel1 promote meiotic interhomolog recombination by targeting the axial element protein Hop1. Without Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation of Hop1, meiotic DSBs are rapidly repaired via a Dmc1-independent intersister repair pathway, resulting in diminished interhomolog crossing-over leading to spore lethality. We find that Mec1/Tel1-mediated phosphorylation of Hop1 is required for activation of Mek1, a meiotic paralogue of the DNA-damage effector kinase, Rad53p/CHK2. Thus, Hop1 is a meiosis-specific adaptor protein of the Mec1/Tel1 signaling pathway that ensures interhomolog recombination by preventing Dmc1-independent repair of meiotic DSBs.

Thus, Hop1 is a meiosis-specific adaptor protein of the Mec1/Tel1 signaling pathway that ensures interhomolog recombination by preventing Dmc1-independent repair of meiotic DSBs. Meiosis is a specialized cell division program during which a single round of genome duplication is followed by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation resulting in the halving of the genome. An essential feature of meiosis is that Spo11-catalyzed meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Keeney et al., 1997Keeney S. Giroux C.N. Kleckner N. Meiosis-specific DNA double-strand breaks are catalyzed by Spo11, a member of a widely conserved protein family.Cell. 1997; 88: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar) are repaired using an intact homologous non-sister chromatid rather than a sister. During meiosis in budding yeast, the ratio between interhomolog (IH) and intersister (IS) recombination is estimated to be about three to one (Schwacha and Kleckner, 1994Schwacha A. Kleckner N. Identification of joint molecules that form frequently between homologs but rarely between sister chromatids during yeast meiosis.Cell. 1994; 76: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinational repair of DSBs in diploid somatic cells occurs almost exclusively between sister chromatids (e.g., Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992Kadyk L.C. Hartwell L.H. Sister chromatids are preferred over homologs as substrates for recombinational repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1992; 132: 387-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two interdependent processes are required for meiotic IH recombination. One is the direct modification of the mitotic recombination apparatus. For example, a meiosis-specific RecA homolog, Dmc1, functions at an early step in recombination to promote invasion of broken ends into the homologs (Bishop et al., 1992Bishop D. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N.

The second is the establishment of meiosis-specific chromosome structure(s), which favors interactions between the homologs while minimizing those between sisters. Essential for the latter process are the meiotic axial element (AE) proteins Hop1, Red1, and Mek1 (Schwacha and Kleckner, 1994Schwacha A. Kleckner N.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mec1, the budding yeast homolog of mammalian ATR, and its genetic partners, Rad17 and Rad24, have also been implicated in meiotic recombination partner choice because mutations in any one of the three genes exhibit elevated levels of ectopic recombination (Grushcow et al., 1999Grushcow J.M. Holzen T.M. Park K.J. Weintert T. Licheten M. Bishop D.K.

Furthermore, rad24 as well as red1 and mek1 were isolated in a screen for mutants exhibiting an increase in meiotic IS recombination (Thompson and Stahl, 1999Thompson D. Stahl F. Genetic control of recombination partner preference in yeast meiosis: isolation and characterization of mutants elevated for meiotic unequal sister-chromatid recombination.Genetics. 1999; 153: 621-641PubMed Google Scholar). The status of IH recombination is monitored by a meiotic surveillance system, which ensures that the onset of the first meiotic division (MI) is coordinated with the completion of DSB repair (Bishop et al., 1992Bishop D.

In dmc1Δ mutants, where IH-strand invasion fails to occur, cells accumulate extensively resected DSBs and arrest prior to MI. This arrest requires MEC1, RAD17, RAD24, HOP1, RED1, and MEK1 (Hochwagen and Amon, 2006Hochwagen A. Amon A. Checking your breaks: Surveillance mechanism for meiotic recombination.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: R217-R228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). dmc1Δ mec1-1 cells proceed through meiosis without repairing DSBs (Lydall et al., 1996Lydall D.

Hartwell L. The RAD9 gene controls the cell cycle response to DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In contrast, the meiotic progression observed in a dmc1Δ mutant following the inactivation of Hop1, Red1, or Mek1 is accompanied by efficient repair of the breaks via IS recombination; meiotic progression in this case is not a checkpoint bypass per se but instead is a consequence of inappropriate repair (Niu et al., 2005Niu H.

Meiotic cell monitor the status of the interhomolog recombination complex.Genes Dev. 1997; 1: 106-118Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Budding yeast Mec1 and Tel1, like their mammalian counterparts, ATR and ATM, are serine/threonine kinases (Mallory and Petes, 2000Mallory J. Petes T. Protein kinase activity of Tel1p and Mec1p, two Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins related to the human ATM protein kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13749-13754Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They preferentially phosphorylate their substrates on serine or threonine residues that precede glutamine residues, so-called SQ/TQ or [S/T]Q motifs. Many known targets of the ATM/ATR family proteins contain [S/T]Q cluster domains (SCDs). An SCD is operationally defined as a region where three or more SQ or TQ motifs are found within a tract of 100 residues or less (Traven and Heierhorst, 2005Traven A. Heierhorst J. SQ/TQ cluster domains: concentrated ATM/ATR kinase phosphorylation site regions in DNA-damage-response proteins.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A key role of Mec1/Tel1 or ATM/ATR phosphorylation is to promote adaptor-protein mediated activation of downstream effector kinases (Melo and Toczyski, 2002Melo J. Toczyski D. A unified view of the DNA-damage checkpoint.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The composition of a specific adaptor-effector kinase pair involved depends on the type of aberration responsible for activating the ATM/ATR or Mec1/Tel1 signaling cascade. For instance, stalled replication forks lead to the phosphorylation of Mrc1 (budding and fission yeasts) or Claspin (frog and mammals), followed by activation of Rad53 or Chk1, respectively (Melo and Toczyski, 2002Melo J. Toczyski D. A unified view of the DNA-damage checkpoint.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DNA damage activates the Rad9-Rad53 pair in budding yeast or Crb2-Chk1 in fission yeast. Interestingly, despite their essential roles during mitotic DSB checkpoint regulation, Rad9 and Rad53 do not appear to have any roles during unchallenged meiosis (Lydall et al., 1996Lydall D. Nikolsky Y. Bishop D.K. Weinert T. A meiotic recombination checkpoint controlled by mitotic checkpoint genes.Nature. 1996; 383: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Roeder and Bailis, 2000Roeder G. Bailis J. The pachytene checkpoint.Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 395-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), suggesting that the surveillance mechanism of meiotic DSB repair may be distinct from its mitotic counterpart. The requirement for Mec1 and Hop1/Red1/Mek1 in mediating a dmc1Δ arrest and their involvement in recombination partner choice raise the possibility that these proteins might be regulating a common process related to meiotic IH bias. Here, we demonstrate that Hop1 is a target of Mec1/Tel1. Characterization of the hop1 allele where three [S/T]Q motifs within the SCD are mutated to AQ (hop1SCD) reveals that phosphorylation by Mec1/Tel1 is required for preventing Dmc1-independent repair and mediating meiotic checkpoint arrest. Identification of Hop1 as the first meiosis-specific target of the ATM/ATR family of proteins provides useful insights into the ways in which these evolutionarily conserved proteins utilize the same molecular mechanism to promote fundamentally different cellular/chromosomal processes during proliferation and meiosis. As Mec1 and Tel1 are protein kinases and Hop1, Red1, and Mek1 are phosphoproteins (Bailis and Roeder, 1998Bailis J.M. Roeder G.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we asked whether Mec1 and/or Tel1 phosphorylate one or more of these proteins. Targets of ATM/ATR or Mec1/Tel1 have a typically high incidence of [S/T]Q motifs. Among Hop1, Red1, and Mek1, only Hop1 has significantly more than the expected incidence of [S/T]Q motifs. The numbers of [S/T]Qs in Hop1, Red1, and Mek1 versus the total number of residues are 8/605, 1/807, and 3/497, respectively. In addition, three of the eight [S/T]Qs in Hop1 occur within 20 residues, thus defining an SCD (Figure 1A), a hallmark of Mec1/Tel1 and ATM/ATR targets (Traven and Heierhorst, 2005Traven A. Heierhorst J. SQ/TQ cluster domains: concentrated ATM/ATR kinase phosphorylation site regions in DNA-damage-response proteins.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Three domains can be recognized in Hop1. The N terminus contains a HORMA (for Hop1, Rev7 Mad2) domain, which is found in several proteins involved in DNA-checkpoint function, chromosome synapsis, and DNA repair (Aravind and Koonin, 1998Aravind L.

Three [S/T]Q motifs are located within the HORMA domain. The SCD is located between the HORMA and the Zn finger domains. The remaining two [S/T]Q motifs occur between the Zn finger and the putative NLS (Figure 1A). Using an α-Hop1 polyclonal antibody, we assessed the phosphorylation status of Hop1 in various genetic backgrounds. During normal meiosis, Hop1 phosphorylation is maximal between 2.5 and 6.5 hr and disappears by the time cells have undergone MI (Figures 1B and 1G). The antibody detects multiple slower-migrating bands, suggesting multiple phosphorylation sites within the Hop1 protein. During wild-type (WT) meiosis, the fraction of phosphorylated Hop1 reaches no more than 40% of the total (Figures 1B and 2D, HOP1 panel). In the absence of Spo11 or its catalytic activity, Hop1 is not phosphorylated (Figure 1C) as observed previously (Niu et al., 2005Niu H. Wan L. Baumgartner B. Schaefer D. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N. Partner choice during meiosis is regulated by Hop1 promoted dimerization of Mek1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5804-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Hop1 was examined next in mec1Δ, mec1-kd (kinase dead), and tel1Δ strains to test whether its phosphorylation was MEC1 and/or TEL1 dependent. All mec1Δ and mec1-kd strains used in the current study carry a second mutation, sml1Δ, which suppresses the lethality conferred by mec1 null mutations (Zhao et al., 1998Zhao X. Muller E.G.D. Rothstein R. A suppressor of two essential checkpoint genes identifies novel protein that negatively affects dNTP pools.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In a tel1Δ strain, Hop1 phosphorylation is similar to that observed in a WT strain (Figure 1D), consistent with the finding that tel1Δ strains do not exhibit any obvious meiotic defects (e.g., Figure 6C). However, this is likely to be due to Mec1's ability to substitute for Tel1 function rather than Tel1 not playing any role during normal meiosis (see below). In mec1-kd or mec1Δ strains, a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of Hop1 is observed, especially in the appearance of the most slowly migrating, hyperphosphorylated isoform (Figure 1D; data not shown). Next, we examined the status of Hop1 phosphorylation in the absence of both Mec1 and Tel1 functions. Characterization of a mec1Δ tel1Δ strain revealed that fewer cells enter meiotic prophase resulting in reduced amounts of meiotic DSBs (J.A.C., N. Hashash, and R.S.C., unpublished data). Given that Hop1 is a DSB-dependent phosphoprotein (Niu et al., 2005Niu H. Wan L. Baumgartner B. Schaefer D. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N. Partner choice during meiosis is regulated by Hop1 promoted dimerization of Mek1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5804-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; Figure 1C), we decided to utilize a mec1-4ts tel1Δ sml1Δ strain (Cha and Kleckner, 2002Cha R. Kleckner N. ATR homolog Mec1 promotes fork progression, thus averting breaks in replication slow zones.Science. 2002; 297: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) that is proficient for meiotic DSB formation (data not shown). In the mec1-4ts tel1Δ sml1Δ strain, no higher mobility isoforms of Hop1 are detected (Figure 1D), demonstrating that Hop1 phosphorylation, at least that detectable by electrophoretic mobility shift, is entirely dependent on MEC1 and TEL1. MEC1/TEL1-dependent phosphorylation of Hop1 is apparently unaffected in a mek1Δ strain (Figure 1E) consistent with the reports that Mek1 function is downstream of Hop1 (Bailis and Roeder, 1998Bailis J.M. Roeder G.S. Synaptonemal complex morphogenesis and sister-chromatid cohesion requires Mek1-dependent phorphorylation of a meiotic chromosomal protein.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3551-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Niu et al., 2005Niu H. Wan L. Baumgartner B. Schaefer D. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N. Partner choice during meiosis is regulated by Hop1 promoted dimerization of Mek1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5804-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hop1 phosphorylation was absent in a red1Δ strain (Figure 1E), suggesting that the RED1-dependent recruitment of Hop1 (Smith and Roeder, 1997Smith A. Roeder G. The yeast Red1 protein localizes to the cores of meiotic chromosomes.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) is likely to be required for the Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation. Hop1 has been implicated in meiotic checkpoint regulation (Hochwagen and Amon, 2006Hochwagen A. Amon A. Checking your breaks: Surveillance mechanism for meiotic recombination.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: R217-R228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To assess whether Hop1 phosphorylation was affected by the status of the meiotic checkpoint, we carried out western blot analysis of extracts prepared from strains carrying dmc1Δ or zip1Δ mutations. The dmc1Δ mutation triggers meiotic prophase arrest due to the presence of unrepaired DSBs (Bishop et al., 1992Bishop D. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. DMC1: A meiosis-specific yeast homolog of E. coli recA required for recombination, synaptonemal complex formation, and cell cycle progression.Cell. 1992; 69: 439-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The budding yeast ZIP1 encodes the major component of the central element of synaptonemal complex (SC) (Sym et al., 1993Sym M. Engebrecht J. Roeder G. ZIP1 is a synaptonemal complex protein required for meiotic chromosome synapsis.Cell. 1993; 72: 365-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Zip1 leads to defects in both SC development (Sym et al., 1993Sym M. Engebrecht J. Roeder G. ZIP1 is a synaptonemal complex protein required for meiotic chromosome synapsis.Cell. 1993; 72: 365-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and meiotic recombination (Börner et al., 2004Börner G.V. Kleckner N. Hunter N. Crossover/Noncrossover differentiation, synaptonemal complex formation, and regulatory surveillance at the leptotene/zygotene transition of meiosis.Cell. 2004; 117: 29-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and also triggers a checkpoint response (Lydall et al., 1996Lydall D. Nikolsky Y. Bishop D.K. Weinert T. A meiotic recombination checkpoint controlled by mitotic checkpoint genes.Nature. 1996; 383: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In both dmc1Δ and zip1Δ mutants, accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated isoform of Hop1 is observed (Figure 1F). Under these conditions, the fraction of phosphorylated Hop1 reached 75%–80% of the total. Eliminating Mec1 function reduced the extent of Hop1 phosphorylation, indicating that the checkpoint-dependent accumulation of phosphorylated Hop1 is also, at least partly, MEC1 dependent (Figure 1F). Note that dmc1Δ mec1Δ or zip1Δ mec1-kd cells proceed through meiotic divisions (Figure 1G) despite the presence of limited Hop1 phosphorylation (Figure 1F), suggesting that the Hop1 phosphorylation observed under these conditions is unrelated to or insufficient for checkpoint arrest (see below). To test whether the Hop1 phosphorylation was mediated by Tel1/Mec1, we used a commercially available polyclonal antibody raised against synthetic phospho-(Ser/Thr) ATM/ATR substrate peptides. This α-p[S/T]Q antibody has already been utilized for cytological and biochemical characterization of ATM/ATR and Mec1/Tel1 targets (e.g., Morales et al., 2005Morales M. Theunissen J. Bender-Kim C. Kitagawa R. Kastan M. Petrini J. The Rad50s allele promotes ATM-dependent DNA damage responses and suppresses ATM deficiency: implications for the Mre11 complex as a DNA damage sensor.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 3043-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Smolka et al., 2007Smolka M. Albuquerque C. Chen S. Zhou H. Proteom-wide identification of in vivo targets of DNA damage checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10364-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined whether the α-p[S/T]Q antibody recognized any of the phosphorylated isoforms of Hop1. Western blot analysis was performed with protein extracts prepared from dmc1Δ or zip1Δ strains. We reasoned that utilization of mutants that lead to a stable accumulation of multiple isoforms of Hop1 (e.g., Figure 1F) would enhance the likelihood of signal detection. Additionally, dmc1Δ hop1Δ and mec1-kd mutants were included as negative controls. The α-p[S/T]Q antibody recognizes an identical sized band to the hyperphosphorylated isoform of Hop1 that is present specifically during meiotic prophase (Figures 2A and 2B “ppHop1”; Figure 1B). The detected signal is HOP1 and MEC1 dependent, indicating that the hyperphosphorylated isoform of Hop1 contains one or more Mec1/Tel1-phosphorylated SQ or TQ residue(s). Although the α-p[S/T]Q antibody does not react with the other isoform(s) of Hop1, they may still contain residues that are phosphorylated by Mec1 or Tel1. As the antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide containing pSQ or pTQ residues that are preceded by a leucine (L) residue, there could be selective affinity for the antibody depending on the residues surrounding individual pSQ or pTQ sites. Hop1 contains five SQ and three TQ sites, three of which comprise an SCD (Figure 2B). As many physiologically relevant Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation events take place within such SCDs (Smolka et al., 2007Smolka M. Albuquerque C. Chen S. Zhou H. Proteom-wide identification of in vivo targets of DNA damage checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10364-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, Traven and Heierhorst, 2005Traven A. Heierhorst J. SQ/TQ cluster domains: concentrated ATM/ATR kinase phosphorylation site regions in DNA-damage-response proteins.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), an allele of hop1 was constructed, where the SQ and TQ residues within the SCD were mutated to AQ (hop1SCD; Figure 2B). The hop1SCD allele confers a hop1 null phenotype for spore lethality and bypass of dmc1Δ arrest (Figure 2C). Western blot analysis shows that the majority of Hop1 phosphorylation is eliminated in hop1SCD cells (Figures 2D and 2E). Next, the physiological significance of each S or T residue within the SCD was examined (Figures 2B and 2C). A threonine to alanine substitution at T318 conferred a hop1 null phenotype typified by spore lethality and dmc1Δ bypass (Figure 2C). However, neither S298A nor S311A caused defects as severe as those conferred by either hop1 null, hop1SCD, or hop1-T318A (Figure 2C). Thus, phosphorylation of the T318 residue has the largest effect on Hop1-dependent activity. Note that the phosphorylation at this residue must occur within the context of a threonine because replacing T318 with a phosphomimic residue aspartic acid (hop1-T318D) or with another phosphorylatable residue, serine (hop1-T318S), does not restore Hop1 function (Figures 2B and 2C). To assess whether each of the S or T residues within the SCD was phosphorylated, we examined the extent of Hop1 phosphorylation in specific hop1 mutants where one, two, or three S or T residues within the SCD are mutated (Figure 2E, panel i). The analysis revealed an additive reduction in Hop1 phosphorylation, suggesting that each S/T residue contributed to the overall Hop1 phosphorylation observed, irrespective of their physiological relevance. When compared to spo11Δ or mec1-4ts tel1Δ sml1Δ strains, the hop1SCD mutant appears to have a residual level of phosphorylated Hop1 isoforms (Figure 2E). Therefore, hop1-5A was constructed, where two additional [S/T]Q residues were mutated to AQ in an attempt to create a mutant whose Hop1 phosphorylation status mimicked that in the mec1-4ts tel1Δ strain (Figure 2B). The amount of Hop1-5A protein recovered was consistently reduced, suggesting the involvement of either the T181 and/or S454 residues in protein stability (Figures 2D and 2E). When individually mutated, hop1-S454A mutants exhibit WT spore viability (Figure 2C). hop1-T181A mutants exhibit similarly reduced Hop1 protein levels (Figures 2D and 2E), suggesting that T181 may influence protein stability. Since the stoichiometry of Hop1, Red1, and Mek1 is important for meiosis (Woltering et al., 2000Woltering D. Baumgartner B. Bagchi S. Larkin B. Loidl J. de los Santos T. Hollingsworth N.

Allergy Immunol. 2003; 130: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). TLR signaling is mediated through the cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, the oligomerization of which initiates the recruitment of TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins. The cytoplasmic adaptor subgroup comprises five members: MyD88, MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL), TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNbeta (TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), and sterile α- and armadillo-motif containing protein (SARM) (4O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar), which mediate or modulate the downstream signaling. Subsequent kinase activation results in the induction of transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factor and NF-κB followed by the production of numerous regulators and effectors of the innate immune response. In addition to the TLRs and the cytoplasmic TIR adaptor subgroup, the family of TIR domain-containing proteins encompasses the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family (5Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The 10 members of the human TLR family recognize a wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. As no ligand has yet been reported for TLR10, it remains the only orphan family member. Activation of TLRs is believed to involve receptor oligomerization, and the current view is that the receptors are active as either homodimers or heterodimers, depending on the receptor type. The cytoplasmic TIR domains dimerize to form a platform for the recruitment of adaptor proteins and additional signaling molecules. TLR10 has been shown to form homodimers and to interact with TLRs 1 and 2 (6Hasan U. Chaffois C. Gaillard C. Saulnier V. Merck E. Tancredi S. Guiet C. Briere F. Vlach J. Lebecque S. Trinchieri G.

In particular, several studies point to the BB-loop as being essential for TLR signal transduction, and it has been suggested to be the site of adaptor protein recruitment (10Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B.

The structural studies have also led to different suggestions for how a biological dimer is formed (11Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A.A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This work presents the structure of the human TLR10 TIR domain, revealing a symmetric dimer with an extensive and highly compatible interaction area. The BB-loop and helix αC of each monomer constitute the major part of the dimer interface. The TLR10 dimer is compatible with existing data from functional analysis of TLR10 and related receptors, and it is likely that the TLR10 structure represents the physiological active dimer. Cloning and Expression—Full-length human TLR10 cDNA was achieved from mammalian gene collection (ID: BC089406). A sequence carrying codons 622–776, corresponding to the TIR domain, was subcloned into the vector pNIC-Bsa4, joining the sequence to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag with integrated tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The resulting plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Cell cultivation and protein expression were performed as described earlier (14Stenmark P. Ogg D. Flodin S. Flores A. Kotenyova T. Nyman T. Nordlund P. Kursula P. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 906-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were frozen at –80 °C until protein purification. Extraction and Purification—Cell extract preparation, purification protocol, and buffer compositions were as described earlier (14Stenmark P. Ogg D. Flodin S. Flores A. Kotenyova T. Nyman T.

Purification was conducted on anÄKTA Xpress system equipped with IMAC (HiTrap chelating HP 1 ml, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade, GE Healthcare) columns. Final gel filtration was performed at 4 °C, in 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 7.5. The resulting gel filtration chromatogram displayed a single symmetric peak at a retention volume corresponding to the monomeric TIR domain. The peak fractions contained the TIR domain to >95% homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (not shown). The protein was concentrated to 10.5 mg/ml, as determined using a molar absorption coefficient of 36,900 (15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C until further handling. The identity of the protein was verified by mass spectrometry. Crystallization and Data Collection—The TLR10 TIR domain was crystallized in hanging drops containing 1 μl of protein solution (10.5 mg/ml) and 2 μl of well solution (11% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m NaSCN), incubated at 20 °C. Crystals appeared on day 2 and were harvested on day 4. A crystal was briefly soaked in cryoprotectant solution (15% polyethylene glycol 3350, 25% glycerol, 0.2 m NaSCN, 0.2 m NaCl) prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY) beamline 14.1 (Berlin, Germany). The data were processed using the program XDS (16Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (17Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) and the human TLR1 structure (PDB ID 1FYV) (10Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) as template. Two monomers were found within the asymmetric unit, arranged as a dimer with two-fold symmetry. The structure was refined with data between 23 and 2.2 Å using Refmac (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar), and iterative model building between refinement rounds was carried out in Coot (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr.

The coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the PDB under the accession code 2J67. Structure analysis was done with Coot and PyMOL (21DeLano, W. L.

The construct containing residues Lys-622–Asn-776 yielded crystals that allowed the TLR10 TIR domain structure to be determined at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure reveals a dimer in the asymmetric unit where each monomer contains a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet (βA–βE) surrounded by five α helices (αA–αE) (Fig. 1A). In line with previous work on TIR domains, the loops are named by the strands and helices that they connect. For instance, the BB-loop connects strand βB and helix αB. The TLR10 TIR domain displays a relatively high degree of sequence conservation (25–75% identity) to the other human TLRs, and the TLR10 structure is therefore similar to the previous structures of TLR1 (10Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and TLR2 (11Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A.A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with r.m.s.d. of 1.4–1.7 Å. The most significant difference in Cα positions among the three TLR structures is seen in the CD-loops, which differ considerably (not shown), whereas both the αC-helix and the following βd-strand overlap with low r.m.s.d. The TLR10 Dimer—The TLR10 dimer displays a two-fold symmetry (Fig. 1A) with a buried surface interaction area of 974 Å, which is in the range of typical physiological interaction surfaces. Based on the solvation energy calculated from the buried surface area and specific electrostatic interactions, the dimer interface was judged by the PISA server (22Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6839) Google Scholar) to constitute a physiological interaction. The major contributions to the dimer interface are made by residues of the BB-loops and the αC-helices. The dimer interface can be seen as made up of a hydrophobic core surrounded by a hydrogen-bonded network (Fig. 1B). The hydrophobic core is constituted primarily by residues of the BB-loop: Tyr-668, Phe-672, Pro-674, and Ile-678. Apart from contributing to the dimer contact, these four residues are stabilizing the observed conformation of the BB-loop, consisting of residues 667–678. At the end of the central αC-helix, Phe-710 and Cys-706 also contribute hydrophobic interactions. The hydrogen-bond network surrounding the hydrophobic core of the interface consists of residues of the BB-loop (Tyr-668, Lys-676), the αB-helix (Ser-679), and the central distorted αC-helix (His-707). The Ser-679 and His-707 residues form a Ser-His-His-Ser chain of hydrogen bonds, connecting the two αC-helices at the very center of the dimer. Above this hydrogen-bond network, the monomers separate slightly, forming a cleft where a number of well defined water molecules mediate hydrogen bonding between the two subunits. At the top of the cleft in monomer A, Arg-741 of the DD-loop makes a polar interaction with Glu-709 in helix αC of monomer B. However, the main part of the DD-loop of monomer A is not involved in the dimer interface. Also, in monomer B, the DD-loop is mainly disordered, which appears to be due to the exposure of the side chains of Phe-735 and Tyr-736, making a crystal contact to the BB-loop of a symmetry-related molecule. A striking feature of the TLR10 structure is the positions of the BB-loops. Although this element constitutes an important part of the dimer interface, a large part of the BB-loop is exposed to the surrounding solvent. This results in the formation of an extended patch of well preserved residues (Fig. 2A). Considering the reported importance of BB-loop residues in the function of TLRs, this opens for the possibility that this extended patch is involved in the recruitment of TIR domain-containing adaptor molecules. The TIR domain dimer seen in this work represents a unique structure. In previous structural work, other TIR-dimer interaction modes have been proposed and correlated to mutagenesis data. Based on a crystal interaction in the C713S mutant of the TLR2 TIR domain, the authors argue for a physiological role of an asymmetric dimer found in this structure (11Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A.A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since TLR2 is not functional as a homodimer (23Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar), the authors suggested that this interface is involved in heterodimer formation between TLR2 and TLR1 or TLR6. This asymmetric dimer interface involves interactions of the BB-loop and αB-helix with the αC-helix and DD-loop of the contacting monomer. In the TLR1 structure (10Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a disulfide-linked symmetric dimer was seen, also with the αC-helix and the BB-loops as the central components. In the structure of the IL-1RAPL TIR domain, a dimer is seen in the asymmetric unit (12Khan J.A. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31664-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), where the interface has the αC-helix as the central component. Although these previous structure dimers are different from the one seen in TLR10, they have focused the attention of previous mutational work on the same interaction motifs as those seen in the TLR10 structure. The TLR10 Dimer Is Consistent with Mutation Data—A wealth of data has been generated on the effects of TLR TIR domain mutations on reporter gene-based signaling assays. However, the structural interpretation of these data is complicated by the fact that it is not known which specific interactions are affected by the mutations, i.e. if it is an inter-receptor interaction, if it is a receptor-adaptor interaction, or if another, still to be revealed, interaction is affected. Furthermore, inactivating mutations have not been analyzed for misfolding defects. The lack of a good biochemical system for in vitro studies of the relevant signaling events and interactions in the TLR-signaling cascades have hampered progress toward understanding the detailed mechanism of these signaling cascades. Structural analyses, however, have the potential to reveal interaction modes of TLR domains, which can serve as working models for the physiological interactions, where the models can be validated by comparison with in vivo mutational data. Previous cell-based mutational work has implicated the BB- and DD-loops as important for the function of TIR domains. Several studies have pointed to the important role of a conserved proline within the BB-loop for the downstream signaling. The well studied P714H mutation of TLR4 (corresponding to Pro-674 in TLR10) abolishes the response to lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria in the C3H/HeJ mouse and acts as a dominant-negative mutant (24Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar). Mutations of this proline apparently had no effect on the ability of TLR4 to form a complex with MyD88 (25Dunne A. Ejdeback M. Ludidi P.L. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41443-41451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutation of the corresponding proline within TLR2 (Pro-681) was demonstrated to result in an inability to signal through MyD88 (10Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). TLR10 has been shown to complex with MyD88 in cell extracts, and the P674H mutation affects both signaling capacity and the interaction with MyD88 (6Hasan U. Chaffois C. Gaillard C. Saulnier V. Merck E. Tancredi S. Guiet C. Briere F. Vlach J. Lebecque S. Trinchieri G. Bates E.E. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2942-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The position of Pro-674 in the TLR10 structure suggests that mutations of this residue are likely to affect dimer interaction. Pro-674 contributes to the interaction surface but also seems important in stabilizing the specific conformation of the BB-loop by restraining its main chain conformation. Moreover, Pro-674 is also exposed on to the surface of the dimer, potentially affecting the interaction with adaptor molecules (Figs. 1B and 2B). The mutation of BB-loop residue I718A in TLR4, corresponding to Ile-678 in TLR10, was found to abolish signaling through the receptor (26Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In an alanine mutation scan, it was found that Phe-679, also of the BB-loop, in TLR2, corresponding to Phe-672 in TLR10, inhibited TLR2 signaling (13Gautam J.K. Ashish Comeau L.D. Krueger J.K. Smith Jr., M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30132-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the BB-loop residues corresponding to Phe-672, Pro-674, and Ile-678 in TLR10 are all involved in the central hydrophobic interaction seen in the TLR10 dimer (Fig. 1B). Phe-672 is conserved as a Phe or a Trp in all TLRs and plays a dual role in the TLR10 structure; it anchors the BB-loop onto the TIR domain but also makes an homotypic interaction with Phe-672 in the neighboring subunit. Ile-678 is conserved as an aliphatic residue (ILV) in all TLRs, except TLR3 (Glu) and TLR5 (Arg). In work on TLR2 and TLR4, it has been demonstrated that the residues corresponding to Cys-706 and Phe-710 of TLR10 are important for receptor function (11Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A.A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Nunez Miguel R. Wong J. Westoll J.F. Brooks H.J. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. Bryant C.E. Monie T.P. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These two residues fall in the central region of the dimer interaction of helix αC and make direct van der Waals interactions at the TLR10 dimer interface. Together with His-707, Cys-706 and Phe-710 constitute the bulk of the αC-helix interactions of the dimer. The TLR2 DD-loop mutations of residues Arg-748, Phe-749, Leu-752, and Arg-753, corresponding to Arg-741, Tyr-742, Leu-745, and Lys-746 in TLR10, had significant effects on TLR2-TLR1 signaling, whereas most other alanine mutations of DD-loop residues showed no such effect (13Gautam J.K. Ashish Comeau L.D. Krueger J.K. Smith Jr., M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30132-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Only Arg-741 of these residues participates directly in the TLR10 dimer interface, where in molecule A, it sits on the tip of the DD-loop, making a salt bridge to Glu-709 of molecule B (Fig. 1B). The Tyr-742, Leu-745, and Lys-746 residues appear to be stabilizing the position of the DD-loop onto the core of the molecule. Since the DD-loop in monomer B is flexible and partially disordered, it is conceivable that mutations of these residues might destabilize the conformation of the region and therefore inhibit the possibility for Arg-741 to participate in the dimer interaction. Both the main chain and the side chain conformations of the DD-loops in the TLR1 and TLR2 structures are similar to those in TLR10, suggesting that the stabilizing function of DD-loop residues could be similar in the three proteins. In a large scale mutational study of the TLR4 TIR domain, mutations of sets of 1–3 consecutive residues were made at a number of different places and shown to abolish or attenuate activity (26Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our interpretation of these complex data is that the effects seen from mutations of two and three consecutive residues are likely to be due to significant structural perturbations. Most single mutations in the study retained activity, and only mutations in the BB-loop and in the αB-helix abolished activity. A number of mutations showing no or minor effects on TLR signaling have also been made in TLR TIR domains. These mutations map almost invariably to areas outside the interaction surface of the TLR10 dimer. Conversely, it is striking that nearly all of the reported mutations of TLR TIR domains affecting receptor function maps to the TLR10 dimer interface revealed in the present study, thus confirming its relevance as a model for a physiological signaling dimer for several members of the TLR family. As mentioned above, there are, however, mutations in the DD-loop region and in the αB-helix, which affect the activity but which do not fall directly on the dimer interaction surface. The effects of these mutations could potentially be explained by secondary structural effects on the interaction surface through misalignment of the DD-loop or the αB-helix. In a recent report, the TLR4 TIR domain dimer was modeled using our TLR10 dimer, made available from the PDB prior to the publication of this work as template (27Nunez Miguel R. Wong J. Westoll J.F. Brooks H.J. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. Bryant C.E. Monie T.P. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These authors also concluded that the interaction mode of the TLR10 dimer is likely to be physiological and that the TLR4 TIR domain dimer modeled from the TLR10 crystallographic structures is consistent with available experimental data. Over the last decade, research on Toll receptor signaling has gathered a wealth of data on the effects of point mutations in the TIR domains. Despite this, a detailed understanding of the interaction modes between TIR domains in activated signaling complex is still lacking. The TLR10 structure presented in this work adds the first direct structural data on a complex of two TLR-TIR domains known to form a signaling pair. The extent of the interaction surface indicates that it corresponds to a physiological interaction. By analyzing the reported effects of TIR domain mutations of TLR10 and other TLRs, we confirm that the TLR10-dimer interaction mode is consistent with observed effects of such mutations. This analysis therefore supports the notion that the TLR10 dimer could serve as a model for TIR domain signaling in the TLR10 system, as well as for other members of the family, most notably TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4, where extensive mutational data exist. However, due to the limitations in information content in the reporter assays and the lack of good in vitro systems for studying activated TIR domain complexes, further studies are required to provide conclusive evidence for the interaction modes of the activated TLR receptors. The BB-loop interaction seen in the TLR10 dimer is very intriguing as it involves most residues of the consecutive sequence Tyr-668–Ser-679 (Ser-679 being the first residue of the αB-helix). The interaction of this segment is extensive and highly complementary, with relatively few water molecules involved in mediating the interaction (Fig. 2B). The interaction is quite hydrophobic (Tyr-668, Phe-672, Pro-674, Ile-678) but also contains polar components (Tyr-668, Lys-676, Ser-679). Peptides and peptidomimetics modeled from the BB-loops of MyD88 and other adaptor TIR domains have been shown to inhibit TLR (28Toshchakov V.U. Basu S. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and IL-1R signaling (29Bartfai T. Behrens M.M. Gaidarova S. Pemberton J. Shivanyuk A. Rebek Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 15809-15814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Likewise, peptides corresponding to the BB-loop region of several TLRs were shown to block, with some specificity, the signaling of specific TLRs (32Toshchakov V.Y. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2655-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the binding pocket for the BB-loop revealed by the TLR10 structure also constitute the binding site for peptide-like inhibitors. The generation of an extended exposed surface constituted by residues of the BB-loop on one face of the TLR10 dimer is intriguing (Fig. 2A). Although interactions of TIR domains might be executed in different modes for different receptors and adaptors, the relatively high conservation of residues in the BB-loop and the common use of MyD88 as an adaptor module imply the existence of common features in TIR domain signaling interactions. MyD88 has been shown to dimerize through homotypic interactions with both its TIR domain and its death domain (33Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The TIR-TIR interaction is suggested to involve the BB-loop as MyD88 BB-loop-derived peptides and peptidomimetics were shown to inhibit dimer formation (30Loiarro M. Capolunghi F. Fanto N. Gallo G. Campo S. Arseni B. Carsetti R. Carminati P. De Santis R. Ruggiero V. Sette C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 82: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Loiarro M. Sette C. Gallo G. Ciacci A.

The conserved and exposed BB-loop surface seen on one face of the TLR10 dimer (Fig. 2A) is a potential candidate interaction surface with MyD88. If this is in fact the case, it would further underline the importance of the BB-loop in the TLR signaling since it could be involved in both homodimer and heterotetramer formation. However, future structural studies of relevant complexes will be required to resolve this issue. In conclusion, the extensive interaction surface and its agreement with mutational data support the physiological relevance of the dimer observed in the TLR10 structure. This work provides a structural background for the critical role of the BB-loop in TLR signaling and reveals a potential peptide-binding pocket, which could be utilized for rational design of specific antagonists of selected TLR pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2052564025,"Cytokinesis involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, followed by abscission, the cutting of the midbody channel, the final bridge between dividing cells. Recently, the midbody ring became known as central for abscission, but its regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we identify BRUCE, a 528 kDa multifunctional protein, which processes ubiquitin-conjugating activity, as a major regulator of abscission. During cytokinesis, BRUCE moves from the vesicular system to the midbody ring and serves as a platform for the membrane delivery machinery and mitotic regulators. Depletion of BRUCE in cell cultures causes defective abscission and cytokinesis-associated apoptosis, accompanied by a block of vesicular targeting and defective formation of the midbody and the midbody ring. Notably, ubiquitin relocalizes from midbody microtubules to the midbody ring during cytokinesis, and depletion of BRUCE disrupts this process. We propose that BRUCE coordinates multiple steps required for abscission and that ubiquitylation may be a crucial trigger."

VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (Flt1) and VEGFR2 (mouse Flk1 or human KDR), are restricted in their tissue distribution primarily to endothelial cells (ECs). The binding of VEGF to its cognate receptors induces dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation of the receptors leading to the activation of several intracellular signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), protein kinase C (PKC), nitric-oxide synthase, mitogen-activated protein kinases and focal adhesion kinases (4Takahashi T.

Gene expression induced by VEGF in ECs plays an important role in controlling angiogenesis. However, the links from VEGF receptors intracellular signaling cascades to gene regulation remain largely elusive.Protein kinase D (PKD), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, including signal transduction (8Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated that VEGF rapidly induces activation of PKD via the VEGFR2-PLCγ-PKC pathway, and that PKD is involved in VEGF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signaling and endothelial cell proliferation (9Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that PKD regulates gene transcription via the control of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) subcellular localization in T lymphocytes and in cardiac cells (10Vega R.B.

However, whether PKD regulates class II HDACs in vascular ECs is unclear.Histone acetylation/deacetylation has emerged as a fundamental mechanism for the control of gene expression (14McKinsey T.A.

Class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9) have been shown to mediate interactions with several transcriptional cofactors and confers responsiveness to calcium-dependent signaling (14McKinsey T.A.

For example, HDAC4 controls chondrocyte hypertrophy during skeletogenesis (16Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G.

However, little is known about the role of class II HDACs in VEGF signaling.In this report, we show that VEGF stimulates PKD-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC5 at Ser259/498 residues in ECs, which leads to HDAC5 nuclear exclusion and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) transcriptional activation. Furthermore, this PKD-HDAC5 pathway mediates a VEGF-induced specific subset of gene expression, cell migration, and tube formation. These findings establish a critical role for PKD and HDAC5 in regulation of gene transcription and angiogenesis by VEGF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Plasmids pEGFP-PKD1-WT and pEGFP-PKD1-KN, pCMV-FLAG-HDAC5-WT and pCMV-FLAG-HDAC5-S/A have been described previously (10Vega R.B.

Adenovirus containing β-galactosidase (LacZ) or GFP was used as a control. ECs were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) for 24 h, and then treated with or without inhibitors followed by the application of VEGF (9Wong C.

After incubating with IRDye infrared secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences), immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed with Odyssey software (LI-COR Biosciences) (9Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence experiments, Ad-GFP-HDAC5, Ad-FLAG-HDAC5, and AD-GFP-PKD1 and their mutants were infected into ECs. GFP-expressing cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with VEGF in the presence or absence of the indicated protein kinase inhibitors. Localization of the fluorescent proteins was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Inc.), and the images were captured and analyzed by the Spot software system (RT Color Diagnostic Instruments) (10Vega R.B.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript Preamplification System (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified by PCR for 30 cycles (Applied Biosystem) (23Youn H.D. Liu J.O.

Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as an internal control.Wound Closure Cell Migration—For the measurement of cell migration during wound closure (24Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), ECs were seeded on 6-well plates coated with gelatin and grown to confluence. Cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses where indicated. Monolayers were then disrupted with a cell scrapper of ∼1.2 mm and photographed at 0 and 12 h after VEGF addition in a light microscope (Olympus CK40) equipped with a digital camera (Olympus DP11). The number of endothelial cells that migrated into the wounded area were counted.Tube formation assay for in vitro angiogenesis. For the in vitro angiogenesis assay (24Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), ECs infected with adenoviruses were plated on a thin layer of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 5 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate in 1% fetal bovine serum EC medium and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. The capillary-like tube structures were visualized by light microscopy (Olympus CK40) at different time points and imaged with a digital camera (Olympus DP11). The total length of the tube-like structures per field was measured with an ImageJ analyzer as previously described (25Pi X. Garin G. Xie L. Zheng Q. Wei H. Abe J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ten random fields were measured per dish, and the total length per field was calculated.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. The significance of the results was assessed by a paired t test between two groups. Differences among 3 or more groups were analyzed by contrast analysis, using the Super analysis of variance. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSVEGF Stimulates HDAC5 Phosphorylation in Endothelial Cells—To examine the potential role of HDAC5 in VEGF signaling, we first studied HDAC5 phosphorylation in ECs in response to VEGF. BAECs were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) at different times as indicated, and the phosphorylation of HDAC5 in cell lysates was determined by Western blots with phospho-specific HDAC5 antibodies, which recognize HDAC5 phosphorylated at Ser259 and Ser498 (10Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). VEGF rapidly induced HDAC5 phosphorylation within 2 min, the activation reached a maximum between 15 and 60 min (Fig. 1A). During the course of VEGF stimulation, the level of total HDAC5 expression in cells was not changed. Moreover, VEGF induced HDAC5 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner at a concentration as low as 1 ng/ml and achieved a maximum of the activation at 10–100 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of HDAC5 by VEGF is not limited on BAECs because VEGF also stimulated HDAC5 phosphorylation in similar time- and dose-dependent manners in HUVECs (data not shown).VEGFR2-mediated PLCγ/PKC Pathway, but Not CaM-CaMK Pathway, Regulates VEGF-induced HDAC5 Phosphorylation—Using neutralizing antibodies against VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 as well as VEGFR2 kinase-inactive mutant, we observed that VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation is mediated by VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1 (supplemental data Fig. S1).We further examined signal pathways involved in VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation. The PLCγ-specific inhibitor U73122 completely blocked HDAC5 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not inhibit VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Ro-31-8425 inhibited HDAC5 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that the PLCγ-PKC pathway mediates VEGF-stimulated HDAC5 phosphorylation in ECs. In contrast, we observed that the calcium-CaM-CaMK pathway was not involved in HDAC5 phosphorylation in ECs by VEGF (supplemental data Fig. S2).FIGURE 2PLCγ-PKC pathway mediates VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation. BAECs were pretreated with vehicle (DMSO as control), PLCγ selective inhibitor U73122 (3 μm, A), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm, B), PKC inhibitors GF109203X (1–10 μm, C), and Ro-31-8425 (1–10 μm, D) for 30 min, and then exposed to 20 ng/ml VEGF for 15 min. HDAC5 phosphorylation and expression in cell lysates were determined. Representative immunoblots are shown (n = 3). p < 0.05 versus the group treated with VEGF alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PKD Mediates HDAC5 Phosphorylation by VEGF—We have previously shown that VEGF stimulated PKD phosphorylation and activation in a PLCγ/PKC pathway-dependent manner (9Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of PKD in VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation, we inhibited the PKD function with three strategies. First a potential PKD inhibitor Go6976 inhibited VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Second, knockdown PKD1 expression in HUVECs by siRNA (9Wong C. Jin Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33262-33269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) markedly attenuated VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Third, Ad-GFP-PKD1-KN significantly reduced VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation, whereas the infection of BAECs with Ad-GFP-PKD1-WT enhanced basal HDAC5 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data demonstrate an essential role of PKD1 for VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation. In addition, we observed that PKD1 and HDAC5 were phosphorylated by VEGF stimulation in vivo in mouse aortas (supplemental data Fig. S3).FIGURE 3PKD1 mediates HDAC5 phosphorylation by VEGF. A, BAECs were pretreated with the potent PKD inhibitor Go6976 at the indicated concentrations for 30 min, and then exposed to 20 ng/ml VEGF for 15 min. B, HUVECs were transfected with scrambled siRNA (100 nm, control) or PKD1 siRNA (100 nm) for 48 h, and then exposed to VEGF. C, BAECs were infected with adenoviruses encoding GFP (Ad-GFP, control), or Ad-GFP-PKD1-KN at 100 m.o.i. for 24 h, and then exposed to VEGF. HDAC5 phosphorylation and expression, and PKD1 phosphorylation and expression in cell lysates were determined. Representative immunoblots and quantitative data are shown (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VEGF Stimulates HDAC5 Nuclear Export—To gain insight into the functional significance of HDAC5 phosphorylation in VEGF-mediated signaling events, we studied the effect of VEGF on HDAC5 subcellular localization with HDAC5 fused with GFP. BAECs were infected with adenovirus expressing GFP-tagged HDAC5 WT, and then exposed to 20 ng/ml VEGF. Without treatment of VEGF, GFP-HDAC5 was located primarily in the nuclei of ECs (Fig. 4A). In response to VEGF stimulation, GFP-HDAC5 in the cells underwent a time-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Fig. 4A). Nuclear export of HDAC5 was observed at 30 min after application of VEGF, and reached a maximum at 2 h. Exported GFP-HDAC5 remained in the cytoplasm for several hours, and then was gradually imported into the nucleus after a 12-h VEGF stimulation. At 24 h after VEGF treatment, almost all of the GFP-HDAC5 was shuttled back into the nucleus from the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4VEGF induces nuclear export of HDAC5 through the PLCγ-PKC-dependent pathway. A, BAECs were infected with Ad-GFP-HDAC5 at 50 m.o.i. for 24 h, and then exposed to VEGF (20 ng/ml) for various times as indicated. B, BAECs were infected with Ad-GFP-HDAC5 at 50 m.o.i. for 24 h, and then pretreated with the vehicle (DMSO as control), PLCγ selective inhibitor U73122 (3 μm), PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8425 (10 μm) and GF109203X (10 μm), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (30 μm), and CaMK II inhibitor KN93 (10 μm) for 30 min, followed by exposure of VEGF for 3 h. The cells were fixed and GFP-HDAC5 distribution was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Representative images (magnification, ×40 for A and ×60 for B) were from five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PLCγ-PKC-PKD Pathway Mediates VEGF-induced HDAC5 Nuclear Export—Similar to HDAC5 phosphorylation, the selective pharmacological inhibitors for PLCγ and PKCs abolished VEGF-induced HDAC5 nuclear export (Fig. 4B), but the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, calcium chelator BAPTA/AM, and CaMK inhibitor KN93 had no effect on HDAC5 nuclear export by VEGF (Fig. 4B).Consistent with the critical role of PKD in VEGF-induced HDAC5 phosphorylation, the PKD inhibitor Go6976 and siRNA to PKD1 also blocked VEGF-induced HDAC5 nuclear export (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, in ECs infected with an adenovirus expressing FLAG-tagged HDAC5 (Ad-FLAG-HDAC5), VEGF also stimulated nuclear export of FLAG-HDAC5 observed by immunocytochemistry with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5C). Co-infection of Ad-GFP-PKD1-WT induced nuclear export of FLAG-HDAC5 no matter the VEGF treatment or not (Fig. 5C). In contrast, co-infection of Ad-GFP-PKD1-KN blocked nuclear export of HDAC5 in response to VEGF (Fig. 5C). Of note, GFP-PKD1-KN was mainly concentrated in the Golgi and affected cell morphology, which is consistent with a previous report (20Hausser A. Link G. Bamberg L. Burzlaff A. Lutz S. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5PKD1-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC5 at Ser259/498 residues is required for HDAC5 nuclear export by VEGF. A, BAECs were infected with Ad-GFP-HDAC5 at 50 m.o.i. for 24 h, and then pretreated with PKD inhibitor Go6976 (1 μm) for 30 min followed by the exposure of VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 3 h. B, HUVECs were transfected with scrambled siRNA (100 nm, control) or PKD1 siRNA (100 nm) for 24 h, and then infected with Ad-GFP-HDAC5 at 50 m.o.i. for 24 h, followed by exposure of VEGF for 3 h. The cells were fixed and GFP-HDAC5 distribution was analyzed. C, BAECs were infected with 50 m.o.i. Ad-FLAG-HDAC5 along with 100 m.o.i. Ad-GFP (control), Ad-GFP-KD1-WT, or Ad-GFP-PKD1-KN for 24 h, and then exposed to VEGF for 3 h. The cells were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Texas Red (red). FLAG-HDAC5 and GFP or GFP-tagged PKD localization in cells was analyzed. D, BAECs were infected with Ad-GFP-HDAC5-WT or Ad-GFP-HDAC-S/A at 50 m.o.i. for 24 h, and then stimulated with VEGF for 3 h. GFP-HDAC5-WT or GFP-HDAC5-S/A distribution and nuclei stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were analyzed. Representative images (magnification, ×60) were from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HDAC5 Phosphorylation on Ser259/498 Sites Is Required for Its Nuclear Export—To determine whether PKD-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC5 at Ser259/498 residues is required for HDAC5 nuclear export, we studied subcellular localization of the GFP-HDAC5-S/A mutant, in which serine 259/498 residues were replaced with alanine. ECs were infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-GFP-HDAC5-WT, or Ad-GFP-HDAC5-S/A. After VEGF stimulation for 2 h, GFP-HDAC5-WT was translocated into the cytoplasm (Fig. 5D). In contrast, GFP-HDAC5-S/A remained in the nucleus after VEGF stimulation. Similar results were observed when ECs were infected with Ad-FLAG-HDAC5-WT and Ad-FLAG-HDAC5-S/A (supplemental data Fig. S4). Collectively, the data indicate that PKD-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC5 at Ser259/498 is critical for its nuclear export.PKD-HDAC5 Pathway Is Involved in VEGF-induced MEF2 Transcriptional Activation and Gene Expression—Class II HDACs have been shown to interact with transcription factors of the MEF2 family and play an important role in the repression of MEF2-dependent gene expression (14McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the effect of FLAG-HDAC5-S/A and GFP-PKD1-KN on VEGF-induced MEF2 transcriptional activation in ECs using the 3xMEF2 luciferase reporter assay. In the cells transfected with 3xMEF2 luciferase plasmids and control empty vector, VEGF significantly increased MEF2 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6A). Co-transfection of FLAG-HADC5-S/A plasmids abolished such an increase of MEF2 transcriptional activation by VEGF (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, PKD1 was also involved in the process because GFP-PKD1-KN significantly inhibited the VEGF-induced MEF2 transcriptional activation (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6VEGF stimulates MEF2 transcription activation and gene expression through PKD-dependent HDAC5 phosphorylation. A and B, BAECs were co-transfected with plasmids with the 3xMEF2-luciferase reporter gene along with the pCMV empty vector (control), FLAG-HDAC5-S/A, GFP (pEGFP-N1 as a control), or GFP-PKD1-KN for 48 h and then stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for an additional 16 h. MEF2 luciferase activity was determined. The graphs represent averaged data (mean ± S.E., n = 4), expressed as -fold change over basal. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate. *, p < 0.05 for the change of MEF2 activity versus control without VEGF stimulation; #, p < 0.05 versus the group treated with VEGF alone.

https://openalex.org/W2082679628,"Gene imprinting, the differential expression of maternal and paternal alleles, independently evolved in mammals and in flowering plants. A unique feature of flowering plants is a double-fertilization event in which the sperm fertilize not only the egg, which forms the embryo, but also the central cell, which develops into the endosperm (an embryo-supporting tissue). The distinctive mechanisms of gene imprinting in the endosperm, which involve DNA demethylation and histone methylation, begin in the central cell and sperm prior to fertilization. Flowering plants might have coevolved double fertilization and imprinting to prevent parthenogenetic development of the endosperm."
https://openalex.org/W2102128818,"The intestine has an extraordinary capacity for fatty acid (FA) absorption. Numerous candidates for a protein-mediated mechanism of dietary FA absorption have been proposed, but firm evidence for this process has remained elusive. Here we show that the scavenger receptor CD36 is required both for the uptake of very long chain FAs (VLCFAs) in cultured cells and the absorption of dietary VLCFAs in mice. We found that the fraction of CD36-dependent saturated fatty acid association/absorption in these model systems is proportional to the FA chain length and specific for fatty acids and fatty alcohols containing very long saturated acyl chains. Moreover, intestinal VLCFA absorption is completely abolished in CD36-null mice fed a high fat diet, illustrating that the predominant mechanism for VLCFA absorption is CD36-dependent. Together, these findings represent the first direct evidence for protein-facilitated FA absorption in the intestine and identify a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases characterized by elevated VLCFA levels."

We show that the 21 gene regulon specifying the pdu organelle and propanediol utilization enzymes from Citrobacter freundii is fully functional when cloned in Escherichia coli, both producing metabolosomes and allowing propanediol utilization. Genetic manipulation of the level of specific shell proteins resulted in the formation of aberrantly shaped metabolosomes, providing evidence for their involvement as delimiting entities in the organelle. This is the first demonstration of complete recombinant metabolosome activity transferred in a single step and supports phylogenetic evidence that the pdu genes are readily horizontally transmissible.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8039-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), emphasizing their role in cellular metabolism. There is some considerable interest in how these proteinaceous organelles form and the arrangement of protein subunits that give rise to these remarkable macromolecular assemblies. In carboxysomes, there are thought to be a number of shell proteins that encase the RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. The situation is more complex in metabolosomes, where there are at least five shell proteins that encase ancillary factors, metabolic enzymes, and activating factors. There are thus between 17 and 21 genes associated with the ethanolamine and propanediol metabolosomes, respectively, and although some functional studies have been undertaken, little is known about the topological arrangement of the encoded protein components within the organelle. However, sequence analysis reveals that the shell proteins found in carboxysomes and metabolosomes are similar, indicating that they have evolved from a common ancestor. Structural studies on some of the individual shell proteins have given an insight into how they may function. The main carboxysome shell protein, CCMK1, has been shown to have a hexameric crystal structure with a charged pore (15Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), suggesting a selective permeability mechanism making the structure a prokaryotic functional equivalent to a eukaryotic organelle. Structures of the CsoS1A carboxysome protein from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus (16Tsai Y. Sawaya M.R. Cannon G.C. Cai F. Williams E.B. Heinhorst S. Kerfeld C.A. Yeates T.O. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the EutN shell protein of the ethanolamine utilization enterosomes from E. coli (17Forouhar F. Kuzin A. Seetharaman J. Lee I.

Genomics. 2007; 8: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) also reveal similar hexameric arrangements with charged residues surrounding a central pore. Cryoelectron microscopy of extracted carboxysomes shows they have an icosahedral symmetry with triangular faces, but a complete image reconstruction was not possible because of a variability in individual carboxysome size, lack of symmetry in carboxysome contents, and absence of obvious capsomers on the surface (18Schmid M.F. Paredes A.M. Khant H.A. Soyer F. Aldrich H.C. Chiu W. Shively J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A similar imaging project has provided even further detail, suggesting that carboxysomes isolated from a Synechococcus strain contain ∼250 RuBisCOs, which are organized into three or four concentric layers (19Iancu C.V. Ding H.J. Morris D.M. Dias D.P. Gonzales A.D. Martino A. Jensen G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The distribution and relatedness of both the structural genes for the protein shell (15Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and the associated metabolic operons (20Lawrence J.G. Roth J.R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 11-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Porwollik S. Wong R.M. McClelland M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8956-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) strongly suggest repeated horizontal transmission in evolution. In keeping with this, we show that plasmid-based expression in E. coli of a pdu operon from C. freundii containing metabolosome structural and enzyme genes results in synthesis of recombinant metabolosomes with fully functional enzyme activity. In this way we have compartmentalized the bacterial cytoplasm, showing that it is possible to create novel compartments by horizontal genetic transfer in bacteria and to vary the shape and topology of the organelle by overproducing individual shell proteins. This process has the potential to be used for metabolic engineering whereby bacteria can be shielded from toxic metabolic intermediates. Thus, this project will contribute to the emerging discipline of synthetic biology. A more detailed account of the techniques, including the cloning and sequencing of the pdu operon is given in the supplemental material. Citrobacter sp. Library—The genomic DNA of Citrobacter sp. was partially digested with Sau3AI, and 20–30-kb fragments were purified after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into the BglII site of the cosmid pLA 2917, and encapsidated in vitro following the Packagene® Lambda DNA packaging system instructions (Promega). The library was used to infect E. coli LE392. One cosmid, which had the ability to degrade 1,2-propanediol, was isolated and named pAR3114 (supplemental Table S1). Bacteria and Growth Conditions—All strains and plasmids are described in supplemental Table S1. E. coli JM109 wild-type and recombinant strains harboring pLA2917 (22Allen L.N. Hanson R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 955-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pAR3114 were grown either in LB medium or trypticase soy agar (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, and 15 g of agar in 1 liter of distilled water) without or with tetracycline (20 μg/ml), respectively. pAR3114 is a pLA2917 cosmid containing an ∼30-kb (pdu operon, cbiA and pocR genes) insert derived from Sau3AI digestion of the C. freundi chromosome. Sequencing of Insert, Gene Annotation, and Recombinant Manipulation—The pdu operon sequence was obtained from pAR3114 after it was sent to be sequenced by Qiagen Ltd. The insert was found to contain 28,618 bp. The sequencing coverage was higher than 12, and the data quality has an error rate of <1/10000 bp and a base accuracy of >99.99%. The cloning and overproduction of individual Pdu components was achieved as described in the supplemental material. Propanediol Utilization Assay—The utilization of 1,2-propanediol was tested by a MacConkey triple-plate method (20Lawrence J.G. Roth J.R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 11-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were streaked on to MacConkey agar (20 g Soy peptone, 5 g of ox bile, 5 g of NaCl, 0.075 g of neutral red, 1% 1,2-propanediol, and 12 g of agar in 1 liter of distilled water) plates containing 1,2-propanediol, 20 μm cobalt chloride, or 100 nm cobinamide. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Formation of red colonies indicated the utilization of 1,2-propanediol by the reduction in pH due to the formation of propionate, and a more rapid appearance of red color with the addition of cobinamide indicated cobalamin dependence of propanediol utilization. Isolation of Metabolosomes—Metabolosomes were isolated by the organelle purification procedure as described previously (7Havemann G.D. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and outlined further in the supplemental material. Electron Microscopy—Late logarithmic phase cells of E. coli pLA2917 and pAR3114 were prefixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutardialdehyde, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, for 72 h. After immobilization in 2% (w/v) water-agar they were postfixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 75 mm cacodylate, pH 7.2, for 60 min at 4 °C followed by dehydration in an ethanol series. The 70% dehydration step, supplemented with 1% (w/v) uranylacetate, was done overnight at ambient temperature following the method of Bobik et al. (6Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections (90 nm) were post-stained with 4% (w/v) aqueous uranylacetate and analyzed at zero-loss bright field mode in an energy-filtered transmission electron microscope (Zeiss CEM 902, Oberkochen, Germany). Isolated polyhedral bodies were fixed in 1% (v/v) glutardialdehyde, and after adsorption to Formvar-carbon-coated grids they were negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranylacetate, pH 4.5. Samples were analyzed by energy-filtered transmission electron microscope, and images were recorded, in general, with a charge-coupled device camera (CCD; Proscan Electronic Systems, Scheuring, Germany). Fast Fourier transformations (FFT) of individual particles was done with CRISP software (Calidris, Sollentuna, Sweden). SuperSTEM microscopy was carried out on a VG HB501 dedicated STEM fitted with a Nion second generation spherical aberration corrector, high angle annular dark field detector (angular range 70–210 mrad), and a Gatan Enfina electron energy loss spectrometer. Diol Dehydratase Assay—The activity of diol dehydratase was measured by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method as described previously (23Toraya T. Honda S. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 39-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of diol dehydratase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of propionaldehyde/min/mg of protein. EPR Analysis and Redox Potentiometry—Continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Elexis E500/580 spectrometer operating at X-band (9.7 MHz) equipped with an Oxford helium flow cryostat as described previously. Redox titrations were performed in a Belle Technology glove-box under a nitrogen atmosphere, essentially as described previously (24Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Ost T.W. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Utilization of 1,2-Propanediol—Transformation of E. coli JM109 cells with a cosmid library made from a partial digest of the C. freundii genome resulted in the identification of a single red colony when the library was plated on propanediol-MacConkey medium (PM medium). The appearance of this red colony was likely due to the ability of the recombinant strain to metabolize 1,2-propanediol, a phenotype absent in wild-type E. coli. The cosmid, termed pAR3114, was found to house an ∼30 kb insert. The insert was sequenced, which revealed that it encoded 30 contiguous genes involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and propanediol utilization and five other genes localized at one end of the insert. These genes and the putative functions of the encoded protein products are described in Table 1. The sequence data have been deposited in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database under accession number AM498294.TABLE 1Genes present on pAR3114, a cosmid containing a 30-kb insert of C. freundii genomic DNAGeneStartEndFunctionLengthDirection of transcriptionPredicted massbpDacbiB8351Cobalamin biosynthesis protein834-17,817cbiA2,211832Cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase1379-49,669pocR3,7182,807Transcriptional regulator911-49,636pduF4,7293,920Propanediol diffusion facilitator809-28,125pduA5,2555,532Shell protein277+9,376pduB5,5366,348Shell protein812+28,021pduC6,3678,031Diol dehydratase large subunit1664+60,280pduD8,0428,716Diol dehydratase medium subunit674+24,280pduE8,7319,249Diol dehydratase small subunit518+19,233pduG9,26511,097Diol dehydratase reactivation protein1832+64,163pduH11,08711,437Diol dehydratase reactivation protein350+12,632pduJ11,45711,732Shell protein275+9,053pduK11,82312,227Shell protein404+13,921pduL12,22712,859Phosphotransacylase632+23,048pduM12,85613,347Unknown491+18,175pduN13,35113,626Shell protein275+9,205pduO13,63514,642Cobalamin adenosyltransferase1007+45,886pduP14,63916,024CoA-dependent propionaldehyde dehydrogenase1385+48,671pduQ16,03517,147Propanol dehydrogenase1112+39,702pduS17,14418,499Cobalamin reductase1355+48,568pduT18,50219,056Shell protein554+19,038pduU19,05619,406Shell protein350+12,483pduV19,41119,863Unknown452+16,331pduW19,84821,062Propionate kinase1214+43,634pduX21,09222,021Unknown929+33,908yeeA23,69422,636Putative inner membrane protein1058-39,618DacD25,54424,372DD-carboxypeptidase1172-43,085phsC26,45025,683Thiosulfate reductase cytochrome B subunit767-28,545phsB27,03526,456Thiosulphate reductase protein579-21,622phsA28,61827,043Thiosulphate reductase precursor1575-53,778 Open table in a new tab Gene Order and Similarity to S. enterica—The C. freundii pdu genes constitute a probable regulon, comprising a 21-gene operon and a regulatory gene. The gene order was found to be identical to that previously reported in S. enterica (6Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), forming a divergent operon with the cbi operon for cobinamide synthesis from a central regulatory gene, pocR (Fig. 1a). Subcloning of the pdu Operon—E. coli pAR3114 formed red colonies on the PM plate in the presence of cobinamide, whereas it remained yellow in its absence indicating the requirement of B12 for propanediol metabolism (Fig. 1b). The E. coli pLA2917 vector control strain formed yellow colonies on PM agar with cobinamide, showing its inability to metabolize 1,2-propanediol. The insert within pAR3114 was trimmed in size by deleting the cbiB, cbiA, pocR, and pduF genes upstream of the main pdu operon, and a further five genes downstream of the pdu operon that are transcribed in the opposite direction and are not thought to be associated with the pdu operon (see Table 1). This shortened insert, containing just the 21 genes of the pdu operon, was cloned into pET14 generating plasmid pED460. When transformed into JM109, bacterial colonies turned red when grown on PM indicator plates, demonstrating that the transformed bacteria had gained the ability to metabolize propanediol. A further deletion was made whereby pduA and pduB were removed from the insert in pED460 to give pED461 (supplemental Table S1). The resulting plasmid, when transformed into E. coli JM109, had a greatly reduced ability to metabolize propanediol on PM medium in that the colonies turned only slightly pink. Reconstitution of propanediol metabolism was achieved by adding pduA-B back in trans on a separate, compatible plasmid (pLysS). However, the individual addition of either pduA or pduB did not restore propanediol metabolism, demonstrating that both proteins are required for this activity. Electron Microscopy—Cobalamin-dependent propanediol utilization is associated with the formation of intracellular inclusions called carboxysome-like bodies, enterosomes, or metabolosomes (6Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined our transformed cells for evidence of metabolosomes. Ultrathin sections of E. coli pAR3114 grown on minimal medium in the presence of 1,2-propanediol showed intracellular metabolosomes (Fig. 2b). E. coli pLA2917 (empty cosmid) control strain grown on minimal medium in the presence of 1,2-propanediol did not show metabolosomes inside the cells (Fig. 2a). When grown on rich medium (LB), E. coli pAR3114 contained metabolosomes in the presence or absence of added propanediol. In cells grown on rich medium, the metabolosomes were closely packed and formed up to 90% of the observed section surface. Again, control strains containing the empty cosmid did not reveal any such structures when grown under similar conditions. In ultrathin cell sections, the metabolosomes measured on average 101 nm across their widest diameter (n = 63; S.D. = 25 nm). There were two maxima in the frequency distribution of measured diameters, compatible with two different size bodies or different sections of a non-spherical polyhedral structure with shorter (77–92 nm) and longer (108–123 nm) axial dimensions (Fig. 2d). These dimensions are similar to those reported for wild-type metabolosomes formed in S. enterica (7Havemann G.D. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and carboxysomes from H. neapolitanus also show variable sizes with two distinct maximal diameters (18Schmid M.F. Paredes A.M. Khant H.A. Soyer F. Aldrich H.C. Chiu W. Shively J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When looked at in detail (Fig. 2c, white arrows), apparent sections of polyhedral bodies showed a weak linearly ordered substructure, indicating a certain degree of interior package order. Additionally, polar deposits of electron-dense amorphous granules could be observed in many recombinant cells (Fig. 2b, asterisks). When the E. coli strain containing the pdu operon, but missing pduA-B, was analyzed by electron microscopy, no metabolosomes were observed (data not shown). Metabolosomes were observed again when this strain was complemented with a compatible plasmid containing pduA-B (data not shown). However, no organelles or other structures were seen in strains in which only pduA or pduB was added back in trans (data not shown). This result indicates that both PduA and PduB are required for organelle biogenesis. Previous research on the S. enterica pdu operon had shown that PduA is essential for organelle formation (26Havemann G.D. Sampson E.M. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Diol Dehydratase Activity—The activity of diol dehydratase was measured from the protein extracted from E. coli pAR3114 grown to stationary phase in the presence and absence of 1,2-propanediol. Diol dehydratase activity was detected at 2.23 units/mg whole-cell protein for E. coli pAR3114 grown in the presence of 1,2-propanediol. Activity was reduced to 0.72 unit/mg when E. coli pAR3114 was grown in the absence of 1,2-propanediol. Recombinant metabolosomes were extracted from cells grown in minimal medium with propanediol as per published methods for the extraction of wild-type metabolosomes (7Havemann G.D. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Purified metabolosomes derived from E. coli pAR3114 grown in the presence of 1,2-propanediol showed diol dehydratase activity of 32.03 units/mg protein, ∼14 times higher than the enzyme activity found in the crude protein extract. Extracted Polyhedral Metabolosomes—Metabolosomes were purified from E. coli pAR3114 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the supplemental material and were viewed both by an energy-filtered transmission electron microscope in the elastic bright field mode and a novel aberration-corrected non-contrast electron microscopy technique using a SuperSTEM instrument. No such structures were obtained from E. coli control strains, indicating that the metabolosomes were generated as a result of the presence of the pdu operon. The interior of negatively stained polyhedral bodies of E. coli pAR3114, fixed with glutardialdehyde (Fig. 3a), showed a finely branching substructure. These particles had a mean diameter of 92 nm (n = 143; S.D. = 32 nm) with a frequency distribution showing 1 maxima (presumed short axis) from 62 to 77 nm and a presumed long axis from 108 to 123 nm (Fig. 2e). Higher magnifications of those particles showed regularly arranged substructures with a layer spacing of about 7 nm (Fig. 3b, white arrows). Intrinsic order on or below this scale within isolated polyhedral bodies was detected by FFT (Fig. 3c, FFTs 2 and 3) relative to the amorphous foil substratum (Fig. 3c, FFT 1) Distinct frequency intensities within a 128 × 128 matrix were obvious at 0.30 and 0.41 per nm, corresponding to a particulate resolution of 3.3 and 2.4 nm (Fig. 3c, FFT 2). That is, the electron micrographs shown resolve structures as small as 2.4 nm, confirming their ability to detect 7-nm layers. Further evidence for regular metabolosome substructure was obtained using SuperSTEM microscopy of the recombinant metabolosomes both in cell sections and protein extracts. A number of particles displayed apparent multicomponent substructure, with smaller particles containing electron density typical of proteins (Fig. 4, a and b). This suggests that the interior of the metabolosome is not an amorphous mixture of component molecules but constitutes a regular assembly of structural proteins. Such a regular assembly has recently been reported for carboxysomes from Synechocystis, where the RuBisCOs are organized into three or four concentric layers (19Iancu C.V. Ding H.J. Morris D.M. Dias D.P. Gonzales A.D. Martino A. Jensen G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Currently crystal structures of carboxysome and metabolosome shell proteins show them forming flat hexagonal sheets, although it has not been determined how this planar structure can bend or fold up to form a closed shell (15Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 16Tsai Y. Sawaya M.R. Cannon G.C. Cai F. Williams E.B. Heinhorst S. Kerfeld C.A. Yeates T.O. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our SuperSTEM images showing discrete electron-dense foci spaced around the recombinant metabolosomes suggest the presence of non-planar protein complexes acting as structural linkage points joining sheets of shell protein to form the faceted surface of the metabolosome (Fig. 4, c and d) in the same way that vertex proteins link planar proteins to form the viral capsid structure (27Abrescia N.G. Cockburn J.J. Grimes J.M. Sutton G.C. Diprose J.M. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D. San Martin C. Burnett R.M. Stuart D.I. Bamford D.H. Bamford J.K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7163-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As in viral capsids, these complexes are presumably pentameric, connecting planes of hexameric shell proteins (27Abrescia N.G. Cockburn J.J. Grimes J.M. Sutton G.C. Diprose J.M. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D. San Martin C. Burnett R.M. Stuart D.I. Bamford D.H. Bamford J.K. Nature. 2004; 432: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Fokine A. Leiman P.G. Shneider M.M. Ahvazi B.

The likely candidate for this metabolosome component is one (or more) of the three predicted shell proteins, just as minor variants of viral capsid proteins normally forming hexameric sheets form pentameric vertex proteins (28Fokine A.

https://openalex.org/W2019622456,"Single-strand extensions of the G strand of telomeres are known to be critical for chromosome-end protection and length regulation. Here, we report that in C. elegans, chromosome termini possess 3′ G-strand overhangs as well as 5′ C-strand overhangs. C tails are as abundant as G tails and are generated by a well-regulated process. These two classes of overhangs are bound by two single-stranded DNA binding proteins, CeOB1 and CeOB2, which exhibit specificity for G-rich or C-rich telomeric DNA. Strains of worms deleted for CeOB1 have elongated telomeres as well as extended G tails, whereas CeOB2 deficiency leads to telomere-length heterogeneity. Both CeOB1 and CeOB2 contain OB (oligo-saccharide/oligo-nucleotide binding) folds, which exhibit structural similarity to the second and first OB folds of the mammalian telomere binding protein hPOT1, respectively. Our results suggest that C. elegans telomere homeostasis relies on a novel mechanism that involves 5′ and 3′ single-stranded termini.

Both CeOB1 and CeOB2 contain OB (oligo-saccharide/oligo-nucleotide binding) folds, which exhibit structural similarity to the second and first OB folds of the mammalian telomere binding protein hPOT1, respectively. Our results suggest that C. elegans telomere homeostasis relies on a novel mechanism that involves 5′ and 3′ single-stranded termini. Telomeric 3′ overhangs have been observed in many model organisms, including yeast, ciliates, trypanosomes, plants, mice, and humans (Hemann and Greider, 1999Hemann M.T. Greider C.W.

Chromosome end replication in ciliates and S. cerevisiae involves the coregulated activities of telomerase and fill-in synthesis by the lagging strand machinery (Bianchi et al., 2004Bianchi A.

Similarly, studies in mammalian systems have proposed that telomerase-dependent elongation of the G strand is coordinated with C strand synthesis (Nakamura et al., 2005Nakamura M. Nabetani A.

The knowledge of the molecular mechanism of overhang generation remains incomplete. Lagging-strand synthesis results in a short 3′ overhang at the chromosome terminus, resulting from removal of the most distal RNA primer utilized for Okazaki fragment synthesis. Leading-strand synthesis is expected to generate a blunt end. However, both telomere termini end in single-stranded G overhangs that are much longer than the RNA primers in yeast, ciliates, and humans, indicating a well-regulated processing of chromosome ends (Chai et al., 2006Chai W.

It is likely that G tails are generated by enzymatic resection of the telomeric C strand, but the nucleases responsible have not been described. It is also unclear if the telomeric leading and lagging strands are differentially synthesized at discrete stages in the cell cycle, and how telomerase participates in this complex process. Proteins specialized to bind to the single-stranded 3′ overhang and to promote chromosome-end protection have been described in a variety of model systems. In S. cerevisiae, Cdc13p plays a role in telomerase recruitment, but loss of Cdc13p leads to extensive degradation of the telomeric C strand and the generation of long G overhangs, triggering cell-cycle arrest (Booth et al., 2001Booth C. Griffith E. Brady G. Lydall D.

Stn1, a new Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, is implicated in telomere size regulation in association with Cdc13.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 512-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). S. pombe lacking the single-stranded binding factor POT1 rapidly lose telomeric DNA, but some cells survive by circularizing their chromosomes (Baumann and Cech, 2001Baumann P. Cech T.R. Pot1, the putative telomere end-binding protein in fission yeast and humans.Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). In mice, POT1b loss leads to degradation of the C strand, suggesting a protective mechanism analogous to Cdc13 in yeast (Hockemeyer et al., 2006Hockemeyer D. Daniels J.P. Takai H. de Lange T. Recent expansion of the telomeric complex in rodents: Two distinct POT1 proteins protect mouse telomeres.Cell. 2006; 126: 63-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Loss of the telomeric G-tail has also been observed in the absence of the telomeric protection factor TRF2 from chromosome ends, indicating that the shelterin complex together with the telomeric double-stranded and single-stranded DNA forms a protective unit at telomeres (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: The protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Telomeric overhangs have also been predicted to play a prominent role in formation of loops at chromosome ends, when it was observed that a fraction of telomeres form lasso-like structures by invasion of the single strand into the double-stranded homologous telomeric DNA (Griffith et al., 1999Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Loops have been found in a wide variety of systems (de Lange, 2004de Lange T. T-loops and the origin of telomeres.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that they are a commonly employed mechanism for protecting telomeres from recognition as double-stranded breaks. The telomeres of the nematode C. elegans are 2–9 kb in length and consist of the repeated DNA sequence TTAGGC. It is known that telomere length in the worm is clonal, inherited, and regulated in cis (Raices et al., 2005Raices M. Maruyama H. Dillin A. Karlseder J. Uncoupling of longevity and telomere length in C. elegans.PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e30https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010030Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), similar to telomere length in mammalian cells. However, no homologs of the mammalian telomeric binding proteins TRF1, TRF2, TPP1, TIN2, or POT1 have been described so far, and were not readily visible in the completed C. elegans genome. A candidate for the catalytic subunit of telomerase has been identified, and its deletion causes gradual telomere shortening, leading to chromosome fusion, loss of viability, and infertility (Meier et al., 2006Meier B. Clejan I. Liu Y. Lowden M. Gartner A. Hodgkin J. Ahmed S. trt-1 is the Caenorhabditis elegans catalytic subunit of telomerase.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e18https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020018.eorCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Telomere length in C. elegans strains has also been analyzed by STELA (single telomere length analysis), a PCR-based method for estimating the length of individual telomeres. Application of this method in C. elegans revealed that the C-rich strand ends preferentially in TCC-5′ (Cheung et al., 2004Cheung I. Schertzer M. Baross A. Rose A.M. Lansdorp P.M. Baird D.M. Strain-specific telomere length revealed by single telomere length analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3383-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed C. elegans telomeric structure in detail and found that worms not only contain 3′ G-rich overhangs, but also 5′ C-rich tails. Two-dimensional gel analysis and electron microscopy revealed the presence of telomeric circles and telomeric loops. We identified two OB-fold-containing proteins with similarity to hPOT1 that bind to either the G-rich or the C-rich nematode telomeric sequence, and whose deletions lead to changes in telomere length, heterogeneity, and accumulation of telomeric circles. We therefore propose that C. elegans employs on a novel mechanism for telomere homeostasis that incorporates 5′ and 3′ overhangs. To analyze single-strand overhangs at nematode telomeres, genomic DNA was isolated and digested as described (Raices et al., 2005Raices M. Maruyama H. Dillin A. Karlseder J. Uncoupling of longevity and telomere length in C. elegans.PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e30https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010030Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Hemann and Greider, 1999Hemann M.T. Greider C.W. G-strand overhangs on telomeres in telomerase-deficient mouse cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3964-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The dried gels were hybridized with a probe complementary to the G overhang [(GCCTAA)4], and with a probe complementary to the C strand [(TTAGGC)4] as control. DNA from five different wild-type worm strains was loaded alongside DNA from transformed human cancer cells (HeLa) and primary human fibroblasts (IMR90). Exposure of the dried gels revealed strong signals resulting from single-stranded G tails (Figure 1A). The signal stretched from the 9.4 kb marker to the bottom of the gel, with a strong signal in the low molecular weight range. Telomeres in nematodes range from 2–9 kb, suggesting that the higher molecular weight signal results from overhangs at telomeres, and the lower molecular weight signal from a different population of single-stranded TTAGGC-containing molecules (Figure 1A). The nature of these molecules is currently under investigation, and they can be separated from telomeric DNA by 2D electrophoresis, as described in Figure 2. The DNA from the human cell lines crosshybridized with the C. elegans telomeric probes, resulting in a signal in the lanes loaded with HeLa or IMR90 DNA (Figure 1A). When the same DNA was hybridized with oligonucleotides complementary to the C strand, no signal was visible in the lanes loaded with human DNA, but a strong signal was observed in all C. elegans DNA lanes (Figure 1B). Denaturation of the gels and subsequent hybridization with the same probes resulted in identical telomeric smear signals for both the G- and the C-rich oligonucleotides in the expected size range from 2–9 kb, interspersed by sharper bands, resulting from intrachromosomal telomeric repeats (Figures 1A and 1B). Taken together, it appears that C. elegans contains both G- and C-rich overhangs.Figure 2Two-Dimensional Analysis of C. elegans TelomeresShow full caption(A) Schematics and examples of native (left) and denatured (right) 2D gels, indicating the telomeric single-stranded overhangs (blue), single-stranded DNA (green), telomeric arc (black), and circular telomeric DNA (red).(B) Native and denatured 2D gels of C. elegans DNA (C. e.), ALT cell DNA (KMST-6) and IMR90 DNA, hybridized with radioactively labeled (GCCTAA)4 and (CCCTAA)4 oligonucleotides, respectively.(C) As in (B), except that the gels were hybridized with radioactively labeled (TTAGGC)4 and (TTAGGG)4 oligonucleotides, respectively.(D) 2D gels of C. elegans DNA under native and denatured conditions.

(E) As in (D), except that the DNA was digested with the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease RecJf as indicated. The signal resulting from hybridization with the G-rich probe was unexpected, since this usually serves as a negative control, and does not lead to hybridization. To exclude the possibility that G-rich probe signals result from accessibility of hybridization probes to double-stranded regions of nematode DNA, we tested whether the signal resulted from terminal DNA fragments. Bal-31 digestion of genomic DNA degrades the DNA from the ends, and has frequently been used to confirm that hybridization signals result from terminal DNA. Digests of nematode DNA with Bal-31 nuclease resulted in rapid loss of the overhang signal. After 5 min of Bal-31 digestion almost no signal could be detected by hybridization of native gels, and after 20 min of digestion the signal was undetectable (Figures S1A and S1B available online). It required 120 min of Bal-31 incubation to remove the bulk of double-stranded telomeric DNA, as visualized by hybridization of denatured gels (Figures S1A and S1B). Bal-31 is not strand specific, and both the signals resulting from hybridization with C-rich probes and G-rich probes were removed with the same efficiency (Figures S1A and S1B). Mung bean nuclease digests single-stranded DNA at termini and in DNA loops. Similarly to Bal-31 digests, a short incubation with the nuclease resulted in loss of the signal resulting from the C- and the G-rich probes, whereas the double-stranded DNA remained undigested (Figures S1C and S1D). However, since Mung bean nuclease and Bal-31 are both capable of digesting intrachromosomal single-stranded DNA (Gray et al., 1975Gray Jr., H.B. Ostrander D.A. Hodnett J.L. Legerski R.J. Robberson D.L. Extracellular nucleases of Pseudomonas BAL 31. I.

Second-strand cDNA synthesis: mRNA fragments as primers.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we performed Exonuclease 1 digests. Exonuclease 1 degrades terminal DNA in 3′ to 5′ direction, effectively removing 3′ telomeric G tails (Hemann and Greider, 1999Hemann M.T. Greider C.W. G-strand overhangs on telomeres in telomerase-deficient mouse cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3964-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Digestion of C. elegans, IMR90 or HeLa DNA with this enzyme resulted in efficient loss of the G strand signal, as visualized by hybridization of native gels with a probe complementary to the G overhang (Figures 1C and 1E). Hybridization of the same gels with the same probe after denaturation demonstrated that the double-stranded DNA was still intact (Figure 1C). These results suggest that the signal resulted from terminal G-rich 3′ overhangs, establishing firmly that nematode telomeres end in G tails. However, Exonuclease 1 had no effect on the signal resulting from hybridization with a telomeric G probe in native or denatured conditions (Figures 1D and 1E), confirming the possibility that this signal might be due to 5′ telomeric C-rich overhangs at C. elegans chromosome ends. We noted that the undefined single-stranded repeats at the bottom of the gels were only partially sensitive to Exonuclease 1 which could be due to the formation of secondary structures, however, at this point we lack an explanation for this phenomenon. To better separate the telomeres from the single-stranded fragments, we established 2D gel electrophoresis for C. elegans telomeres. DNA from C. elegans, IMR90 primary fibroblasts and KMST-6 human ALT cells was separated by size on the x axis and by conformation on the y axis (Cesare and Griffith, 2004Cesare A.J. Griffith J.D. Telomeric DNA in ALT cells is characterized by free telomeric circles and heterogeneous t-loops.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9948-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A) and hybridized with C and G probes under native and denaturing conditions. Hybridization of native 2D gels loaded with nematode DNA with a (GCCTAA)4 probe resulted in a strong signal of the telomeric G overhangs (blue arrows) that was well-separated from the low molecular weight single-stranded G-rich DNA (green arrows) (Figure 2B, upper first panel). Hybridization of native 2D gels loaded with DNA isolated from KMST-6 ALT cells with a (CCCTAA)4 probe resulted in a similar pattern, displaying telomeric overhangs (blue arrows) and single-stranded low molecular weight G-rich DNA (green arrows) (Figure 2B, upper second panel). Only the G overhang arc was observed in IMR90 DNA (Figure 2B, upper third panel). When the DNA in the gels was denatured and rehybridized with the same probes, C. elegans telomeres arranged in a telomeric arc, but also displayed a second arc above the telomeric fragments (Figure 2B, lower first panel, red arrows), characteristic of telomeric circles, which were also observed in ALT cells (Figure 2B, lower second panel, red arrows) (Cesare and Griffith, 2004Cesare A.J. Griffith J.D. Telomeric DNA in ALT cells is characterized by free telomeric circles and heterogeneous t-loops.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9948-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2004Wang R.C. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Homologous recombination generates T-loop-sized deletions at human telomeres.Cell. 2004; 119: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), but absent in IMR90 cells (Figure 2B, lower third panel). When 2D gels with DNA from worms and human cells were analyzed with probes complementary to the C strand, only hybridization of C. elegans DNA resulted in a signal under native conditions (Figure 2C, upper panel). Again, the telomeric signal (blue arrow) was distinct from the single-stranded fragments (green arrow). Denaturation and rehybridization of the DNA in the gels generated strong telomeric signals in all three DNA samples, and the additional arcs (red arrows) resulting from telomeric circles were clearly visible in worm DNA and DNA from ALT cells (Figure 2C, lower panels). Since the 2D gel analysis allowed efficient separation of telomeric fragments from low molecular weight DNA, we analyzed the effects of Exonuclease 1, which specifically degrades 3′ single-stranded overhangs, and of RecJf, an exonuclease that specifically degrades 5′ single-stranded overhangs (Lovett and Kolodner, 1989Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Identification and purification of a single-stranded-DNA-specific exonuclease encoded by the recJ gene of Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Analysis of worm DNA under native and denaturing conditions revealed again that Exonuclease 1 efficiently removed the 3′ G overhangs. When hybridized under native conditions with a C-rich probe, the telomeric arc signal was undetectable after Exonuclease 1 digestion (Figure 2D, upper left two panels). Denaturation of the gels demonstrated that the genomic DNA was not degraded and telomeres were still readily detectable (Figure 2D, lower left two panels). In contrast, incubation with Exonuclease 1 did not change the signal intensity resulting from hybridization with a probe complementary to the C strand under native or denaturing conditions (Figure 2D, right two panels). The situation was reversed when the DNA was digested with RecJf. G overhang analysis demonstrated that 3′ G tails were unaffected by RecJf under native conditions (Figure 2E, left two panels). In contrast, RecJf efficiently removed 5′ C overhangs from worm chromosome ends, as demonstrated by the complete loss of signal after hybridization with a (TTAGGC)4 probe under native conditions (Figure 2F, upper right two panels). Like Exonuclease 1, RecJf did not degrade double-stranded genomic DNA (Figure 2F, lower right two panels). Taken together, these results suggest that C. elegans telomeres contain 3′ G tails and 5′ C tails on their chromosome ends. In both human cells and in worms, the recessed C strand present at termini with G tails ends preferentially at a specific sequence (Cheung et al., 2004Cheung I. Schertzer M. Baross A. Rose A.M. Lansdorp P.M. Baird D.M.

Cell. 2005; 18: 131-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting a well-regulated generation of the 3′ G-rich overhang. To ask whether C-tail formation in C. elegans is also a regulated process, we developed an inverted STELA method, dependent on the presence of 5′ C overhangs, and capable of amplifying telomeric fragments from both arms of C. elegans chromosome V (Figure 3A). An inverted telorette is ligated to the 3′ end of the G-rich strand, followed by amplification of a telomeric fragment with a teltail primer complementary to the inverted telorette, and a specific primer complementary to the subtelomeric region of either the left or the right arm of chromosome V (Figure 3A). When this method was applied to DNA from worm strains with either short telomeres (Figures 3B and 3C, N2 strains) or long telomeres (Figures 3B and 3C, CC2 strain), telomeric products with the expected length could be amplified on both chromosome arms with STELA and inverted STELA (Figure 3B for chromosome VL, Figure 3C for VR). STELA was performed with the optimized telorette 503 (Cheung et al., 2004Cheung I. Schertzer M. Baross A. Rose A.M. Lansdorp P.M. Baird D.M. Strain-specific telomere length revealed by single telomere length analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3383-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the amplification/hybridization protocol yielded strong signals (Figures 3B and 3C), in accord with previous observations. The inverse STELA protocol was also capable of amplifying telomeric fragments of the expected size with primers, whose binding is dependent on the presence of a 5′ C-rich overhang. However, signal intensities were much weaker and less bands appeared (Figure 3B, C). This raised the possibility that the inverted telorette 503 (INV-1) is capable of being ligated to the end of the G strand at only a small fraction of telomeres. We therefore tested all permutations of the inverted telorette (INV-2 to 6, Figure 3A), and found that INV-4, ending in 5′-GCCTAA-3′, was by far the most efficient for amplification of telomeric fragments (Figures 3D and 3E). Weak amplification was observed with INV- 1 and 6, and no amplification was possible with INV-2, 3, 5, when an only unrelated linker, the teltail oligo, or no linker was added. Amplification was dependent on the addition of C. elegans DNA and Ligase. PCR requirements for the left or the right arm of chromosome V were identical (Figures 3D and 3E). These controls suggest that the amplified fragments are not primer multimers (unrelated linker, teltail only, no linker, unrelated inverted linker and no DNA controls). Moreover, the requirement for ligase emphasizes that the C overhangs are terminal, and amplification does not result from C-teltail primers binding to partially denatured DNA. Finally, the increased amplification efficiency upon ligation of INV-telorette 4 suggests that the recessed telomeric G strand at 5′ C tails frequently ends in TTA-3′, suggesting a well regulated mechanism for generation of 5′ overhangs.

This bone marrow variant contains a 288-nucleotide deletion from exons 4–6 and exhibits impaired transcriptional activity. The murine IRF-5 can be activated by both TBK1 and MyD88 to form homodimers and bind to and activate transcription of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine genes. The importance of IRF-5 in the antiviral and inflammatory response in vivo is highlighted by marked reductions in serum levels of type I interferon and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in Newcastle disease virus-infected Irf5–/– mice. IRF-5 is critical for TLR3-, TLR4-, and TLR9-dependent induction of TNFα in CD11c+ dendritic cells. In contrast, TLR9, but not TLR3/4-mediated induction of type I IFN transcription, is dependent on IRF-5 in these cells. In addition, IRF-5 regulates TNFα but not type I interferon gene transcription in Newcastle disease virus-infected peritoneal macrophages. Altogether, these data reveal the cell type-specific importance of IRF-5 in MyD88-mediated antiviral pathways and the widespread role of IRF-5 in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines.

Viral nucleic acids are recognized by two classes of cellular receptors as follows: toll-like receptors (TLR), which are present in the endosomal compartments of immune cells (1Akira S. Uematsu S.

Binding of dsRNA to TLR3 triggers MyD88-independent signaling pathways, which activate two IKK-related kinases, Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKϵ (also called IKKi). The search for transcription factors activating the promoters of IFNA and IFNB genes led to the identification of IRF-3 and IRF-7, which have a critical role in the transcriptional activation of type I IFN genes (11Au W.C.

These cytoplasmic IRFs are specifically phosphorylated by TBK1 and IKKϵ, transported to the nucleus, and activate expression of type I IFN genes as well as certain IFN-induced genes (ISG) (16Paun A. Pitha P.M. Adv. Virus Res. 2007; 69: 1-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recognition of viral RNAs by cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I and MDA5 induces a distinct signaling cascade via the adapter IPS1 (also called MAVS, CARDif, and VISA), which also activates TBK1, IKKϵ, IRF-3, and IRF-7. In contrast, activation of the antiviral pathway by TLR7/8 or TLR9 is MyD88-dependent and requires IRAK1, IKKα, and TRAF6 but is independent of TBK1 and IKKϵ (17Uematsu S. Sato S. Yamamoto M.

Generation of mice deficient in TLRs, RIG-I, IRF-3, or IRF-7 has revealed that although pathogen recognition may be mediated by distinct cellular receptors and signaling pathways, all pathways converge on IRF-3 and IRF-7 (1Akira S.

Activation of IRF-3 is sufficient for the stimulation of the IFNB gene transcription, whereas activation of the IFNA genes depends on IRF-7 (12Juang Y.T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R.

The HuIRF-5 variant 4 (GenBank™ accession number AY_504947.1) is expressed primarily in dendritic cells (DC) and B cells and shows some properties that are distinct from IRF-3 and IRF-7. Unlike IRF-3 and -7, the IRF-5 polypeptide contains two nuclear localization signals, and consequently low levels of nuclear IRF-5 can be detected in the nucleus of uninfected cells (22Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Human IRF-5 is expressed in multiple spliced variants, and some of these are transcriptionally inactive and may function as dominant negative mutants (24Mancl M.E. Hu G. Sangster-Guity N.

The activation and nuclear transport of individual variants of HuIRF-5 also seems to be distinct (25Cheng T.F. Brzostek S. Ando O. Van Scoy S. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. J.

In conjunction with the observed in vitro antiviral effects of HuIRF-5, further evidence for the role of IRF-5 in IFNα synthesis has come from genetic studies of systemic lupus erythromatosis (SLE), which is characterized by a constitutive expression of IFNα/β. Three different functional variants of IRF-5 have now been identified with defined risk haplotypes for SLE (27Graham R.R. Kyogoku C. Sigurdsson S. Vlasova I.A. Davies L.R. Baechler E.C. Plenge R.M.

In vitro experiments have shown that in infected cells, HuIRF-5, like IRF-3 and IRF-7, is activated by phosphorylation, resulting in nuclear translocation and stimulation of IFNA gene expression (23Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The transcriptional signatures of IRF-5 and IRF-7 in NDV-infected cells were shown to be both overlapping and distinct (22Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Barnes B.J. Richards J. Mancl M. Hanash S. Beretta L. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45194-45207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). IRF-5 was found to specifically up-regulate early inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in addition to IFNα (29Barnes B.J. Richards J. Mancl M. Hanash S. Beretta L. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). Distinctions also exist between the activation of IRF-3 and IRF-5. The TLR3-TRIF pathway, which activates both IRF-3 and IRF-7 by TBK-1 and IKKϵ, does not activate IRF-5. However, both IRF-5 and IRF-7 are activated by MyD88-dependent pathways through a TRAF6- and IRAK1-dependent mechanism (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar, 31Schoenemeyer A. Barnes B.J. Mancl M.E. Latz E. Goutagny N. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald K.A. Golenbock D.T. J.

Initial analysis of the role of IRF-5 in the innate antiviral response in Irf5–/– mice showed impairment in the TLR9-mediated induction of IL-6 and TNFα in splenic DC. However, unlike pDCs from Irf7–/– mice, which are severely compromised in CpG-DNA-induced IFN responses, pDCs from Irf5–/– mice did not show any defect in the induction of IFNα (19Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 32Takaoka A. Yanai H. Kondo S. Duncan G. Negishi H. Mizutani T. Kano S. Honda K. Ohba Y. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The impairment of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-12p40 was not limited to TLR9-mediated induction but was also observed in the TLR4 and TLR3 responses of splenic macrophages; however, the induction of type I IFN in Irf5–/– cells in response to these inducers was not examined (32Takaoka A. Yanai H. Kondo S. Duncan G. Negishi H. Mizutani T. Kano S. Honda K. Ohba Y. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). A subsequent paper by the same group reported that Irf5–/– mice are highly sensitive to viral infection and show lower levels of type I IFN in the serum. IFN production was also impaired in infected macrophages, whereas no decrease was seen in Irf5–/– MEFs (33Yanai H. Chen H.M. Inuzuka T. Kondo S. Mak T.W. Takaoka A. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for human IRF-5 v4 (30Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar), MuIRF-5 was also shown to play a role in apoptosis and tumorigenicity in nude mice (34Couzinet A. Tamura K. Chen H.M. Nishimura K. Wang Z. Morishita Y. Takeda K. Yagita H. Yanai H. Taniguchi T. Tamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 2556-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent observations have shown that IRF-5 and TLR7 play a role in IFNα induction by RNA-containing immune complexes present in the sera of SLE patients (35Yasuda K. Richez C. Maciaszek J.W. Agrawal N. Akira S. Marshak-Rothstein A. Rifkin I.R. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6876-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Yasuda et al. (35Yasuda K. Richez C. Maciaszek J.W. Agrawal N. Akira S. Marshak-Rothstein A. Rifkin I.R. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6876-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) stimulated a mixture of cDC and pDC derived from the bone marrow of C57BL/6J and Irf5–/– mice with IgG from lupus sera, the TLR9 ligand CpG-A, or the TLR7 ligand R848 and show that production of IFNα and IL-6 was largely abolished in Irf5–/– cells, a result that is in contrast to the report by Takaoka et al. (32Takaoka A. Yanai H. Kondo S. Duncan G. Negishi H. Mizutani T. Kano S. Honda K. Ohba Y. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). This study was initiated to clarify the apparent contradictions between the role of HuIRF-5 in the antiviral response (in particular the type I IFN response) in vitro and MuIRF-5 in vivo. To this effect, we have identified and characterized the IRF-5 transcripts expressed in C57BL/6J mice and determined the functional properties of MuIRF-5 in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that unlike HuIRF-5, which is expressed in multiple spliced variants, MuIRF-5 is expressed as a single major transcript. Low levels of a single spliced MuIRF-5 containing a 288-nucleotide deletion were detected only in the bone marrow of C57BL/6J mice. MuIRF-5 enhanced the NDV-induced transcriptional activation of the IFNA4 and IFNB promoters. TBK1- and MyD88-activated IRF-5 binds to the IFNA4 promoter and regulates transcription of both type I IFN genes and inflammatory cytokines. The role of IRF-5 in the antiviral response was also demonstrated in vivo; serum levels of type I IFN and TNFα were significantly lower in NDV-infected Irf5–/– mice than in the C57BL/6J mice, which is in agreement with the published data on VSV and HSV-1-infected Irf5–/– mice (33Yanai H. Chen H.M. Inuzuka T. Kondo S. Mak T.W. Takaoka A. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). IRF-5 plays an important role for NDV- and TLR7-induced TNFα production in peritoneal macrophages but not in bone marrow-derived macrophages and is not involved in type I IFN production in these cells. In contrast, IRF-5 is critical for TLR-mediated TNFα production in CD11c+ DC and for TLR9-mediated IFNα induction. Altogether, our data clearly reveal the importance of IRF-5 in antiviral and inflammatory responses to NDV and the TLR7 and TLR9 MyD88-mediated antiviral pathway.

Peritoneal and Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages, Splenic DC Preparations—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated by adherence following peritoneal lavage 72 h after intraperitoneal injection of sterile thioglycolate solution (REMEL), seeded in RPMI 1640 medium (10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and gentamicin), and infected with 50 HAU of NDV for the indicated times. Medium was collected, and cytokines were assayed as described above. For bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), bone marrow was flushed out of the femurs of WT and Irf5–/– mice with RPMI 1640 medium (10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 5% horse serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate), and the macrophages were seeded into Petri dishes. For maintenance of the BMDM in culture RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with 20% of supernatant taken from L929 cells (which produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Splenic CD11c+ DC were isolated by positive selection using anti-CD11c MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec). For experiments cells were plated onto 6- or 96-well plates at a plating density of 2 × 106 or 2 × 104 per well, respectively. RT, PCR, Quantitative PCR, and Sequencing—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen).

The specificity of amplification was assessed for each sample by melting curve analysis, and the size of the amplicon was checked by electrophoresis. PCR efficiency was calculated for each RNA with 10-fold dilutions of the cDNA with the formula E = 10–/slope–1 as described previously (39Rutledge R.G. Cote C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative quantification was performed using standard curve analysis. All gene expression data were normalized with β-actin and are presented as a ratio of gene copy number per 100 copies of β-actin ± S.D. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with indicated expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For luciferase assay, 293T cells (2 × 105 cells/well on a 96-well plate) were transfected with 10 ng/well Renilla luciferase plasmid, 40 or 50 ng of cytokine reporter constructs, and 0–100 ng of MyD88, TBK1, IRF-5, IRF-3, and IRF-7 plasmids. Empty vector DNA was used to keep the total amount of transfected DNA constant (250 ng/well of a 96-well plate). Where required, 16–18 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with NDV for 16 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized against Renilla luciferase activity. Native and SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—For the dimerization studies, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids, and where indicated, 18 h after transfection cells were stimulated with NDV for 6 h prior to lysis. Lysates (20 μg) were analyzed on native (nondenaturing) gels as described (40Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Mori W. Shiota K. Okabe Y. Namiki H. Fujita T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and detected by immune blotting as described below. For SDS-PAGE, 10–20 μg of total proteins was resolved on 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% dry skim milk powder in TBST before overnight incubation with anti-mouse IRF-5 (generated in rabbits against the VRFPSPEDIPSDKWR peptide by Affinity BioReagents), IRF-3, and β-actin antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membranes were subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and immunodetection was visualized by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography on HyBlot CL film (Denville Scientific). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—This assay was performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously, (11Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41629-41637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); for full details see supplemental material. The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR with promoter-specific primers for 30 cycles. IFNA4 (5′-TACGTTTGAGCCCAAGGTAGAC and 3′-GGCTGTGGGTTTGAGTCTTCTC), and IFNB (5′-AAAGGTACCTCACAGAGACCCTCTCCCAC and 3′-AAAAAGCTTGCTGGAAGCCAGGCTGGTGT). Purification of Polyhistidine-tagged IRF-5 Using Probond Nickel-chelating Resin—293T cells (5 × 107) were transfected with a combination of expression plasmids for 24 h. Cells were then harvested, and His-tagged IRF-5 and associated proteins were purified using Ni2+ ProBind resin beads (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions; for full details see supplemental material. Eluted proteins were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in loading buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Characterization of IRF-5 Transcripts in Inbred Strains of Mice—We have shown previously that HuIRF-5 is expressed as a number of spliced variants in established cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with most of the deletions localized in exon 6 (24Mancl M.E.

In transient transfection assays only IRF-5 variant 4 (v4) was able to effectively stimulate transcriptional activity of IFNA and IFNB promoters. Two IRF-5 variants, v9, which encodes only the DNA binding peptide-(1–157) and v7-(110–389), encoding a truncated protein, could potentially serve as dominant negative mutants and interfere with endogenous IRF-5 activity (24Mancl M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2068928743,"Spatial organization of cellular proteins plays an important role in establishment of cellular polarity to regulate cell division, differentiation, migration, and organogenesis. Activation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) results in the formation of an immunological synapse (IS), assembly of a signaling scaffold at the T cell receptor (TCR) contact, cytoskeletal reorganization, and generation of second messengers within the first hours following intercellular contact. We demonstrate here that Crtam (class-I MHC-restricted T-cell associated molecule), an immunoglobulin-superfamily transmembrane protein, coordinates a signaling complex anchored by the Scrib polarity protein to establish a later phase of T cell polarity on a subset of CD4+ T cells >6 hours following activation. Maintenance of this late cellular polarity results in the ability of CD4+Crtam+ T cells to selectively produce more IFNγ and IL22. Crtam engagement thus modulates signals many hours beyond the initial activation event and dynamically influences the adaptive immune response."

We showed that the solute-binding protein of a putative ATP-binding cassette-type transporter encoded in the cluster crystallizes only in the presence of LNB or GNB, and therefore we named it GNB/LNB-binding protein (GL-BP). Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements revealed that GL-BP specifically binds LNB and GNB with Kd values of 0.087 and 0.010 μm, respectively, and the binding process is enthalpy-driven. The crystal structures of GL-BP complexed with LNB, GNB, and lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) were determined. The interactions between GL-BP and the disaccharide ligands mainly occurred through water-mediated hydrogen bonds. In comparison with the LNB complex, one additional hydrogen bond was found in the GNB complex. These structural characteristics of ligand binding are in agreement with the thermodynamic properties. The overall structure of GL-BP was similar to that of maltose-binding protein; however, the mode of ligand binding and the thermodynamic properties of these proteins were significantly different.

Bifidobacteria are Gram-positive anaerobes naturally present in the dominant colonic microbiota and have been considered to be beneficial for human health. As probiotic agents, Bifidobacteria can prevent or alleviate infectious diarrhea through their effects on the immune system and promote the host resistance to colonization by pathogens (1Picard C. Fioramonti J. Francois A. Robinson T. Neant F. Matuchansky C. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 22: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Carbon source compounds, including oligofructose, inulin, and raffinose, are used as food additives (prebiotics) to selectively promote the growth of Bifidobacteria in the gut (2Gibson G.R. Beatty E.R. Wang X. Cummings J.H. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 3Gibson G.R. Roberfroid M.B. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5648) Google Scholar). Bifidobacteria predominate the intestinal flora of breastfed infants (4Benno Y. Sawada K. Mitsuoka T. Microbiol.

(1989) in Biochemistry and Physiology of Bifidobacteria (Bezkorovainy, A., and Miller-Catchpole, R., eds) pp. 29-72, CRC Press, Cleveland, OHGoogle Scholar). It has been widely accepted that oligosaccharides other than lactose in human milk (human milk oligosaccharides, HMOs) 4The abbreviations used are: HMOs, human milk oligosaccharides; LNB, lacto-N-biose I; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; LNT, lacto-N-tetraose; GNB, galacto-N-biose; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; SBP, solute-binding protein; GL-BP, galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I-binding protein; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MBP, maltose- or maltodextrin-binding protein; CUT1 family, carbohydrate uptake transporter-1 family; ABP, l-arabinose-binding protein; ABL, lectin from Agaricus bisporus; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. play a key role in the growth of Bifidobacteria in the gut (7Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 8Newburg, D. S., and Neubauer, S. H. (1995) in Handbook of Milk Composition (Jensen, R. G., ed) pp. 273-349, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar). However, it remains unknown what structure, in HMOs, constitutes the bifidus factor responsible for increasing the bifidobacterial population. Human milk is reported to contain more than 100 kinds of oligosaccharides, the building blocks of which are the following three basic core disaccharides: lactose (Galβ1–4Glc), lacto-N-biose I (LNB; Galβ1–3GlcNAc), and N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc; Galβ1–4GlcNAc). These oligosaccharides are often modified by sialic acid and/or l-fucose (7Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT; Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc), which is formed by a β1–3 linkage between LNB and lactose, and fucosylated derivative (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) are the major components of HMOs (9Kobata A. Yamashita K. Tachibana Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 50: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Haeuw-Fievre S. Wieruszeski J.M. Plancke Y. Michalski J.C. Montreuil J. Strecker G. Eur. J.

Prieto P.A. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2000; 30: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that Bifidobacterium longum JCM1217 has a unique metabolic pathway specific for LNB and galacto-N-biose (GNB, Galβ1–3GalNAc), and we presented the hypothesis that the LNB residue in HMOs is the bifidus factor in breastfed infants (12Kitaoka M. Tian J. Nishimoto M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because GNB is the common O-glycan core structure in animal glycoproteins, such as mucin in the human intestine, this novel LNB/GNB metabolic pathway is considered to be related to intestinal colonization (12Kitaoka M. Tian J. Nishimoto M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The two similar disaccharides, LNB and GNB, are important core structures of oligosaccharides in cell surface glycoconjugates, and most cancer-associated antigens have structures related to them (13Magnani J.L. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Ginsburg V. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5489-5492PubMed Google Scholar, 14Springer G.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 15Springer G.F. Desai P.R. Wise W. Carlstedt S.C. Tegtmeyer H. Stein R. Scanlon E.F. Immunol. Ser. 1990; 53: 587-612PubMed Google Scholar). LNB residues are found in the type 1 chains of blood group antigens and in some types of oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids. GNB is also called core 1 disaccharide or T-antigen disaccharide. Genes involved in the LNB/GNB metabolism of B. longum JCM1217 are homologs of the BL1638–1644 genes of B. longum NCC2705 (16Schell M.A. Karmirantzou M. Snel B. Vilanova D. Berger B. Pessi G. Zwahlen M.C. Desiere F. Bork P. Delley M. Pridmore R.D. Arigoni F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Among these, the product of BL1641 homolog (lnpA) has phosphorolytic activity specific for LNB and GNB (12Kitaoka M. Tian J. Nishimoto M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and three downstream genes (BL1642–1644 homologs; lnpB, lnpC, and lnpD) have also been confirmed to encode catalytic enzymes involved in the novel Leloir-like galactose pathway (17Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 6444-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the three upstream genes (BL1638–1640) are annotated as ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type sugar transporters, and BL1638 is a solute-binding protein (SBP). The bacterial ABC transporter system for uptake generally involves extracellular or periplasmic SBP that binds to substrates and delivers them to the membrane-associated transport complex (18Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The SBPs of Gram-positive bacteria are anchored to the outside of the cell by lipid groups (19Perego M. Higgins C.F. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20Wu, H. C. (1996) in Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology (Neidhardt, F. C., Curtiss, R., III, Ingraham, J. L., Lin, E. C. C., Low, K. B., Magasanik, B., Reznikoff, W. S., Riley, M., Schaechter, M., and Umbarger, H. E., eds) pp. 1005-1014, American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DCGoogle Scholar). BL1638 is also thought to be a membrane-anchored lipoprotein, because its primary structure contains a lipid-anchor signal sequence, GLAGCG. In the genome of B. longum NCC2705, there are 13 putative ABC transporter systems for the uptake of sugars (21Parche S. Amon J. Jankovic I. Rezzonico E. Beleut M. Barutcu H. Schendel I. Eddy M.P. Burkovski A. Arigoni F. Titgemeyer F. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 12: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, there are no reports on the three-dimensional structures of sugar transporters from Bifidobacteria and their substrate recognition mechanisms. Recently, we showed that the gene product of the BL1638 homolog from B. longum JCM1217 crystallizes only in the presence of LNB or GNB, and we named the protein galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I-binding protein (GL-BP) (22Wada J. Suzuki R. Fushinobu S. Kitaoka M. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Ashida H. Kumagai H. Katayama T. Yamamoto K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2007; 63: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that GL-BP specifically binds to GNB and LNB, and we reveal its thermodynamic character and the structural basis for its recognition. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Analysis—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed at 25 °C according to standard procedures using a VP-ITC system (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). First, the proteins were dialyzed extensively against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the ligands were dissolved in the same buffer to minimize the heat of dilution. To obtain the best experimental conditions, several preliminary titration experiments were performed by changing the concentrations of the protein and ligands. During each titration, a protein sample (4.76–50.0 μm) was stirred at 300 rpm in a 1.44-ml reaction cell. Then the sample was injected with 7.5–10-μl aliquots of a ligand (0.10–1.0 mm) 19–24 times at intervals of 360–420 s. The c values (c = n × protein concentration × Ka) were 110, 464, and 4.25 for LNB, GNB, and LNT, respectively. The integrated heat effect was analyzed by means of nonlinear regression using the MicroCal Origin (version 5.0) program. Data fitted by one set of sites yielded the association constant (Ka), the enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and the number of binding sites (n). The Gibbs energy change, ΔG0, and the entropy change, ΔS0, of the binding are calculated by ΔG0 =-RTlnKa and TΔS0 =ΔH -ΔG0, respectively, where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The enthalpy change, ΔH, determined from the calorimetry experiment, is assumed to be equal to the standard enthalpy change, ΔH0. Crystallography—Expression and purification of GL-BP and its co-crystallization with LNB or GNB were performed as reported previously (22Wada J. Suzuki R. Fushinobu S. Kitaoka M. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Ashida H. Kumagai H. Katayama T. Yamamoto K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2007; 63: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GL-BP in complex with LNT was prepared by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 10 mm LNT. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain B834 (DE3), and the protein was purified and crystallized under conditions similar to those for the native crystals with LNB. The x-ray diffraction data were collected using charge-coupled device cameras on the BL5A and BL17A stations of the Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan. The crystals were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure of GL-BP was determined by a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using a selenomethionine-substituted crystal. Twenty four selenium atoms were located, and initial phases were calculated using SOLVE/RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Initial structural model building was conducted using the program ARP/wARP (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), and the R-factor was improved to 20.4% after 50 cycles of calculation. Manual model rebuilding, introduction of water molecules, and refinement were achieved using Coot (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The molecules A and B (residues 37–437 and 36–437, respectively) were numbered based on the full-length gene encoding GL-BP. The clear electron densities corresponding to the ligand molecules (LNB, GNB, or LNT) were found in the Fobs - Fcalc maps around the sugar-binding sites of the two GL-BP molecules. In addition to the two ligand molecules, two MES molecules and seven zinc ions were added in the model of the LNB and GNB complex structures. In the LNT complex structures, in addition to two MES molecules, five zinc ions and three sodium ions were added based on the peak height and refined temperature factor.

The isotherms for binding with LNB (Fig. 1, left), GNB, and LNT (data not shown) exhibited normal sigmoidal titration curves, and the binding stoichiometry (n) was ∼1 in all cases. In contrast, no apparent heat pulse was observed for LacNAc (Fig. 1, right), lactose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine (data not shown). The binding affinity was the highest for GNB and relatively weak for LNB. The affinity for LNT was about 1000-fold weaker than that for GNB. For the three oligosaccharides tested here, the binding process was enthalpy-driven, with unfavorable entropy changes at 25 °C (TΔS < 0).TABLE 2Thermodynamics of binding of oligosaccharides to GL-BP measured by ITC at 298 KLigandKaΔG0ΔH–TΔS0ΔS0naNumber of binding sites on the protein×107 m–1kcal mol–1kcal mol–1kcal mol–1cal K–1 mol–1LNB1.15 ± 0.04bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit–9.65–32.9 ± 0.1bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit23.2–77.80.958 ± 0.002bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fitGNB9.74 ± 0.73bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit–10.9–40.6 ± 0.1bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit29.7–99.71.001 ± 0.002bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fitLNT0.00910 ± 0.00065bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit–6.8–19.2 ± 0.5bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit12.5–41.80.934 ± 0.018bThe standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fita Number of binding sites on the proteinb The standard errors of binding parameters were evaluated from a single fit Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of GL-BP—The structures of complexes of GL-BP with LNB, GNB, and LNT were determined at 1.85, 2.0, and 1.65 Å resolutions, respectively. All crystals contained two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, and the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values for C-α atoms between them were less than 0.34 Å in all complex structures. The protein construct used for crystallization consisted of 411 residues (amino acid residues 28–438). Amino acid residues of all structures were determined for the A chain 37–437 and the B chain 36–437; however, residues 409–411 of the B chain were missing, probably because of its flexibility. Hereafter, the descriptions will primarily focus on molecule A. As generally observed for other SBPs (31Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), the overall structure of GL-BP consists of two globular domains, N- and C-domains, linked by three hinge regions to form a bilobate structure (Fig. 2). The N-domain consists of six α-helices, and a mixed parallel and antiparallel β-sheet of five strands. The C-domain consists of 10 α-helices, a mixed β-sheet of five strands, and an antiparallel β-sheet of two strands. A homology search of GL-BP using the Dali server (32Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) revealed that GL-BP is very similar to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a related protein in the closed form, trehalose/maltose-binding protein from Thermococcus litoralis (Protein Data Bank code 1EU8; Z score = 34.2; r.m.s.d. for 376 C-α atoms = 3.3 Å) (33Diez J. Diederichs K. Greller G. Horlacher R. Boos W. Welte W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and MBP from E. coli complexed with maltotriose (Protein Data Bank code 4MBP; Z score = 33.1; r.m.s.d. for 350 C-α atoms = 3.1 Å) (34Quiocho F.A. Spurlino J.C. Rodseth L.E. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 997-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The ABC transporter system of MBP has been classified in the carbohydrate uptake transporter-1 (CUT1) family in the Transport Classification Data Base (35Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because the putative ABC transporter system of GL-BP (BL1638–1640) contains two separate transmembrane components expected to form a heterodimer, it will be also classified in the CUT1 family (36Schneider E. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GL-BP shows modest structural similarity (Dali Z scores > 10) with bacterial SBPs belonging to the SBP_bac_1 family of Pfam (37Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V.

Biol. 1997; 4: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interactions with GNB and LNB—The crystal structures of the LNB and GNB complexes were almost the same, and the r.m.s.d. values for C-α between these complexes were within 0.24 Å. Co-crystallized sugars were found in the middle of the N- and C-domains and are sequestered from solvent by these two lobes. The Fobs - Fcalc omit maps for LNB and GNB were clearly observed (Fig. 3, A and B). Superimposition of these complex structures revealed that LNB and GNB bound to GL-BP in a very similar manner (Fig. 4A). Two tryptophans, Trp278 and Trp257, form aromatic stacking interactions with the sugar rings of Gal and GlcNAc/GalNAc, respectively. Hydrogen bonds play a dominant role in ligand binding to GL-BP. The hydroxyl groups of ligands form direct hydrogen bonds with Arg49, Gln105, Asp154, Glu203, and Ser316 (supplemental Table). As a result, all hydroxyl groups of LNB or GNB form hydrogen bonds to waters and/or amino acid residues. In both the LNB and GNB complex structures, eight ordered water molecules mediating the hydrogen bonds between ligands and GL-BP protein were found. Therefore, the interactions between ligand and protein are mainly water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and this observation corresponded well with the thermodynamic character of ligand binding to GL-BP determined by ITC measurements. The favorable enthalpy change should arise mainly through the formation of hydrogen bonds, and the unfavorable entropy may be due to the confinement of the water molecules as well as loss of the free diffusion of ligand (43Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The sole structural difference between LNB and GNB is the epimer of the O-4 hydroxyl group in the reducing-end sugar; the former (GlcNAc) is equatorial; however, the latter (GalNAc) is axial. This causes the difference in conformation of the O-6 hydroxyl group in the same GlcNAc/GalNAc sugar ring. The O-6 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc in LNB is in the gauche-gauche orientation, which prevents steric hindrance with O-4. On the other hand, the O-6 hydroxyl group of GalNAc in GNB is in the trans-gauche orientation and forms a hydrogen bond with two water molecules, one of which also forms an inter-sugar bridging hydrogen bond with the O-6 hydroxyl group of Gal.FIGURE 4Comparison of the complex structures of GL-BP. Carbohydrates are shown with thicker sticks than proteins. A, superimposition of the LNB (blue) and GNB (green) complex structures. The axial O-4 hydroxyl group of GalNAc of GNB forms an additional hydrogen bond with a water molecule (shown as a larger sphere), which is held by two hydrogen bonds from Arg49. B, superimposition of the LNB (blue) and LNT (yellow) complex structures. These structures are almost identical at the LNB portion. Because LNT has a bulky lactose portion at its reducing end, the loop region containing Ser83 and Lys85 residues of the LNT complex is slightly open compared with that of the LNB complex, to circumvent steric hindrance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The higher affinity of GNB to GL-BP compared with that of LNB can also be explained by comparing the structures of the complexes. In the case of the GNB complex, the axial O-4 hydroxyl group of GalNAc forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule, which is strongly held by two hydrogen bonds to the main chain O and N-η2 atoms of Arg49. In the case of the LNB complex, the equatorial O-4 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc does not contribute to the protein-sugar interaction. Instead, the O-6 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule, which is held by a single hydrogen bond to the main chain N atom of Ala84. In total, GL-BP forms an additional hydrogen bond with GNB compared with LNB, and this may result in a larger negative ΔH value, which is advantageous, with a difference of 7.7 kcal mol-1. Complex Structure with LNT—The Fobs - Fcalc omit map for LNT was clearly observed (Fig. 3C). The overall structure of the LNT complex is very similar to those of the disaccharide (LNB and GNB) complexes, and the r.m.s.d. values for C-α were less than 0.31 Å. The LNB portion of LNT overlaps considerably with the LNB molecule bound to the LNB complex structure (Fig. 4B). No stacking interactions were found in the lactose portion of the LNT; however, there are only two direct hydrogen bonds (supplemental Table). A slight displacement of the loop region containing Lys83–Ser85 residues was observed between the LNT and disaccharide complexes. In the LNB complex, a hydrogen bond between the N-ζ atom of Lys83 and O-γ atom of Ser85 blocks the entrance of the sugar-binding cleft. In contrast, the side chain of Lys83 in the LNT complex is directed to the opposite side, preventing steric hindrance with the lactose portion. As a result, the loop region in the LNT complex is shifted slightly upward, changing the protein to a relatively open state. The O-1 atom of GlcNAc in the LNT complex is also shifted slightly upward, and a hydrogen bond with Glu203 is broken. These results together indicate that specific binding interactions for LNT are not enforced compared with those for LNB, but the lactose portion of LNT might cause steric hindrance with the side chain of Lys83. Hence, the binding of LNT to GL-BP appears less stable than that to LNB, and this observation may explain the smaller enthalpy change on LNT binding compared with that on LNB binding, the difference being 13.7 kcal mol-1. In contrast, the entropic penalty on LNT binding was about 36.0 cal K-1 mol-1 smaller than that on LNB binding. The number of water molecules excluded from the cleft on LNT binding should be larger than that on LNB binding, because LNT has a bulky lactose portion. In the LNB complex, seven ordered water molecules were found in the area corresponding to the lactose portion of the LNT complex. Therefore, a larger solvent exclusion effect on LNT binding may reduce the entropic penalty. Comparison with the Other Solute-binding Proteins—Among the members of SBP_bac_1 family (Pfam), the structural characteristics of MBP from E. coli has been studied extensively (44Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the structures of MBP and related binding proteins (e.g. trehalose/maltose-binding protein and cyclo/maltodextrin-binding proteins) from other sources have also been determined (33Diez J.

We used isothermal titration calorimetry to identify the manganese binding sites in wild-type mouse PrP. The protein showed two manganese binding sites with affinities that would bind manganese at concentrations of 63 and 200 μm at pH 5.5. This indicates that PrP binds manganese with affinity similar to other known manganese-binding proteins. Further study indicated that the main manganese binding site is associated with His-95 in the so-called “fifth site” normally associated with copper binding. Additionally, it was shown that occupancy by copper does not prevent manganese binding. Under these conditions, manganese binding resulted in an altered conformation of PrP, displacement of copper, and altered redox chemistry of the metal-protein complex. Cyclic voltammetric measurements suggested a complex redox chemistry involving manganese bound to PrP, whereas copper-bound PrP was able to undergo fully reversible electron cycling. Additionally, manganese binding to PrP converted it to a form able to catalyze aggregation of metal-free PrP. These results further support the notion that manganese binding could cause a conformation change in PrP and trigger changes in the protein similar to those associated with prion disease.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). In particular, PrPc is highly expressed at neuronal synapses (2Sales N. Rodolfo K. Hassig R. Faucheux B. Di Giamberardino L. Moya K.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2464-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The function of the protein is still debated, but data have suggested a number of possible different roles, including an antioxidant, a copper transport protein, and involvement in cell adhesion or cell signaling (3Pauly P.C.

Although the role of the protein in normal cell activity is still being defined, it is widely agreed that conversion of PrPc to an abnormal isoform (PrPSc) plays a central role in the disease process of a family of disorders termed prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). These diseases include sporadic forms such as scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, inherited forms such as fatal familial insomnia and transmitted forms such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The majority of data clearly point to PrPc being a cuproprotein (7Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A.

As well as possible beneficial effects of copper binding, other data suggest that inappropriate interactions between copper and PrP result in the aggregation of the protein and increased proteinase K resistance (16Qin K. Yang D.S. Yang Y. Chishti M.A. Meng L.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Westaway D. J. Biol.

Other studies have shown that copper can enhance the infectivity of prions and that copper chelators extend the incubation period of the disease (18McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R.

This picture is further complicated by the fact that copper can also prevent prion fibrils from forming (20Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6776-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and increased copper in the diet can delay the onset of prion disease symptoms (21Hijazi N. Shaked Y. Rosenmann H.

The binding of manganese to PrP potentially results in the conversion of the protein to an abnormal isoform with properties reminiscent of PrPSc (8Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.-S.

Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In particular, manganese-bound PrP shows greater protease resistance (27Kim N.H. Choi J.K. Jeong B.H. Kim J.I. Kwon M.S. Carp R.I. Kim Y.S. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 783-785PubMed Google Scholar), increased β-sheet content, the ability to aggregate (28Giese A. Levin J. Bertsch U. Kretzschmar H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the ability to seed polymerization of further prion protein (26Abdelraheim S.R. Kralovicova S. Brown D.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These effects are observed in recombinant protein and protein expressed in cells (29Treiber C. Simons A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6674-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that substitution of copper with manganese could bring about changes in PrP, initiating prion disease (8Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.-S. Jones I.M. Clive C. Haswell S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Despite geochemical evidence that high environmental manganese coincides with some clustering of prion disease cases (30Ragnarsdottir K.V. Hawkins D.P. J. Geochem. Explor. 2005; 88: 228-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the cellular and biochemical effect of manganese on PrP, there is currently no evidence that exposure to increased levels of manganese is anything other than a potential risk factor for prion diseases. Despite the interest in manganese binding to PrP, a thorough analysis of the interaction of the metal with the protein has not appeared. In this study we examined the affinity of manganese for PrP and demonstrated that manganese can bind to PrP even while copper is still bound and induce a conformational change. The use of cyclic voltammetry indicated that three copper redox-active centers are displaced in manganese-charged PrP and that the metal-protein complex has an estimated reversible potential of +0.08 V. We showed that the main manganese binding center of the protein is associated with a histidine a position 95 in the mouse PrP sequence with an affinity equivalent to that of other known manganese-binding proteins. Unless stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Protein Purification—Recombinant mouse prion proteins were prepared as described previously (13Thompsett A.R. Abdelraheim S.R. Daniels M. Brown D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42750-42758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly bacterial expression was used to generate recombinant protein. Bacteria were transformed with a plasmid (pET) containing the open reading frame of wild-type mouse PrP (amino acid residues 23–231) or mutants of this construct. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and inclusion bodies were isolated from the bacteria with standard techniques. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in a buffer containing 8 m urea. Recombinant PrP was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The column was charged with copper, and the protein bound to the column was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in 8 m urea. All proteins were generated tag-free. 0.5 mm EDTA was added to the protein to chelate any metals present. All subsequent steps used double deionized water treated with Chelex resin to remove residual metal ions. The denatured protein was refolded by a 10-fold dilution of the urea in deionized water, the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration, and two rounds of dialysis were carried out to remove residual urea, imidazole, and EDTA. Protein concentrations were measured using theoretical extinction coefficients at 280 nm (ExPASy ProtParam tool) and confirmed by BCA assay. Protein purity was checked using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For some experiments recombinant proteins were charged with metal (either MnSO4 or CuSO4) during the refolding process. This results in saturation of the available metal binding sites with the metal. The method was as described previously (8Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.-S. Jones I.M. Clive C. Haswell S.J.

For some experiments PrP was treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) to block potential metal binding sites. As PrP contains seven histidine molecules, DEPC was incubated with PrP at a 10 m excess (in 50 mm Na2PO4, pH 6.8) to ensure that all histidine molecules were modified. Modification of histidine was monitored as increased absorbance at 245 nm. Once the reaction was complete excess DEPC was removed by dialysis. The mutant proteins used in this study were generated as described previously (13Thompsett A.R. Abdelraheim S.R. Daniels M. Brown D.R. J. Biol.

The mutant proteins used in this study include a deletion of N-terminal residues 23–89 (PrP90–231), deletion of residues 23–112 (PrP113–231), deletion of the octameric repeat region 51–89, and three mutants with alanine substituted for histidine at amino acid residues 95, 110, or both (H95A, H110A, and H95A/H110A). In addition two peptides were used for these experiments. The first was a 32-amino acid residue peptide based on the octameric repeat sequence (residues 51–89) as described previously (8Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.-S. Jones I.M. Clive C. Haswell S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) termed octarepeat (PHGGGWGQPHGGSWGQPHGGSWGQPHGGGWGQ). The second was a peptide with the sequence equivalent to amino acid residues 90–120 of the mouse PrP sequence (GGGTHNQWNKPSKPKTNLKHVAGAAAAGAVV). Both peptides were synthesized with modified N- and C-terminal residues to ensure no nonspecific metal interactions with terminal groups as described previously (32Brown D.R. Guantieri V. Grasso G. Impellizzeri G. Pappalardo G. Rizzarelli E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out as described previously (13Thompsett A.R. Abdelraheim S.R. Daniels M. Brown D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42750-42758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All measurements were made on a MicroCal VP-Isothermal Titration Calorimeter instrument. Briefly a time course of injections of metal to PrP was made in an enclosed reaction cell maintained at a constant temperature. The instrument measured the heat generated or absorbed as a ligand-macromolecule reaction occurred. A binding isotherm was fitted to the data, expressed in terms of heat change per mole of metal against metal to PrP molar ratio. From the binding isotherm values for the reaction stoichiometry and association constants (Ka) were obtained. All solutions were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and degassed prior to use. Typically an initial injection of 2 μl of metal solution was followed by a further 29 injections of 4 μl of metal solution into the protein in the sample cell stirred at 300 rpm. Injections were separated by 120 s to allow equilibration, and sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Data were analyzed with the Origin 5.0 software package from MicroCal. A baseline correction was applied to each experiment by subtraction of data from a series of injections of metal solution into a buffer blank correlating to the heat of dilution of the metal solution. After subtraction of the blank data a nonlinear least squares method was used to minimize χ2 values and obtain best fit parameters for the association constants. In all cases best fit parameters were obtained from the sequential binding site model whereby the user defines the number of binding sites to be fitted in a sequential manner. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—For analysis of protein samples by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy the samples were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml. The protein concentration was determined for the samples by first assessing the concentration of a metal-free PrP sample using a scan of the UV spectra with a Carey spectrophotometer (Varian) using an extinction coefficient of 63,495 m–1 cm–1. As metals can alter the UV absorbance of protein, a Bradford assay was used to assure that the metal-binding PrP samples were at the same concentration as apoPrP. CD spectra for apoPrP and metal-charged PrP were obtained using an Applied Photophysics Chirascan spectropolarimeter as described previously (31Cui T. Daniels M. Wong B.S. Li R. Sy M.S. Sassoon J. Brown D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein concentration and path length were used to equate the measured spectra and plotted in the form of molar ellipticity between 185 and 260 nm. Cyclic Voltammetry—Voltammetric measurements were conducted with a μ-Autolab III potentiostat system (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. Experiments were performed in staircase voltammetry mode with platinum gauze counter and saturated calomel reference electrode (REF401, Radiometer Analytical). The working electrodes used were 5-mm-diameter edge plane pyrolytic graphite (Pyrocarbon, Le Carbone, East Sussex, UK) or 3-mm-diameter boron-doped diamond (Windsor Scientific, Slough Berkshire, UK). Electrodes were polished on fresh cloths (Buehler, Coventry, UK) with alumina (1 μm; Buehler) as a polishing aid. After the final polish on a clean cloth, electrodes were rinsed with demineralized water. Aqueous solutions were thoroughly deaerated with nitrogen (BOC Industrial, Manchester, UK) prior to recording data. All measurements were undertaken at 25 ± 2 °C. For voltammetric measurements an aqueous buffer solution (5 mm MES at pH 7) was thoroughly deaerated with nitrogen. The working electrode was polished, and the background current was recorded in the absence of protein. Next the working electrode was immersed into the protein solution (containing 20 μm wild-type mouse PrP (WT-PrP) in MilliQ filtered water, pH 7) and after 60 s removed and rinsed with MilliQ filtered water, pH 7. The resulting protein-modified electrode was reimmersed into the pure buffer solution in the measurement cell, and cyclic voltammograms were recorded. Protein adhesion to the edge plane pyrolytic graphite and to the boron-doped diamond electrode surfaces was excellent, and stable signals were obtained for many potential cycles. Redox potentials were also determined with reference to the saturated calomel electrode (reference electrode). Aggregation Studies—Recombinant PrP was generated as described above and either refolded to bind manganese or refolded to bind copper. Some copper-refolded protein was exposed to manganese as described for ITC experiments. The basis for the experiment was the ability of the metal-charged protein to cause aggregation of monomeric, metal-free PrP as determined by a change in absorbance at 325 nm. Metal-free WT-PrP was prepared at 1 mg/ml in 1 mm MES, pH 6.5. 1 ml of this solution was placed into a cuvette, and 0.1 mg/ml seeding PrP (with bound metals) was added in 50 μl of 1 mm MES, pH 6.5. All measurements were performed using a Cary 100Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) at 325 nm using a quartz cuvette of 5-mm path length. Polymerization was observed as an increase in solution turbidity. The resultant scattering of UV light at 325 nm resulted in an increased absorbance measurement. Measurements were taken at 1–10-min intervals until no further change in absorbance was measured in all samples. Manganese Affinity for PrP and pH Dependence—We used ITC to study manganese binding to mouse PrP. WT-PrP was generated by expression in bacteria and isolated using an immobilized metal affinity chromatography technique. This protein consisted of the full-length mouse PrP lacking the signal and glycosylphosphatidylinositol signal peptides (PrP23–231). The purified protein was tag-free and dialyzed after treatment with EDTA to remove any trace metal contamination. Manganese was titrated into PrP at a variety of pH values to determine the affinity within the pH range of 4.5–8. ITC experiments showed strong isotherms for the binding of manganese (Fig. 1). Using a data fitting program, two sequential bindings sites were determined, and the affinity for each site was calculated. Two sites were identified at all pH values tested. Fig. 1 shows that the highest affinity of manganese for WT-PrP was observed at pH 5.5. At this pH the calculated dissociation constants for the two sites were 63 and 200 μm. These values lie within the expected range for manganese affinity. At pH 7.5 the dissociation constant values rose to 630 μm and ∼10 mm. At this pH it is unlikely that the second site would be occupied. Further experiments were carried out at pH 5.5. Previous studies have suggested that manganese binds to PrP in association with histidine residues. Proteins can be specifically modified by reaction of DEPC with the imidazole groups of histidines, blocking the ability to bind metals. To assess whether histidines were important to manganese binding, PrP was modified with DEPC, and ITC experiments were repeated at pH 5.5. As shown in Fig. 1B, no manganese binding to PrP was observed. This suggests that histidine residues play a central role in manganese binding to PrP and further supports the notion that manganese is a ligand for PrP. Identification of Manganese Binding Sites—To assess the location of the two manganese binding sites, mutant forms of PrP were also used in ITC experiments. Table 1 shows the results of the ITC experiments and includes the affinity values calculated. Only one of the mutants showed no binding of manganese. The mutant PrP113–231 lacks the N terminus of the protein. This indicates that both sites lie within the N terminus. Deletion of the N terminus up to residue 90 (i.e. PrP90–231) resulted in the loss of the low affinity binding site suggesting that the high affinity site lies between residues 90 and 112. Analysis of a mutant lacking only the octameric repeat region confirmed that the low affinity site lies within the octameric repeat. To confirm this we used two synthetic peptides corresponding to these two regions. The peptide 90–120 bound manganese with high affinity, an order of magnitude higher than for the wild-type protein PrP23–231. In comparison the affinity for the octarepeat peptide was very low, confirming work from previous studies (33Garnett A.P. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Affinity of manganese for PrP mutantsPrP mutantSite 1Site 2WT-PrP4.23.7PrP90-2314.2ND90-1205.3NDPrPΔ51-894.2NDPrP113-231NDNDH95AND3.9H110A4.23.6H95A/H110AND3.6OctapeptideND2.2 Open table in a new tab As studies with DEPC suggested that manganese binds to histidine in the protein and two histidines form the so-called “fifth site” for copper binding, we examined mutants lacking either or both of these histidines. The double mutant with alanine substituted at His-95 and His-110 lacked the high affinity site. This confirms that this site is the high affinity manganese binding site in PrP. Substitution of His-95 alone resulted in loss of the high affinity site, whereas substitution of His-110 did not (Table 1). This implies that His-95 is central to the high affinity manganese binding site of PrP. Metal Binding to Manganese-saturated PrP—To assess whether copper and manganese bind to equivalent sites in the protein we carried out experiments with manganese-saturated PrP. Following purification of PrP in the presence of 8 m urea, the protein was refolded to its native conformation in the presence of manganese. This results in occupation of all available manganese binding sites (8Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.-S. Jones I.M. Clive C. Haswell S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Protein purified in this way was subjected to ITC experiments with manganese. Manganese binding to manganese-saturated PrP resulted in one binding event (Fig. 2) with very low affinity (Table 2). Under the same conditions manganese-saturated H95A/H110A also showed binding at one site with the same affinity. Therefore this low affinity binding site (if physiologically relevant) is not at the fifth site but was associated with the octameric repeats.TABLE 2Affinity of copper and manganese for PrP when metal binding sites are occupiedProteinCopperManganeseWT-apoPrP10.5, 9.5, 8.2, 7.4See Table 1Copper-saturated WT-PrP—4.2, 2.3 PrP90-231—ND H95A—2.2 H110A—4.2, 2.1Manganese-saturated WT-PrP7.5, 6.32.2 PrP90-231NDND H95A7.5, 6.4— H110A6.4— H95A/H110A6.22.2 Open table in a new tab We also assessed copper binding to manganese-saturated PrP with ITC. Studies of copper binding to PrP at four sites at pH 5.5 indicate four binding sites with a range of affinities as shown in Table 2. However, when saturated with manganese, only two sites could be detected with ITC. This implies that manganese bound to PrP blocked copper binding at two sites at pH 5.5. The H95A mutant showed the same number of sites as the wild-type protein, but the H110A and H95A/H110A mutants showed the loss of the high affinity copper binding site. This implies that in manganese-saturated PrP copper can bind at His-110 and somewhere in the octameric repeat region. Despite this result the PrP90–231 mutant showed no binding of copper or manganese when first loaded with manganese during refolding. This would suggest that metal binding at the fifth site is different in the absence of the amino acid residues 23–89 that include the octameric repeat region. Manganese Binding to Copper-saturated PrP—It has been suggested previously that when manganese binds in place of copper it can alter the conformation of PrP. However, it has not been determined whether manganese can bind to PrP when it already binds copper. Manganese was titrated into PrP refolded in the presence of copper. The copper sites in PrP were filled with copper, but ITC experiments suggest that WT-PrP was still able to bind two atoms of manganese (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This result suggests that copper binding to PrP does not prevent manganese binding. In comparison the H95A mutant lacked the high affinity manganese site, whereas H110A did not. This implies that for copper-saturated PrP manganese is able to bind at the fifth site via His-95. Interestingly PrP90–231 saturated with copper showed no binding of manganese. This suggests that in the absence of the N terminus coordination of metal binding to the fifth site is altered. We used CD spectroscopy to look at changes in the secondary structure of PrP on binding of manganese to copper-saturated PrP. Fig. 4 shows typical CD spectra from WT-PrP. Freshly prepared copper- and manganese-saturated WT-PrP produced similar CD spectra characterized by a deep minimum between 210 and 225 nm indicative of α-helical content. In contrast WT-PrP saturated with copper with subsequent manganese binding resulted in an altered spectrum with reduced helical content. This suggests tha"

In the present study, we examined alterations in caveolin-1 expression during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the ability of caveolin-1 to alter cancer cell adhesion, an aspect of cell motility. We employed two EMT cell models, the human embryonic carcinoma cell line NT2/D1, and TGF-β1-treated NMuMG cells, which are derived from normal mouse mammary epithelia. Caveolin-1 expression was substantially up-regulated in both cell lines following the induction of EMT and was preceded by increased activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, two known tyrosine kinases involved in EMT. We hypothesized that caveolin-1 expression could be influenced by increased FAK phosphorylation, to which Src is a known contributor. Examination of FAK+/+ and FAK-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed that in cells devoid of FAK, caveolin-1 expression is strikingly diminished. Using FAK and superFAK constructs and the novel FAK inhibitor PF-228, we were able to demonstrate that indeed, FAK can regulate caveolin-1 expression. We also found that Src can contribute to increases in caveolin-1 expression, however, only in the presence of FAK. From the culmination of this data and our functional analyses, we conclude that caveolin-1 expression can be up-regulated during EMT, and further, once expressed, caveolin-1 can greatly influence cancer cell adhesion.

This suppressor/promoter discrepancy could be due to the examination of various cell types, cancer stages, variations in in vitro versus in vivo data, or an indicator that caveolin can serve different roles depending on the context in which its function is being examined. One trend that has more recently arisen, however, is that caveolin-1 is up-regulated in a number of metastatic cancers including prostate and lung, and consistent with this, we and others (18Beardsley A.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that occurs during embryonic development (as stem cells differentiate into various components of the organism) (22Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) and during cancer progression (as tumor cells gradually acquire a more motile phenotype). Cancer cells that undergo EMT, which entails an intricate series of changes in cell-cell contacts (23Peinado H. Portillo F. Cano A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), cell-matrix interactions, and cell signaling (24Huber M.A. Kraut N. Beug H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), can gain the ability to invade, extravasate, and potentially re-establish as a metastatic lesion in a lymph node or distant organ. The integrin and cadherin families of proteins demonstrate changes in expression during the process of EMT, and recently, a cross-regulation was described between these families via the small GTPase Rap1 (25Balzac F.

Correspondingly, increased activation of FAK and Src, both players in focal adhesion complexes, has been shown in tumor progression/metastasis, and this activation can greatly enhance cell invasion (26Avizienyte E.

Recently, FAK has also been implicated in the regulation of cadherins, with reports of FAK decreasing Rac1 activity and affecting N-cadherin adhesions (30Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kurokawa K. Hanks S.K. Matsuda M. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and FAK localizing to/aiding in the disruption of E-cadherin complexes (31Koenig A. Mueller C. Hasel C. Adler G. Menke A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4662-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is well documented that Src can contribute largely to the phosphorylation of FAK (32Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), hence making Src an important consideration on processes affected by FAK activity. Realizing the complexity of caveolin in cancer and the potential of caveolin-1 expression to change during EMT, we wanted to examine two EMT cell models, NT2/D1 and NMuMG, to examine if and in what cellular context (denoting potential sources of regulation) caveolin-1 expression is altered during EMT. Further, we wanted to determine the impact of caveolin-1 on aspects of cancer cell adhesion, because of the implicated role of caveolin in cell motility (18Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V.

The pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cell line NT2/D1 has the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types upon appropriate stimulation (35Duran C. Talley P.J. Walsh J. Pigott C.

It is well documented that the mouse mammary epithelial cells NMuMG undergo EMT upon treatment with TGF-β1 (38Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Prior to induction of EMT, the NT2/D1 and NMuMG cells display scant caveolin-1 protein expression, thus allowing us to readily examine any alterations in expression during the course of EMT. In our present study, both cell models employed demonstrated an up-regulation of caveolin-1 expression during EMT. Importantly, we found that both the presence and phosphorylation of FAK have a significant impact on caveolin-1 expression. The combination of our expression and functional data provide insight into the regulation of caveolin-1 expression during EMT and clues to the impact of this expression on aspects of cancer cell metastasis. Materials—Antibodies were purchased from the following sources: caveolin-1, FAK, and E-cadherin from BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA); paxillin, pY31-paxillin, pY397-FAK, pY861-FAK, and pY418-Src from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA); caveolin-1 and fibronectin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); actin (coumarin phallacidin) from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA); Src from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); ZO-1 and N-cadherin from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA); and GAPDH from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Concord, MA). Secondary antibodies and exposure reagents for Western blot analysis were purchased from Pierce. The transfection reagents Lipofectin and Oligofectamine were purchased from Invitrogen. All media and cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human embryonic carcinoma cell line NTERA2 cl. D1 (NT2/D1) and the control cell line 2102Ep were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 5 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG and human lung cancer cell line H1703 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured as recommended. FAK-/-, SYF-/-, and wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Caveolin-1 WT and KO MEFs were isolated and cultured by our laboratory as previously described (21Sun X.H. Flynn D.C. Castranova V. Millecchia L.L. Beardsley A.R. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7232-7241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All cell cultures were kept in 37 °C incubators maintained under 5% CO2. Induction of Differentiation—For NT2/D1 and control 2102Ep cells, EMT was induced by switching the culture media to a stimulatory media consisting of MCDB 131 supplemented with 20% newborn calf serum, 5% normal human serum, 0.05% bovine brain extract, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine. Induction of EMT in the NMuMG cells was accomplished by adding 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 to the normal growth media. Inhibitor Treatment—PF-573,228 (referred to as PF-228) is an inhibitor of FAK catalytic activity, as previously described (39Slack-Davis J.K. Martin K.H. Tilghman R.W. Iwanicki M. Ung E.J. Autry C.

Cell Transfection and Lysate Preparation—The FAK-GFP and superFAK constructs were gifts from Dr. Michael Schaller (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The active Src construct c-Src Y527F was a gift from Dr. Daniel Flynn (Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, Morgantown, WV). The WT caveolin-1 (21Sun X.H. Flynn D.C. Castranova V. Millecchia L.L. Beardsley A.R. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7232-7241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and caveolin-1 Y14F constructs were generated in our laboratory by utilizing the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Cells were transfected with 3 μg of the desired plasmid DNA using either Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) or the Amaxa biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD) nucleofection system, both according to the manufacturer's detailed instructions. Complete medium was placed on the cells following transfection or nucleofection recovery. Cav-1 or control siRNA (as used previously in our laboratory, Ref. 18Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was transfected into cells using oligofectamine. Cells were lysed by incubating cells with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1× phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor) for 25 min or used in assays as described. Wound Healing Scratch Assay—5 × 105 cells (see individual experiments for cell types and treatment conditions/controls) were seeded, allowed to form a confluent monolayer, and then wounded by scraping the monolayer with a pipette tip. The wound areas and in-migrated cells in each group were monitored for 10 h and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. Boyden Chamber Assay—H1703 cells were treated with control siRNA, caveolin-1 siRNA (18Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or mock treatment (oligofectamine only, Invitrogen). 48-h post-transfection, 5 × 103 cells of each group were resuspended in 0.5% fetal bovine serum/RPMI and subjected in quadruplicate to the upper chambers of the Boyden apparatus. The lower well of the Boyden chamber contained RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum. The polycarbonate membrane separating the upper and lower wells was coated in 10 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at room temperature prior to the experiment. Cells were allowed to migrate for 3.5 h. The membrane was then fixed, stained using hematoxylin, and mounted. Migrated cells were manually quantified. Western Blot and Densitometry Analysis—Boiled cell lysates were subjected to SDS/PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies as shown in the results. Bands were visualized using Super Signal West Pico Stable Peroxide and Luminol/Enhancer solutions (Pierce). Densitometry analysis of blots and corresponding GAPDH controls was performed using the Eagle Eye II apparatus and Eagle Sight software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All blots shown are representatives of experiments performed at least in duplicate. Real-time PCR Analysis—Primers compatible with the Roche Universal Probe system were designed for mouse cav-1 (forward: aacgacgacgtggtcaaga and reverse: cacagtgaaggtggtgaagc) and human cav-1 (forward: acagcccagggaaacctc and reverse: gatgggaacggtgtagagatg). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and converted into cDNA using the Promega Reverse Transcription System (Promega). RNA isolated from cav-1-/- MEFs served as an experimental negative control for mouse-derived samples. All samples were also run in duplicate with primer/probe pairs for either 18 S (mouse samples) or GAPDH (human samples), which served as a total loading control. Relative mRNA levels were determined by using the comparative Ct method, where the cav-1 target is normalized to the control and then compared with a reference sample (assigned a relative value of 1) by the equation: 2-ΔΔCt. Electric Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)—1 × 105 cells (see individual experiments for cell types and any additional treatment conditions) were seeded into fibronectin-coated wells of an 8 W10E ECIS chamber/electrode. Cell attachment and spreading were immediately analyzed using the ECIS1600R (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NJ) attachment program with data collection every 30 s at 4000 Hz for 3 h. Immunofluorescence, Confocal Microscopy, and Manual Cell Analysis—Cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (10 μg/ml in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) and fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100, washed, and nonspecific binding was blocked by application of 5% normal goat serum for 30 min. Following primary antibody incubation, cells were washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 30 min. Finally, slips were mounted using the anti-fade reagent Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Cells were imaged using a 40× water objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright microscope and images were captured via the Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal system (NIOSH, Morgantown, WV). Cell spreading area and number of focal adhesions were manually quantified using NIH Image J software. The Student's t test was used to analyze statistical significance, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered significant. Stimulated NT2/D1 and NMuMG Cells Both Undergo EMT— To investigate potential alterations in caveolin-1 expression during EMT, we employed two cell models, the human embryonic carcinoma cell line NT2/D1 and the mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG. The NT2/D1 cells have the potential to undergo EMT and be differentiated into a number of cell types, including neuronal-like cells in response to retinoic acid (42Lee V.M. Andrews P.W. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 514-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the changes occurring in the NT2/D1 cells using our stimulation method (see “Experimental Procedures”), we first immunofluorescently labeled unstimulated cells and cells that had been stimulated for 1 week for SSEA-4 and SSEA-1, markers for undifferentiated and differentiating human cells, respectively. The stimulated cells demonstrated a sizable loss of SSEA-4 and a gain in cytoplasmic SSEA-1 staining (data not shown), indicating that these cells are indeed differentiating following stimulation. The differentiating cells were next examined for evidence of EMT. The morphological differences seen between the undifferentiating and differentiating NT2/D1 cells included cell elongation and a decrease in cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1, A and B). A classically described signature of EMT is the down-regulation of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin and fibronectin (43Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the stimulated NT2/D1 cells revealed that E-cadherin expression was significantly suppressed 24 h post-stimulation, and scant E-cadherin expression remained at day 4 (Fig. 1C, top panel). In contrast, fibronectin, an EMT marker in some cell lines (43Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar), was barely expressed in the unstimulated NT2/D1 cells, but was substantially up-regulated as the cells differentiated (Fig. 1C). Further, N-cadherin was slightly up-regulated by day 4 (Fig. 1C). As E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and the junctional protein ZO-1 have been shown to not only alter their expression but also cellular localization during EMT (23Peinado H. Portillo F. Cano A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 44Polette M. Mestdagt M. Bindels S. Nawrocki-Raby B. Hunziker W. Foidart J.M. Birembaut P. Gilles C.

Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 46Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), we decided to immunofluorescently label the day 0 and day 4 NT2/D1 cells for these proteins to examine their staining patterns. Fig. 1G (top panels) shows that stimulation of the NT2/D1 cells causes a weakened fluorescence intensity and decrease in cell-cell junction localization of both E-cadherin and ZO-1. In contrast to this, N-cadherin staining intensity is enhanced in the stimulated NT2/D1 cells. Classically, cells that undergo EMT demonstrate enhanced motility and invasive capabilities (47Barrallo-Gimeno A. Nieto M.A. Development. 2005; 132: 3151-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). By using a scratch wound healing assay, we show that the stimulated NT2/D1 cells migrate more effectively and fill the wound-gaps up to 6-fold faster than that of the unstimulated cells (Fig. 1H). Day 0 and day 4 NT2/D1 cells were also subjected to collagen-based Transwell invasion assays, and the day 4 cells showed an acquired ability to invade compared with the day 0 cells, which were actually unable to invade (data not shown). Finally, we used real-time PCR analysis to examine Snail expression (a potent contributor to E-cadherin repression during EMT, Ref. 48Peinado H. Olmeda D. Cano A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) in day 0 to day 4 NT2/D1 cells and found that Snail mRNA was significantly up-regulated following stimulation of these cells (data not shown). TGF-β1 treatment of NMuMG cells is a well documented cell model to examine epithelial to mesenchymal transition (38Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 49Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol.

Treatment of cells with TGF-β1 has been shown to trigger cell motility (51Hojo M. Morimoto T. Maluccio M. Asano T. Morimoto K. Lagman M. Shimbo T. Suthanthiran M. Nature. 1999; 397: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 52Postlethwaite A.E. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. Kang A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), with TGF-β1 prompting NMuMG cells to switch from migrating as a slow moving sheet of cells to migrating more effectively as individual, mesenchymal-like cells (50Robson E.J. Khaled W.T. Abell K. Watson C.J. Differentiation. 2006; 74: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm the morphological and molecular changes in the NT2/D1 cells, we chose to examine EMT in the NMuMG cells. Fig. 1, D and E show the morphology differences seen in NMuMG cells that have been cultured in either normal growth media or growth media supplemented with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 4 days, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that TGF-β1 treatment increased N-cadherin expression and slightly decreased E-cadherin (Fig. 1F), as previously reported (53Shintani Y. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2963-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similar to the results seen in the NT2/D1 cells, past reports have also shown increases in fibronectin but no change in vimentin expression in TGF-β1-treated NMuMG cells (38Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Cro"
https://openalex.org/W1964162853,"Toward the end of mitosis, neighboring chromosomes gather closely to form a compact cluster. This is important for reassembling the nuclear envelope around the entire chromosome mass but not individual chromosomes. By analyzing mice and cultured cells lacking the expression of chromokinesin Kid/kinesin-10, we show that Kid localizes to the boundaries of anaphase and telophase chromosomes and contributes to the shortening of the anaphase chromosome mass along the spindle axis. Loss of Kid-mediated anaphase chromosome compaction often causes the formation of multinucleated cells, specifically at oocyte meiosis II and the first couple of mitoses leading to embryonic death. In contrast, neither male meiosis nor somatic mitosis after the morula-stage is affected by Kid deficiency. These data suggest that Kid-mediated anaphase/telophase chromosome compaction prevents formation of multinucleated cells. This protection is especially important during the very early stages of development, when the embryonic cells are rich in ooplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2018753611,"p97, an essential chaperone in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and organelle biogenesis, contains two AAA domains (D1 and D2) and assembles as a stable hexamer. We present a quantitative analysis of nucleotide binding to both D1 and D2 domains of p97, the first detailed study of nucleotide binding to both AAA domains for this type of AAA+ ATPase. We report that adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS) binds with similar affinity to D1 and D2, but ADP binds with higher affinity to D1 than D2, offering an explanation for the higher ATPase activity in D2. Stoichiometric measurements suggest that although both ADP and ATPgammaS can saturate all 6 nucleotide binding sites in D1, only 3-4 of the 6 D2 sites can bind ATPgammaS simultaneously. ATPgammaS binding triggers a downstream cooperative conformational change of at least three monomers, which involves conserved arginine fingers and is necessary for ATP hydrolysis."

We demonstrate in this study, using a highly purified LH1-reaction center complex, that the LH1 Qy transition is strongly dependent on metal cations and Ca2+ is involved in the unusual red shift. Removal of the Ca2+ resulted in formation of a species with the LH1 Qy absorption at 880 nm, and addition of the Ca2+ to the 880-nm species recovered the native 915-nm form. Interchange between the two forms is fully reversible. Based on spectroscopic and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses, the Ca2+ binding to the LH1 complex was estimated to occur in a stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+/αβ-subunit = 1:1 and the binding constant was in 105 m-1 order of magnitude, which is comparable with those for EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins. Despite the high affinity, conformational changes in the LH1 complex upon Ca2+ binding were small and occurred slowly, with a typical time constant of ∼6 min. Replacement of the Ca2+ with other metal cations caused blue shifts of the Qy bands depending on the property of the cations, indicating that the binding site is highly selective. Based on the amino acid sequences of the LH1 complex, possible Ca2+-binding sites are proposed that consist of several acidic amino acid residues near the membrane interfaces of the C-terminal region of the α-polypeptide and the N-terminal region of the β-polypeptide.

The symmetry issue needs to be taken into account when addressing the possible contacting sites between the LH1 and RC and the factors determining the specific orientation of RC inside the LH1 ring. The crystallographic structure of the LH1-RC complex from Rhodopseudomonas (Rps.) palustris at 4.8 Å resolution shows a slightly elliptical LH1 ring composed of 15 pairs of the αβ-polypeptides with a gap that is associated with an unknown protein W and is proposed to be adjacent to the ubiquinone-binding site in RC (17Roszak A.W. Howard T.D. Southall J. Gardiner A.T. Law C.J. Isaac N.W. Cogdell R.J. Science. 2003; 302: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). However, to gain insight into a more detailed picture of the configuration of LH1-RC, structural information at higher resolutions is required. Recently, the LH1-RC complex from Tch. tepidum has been crystallized (21Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have shown that the purified LH1-RC complex of Tch. tepidum is extremely stable (21Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Kobayashi M. Fujioka Y. Mori T. Terashima M. Suzuki H. Shimada Y. Saito T. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Besides the thermal stability, another striking feature is the unusual red shift of the Qy transition of the LH1 complex. Although the core complex contains only a-type bacteriochlorophyll (BChl), the same as those found in most other purple bacteria, spectroscopically the LH1 complex of Tch. tepidum exhibits a Qy absorption at 915 nm, ∼35 nm red-shifted from those of its mesophilic counterparts. The reason for this red shift has been unclear (2Madigan M.T. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Two other LH1 complexes from purple bacteria strain 970 and Roseospirillum parvum 930I were reported to exhibit Qy absorptions at 963 nm (23Permentier H.P. Neerken S. Overmann J. Amesz J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and 909 nm (24Glaeser J. Overmann J. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Tuschat C. Beatty J.T. Overmann J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 81: 181-199Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), respectively. The large red shifts were explained in terms of enhanced exciton interaction among the BChl a molecules and specific interactions between BChl a and LH1 polypeptides. Recent studies on the LH complexes show that small differences in the primary structure of the apoproteins can alter the spectroscopic properties (12McLuskey K. Prince S.M. Cogdell R.J. Isaac N.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8783-8789Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Fowler G.J.S. Visschers R.W. Grief G.G. van Grondelle R. Hunter C.N.

Res. 2002; 74: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The hydrogen-bonding pattern and local environment were shown to have an effect on the conformation of the coupled BChl a molecules, and small changes in the conformation could result in a significant shift of the Qy transition. In a preliminary study, we found that the LH1 Qy absorption of Tch. tepidum core complex appeared to be affected by various cations used in the experiment (6Fathir I. Ashikaga M. Tanaka K. Katano T. Nirasawa T. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 58: 193-202Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the LH1-RC samples used in the previous work were partially damaged, and the LH2 along with other two unknown proteins were not completely removed. We demonstrate in the present work using highly purified samples that the calcium ions are strongly involved in the unusual red shift of the LH1 Qy transition. A species with absorption maximum at 880 nm can be obtained from the LH1 915-nm complex by removing the Ca2+, and the native LH1 915-nm form (B915) can be recovered from the 880-nm species (B880) by addition of Ca2+. Interchange between the two forms is reversible. Effects of the Ca2+ on the properties of the LH1-RC complex from Tch. tepidum were analyzed by absorption, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analyses. The Ca2+ binding constants were estimated both spectroscopically and thermodynamically. The rates of conformational changes upon the Ca2+ binding were calculated from a pseudo first-order kinetics analysis. By comparison of the amino acid sequences of LH1 complexes, possible Ca2+-binding sites have been proposed. The Ca2+-dependent spectral behavior of the LH1 complex has not been reported for other purple photosynthetic bacteria and is of great interest and significance in understanding the structural and functional roles of Ca2+ in this thermophilic organism. Sample Preparation—Cells from Tch. tepidum were cultured anaerobically at 48 °C for 7 days as described previously (7Wang Z.-Y. Shimonaga M. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 78: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isolation and purification followed the same procedure described before (21Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) was used as detergent in solubilization and chromatography. The harvested cells were disrupted by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.5. Chromatophores were first treated with 0.35% (w/v) lauryldimethylamine N-oxide at 25 °C for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was further treated with 1.0% (w/v) OG and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min to extract the LH1-RC components. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE anion-exchange column (Toyopearl 650S; Tosoh Corp.) equilibrated at 4 °C with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.8% (w/v) OG. The LH1-RC fraction was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 50 to 125 mm, and peak fractions with a ratio of A915/A280 over 2.10 were collected. The native LH1-RC complex was passed through a size exclusion column (Sephadex G25M PD10; GE Healthcare) to remove excess salts, followed by incubation at 0 °C for 3 h in darkness in the presence of 1.25 mm EDTA. The sample solution was extensively washed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.8% (w/v) OG to remove excess of EDTA. The final concentration of EDTA in the solution was estimated to be lower than 1 nm. The resulting core complex showed an LH1 Qy absorption maximum ∼880 nm. To examine the effects of metal cations, the B880 sample was incubated at 0 °C overnight after adding various metal cations. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis was conducted by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g and 4 °C for 12 h under a 10–40% (w/v) continuous gradient of sucrose concentration in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.7% (w/v) OG in the presence or absence of 1 mm EDTA. Spectroscopic Measurements—Absorption spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Kinetic analysis for the recovering process from B880 to B915 upon the addition of Ca2+ was performed by monitoring the increase of the absorbance at 937 nm. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720w spectropolarimeter in the ranges of 200 to 300 and 400 to 1000 nm. The measurements were conducted under the conditions of 20 nm/min of scan speed, 1.0 nm bandwidth, and 2 s of response time. For the CD measurement between 200 and 300 nm, data were averaged over 10 scans in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, while for the measurements between 400 and 1000 nm the spectra were obtained from one scan. The molar extinction coefficient of BChl a dimer in a native αβ-subunit was estimated to be 270 mm-1 cm-1 by extracting BChl a molecules from purified LH1-RC complexes with acetone/methanol (7/2, v/v) and using ϵ770 = 76 mm-1 cm-1 for the monomeric BChl a (30Clayton R.K. Clayton B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5583-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ITC—ITC measurements were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 25 °C. The LH1-RC samples were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.7% OG at 250 μm. Following thermal equilibration at 25 °C, a total of 14 injections of 50 mm CaCl2 dissolved in the same buffer were made in 1-μl aliquots into the cell from the syringe using a 300-rpm stirring speed. An injection delay of 10 min was utilized to allow for the baseline to return after each injection. The titration data were deconvoluted based on a binding model containing either one or two sets of noninteracting binding sites by a nonlinear least squares minimization method (31Schwarz F.P. Puri K.D. Bhat R.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) performed using the MicroCal Origin ITC software. First we confirmed the effect of various metal cations on the absorption spectrum using highly purified LH1-RC complex from the Tch. tepidum (supplemental Fig. S1). The native core complex (B915) exhibited LH1 Qy absorption at 914 nm as reported previously (21Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Qy band was retained at the original position only in the presence of Ca2+ and blue-shifted by the addition of other cations. The results indicate that the native LH1 form of the Tch. tepidum is sensitive to the coexisting metal cations. To investigate whether the B915 species is bound to metal ions, metal chelators were employed. Fig. 1 shows an absorption spectrum obtained with the addition of EDTA to the B915 species. The LH1 Qy band was largely blue-shifted to 876 nm with a spectral shape similar to those observed for the LH1 complexes from other purple bacteria. This clearly indicated that metal ions are involved in the formation of the B915 and removal of the cation by EDTA results in a conformational change of the BChl a molecules in the LH1 complex, leading to a large blue shift of the LH1 Qy band. Similar results were observed using different metal chelators, nitrilotriacetic acid and ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (tetrasodium salt), suggesting that the blue shift was not caused by the specific interaction between EDTA and the core complex. We further investigated the effects of various cations on the EDTA-treated LH1-RC complex (B880). Typical results on the divalent cations are shown in Fig. 1, and the results for monovalent cations are provided in supplemental Fig. S2. Red shifts with respect to the LH1 Qy band (876 nm) of the B880 species were observed with additions of all cations. Among the divalent cations tested, only Ca2+ gave an absorption spectrum closely resembling that of native B915 species with the LH1 Qy absorption maximum at 913.5 nm. Addition of other cations resulted in small red shifts of the LH1 Qy band to 885–889 nm for the divalent cations and 879–884 nm for the monovalent cations, respectively. The results strongly suggest that the B915 species is induced from the B880 species by the binding of Ca2+ to the LH1 complex. The binding property of Ca2+ was examined over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of the EDTA-treated core complex in the presence of Ca2+ at various concentrations. By increasing the Ca2+ concentration, the B915 species was formed accompanied by a decrease of the B880 species. There was an isosbestic point at 895 nm, indicating that the B915 recovered from the B880 upon the addition of Ca2+. The Ca2+-dependent LH1 Qy shifts were plotted in the inset as a function of the Ca2+ concentration, revealing a sigmoid curve that saturated ∼50 μm Ca2+. Kinetics of the Ca2+ binding process at room temperature (25 °C) was analyzed using the pseudo first-order model. Formation of the B915 species was monitored at 937 nm where we can observe the maximum change in the intensity. Fig. 3 shows the time profile of the absorption change (ΔA) after addition of 5 mm Ca2+ to the B880 species of 7 μm LH1 subunit. The absorbance at 937 nm increased with time and reached maximum in ∼30 min. Because the concentration of Ca2+ was much higher than that of the B880 species, the binding process can be represented by a pseudo first-order kinetics model. The time-dependent absorption change ΔA(t) can be expressed by the first-order rate equation as shown in Equation 1, ΔA(t)=ΔA×[1−exp(−k×t)]([Eq. 1]) where ΔA is the final change of absorbance at 937 nm, k is the rate constant for the conformational change of the LH1 complex upon the Ca2+ binding, and t is the time in minutes after the addition of Ca2+. By a least-square fitting of the data using Equation 1, the rise rate constant k of B915 was determined to be 0.20 min-1. This value did not change very much over a range of 2.5 to 100 mm of the Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 3, inset), suggesting that the pseudo first-order kinetic analysis is valid and the conformational changes from B880 to B915 upon the Ca2+ binding occur slowly under the experimental conditions.FIGURE 3Time profile of the absorption change at 937 nm after addition of 5 mm Ca2+ to the B880 complex of Tch. tepidum. Concentration of the LH1 subunit was 7 μm, and the measurement was conducted at 25 °C. The dotted line was obtained by pseudo first-order kinetic analysis using Equation 1. Inset, a plot of apparent rate constants at different Ca2+ concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding affinity of Ca2+ to B880 was evaluated by a nonlinear least-square fitting of the spectroscopic data. Fig. 4 shows the plots of ΔA at several wavelengths between 930 and 960 nm as a function of the Ca2+ concentration. These wavelengths were selected so as to minimize contribution from the RC that has absorption over 750–950 nm. Assuming that one LH1 subunit of the B880 species binds to one Ca2+ to form one subunit of the B915 species, the absorption changes ΔA observed can be expressed by Equation 2 (see supplemental data for details), ΔA=l×(ϵ915−ϵ880)×[(1+C0K+Kx)([Eq. 2]) −{(1+C0K+Kx) 2−4C0K2x} 0.5]/2K where l is the light path length, ϵ915 and ϵ880 are molar extinction coefficients of the LH1 subunit in the B915 and B880 forms, respectively, C0 is the initial concentration of subunit of the B880 species, K is the Ca2+ binding constant, and x is the concentration of Ca2+. By using the nonlinear least-square fitting of ΔA, the Ca2+ binding constant K was estimated to be 6.5 (±0.3) × 105 m-1. Fig. 4 shows a good agreement between the calculated result and the spectroscopic data. The value of the binding constant is comparable with those reported for typical EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (32Ogawa Y. Tanokura M. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The binding properties of Ca2+ to the LH1 complex were further examined by thermodynamic analysis. Fig. 5A shows the ITC profile obtained with titration of Ca2+ to the B880 species. Large exothermic change was observed for each injection, providing independent evidence for the strong Ca2+ binding. A remarkable feature in the thermogram is that each exothermic signal clearly revealed a two-phase change: a rapid return immediately after the injection and a slow recovery, as shown typically in the inset of Fig. 5A. The two exothermic components can be interpreted in terms of a fast Ca2+ binding to the B880 and a slow process of conformational rearrangement within the core complex, respectively. Based on a two-component analysis, the time constants were determined to be 20 and 369 s for the fast and slow processes, respectively. The latter is quite consistent with the rate constant observed from spectroscopic measurement (Fig. 3). Fig. 5B shows a plot of the integrated heat/mol of injectant (Ca2+) as a function of the molar ratio of Ca2+/(B880 subunit). The plot exhibited a sigmoid-like curve with a stoichiometrically equivalent point ∼1.0, suggesting that the Ca2+ binding phenomenon can be described by a simple one-site model. From the model analysis, several thermodynamic parameters were obtained: the number of binding site/subunit n = 0.97, the binding constant K = 9.6 × 104 m-1, and enthalpy change ΔH =-4.0 kcal mol-1. Using these values, the changes of Gibbs free energy ΔG and entropy ΔS were evaluated to be -6.8 kcal mol-1 and 9.36 cal mol-1 K-1, respectively, from Equation 3, ΔG=ΔH-TΔS=-nRTlnK([Eq. 3]) where T is the absolute temperature, n is the mole number, and R is the gas constant, 8.315 J mol-1 K-1. These thermodynamic parameters indicate that the Ca2+-binding site has a high affinity with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and the Ca2+ binding is driven both enthalpically and entropically. Structural differences in conformation and assembly of the core complexes between the B915 and B880 species were investigated by CD spectroscopy and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fig. 6 shows the CD spectra. As reported previously, the CD spectrum of B915 was characterized by small and nonconservative signals in the Qy region (21Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a typical feature for the core complexes from purple bacteria (33Georgakopoulou S. van Grondelle R. van der Zwan G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 3344-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Georgakopoulou S. van Grondelle R. van der Zwan G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 3354-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Upon removal of Ca2+, the CD signals for the Qy and Qx bands were blue-shifted in accordance with the changes of absorption spectra, whereas other signals from the RC and carotenoids remained unchanged. These results support that Ca2+-dependent spectral changes originate from the change in configuration of the BChl a molecules in the LH1 complex. We also examined the effect of Ca2+ on the secondary structure of the apoproteins of the LH1-RC complex by measuring the CD spectra in the far UV region (Fig. 6, inset). Spectra for both the B915 and B880 revealed almost the same shape and can be characterized by highly α-helical structures. This suggests that there was no change in the secondary structures of the polypeptides. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation exhibited a single band for both B915 and B880 at identical positions (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that the B880 is not a decomposed form of B915 and the whole assembly of the core complex remains unchanged. All results described above were obtained using the purified LH1-RC complex. In Fig. 7, we show that similar phenomena can be observed for Tch. tepidum chromatophores. The chromatophore membrane contains a large amount of LH2 complex, as revealed by the intensive absorption maxima at 800 and 850 nm, and a small amount of LH1 complex with the Qy transition at 915 nm. In the presence of CaCl2, there was no change in the absorption spectrum of the chromatophore. However, upon the addition of EDTA or MgCl2, the LH1 915-nm band was shifted toward 880 nm and merged with the LH2 absorptions. The result implied that the Ca2+-binding site of the LH1 complex exists in a hydrophilic part or at the membrane interface where metal cations and EDTA are readily accessible. The present study demonstrated that the LH1 Qy transition at 915 nm of the core complex from Tch. tepidum is induced by the binding of Ca2+ to the LH1 complex. Removal of the Ca2+ resulted in a blue shift of the LH1 Qy transition to 876 nm, the wavelength similar to those of other mesophilic purple bacteria. The B915 native form can be recovered from the B880 by the addition of Ca2+. The result indicates that Ca2+ is an indispensable cofactor for retaining the native structure of the Tch. tepidum LH1 complex. The Ca2+ binding property of the Tch. tepidum LH1 complex is considered to be closely related to the living environment of this organism. Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, from where the bacterium was collected (1Madigan M.T. Science. 1984; 225: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is known to contain rich mineral calcium carbonate deposited over millions of years to form thick layers of sedimentary limestone. This bacterium cannot grow in a Ca2+-depleted culture (data not shown). Through the spectroscopic and ITC analyses, binding of the Ca2+ to the LH1 αβ-subunit was found to occur in a one-to-one ratio with a binding constant of ∼105 order of magnitude. The high binding affinity is comparable with that for the well known EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (32Ogawa Y. Tanokura M. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Generally, Ca2+ is classified as a hard acid and prefers to interact with a hard base. In the proteins with an EF-hand Ca2+-binding site, the ligands are mainly composed of oxygen atoms from acidic amino acid residues (Asp and Glu) as well as those from main chain carbonyl groups and water molecules (35Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Inspection of the primary sequences of the Tch. tepidum LH1 polypeptides revealed that three Asp in the α-polypeptide are located in the C-terminal region and are close to the BChl a-coordinating His residue (Fig. 8) (6Fathir I. Ashikaga M. Tanaka K. Katano T. Nirasawa T. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 58: 193-202Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Wang Z.-Y. Shimonaga M. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 78: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Three similar residues (two Glu and one Asp) are found in the C terminus of the LH1 α-polypeptide from the mesophilic purple bacterium Allochromatium (Ach.) vinosum. However, a deletion exists in this region of the Tch. tepidum LH1 α-polypeptide that is thought to be essential for the formation of a Ca2+-binding site and the specific interaction between the polypeptide and pigment molecule. Positions of the deletion and the three Asp residues are estimated to be on the membrane interface or in the hydrophilic part of the α-polypeptide. Similarly, several neighboring acidic residues are found in the N-terminal domain of the β-polypeptide, which might also serve as a potential binding site. Possibilities for other residues around the BChl a that are capable of hydrogen bonding (27Olsen J.D. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Cogdell R.J. Howard T.D. Isaac N.W. McLuskey K. Gardiner A.T. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and/or Ca2+ binding need to be further investigated. Despite the high affinity between the Tch. tepidum LH1 complex and Ca2+, the structural changes induced by the Ca2+ binding occurred slowly as revealed from the spectroscopic and the ITC measurements. Therefore, the conformational change from B880 to B915 is the rate-limiting step under the experimental conditions. Previous study showed that the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex was purified in a monomeric form, with the LH1 ring composed of 16 αβ-subunits (21Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present work, the Ca2+ binding to the LH1 complex was estimated to occur in a stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+/αβ-subunit = 1:1. This means that the B915 form may not be completed from the B880 form until all the 16 binding sites are occupied by the Ca2+ ions, because the Qy transition is a consequence of cooperative interaction between the exciton states formed by the 32 BChl a molecules. In the case where there are less Ca2+ ions than LH1-αβ pairs, the original state of the exciton interaction in the LH1 ring will be altered and become heterogeneous. As a result, a broadening in the Qy transition could be expected. Such broadening was actually observed at low Ca2+ concentrations up to 3.2 μm (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). At higher Ca2+ concentrations than 3.2 μm, the full width at half maximum decreased rapidly with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Taking into account the total molecular weight of ∼330,000 for the core complex, the slow structural change may be interpreted in terms of the large size of the membrane proteins associated with a considerable amount of the surrounded detergent molecules. Other factors include the relatively long time required for the fine-tuning of the 16 Ca2+-bound αβ-subunits within the LH1 complex to form a stabilized conformation that can also contribute to the thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum. Generally, metal binding to proteins is known to be driven entropically because the dehydration enthalpy of divalent cations is highly endothermic. However, overall enthalpy could become exothermic if the metal binding is thermodynamically coupled to the conformational change that eventually could result in a thermal stabilization of the protein (36Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In calmodulins from bovine brain (37Ogawa Y. Tanokura M. J.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7668-7674Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) the Ca2+ binding reactions were mostly favorable in both entropy and enthalpy except for several specific sites where endothermic- and entropy-driven reactions occur in a similar way to the calmodulins (42Yamada K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. 1982; 92: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 43Imaizumi M. Tanokura M. Yamada K. J. Biol.

For the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex, the Ca2+ binding is driven both entropically and enthalpically, similar to the cases of troponin C and parvalbumins. Therefore, the large exothermic changes of the Tch. tepidum core complex strongly support that the Ca2+ binding to the LH1 complex caused a conformational change that largely stabilized the structure of the LH1-RC complex. The Ca2+ binding in calmodulins was reported to induce a conformational transition of random coils to α-helical structures based on the results of CD measurement (46Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 47Wolff D.J. Poirier P.G. Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 10694-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the Tch. tepidum core complex, the far UV-CD spectra did not show any change in the Ca2+ depletion. This means that conformational change of the LH1 complex may occur mainly in the tertiary structure or the change in the secondary structure, if there is any, may be too small to be detected. Similar results were reported for troponin C from rabbit skeletal muscle (41Potter J.D. Hsu F.-J. Pownall H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2452-2454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In EF-hand proteins (35Grabarek Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-binding sites are located in the loop of a helix-loop-helix motif and large conformational changes are accompanied with the binding of Ca2+. In contrast, the putative Ca2+-binding sites in the LH1 complex are located at the terminal regions of the polypeptides. Furthermore, the number of acidic residues involved in the binding site and their arrangement seem to be different from those of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (32Ogawa Y. Tanokura M. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As a result, the slight structural change in LH1 can only be detected by its Qy transition that is extremely sensitive to the conformational change of the BChl a molecules. The changes in LH1 Qy transition for different alkaline earth cations appeared to be partly related to the ionic radius, as the cations with larger (Sr2+, Ba2+) and smaller (Mg2+) ionic radii than that of Ca2+ showed the cation-dependent Qy bands between 885 and 889 nm. However, substitution of Cd2+ that has an ionic radius almost the same as that of Ca2+ also induced a red shift to 887 nm. The results indicate that the Ca2+-binding site in the LH1 complex is highly selective and can distinguish the cations not only by the ionic radius but also by other properties such as binding mode and coordination number (49Dudev T. Lim C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2007; 40: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as well as the hard-soft nature. In this regard, the complex mechanism of molecular recognition of the Tch. tepidum LH1 is expected to be explored by detailed structural information, and the effort toward determining a high-resolution structure of the core complex is in progress (21Suzuki H.

It consists of a Mn4Ca cluster close to a redox-active tyrosine residue (TyrZ). Cl- is also required for enzyme activity. To study the role of Ca2+ and Cl- in PSII, these ions were biosynthetically substituted by Sr2+ and Br-, respectively, in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Irrespective of the combination of the non-native ions used (Ca/Br, Sr/Cl, Sr/Br), the enzyme could be isolated in a state that was fully intact but kinetically limited. The electron transfer steps affected by the exchanges were identified and then investigated by using time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved O2 polarography, and thermoluminescence spectroscopy. The effect of the Ca2+/Sr2+ and Cl-/Br- exchanges was additive, and the magnitude of the effect varied in the following order: Ca/Cl < Ca/Br < Sr/Cl < Sr/Br. In all cases, the rate of O2 release was similar to that of the S3TyrZ. to S0TyrZ transition, with the slowest kinetics (i.e. the Sr/Br enzyme) being ≈6-7 slower than in the native Ca/Cl enzyme. This slowdown in the kinetics was reflected in a decrease in the free energy level of the S3 state as manifest by thermoluminescence. These observations indicate that Cl- is involved in the water oxidation mechanism. The possibility that Cl- is close to the active site is discussed in terms of recent structural models.

Refined three-dimensional x-ray structures at 3.5 and 3.0 Å resolution have been obtained by using PSII isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (1Ferreira K.N.

Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). PSII is made up of more than 20 membrane protein subunits, 35-36 chlorophyll molecules, more than 10 carotenoid molecules, several lipids, two hemes, and the cofactors involved in the electron transfer reactions (1Ferreira K.N.

Absorption of a photon by chlorophyll is followed by the formation of a radical pair in which the pheophytin molecule, PheoD1, is reduced and the accessory chlorophyll molecule, ChlD1, is oxidized (3Diner B.A. Schlodder E.

The cation is then stabilized on P680, a weakly coupled chlorophyll dimer (see e.g. Refs. 6Rappaport F. Diner B.A. Coord. Chem.

The pheophytin anion transfers the electron to a quinone, QA, which in turn reduces a second quinone, QB.P680+.. oxidizes a tyrosine residue of the D1 polypeptide, TyrZ, which in turn oxidizes the Mn4Ca cluster. The Mn4Ca cluster acts as a device for accumulating oxidizing equivalents and as the active site for water oxidation. During the enzyme cycle, the oxidizing side of PSII goes through five sequential redox states, denoted as Sn, where n varies from 0 to 4 upon the absorption of four photons (8Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 11: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). Upon formation of the S4 state, two molecules of water are rapidly oxidized, the S0 state is regenerated, and O2 is released. The mechanism by which water is oxidized and O2 produced is still largely unknown (9Yano J. Kern J. Sauer K. Latimer M.J. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Saenger W. Messinger J. Zouni A.

The transition from S (or S3TyrZ., which is kinetically indistinguishable) to S0 probably involves several reaction intermediates. These have largely escaped detection for the following reasons: 1) the rate constant of this transition is rapid (t½ ≈ 1 ms); 2) the reduction of TyrZ. is the limiting step for water oxidation in the native enzyme; and 3) experimental methods for trapping potential intermediate states are lacking (see Refs. 20Clausen J. Junge W. Nature. 2004; 430: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 21Clausen J. Junge W. Dau H. Haumann M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12775-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar for a recent elegant thermodynamic approach). One strategy that could allow intermediates to be detected is to modify the enzyme, maintaining its capacity for turnover but impairing its kinetics. A change in the rate-limiting step could allow one or more intermediates to become detectable. Recently (22Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W.

When Ca2+ is removed from its site, manganese oxidation can still take place, allowing the formation of the S2 state, but in the following step, the normal S3 state is not formed. Instead, an alternative, abnormally stable form appears to be induced in which the Mn4 cluster is in the same redox state as it was in S2 state but in magnetic interaction with a radical (spin = 1/2) (38Boussac A.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 56Kamiya N. Shen J.-R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar), and the question arose whether Ca2+ really was intimately associated with the Mn4 cluster in cyanobacteria as was thought to be the case in plants. This prompted us to develop a method for biosynthetic Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange in T. elongatus (22Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Sugiura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22809-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We showed that there is one Sr2+ per PSII in fully active cyanobacterial PSII (22Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Sugiura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22809-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the same time, a structure with 3.5 Å resolution was reported in which a Ca2+ ion in close interaction with the Mn4 cluster was identified based on anomalous diffraction data (1Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Recently, x-ray crystallography and EXAFS spectroscopy using the Sr2+-containing enzyme confirmed that Sr2+ was associated with the Mn4 cluster and was located in a position similar to that of Ca2+ (34Pushkar Y. Yano J. Sauer K. Boussac A. Yachandra V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 57Kargul J. Maghlaoui K. Murray J.W. Deak Z. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Vass I. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The situation for chloride is less clear. No chloride ions are defined in the current three-dimensional structural models of the enzyme (1Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar, 2Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). This is partly because the resolution is insufficient but also because the structure of the cluster is perturbed by the x-ray beam, which reduces the high valence manganese cluster to the MnII state (18Yano J. Kern J. Irrgang K.D. Latimer M.J. Bergmann U. Glatzel P. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Sauer K. Messinger J. Zouni A. Yachandra V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4580-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The role and location of chloride as a cofactor in PSII from cyanobacteria thus remain open. For this reason, Cl-/Br- exchange experiments are potentially interesting. Previously reported Cl-/Br- exchange studies were done in chloride-depleted PSII. Depending on the Cl--depletion procedure (e.g. sulfate treatment at high pH versus extrinsic polypeptide depletion), the Br- reconstitution may have different effects. These differences can be explained by the presence of more than one chloride-binding site in PSII, the activity of which would depend on the binding of chloride to a high affinity site; and this activity could be modulated by the binding of another chloride to a low affinity binding site (46vanVliet P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 48Boussac A. Chem. Phys. 1995; 194: 409-418Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An alternative interpretation has been suggested, namely that many of the effects induced by Cl- depletion are depletion-induced artifacts and that there is a single Cl--binding site that has only an indirect effect on enzyme function. Indeed, in this interpretation Cl- is not considered necessary for enzyme activity (51Lindberg K. Vänngård T. Andréasson L.-E. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 52Lindberg K. Andréasson L.-E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14259-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As in the case of Ca2+/Sr2+, the biosynthetic substitution of Br- for Cl- could provide a “bromide phenotype” that does not suffer from the ambiguities associated with biochemical exchange procedures. The study of the bromide exchanged PSII could yield evidence for the involvement of Cl- in the water-splitting process and provide new insights on the role of chloride in the water oxidation mechanism. Here we present the results of this biosynthetic Cl-/Br- replacement study using T. elongatus with either Ca2+ or Sr2+ in the active site. Fully intact PSII preparations containing Ca/Cl, Ca/Br, Sr/Cl, and Sr/Br were analyzed using a combination of spectroscopic and enzymological studies. Culture of the Cells and Purification of Thylakoids and PSII— Thylakoids, and thence PSII, were purified from a T. elongatus strain that had a His6 tag on the CP43 subunit (58Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in which the psbA1 and psbA2 genes were deleted (WT*) (59Sugiura, M., Boussac, A., Noguchi, T., and Rappaport, F. (2008) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1777, 331-342Google Scholar). The D1 protein in PSII can potentially be encoded by three genes, psbA1, psbA2, and psbA3, each differing slightly. Because in this WT* T. elongatus only the psbA3 gene is present, the enzyme is not affected by the possible heterogeneity in D1 that would result from the expression of more than one of the three psbA genes. Such a situation could occur, for example, because of regulatory mechanisms triggered when changing light intensity during batch culture (60Kós P.B. Deák Z. Cheregi O. Vass I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The WT* cells were grown in 1 liter of culture medium (58Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) in 3-liter Erlenmeyer flasks in a rotary shaker with a CO2-enriched atmosphere at 45 °C under continuous light (80 μmol of photons·m-2·s-1). The culture medium was supplemented with either 0.8 mm CaX2 or SrX2 (X was either bromide or chloride depending on the experiments). The grade of the chemicals used was ≥99.999% for CaBr2, SrCl2, and SrBr2 and ≥99.99% for CaCl2. The chloride content was ≤0.001% in glycerol, ≤0.02% in betaine, and ≤0.005% in MES. In the culture medium and before the addition of the CaX2 or SrX2 salts, the Ca2+ contamination was measured by ICP (22Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Sugiura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22809-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to be less than 1.5 μm. The Cl- contamination can be estimated from the specifications given by the suppliers of the chemicals to be ≤40 μm (essentially from the Tricine buffer). Thylakoids and PSII were prepared as described earlier (61Sugiura M. Rappaport F. Brettel K. Noguchi T. Rutherford A.W. Boussac A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13549-13563Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the exception that no polyethylene glycol was used to concentrate the samples. Instead, the samples were concentrated by using Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator devices (Millipore) with a 100-kDa cut-off. Routinely, the total amount of Chl after the breaking of the cells was ≈180 mg, and the yield after PSII purification in terms of Chl amounts was ≈4-5%. Thylakoids and PSII were stored in liquid nitrogen at a concentration of about 1.5-2 mg Chl/ml in a medium containing 10% glycerol, 1 m betaine, 15 mm CaX2, 15 mm MgX2, and 40 mm MES, pH 6.5 (pH adjusted with NaOH), until they were used. Oxygen Evolution under Continuous Light—Oxygen evolution of PSII under continuous light was measured at 25 °C by polarography using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech) with saturating white light at a Chl concentration of 5 μg of Chl·ml-1 in the media described above. A total of 0.5 mm DCBQ (2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added as an electron acceptor. The betaine, DCBQ, and QB react in the time range of minutes in the presence of O2. For that reason, measurements of PSII activity were done at ≤1 min after the addition of DCBQ. Flash-induced Oxygen Evolution—Oxygen evolution under flashing light was measured with a laboratory-made rate electrode (22Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Sugiura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22809-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Two combinations of electrodes were used: either Pt/Ag/AgCl or Pt/Ag/AgBr, depending on the conditions. The Ag/AgCl and Ag/AgBr electrodes were prepared by using 1-2 m HCl or HBr acids, respectively. Thylakoids were used at 1.2 mg Chl·ml-1. Typically, 25 μl of a thylakoid suspension was put onto the platinum electrode. The volume of the circulating medium was ≈250 ml and contained 10% glycerol, 1 m betaine, 15 mm CaX2, 15 mm MgX2, 50 mm KX, and 40 mm MES, pH 6.5 (pH adjusted with NaOH). Illumination was done with a xenon flash (PerkinElmer Optoelectronics). The intensity of the flash was adjusted so that the light intensity was saturating (i.e. the miss parameter was minimum). Measurements were done at room temperature (20-25 °C). The amplified amperometric signal resulting from the flash-induced oxygen evolution was recorded with a numerical oscilloscope. UV-visible Absorption Change Spectroscopy—Absorption changes were measured with a laboratory-built spectrophotometer where the absorption changes were sampled at discrete times by short flashes (62Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1999; 70: 202-207Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These flashes were provided by a neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) pumped (355 nm) optical parametric oscillator, which produces monochromatic flashes (1 nm full-width at half-maximum) with a duration of 6 ns. Excitation at 685 nm was provided by a dye laser pumped by a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser. The path length of the cell was 2.5 mm. PSII was used at 25 μg of Chl·ml-1 in 10% glycerol, 1 m betaine, 15 mm CaX2, 15 mm MgX2, and 40 mm MES, pH 6.5 (pH adjusted with NaOH). After dark adaptation for 1 h at room temperature (20-22 °C), 0.1 mm PPBQ dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added as an electron acceptor. PPBQ was used here instead of DCBQ because of the length of the experiment (see above). Thermoluminescence Experiments—Thermoluminescence glow curves were measured with a laboratory-built apparatus (63Ducruet J.-M. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 2419-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PSII samples at 10 μg Chl·ml-1 were first dark-adapted at room temperature for 1 h. Illumination was done by using saturating xenon flashes (PerkinElmer Optoelectronics) at 5 °C. Then the samples were frozen to -10 °C in 5 s. After an additional 5 s at -10 °C, the frozen samples were heated at a constant rate (0.33 °C/s). From the lifetime of the S2 and S3 states at room temperature (22Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P.

https://openalex.org/W2028638910,"Single-chain insulin (SCI) analogs provide insight into the inter-relation of hormone structure, function, and dynamics. Although compatible with wild-type structure, short connecting segments (<3 residues) prevent induced fit upon receptor binding and so are essentially without biological activity. Substantial but incomplete activity can be regained with increasing linker length. Here, we describe the design, structure, and function of a single-chain insulin analog (SCI-57) containing a 6-residue linker (GGGPRR). Native receptor-binding affinity (130 +/- 8% relative to the wild type) is achieved as hindrance by the linker is offset by favorable substitutions in the insulin moiety. The thermodynamic stability of SCI-57 is markedly increased (DeltaDeltaG(u) = 0.7 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol relative to the corresponding two-chain analog and 1.9 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol relative to wild-type insulin). Analysis of inter-residue nuclear Overhauser effects demonstrates that a native-like fold is maintained in solution. Surprisingly, the glycine-rich connecting segment folds against the insulin moiety: its central Pro contacts Val(A3) at the edge of the hydrophobic core, whereas the final Arg extends the A1-A8 alpha-helix. Comparison between SCI-57 and its parent two-chain analog reveals striking enhancement of multiple native-like nuclear Overhauser effects within the tethered protein. These contacts are consistent with wild-type crystal structures but are ordinarily attenuated in NMR spectra of two-chain analogs, presumably due to conformational fluctuations. Linker-specific damping of fluctuations provides evidence for the intrinsic flexibility of an insulin monomer. In addition to their biophysical interest, ultrastable SCIs may enhance the safety and efficacy of insulin replacement therapy in the developing world."

https://openalex.org/W2022261156,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway has emerged as a major regulator of cellular functions and has been implicated in several pathologies involving remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). The end stage of inflammatory joint diseases is characterized by excessive ECM catabolism, and in this study we assess the role of PI3K signaling in the induction of collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human chondrocytes. We used the most potent cytokine stimulus reported to promote cartilage ECM catabolism, namely interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM). Both OSM and IL-6 (in the presence of its soluble receptor), but not IL-1 nor leukemia inhibitory factor, induced Akt phosphorylation in human chondrocytes. Inhibition of PI3K signaling using LY294002 blocked IL-1+OSM-mediated Akt phosphorylation, induction of MMP-1 and MMP-13, and cartilage collagenolysis. To further explore the role of downstream substrates within the PI3K pathway, complementary use of small molecule inhibitors and specific small interfering RNAs demonstrated that the PI3K subunit p110α and Akt1 were required for MMP-1 mRNA induction. MMP-13 induction was also reduced by loss of function of these molecules and by a lack of p110δ, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 or Akt3. We therefore propose that the activities of specific elements of the PI3K signaling pathway, including Akt, are necessary for the synergistic induction of MMP-1 and MMP-13 and the cartilage breakdown stimulated by IL-1+OSM. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism of synergy between IL-1 and OSM and highlight new therapeutic targets for inflammatory joint diseases that aim to repress the expression of collagenases.

Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Stephens L.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Activation of class I PI3K signaling plays a vital role in the response of many cytokine and growth factor receptors to control cellular processes such as growth, survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration (1Hawkins P.T. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Stephens L.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Activity of the downstream serine/threonine kinase, Akt (protein kinase B), is of key importance for these events. This PI3K subgroup is further sub-divided: class IA comprises heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit (α, β, or δ isoforms), closely associated with a p50, p55, or p85 regulatory subunit, which is responsible for recruitment to tyrosine kinase-associated receptors activated by cytokines and growth factors. In class IB enzymes, usually activated by G-protein-coupled receptors, the catalytic subunit is p110γ, and the regulatory subunit is p84 or p101 (1Hawkins P.T. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Stephens L.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Akt is a pivotal kinase in PI3K signaling, and mechanisms exist to limit Akt activation. Positive or negative regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling enables functional differences between receptors which, for example, determine the outcome of T cell activation (2Parry R.V. Riley J.L. Ward S.G. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There are three mammalian Akt family members involved in a plethora of cellular signaling events. These isoforms have central roles in a variety of human cancers, with effects on tumor initiation and progression as well as metastasis. They also contribute to tumorigenesis at multiple levels such as regulation of cell motility and migration, and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) (3Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 461-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cross-talk occurs between Akt and other signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are themselves activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli (4Yart A. Chap H. Raynal P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, PI3K pathway activation can influence other signaling pathways; combined with the ability of Akt to regulate the subcellular localization of downstream substrates (and hence their functionality, Ref. 5Kumar R. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this pathway is an important modulator of gene expression in inflammatory milieu where multiple cytokines are present.Inflammation is a major characteristic of joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Despite having different aetiologies, inflammatory mediators released by infiltrating immune cells as well as resident joint cells induce alterations in gene expression that can lead to ECM degradation (6Sakkas L.I. Platsoucas C.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Scrivo R. Di Franco M. Spadaro A. Valesini G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1108: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cytokines such as interleukin(IL-)1, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are the key mediators thought to be involved in promoting inflammatory responses in such destructive joint diseases (8Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 9Koenders M.I. Joosten L.A. van den Berg W.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2006; 65: iii29-iii33Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have shown that the IL-6-family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) and IL-6 markedly exacerbate the catabolic potential of these mediators, synergistically promoting cartilage ECM catabolism both in vitro and in vivo (10Rowan A.D.

This is achieved by regulating the expression of ECM components with catabolic factors such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which collectively can degrade all the ECM macromolecules. During the degradative phases of inflammatory joint diseases, chondrocytes are stimulated to secrete elevated levels of MMPs that, once activated, mediate the proteolysis of tendon, bone, and cartilage (15Burrage P.S. Mix K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 16Page-McCaw A. Ewald A.J. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). MMP-1 and MMP-13 are collagenolytic MMPs that have been most strongly associated with cartilage collagenolysis, a key proteolytic event in inflammatory joint disease, because it is essentially irreversible (17Jubb R.W. Fell H.B. J. Pathol. 1980; 130: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A marked synergistic induction of collagenase gene expression occurs in human chondrocytes following stimulation with IL-1+OSM (13Rowan A.D. Hui W. Cawston T.E. Richards C.D. Am. J.

Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and this has been proposed to be via the interplay of signal transduction pathways whereby signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), c-Fos, and alterations in activator protein-1 (AP-1) composition are important (20Catterall J.B. Carrere S. Koshy P.J. Degnan B.A. Shingleton W.D. Brinckerhoff C.E. Rutter J. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2296-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MMP gene expression is certainly reliant on transcription factors such as erythroblastosis 26 and nuclear factor-κB as well as AP-1 (21Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), although synergistic MMP gene expression is likely to involve other signaling pathways that impinge on one or more of these factors. Thus, targeting specific pathways such as those activated by OSM may have the potential to suppress collagenolytic MMP gene expression during inflammation.Class I PI3K activity, particularly of PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ isoforms, represents a well established target for the treatment of inflammatory joint disease, based largely on the importance of these activities in T cell receptor-induced T cell activation and/or migration (22Rommel C. Camps M. Ji H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 23Alcazar I. Marques M. Kumar A. Hirsch E. Wymann M. Carrera A.C. Barber D.F. J. Exp.

Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 988-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), and various reports suggest that this signaling may regulate the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, thus influencing tumor invasiveness (26Fukaya Y.

Acta. 2007; 1773: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).We propose that elements of the PI3K pathway are important determinants for the synergistic induction of collagenolytic MMPs in cartilage. In this study, we demonstrate activation of Akt by OSM (but not IL-1), and that MMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression are dependent on distinct sets of signaling molecules within the PI3K pathway. These data therefore further support the differential regulation of these important collagenases (43Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Barchowsky A. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), confirm that OSM-activated PI3K signaling is an important contributor to MMP synergy, and that specific ablation of PI3K signaling events could function to preserve cartilage homeostasis during inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals, including AS-604850, were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated and were of the highest purity available. All cytokines used were recombinant human. IL-1α was a generous gift from Dr. Keith Ray (Glaxo-SmithKline, Stevenage, UK). OSM and LIF were kindly donated by Prof. John Heath (Department of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK), while IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sIL-6R) were purchased from R&D Systems Ltd. (Abingdon, UK). LY294002, and Akt inhibitors IV and VIII were from Merck Chemicals (Nottingham, UK), compound 15e and TGX-221 were from Axxora (Nottingham, UK). All kinase inhibitors and siRNA reagents were screened for toxicity using the XTT assay of metabolic activity (Roche Applied Sciences), and used at concentrations that did not affect cell viability over a 24-h period.Chondrocytes—Human chondrocytes were obtained by the enzymatic digestion of macroscopically normal articular cartilage from OA patients undergoing joint replacement surgery as described (44Cleaver C.S. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All subjects gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Joint Ethics Committee. Bovine cartilage was dissected from nasal septi obtained from a local abattoir as described (45Shingleton W.D. Ellis A.J. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were only used as primary cultures, or for siRNA transfection, after a single passage.Cartilage Degradation Assay—Bovine nasal septum cartilage was dissected into ∼2 × 2 × 2-mm discs, plated into 24-well tissue culture plates (3 discs per well, n = 4) in serum-free medium and incubated for 14 days in the presence of IL-1 ± OSM (±LY294002 including a 24-h preincubation), changing medium after 7 days as previously described (45Shingleton W.D. Ellis A.J. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cartilage remaining at day 14 was digested with papain (45Shingleton W.D. Ellis A.J. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and all samples were stored at –20 °C until assay.Viability of cartilage explants was assessed by screening for the production of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using the Cytotox 96 assay (Promega, Southampton, UK). No increase in LDH levels with any of the treatments including inhibitors has been found (data not shown).Proteoglycan, Collagen, and Collagenolytic Activity Assays—For proteoglycan release, a measurement of sulfated glycosaminoglycans was used as described previously (47Cawston T.E. Curry V.A. Summers C.A. Clark I.M. Riley G.P. Life P.F. Spaull J.R. Goldring M.B. Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Shingleton W.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Hydroxyproline measurements (46Bergman I. Loxley R. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 1961-1965Crossref Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) were used as an estimate of cartilage collagen, and the cumulative release calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total for each well (47Cawston T.E. Curry V.A. Summers C.A. Clark I.M. Riley G.P. Life P.F. Spaull J.R. Goldring M.B. Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Shingleton W.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Collagenolytic activity present in the culture medium from cartilage explants was determined using a diffuse fibril assay with 3H-acetylated collagen (48Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Life P.F. Cawston T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One unit of collagenase activity degrades 1 μgof collagen per min at 37 °C.Immunoblotting—Human articular chondrocytes were grown to 80–90% confluence, serum-starved overnight, and then stimulated with cytokines for 20 min. Cells were lysed with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1.2 m glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 μm microcystin-LR; 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences)), particulate matter removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C, and lysates stored at –80 °C until use. Lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subsequently probed using the following antibodies: phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-Akt (Thr-308), Akt, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), and phospho-PDK1 (Ser-241) from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); PI3K p110 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Autogen Bioclear, Wiltshire, UK); glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Millipore (Watford, UK).Immunoassays—Primary human articular chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1 ± OSM (±LY294002 preincubated with the cells for 1 h) for 48 h under serum-free conditions (10Rowan A.D. Koshy P.J. Shingleton W.D. Degnan B.A. Heath J.K. Vernallis A.B. Spaull J.R. Life P.F. Hudson K. Cawston T.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The medium was removed and assayed by specific immunoassay for MMP-1 (49Clark I.M. Powell L.K. Wright J.K. Cawston T.E. Hazleman B.L. Matrix. 1992; 12: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), MMP-13 (50Morgan T.G. Rowan A.D. Dickinson S.C. Jones D. Hollander A.P. Deehan D. Cawston T.E. Ann. Rheum.

The MMP assays detected both the pro- and active forms.siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—Primary human chondrocytes were prepared and cultured as above. For siRNA transfection, cells were trypsinized and re-seeded at ∼50% confluence. Maintenance of the chondrocytic phenotype was confirmed by assessment of SOX9 and Col2A1 expression by real-time PCR using Taqman® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Dharmacon siGENOME™ SMARTpools® (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO.) of 4 specific siRNA duplexes (total of 100 nm siRNA) were used to transfect chondrocytes using the Dharmafect™ 1 lipid reagent (Thermo Fisher). siRNA pools were used to target p110α (NM_006218, cat: 003018); p110β (NM_006219, cat: 003019); p110δ (NM_005026, cat: 006775); PDK1 (NM_002613, cat: 003017); Akt1 (NM_005163, cat: 003000); Akt2 (NM_001626, cat: 003001); Akt3 (NM_005465, cat: 003002). After a 28-h transfection, cells were washed in serum-free medium for 20 h prior to the addition of cytokines for a further 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed using the Cells-to-Signal™ kit (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) as directed. Expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA was measured by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (see below). Depletion of gene-specific mRNA levels was calculated by comparison of expression levels with cells transfected with 100 nm siCONTROL (non-targeting siRNA 2, cat. 001210-02; Dharmacon).Real-time PCR of Relative mRNA Levels—RNA was stabilized in cell lysates in a 96-well format and cDNA synthesized using the Cells-to-Signal™ kit as directed. For TaqMan or SYBR Green PCR, mRNA levels for each gene were obtained from standard curves and corrected using 18 S ribosomal RNA levels. Cycling conditions (7900HT system, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for SYBR Green PCR (using Takara SYBR ExTaq premix; Lonza Biologics, Cambridge, UK) were 95 °C 10 s, then 40 cycles of 95 °C 5 s, then 60 °C 30 s, followed by a standard dissociation curve analysis. Cycling conditions for Taqman PCR (Jumpstart Taq Readymix; Sigma) were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. Primers and probe sequences for Taqman PCR were: MMP-1: For, 5′-AAGATGAAAGGTGGACCAAAATT-3′ and Rev, 5′-CCAAGAGAATGGCCGAGTTC-3′, Probe: 5′-FAM-CAGAGAGTACAACTTACATCGTGTTGCGGCTCTAMRA-3′; MMP-13: For, 5′-AAATTATGGAGGAGATGCCCATT-3′ and Rev, 5′-TCCTTGGAGTGGTCAAGACCTAA-3′, Probe: 5′-FAM-CTACAACTTGTTTCTTGTTGCTGCGCATGATAMRA-3′; 18 S ribosomal RNA: For, 5′-CGAATGGCTCATTAAATCAGTTATGG-3′ and Rev 5′-TATTAGCTCTAGAATTACCACAGTTATCC-3′, Probe: 5′-FAM-TCCTTTGGTCGCTCGCTCCTCTCCC-TAMRA-3′. Some Taqman assays used Universal Probe Library probes (Roche Applied Sciences) as directed: Akt2: For, 5′-ACGTGGATTCTCCAGACGA-3′ and Rev, 5′-GCTGCTTGAGGCTGTTGG-3′, Probe: 52; Akt3: For, 5′-TGGATTTACCTTATCCCCTCAA-3′ and Rev 5′-TGGCTTTGGTCGTTCTGTTT-3′, Probe: 59; PDK1: For, 5′-GTCTTATCCCCAGAGAGCAAAC-3′ and Rev, 5′-AGCAGCTCTGGAGAAACGTACT-3′, Probe: 81; p110β: For, 5′-CCCTTCTGAACTGGCTTAAAGA-3′ and Rev, 5′-GGACAGTGTAAATTCCTCAATGG-3′, Probe: 85. For SYBR Green PCR, primer sequences were: Akt1: For, 5′-CTGTCATCGAACGCACCTT-3′ and Rev, 5′-GTCTGGATGGCGGTTGTC-3′; p110α: For, 5′-CACGAGATCCTCTCTCTGAAATC-3′ and Rev, 5′-GGTAGAATTTCGGGGATAGTTACA-3′; p110γ: For, 5′-CCTCAACCATGAAGGAAACC-3′ and Rev, 5′-GCACCACGGGCTGTTTATAG-3′; p110δ: For, 5′-TTGCTGGTCTTTCTTGGACTATT-3′ and Rev, 5′-TTCTCCTCCTTGGTCCAGAAT-3′.Statistical Analyses—Statistical differences between sample groups were assessed using ANOVA with a post-hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, where ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05. For clarity, only selected comparisons are presented in some figures.RESULTSOSM Stimulates Akt Phosphorylation in Human Chondrocytes—Stimulation of primary human articular chondrocytes with OSM and IL-6 (+sIL-6R), but not LIF, led to the phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (Fig. 1A) indicating Akt activation. LIF treatment did induce STAT3 phosphorylation in these chondrocytes (data not shown). IL-1 stimulation did not result in Akt activation, and inclusion of LY294002 (5 μm) prevented OSM-mediated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). LY294002 similarly blocked IL-6-mediated activation of Akt (data not shown).PI3K Inhibition Blocks IL-1+OSM-mediated Cartilage Degradation—We examined the effect of inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway in an established model of cartilage degradation. The IL-1+OSM combination (0.02 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively) was used at pathologically relevant concentrations, and induced a reproducible and synergistic release of collagen from bovine cartilage as shown previously (47Cawston T.E. Curry V.A. Summers C.A. Clark I.M. Riley G.P. Life P.F. Spaull J.R. Goldring M.B. Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Shingleton W.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), while inclusion of LY294002 throughout the 14-day culture resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of this release (Fig. 2). There was no increase in LDH release from inhibitor-treated cartilage (not shown) indicating that the observed effects were not due to toxicity of the inhibitor. A concentration-dependent reduction in the levels of active collagenolytic activity was also seen in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 2). Although collagenase activity was significantly reduced, no inhibition of collagenolysis was observed at low inhibitor levels, consistent with previous findings when collagenase levels exceed 1 unit; such remaining collagenase activity is sufficient to catalyze maximum collagen release (52Shingleton W.D. Jones D. Xu X. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2006; 45: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The most marked reduction in activity correlated with the inhibition of collagenolysis (10 μm LY294002) (Fig. 2). LY294002 did not affect IL-1+OSM-mediated proteoglycan release (Fig. 2, inset).FIGURE 2PI3K pathway inhibition blocks IL-1+OSM-induced collagenolysis. Cartilage explants were incubated with IL-1 (1 ng/ml) ± OSM (10 ng/ml) for 14 days, with fresh medium and cytokines at day 7. LY294002 was preincubated with cartilage for 24 h and throughout the stimulation period; DMSO (Dm) was included as a solvent control for the inhibitor. Cumulative collagen release by day 14 (black bars) was expressed as a percentage of the total for each treatment, and active collagenolytic activity in the day 14 culture supernatants (gray bars) was determined by bioassay (mean ± S.D., n = 4; ***, p < 0.001, LY294002-treated compared with IL-1+OSM; **, p < 0.01, ANOVA).

https://openalex.org/W2131991518,"Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that colonizes the upper respiratory tract and is also the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. S. pneumoniae causes invasive diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. Despite the importance of pneumococcal diseases, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which S. pneumoniae-induced inflammation is regulated, especially the negative regulatory mechanisms. Here we show that S. pneumoniae activates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway and the subsequent up-regulation of inflammatory mediators via a key pneumococcal virulence factor, pneumolysin. We also demonstrate that S. pneumoniae activates NFAT transcription factor independently of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Moreover, S. pneumoniae induces NFAT activation via both Ca(2+)-calcineurin and transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) 3/6-p38alpha/beta-dependent signaling pathways. Interestingly, we found for the first time that tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD) acts as a negative regulator for S. pneumoniae-induced NFAT signaling pathway via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism. Finally, we showed that CYLD interacts with and deubiquitinates TAK1 to negatively regulate the activation of the downstream MKK3/6-p38alpha/beta pathway. Our studies thus bring new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae infections through the NFAT-dependent mechanism and further identify CYLD as a negative regulator for NFAT signaling, thereby opening up new therapeutic targets for these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2076234955,"There is much interest in understanding the signals in the bone marrow niche that keep hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a quiescent state. In the current issue of Cell Stem Cell, Fleming et al. (2008) report that blocking Wnt signaling in the niche increases the number of proliferating HSCs and reduces their ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of irradiated recipient mice. These findings show that Wnt/beta-catenin activity is crucial for the maintenance of HSC quiescence in the bone marrow niche."
https://openalex.org/W2056448123,"Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are believed to play a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and axonal outgrowth. Among them, CRMP2 mediates axonal guidance by collapsing growth cones during development. This activity is correlated with the reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins. CRMP2 is implicated in the regulation of several intracellular signaling pathways. Two subtypes, A and B, and multiple cytosolic isoforms of CRMP2B with apparent masses between 62 and 66 kDa have previously been reported. Here, we show a new short isoform of 58 kDa, expressed during brain development, derived from C-terminal processing of the CRMP2B subtype. Although full-length CRMP2 is restricted to the cytoplasm, using transfection experiments, we demonstrate that a part of the short isoform is found in the nucleus. Interestingly, at the tissue level, this short CRMP2 is also found in a nuclear fraction of brain extract. By mutational analysis, we demonstrate, for the first time, that nuclear translocation occurs via nuclear localization signal (NLS) within residues Arg471-Lys472 in CRMP2 sequence. The NLS may be unmasked after C-terminal processing; thereby, this motif may be surface-exposed. This short CRMP2 induces neurite outgrowth inhibition in neuroblastoma cells and suppressed axonal growth in cultured cortical neurons, whereas full-length CRMP2 promotes neurite elongation. The NLS-mutated short isoform, restricted to the cytoplasm, abrogates both neurite outgrowth and axon growth inhibition, indicating that short nuclear CRMP2 acts as a dominant signal. Therefore, post-transcriptional processing of CRMP2 together with its nuclear localization may be an important key in the regulation of neurite outgrowth in brain development.

They play important roles in neurite outgrowth and axonal guidance (1Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Among them, CRMP2 was originally identified as a signaling molecule, required for growth cone collapse of dorsal root ganglion neurons, in response to a repulsive guidance cue, semaphorin-3A (2Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). CRMP2 was also reported to have a positive effect on axonal extension and to play a crucial role in axon-dendrite specification and axon regeneration, since the overexpression of CRMP2 induces the formation of multiple axons, and the expression of the dominant-negative form of CRMP2 or the knockdown of CRMP2 suppresses axon formation (3Inagaki N.

Morphological changes and the motility of neuronal growth cones are closely related to the reorganization of actin, tubulin, and other cytoskeletal proteins (8Buck K.B. Zheng J.Q. J.

Accordingly, CRMP2 co-localizes with F-actin in the growth cones of different types of neurons (1Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J.

Moreover, CRMP2 is thought to regulate axonal growth through its interaction with tubulin dimers to promote microtubule assembly. The CRMP2-tubulin interaction seems to be mediated by a microtubule-binding domain, spanning amino acids 323-381 within CRMP2 (4Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T.

Besides, CRMP2 was shown to bind to the kinesin-1 light chain, thereby regulating the transport of soluble tubulin to the distal parts of growing axons (11Kimura T. Arimura N. Fukata Y. Watanabe H. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). By interacting with the Sra-1 (Rac1-associated protein 1)-Wave1 (WASP family verpolin-homologous protein 1) complex, CRMP2 operates by transporting it to the growth cone of axons via kinesin-1 light chain (12Kawano Y. Yoshimura T. Tsuboi D. Kawabata S. Kaneto-Kawano T. Shirataki H. Takenawa T. Kaibuchi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9920-9935Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). CRMP2 also participates in the polarized Numb-mediated endocytosis of the neuronal adhesion molecule L1 at the growth cones (6Nishimura T. Fukata Y. Kato K. Yamaguchi T. Matsuura Y. Kamiguchi H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Besides the above mentioned proteins, other CRMP2-interacting molecules, such as chimaerin and phospholipase D, have also been identified (13Lee S. Kim J.H. Lee C.S. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Heo K. Ihara Y.

Qi R.Z. Leung T. Lim L. Hall C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8994-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In parallel, our group has shown that CRMP2 may act as a regulator of other functions, such as migration and proliferation, since CRMP2 is highly expressed in the developing cerebellum, either in the proliferative external granular layer or in growing fibers in the molecular layer (15Ricard D. Rogemont V. Charrier E. Aguera M. Bagnard D. Belin M.F. Thomasset N. Honnorat J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 15: 7203-7214Crossref Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that by interacting with different molecular partners, CRMP2 may play a pivotal role in regulating several signaling pathways leading to nervous system development. A number of studies have raised the possibility that post-translational modifications of CRMP2 modulate its activity in axonal growth or growth cone dynamics, by preventing its association with other molecules. There is growing evidence that CRMP2-tubulin interaction is regulated by CRMP2 phosphorylation, which inhibits the ability of CRMP2 to promote microtubule assembly and induces growth cone collapse, suggesting that the phosphorylation states of the CRMP2 modulate its activity (7Yoshimura T.

On the other hand, hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2 is implicated in some pathology, such as Alzheimer disease (16Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Shuterland C.

Kolattukudy P. Honnorat J. Goshima Y. Genes Cell. 2005; 10: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, besides phosphorylation, other post-translational modifications may exist, which regulate the function of CRMP2. CRMP2 has the characteristic of being present under different isoforms (21Bretin S. Reibel S. Charrier E. Maus-Moati M. Auvergnon N. Thevenoux A. Glowinski J. Rogemond V. Premont J. Honnorat J. Gauchy C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the function of each isoform. Two subtypes (A and B) have been reported for different CRMPs (1Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goshima Y.

Ohkawara T. Murata M. Noda M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2329-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We reported that CRMP2A, present as a 75-kDa protein, was specifically localized in neuronal soma and/or axons but was absent from dendrites, whereas CRMP2B was localized in both axons and dendrites (21Bretin S. Reibel S. Charrier E. Maus-Moati M. Auvergnon N. Thevenoux A. Glowinski J. Rogemond V. Premont J. Honnorat J. Gauchy C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The balance between the expressions of the two subtypes is involved in the control of axon branching and elongation. CRMP2B is present in different isoforms with apparent masses varying between 62 and 66 kDa (10Yuasa-Kawada J. Suzuki R. Kano F. Ohkawara T. Murata M. Noda M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2329-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Bretin S.

Despite extensive studies on CRMP2 during the last few years, no attempt has been made to elucidate the spatio-temporal expression and the function of each of these multiple isoforms of CRMP2. Recently, another isoform (58 kDa) resulting from post-translational processing of CRMP2 and of CRMP4 has been reported after brain injury, such as ischemia (21Bretin S. Reibel S. Charrier E. Maus-Moati M. Auvergnon N. Thevenoux A. Glowinski J. Rogemond V. Premont J. Honnorat J. Gauchy C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Kowara R. Chen Q.

We showed an N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced post-translational processing of CRMPs, including CRMP2, in cortical neurons, also leading to the appearance of short isoform (25Bretin S. Rogemond V. Marin P Maus M Torrens Y. Honnorat J. Glowinski J. Prémont J. Gauchy C. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1252-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because CRMP2 exerts various functions, depending on its post-translational modification state, an insight into the spatio-temporal expression and the function of the 58-kDa short isoform offers an important key to elucidating the role of this isoform in neuronal development. In the present study, we show, the developmentally dependent expression of a short isoform (58 kDa) of CRMP2 exclusively present in the embryonic and postnatal stages but absent in the adult brain. We show that this short isoform derives from post-translational C-terminal processing of the CRMP2B subtype, thus unmasking a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within CRMP2. This short isoform is found in the nucleus, at both cell and tissue levels. We define, for the first time, a functional NLS sequence within the CRMP2 isoform. The nuclear short CRMP2 induces neurite outgrowth inhibition, thereby suggesting that CRMP2 plays an important role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth in brain development. Crude Brain Extract—Adult male, postnatal days 1 (P1), 5 (P5), and 15 (P15), rats or mice (OFA; Charles River Laboratories, L'Arbresle, France) were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Embryos at embryonic days 14 (E14), 16 (E16), and 19 (E19) were removed from anesthetized pregnant females. After decapitation, the brains were removed and chilled on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cerebral tissues were sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C. The proteins in the supernatant were quantified (Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent; Pierce), diluted to a concentration of 6 mg/ml in the homogenization buffer, and stored at -80 °C until used. Subcellular Fractionation—Cerebella of postnatal rats (P1) were explanted, cleaned free of meninges, and subjected to subcellular fractionation using the proteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit from Calbiochem, following exactly the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 mg of tissue were resuspended in 1 ml of extraction Buffer I and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g, the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was kept apart. Then the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of extraction Buffer II and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 × g. The supernatant, containing the membrane protein fraction, was kept apart, and the pellet was incubated with 500 μl of Buffer III containing 375 units of Benzonase (Calbiochem) for 10 min at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Another centrifugation at 10,000 × g allowed the separation of nuclear protein remaining in the supernatant. The pellet, dissolved in 500 μl of Buffer IV, allowed the recovery of the cytoskeletal fraction. All buffers contained 5 μl of inhibitor mixture. Antibodies Used and Western Blot Analysis—The site-specific antibodies to CRMP2 were obtained as previously described (21Bretin S. Reibel S. Charrier E. Maus-Moati M. Auvergnon N. Thevenoux A. Glowinski J. Rogemond V. Premont J. Honnorat J. Gauchy C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Quach T.T. Duchemin A.M. Rogemond V. Aguera M. Honnorat J. Belin M.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Cell Neurol. 2004; 25: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences used to generate specific antisera were 557IVAPPGGRANITSLG572 targeting the CRMP2 C-terminal region (C-ter), and 454LEDGTLHVTEGS465 (pep4). Peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. The anti-peptide antibodies (IgG) were purified by affinity chromatography on the corresponding immobilized peptide. Extracts from brain or transfected cells (30 μg) were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (8 or 10% polyacrylamide gels), transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with different antibodies as described (25Bretin S. Rogemond V. Marin P Maus M Torrens Y. Honnorat J. Glowinski J. Prémont J. Gauchy C. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1252-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The target protein was detected using diaminobenzidine as peroxidase substrate or an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Covalab, Lyon, France) and x-ray film. Densitometric quantification of the immunoblot bands was performed using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Preparation, In-gel Enzymatic Proteolysis, and Mass Spectrometry—A 300-μl aliquot of the cytosolic fraction from mouse brain cortex was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm PPi and applied to 1 ml of Q-Sepharose columns (Hi-trap Q; GE Healthcare). After elution with 0.5 m NaCl, in the same buffer, CRMP2-enriched fractions were pooled and concentrated on an Ultrafree Biomax membrane (Millipore), dialyzed, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide). Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue, according to standard protocols, the bands of interest were excised from the gel, and in-gel digestion with trypsin was carried out as described by Shevchenko et al. (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, using a Voyager DE-PRO work station (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). Spectra were recorded in the mass range 700-5000 Da. A 200-μl solution of 0.5% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (LaserBioLab, Sophia-Antipolis, France) in 50% acetonitrile, 50% H2O, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as matrix. The instrument was calibrated using trypsin autolysis fragments at m/z 842.5100 and 2211.1046 Da. Peptide mass fingerprinting was compared with the theoretical masses from the SwissProt sequence data base using Protein Prospector MS-Fit software. Typical search parameters were as follows: ±40 ppm of mass tolerance, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, methionine considered in oxidized form, one missed enzymatic cleavage for trypsin. A minimum of five peptide mass hits was required for a match, and a protein mass range from 5 to 100 kDa was permitted. Probability-based molecular weight search scores greater than 1000 were considered as significant. Data Base and Structure Analysis—Sequences were aligned using the Clustal program (28Higgins D.G. Sharp D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). The prediction programs PROSITE (available on the World Wide Web) and PSORT II (available on the World Wide Web) were used to identify putative NLS. The online prediction program (available on the World Wide Web) was used to identify the intrinsically unstructured protein-related structure of the C-terminal part of CRMP2. The structure of CRMP2 was modeled, based on the coordinates available for CRMP2 chain D (protein Data Bank entry 2GSE), using Viewerlite version 4.2 (Accelrys). Expression Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Full-length CRMP2 or the C-terminally truncated ΔC503 was amplified by PCR and inserted directionally into the pCMV2-FLAG vector (Sigma), which generated a protein with a FLAG tag at its N terminus. A two-step PCR procedure was used for the preparation of CRMP2 ΔC503 mutants. First, C-terminal fragments were generated using ΔC503 reverse primers introducing an EcoRI site at the 3′-end and forward primers with substituted codons as follows: mutant 1, Arg471 (CGG) and Lys472 (AAG), both substituted with Ala (GCG); mutant 2, Lys480 (AAA) and Arg481 (CGC), substituted with Ala (GCA) and Ala (GCC) respectively; mutant 3, Lys483 (AAG), Arg485 (AGG), and Arg487 (AGG) each substituted with Ala (GCG). Next, the three mutated fragments were used as reverse primers in the PCR with a wild type forward primer introducing a HindIII site at the 5′-end. For the full-length mutant Arg471-Lys472, two overlapping PCR products bearing the mutated codons (nucleotides 1-1506 and 1387-1716) were first obtained by separated reaction using wild-type CRMP2 as a template. Fragment 1-1506 corresponded to ΔC503 mutant 1. Fragment 1387-1716 was generated using a mutagenic forward primer introducing the above mentioned substituted codons and a wild-type reverse primer. Both fragments were mixed and then allowed to hybridize (5 min at 50 °C) and elongate (10 min at 70 °C) for the generation of the mutated template. Finally, this template was used in a last PCR step to generate full-length mutated CRMP2, using the above described forward and reverse CRMP2 primers introducing HindIII and EcoRI sites. The correct DNA sequences of all constructs were verified. The final PCR product was cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pCMV2-FLAG vector. PC12 cells were transfected by 2 μg of purified plasmid using the Amaxa nucleofector reagent and electroporation, following precisely the manufacturer's protocol. N1E-115 cells were seeded in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium and cultured overnight. The cells were transiently transfected, in the absence of serum, using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) essentially as described (4Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T.

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were cultured in 5% serum-containing medium for 24 h and were treated for immunohistochemistry analysis. Cortical neurons from E15 mouse embryos were prepared as described (29Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. Rougon G. Allinquant B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7640-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Dissociated cells were seeded on plastic dishes coated overnight with 1.5 μg/ml poly-d-ornithine in chemically defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium free of serum with 2 mm glutamine, 9 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 33 mm glucose. The medium was supplemented with hormones and proteins (100 μg/ml transferin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 μm putrescine, 0.1% ovalbumin, and 30 nm sodium selenite). After 3 days of in vitro culture, neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) in medium without hormones and proteins. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, neurons were cultured in the presence of hormones and proteins for a further 48 h. Immunofluorescence Study and Microscopic Observation—The PC12 cells were observed 48 h after transfection using a laser-scanning confocal system (Leica TCF SP2) imaging platform. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% gelatin and 0.1% Triton X-100 before incubation with different antibodies. The cells were double-stained with polyclonal anti-FLAG (F 7425; Sigma) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluo 488 (Invitrogen) antibodies and with monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) and anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson) antibodies. For some experiments, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluo 546 (Invitrogen) was used. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, and Alexa Fluo 546-phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used for F-actin staining. For morphometric analysis, both N1E-115 cells and mouse embryo cortical neurons transfected with FLAG-CRMP2 (full-length, Δ503, and mutant 1) were viewed using the Axioplan II fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). N1E-115 cells were fixed and stained with polyclonal anti-FLAG and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluo 488 antibodies. The percentage of cells bearing neurites (length >20 μm from the cell body) among the transfected cells was measured. At least 300 cells for each expressed protein from three different experiments were examined. Cortical neurons were fixed and visualized by immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody. Non-transfected cortical neurons, used as control cells, were stained by anti-pep4 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluo 488 antibodies. The length of the longest neurite was measured as that of an axon and compared with the axon length of control neurons. At least 40 cells for each expressed protein were examined in one experiment. The axon length from three different experiments was examined. Identification of Different Isoforms of CRMP2 during Brain Development—To study different isoforms of CRMP2, a site-specific antibody recognizing residues 454-465 of CRMP2 was used (anti-pep4; Fig. 1A). The specificity of this antibody toward CRMP2, but not CRMP1, -3, -4, and -5, had previously been confirmed (26Quach T.T. Duchemin A.M. Rogemond V. Aguera M. Honnorat J. Belin M.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Mol. Cell Neurol. 2004; 25: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Besides the well known and abundant 64-kDa CRMP2, other isoforms of CRMP2 migrating as 62 and 66 kDa could be detected in embryonic brain extract as faint bands (Fig. 1C, anti-pep4), their intensity increasing at the postnatal stages. The presence of such isoforms was reported in previous studies (19Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, in embryonic brain cortex, an additional isoform presenting an apparent mass of 58 kDa was recognized by the anti-pep4 antibody (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the presence of this short isoform of CRMP2 is development-dependent, it was searched for in brain extracts at embryonic and early postnatal stages. As an internal loading control, the extent of actin was checked in all lanes using anti-actin antibody (data not shown). Anti-pep4 antibody clearly recognized a band migrating at 58 kDa in the cortex extract from embryo (stages E14, E16, and E19) as well as in the extract of early postnatal P1-P15 brain (Fig. 1C, anti-pep4). The intensity of this band decreased gradually during development, since only a faint band was recognized by the anti-pep4 antibody at stage P15 (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas other isoforms (62-66 kDa) of CRMP2B were clearly detected (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, the ratio of the 58 kDa band to 64 kDa decreased at late stages of brain development. This 58 kDa band was also detected by anti-pep4 antibody in an extract from primary cortical neuron cultured at stage E15 (Fig. 1B). In addition, a high molecular mass band (75 kDa) belonging to CRMP2A could be visualized from the P1 stage onward (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, in the adult brain, the 58 kDa band was almost absent, since a very faint band, presenting very low intensity, could be detected by the anti-pep4 antibody. However, significant intensity was detected for the 64-kDa isoform (Fig. 1, C and D). The appearance of t"

Proton binding and release occurs in the middle of the membrane at Asp-61 on transmembrane helix 2 of subunit c. Previously, the reactivity of cysteines substituted into F0 subunit a revealed two regions of aqueous access, one extending from the periplasm to the middle of the membrane and a second extending from the middle of the membrane to the cytoplasm. To further characterize aqueous accessibility at the subunit a-c interface, we have substituted Cys for residues on the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane helix 2 of subunit c and probed the accessibility to these substituted positions using thiolate-reactive reagents. The Cys substitutions tested were uniformly inhibited by Ag+ treatment, which suggested widespread aqueous access to this generally hydrophobic region. Sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and methanethiosulfonate reagents was localized to a membrane-embedded pocket surrounding Asp-61. The cG58C substitution was profoundly inhibited by all the reagents tested, including membrane impermeant methanethiosulfonate reagents. Further studies of the highly reactive cG58C substitution revealed that NEM modification of a single c subunit in the oligomeric c-ring was sufficient to cause complete inhibition. In addition, NEM modification of subunit c was dependent upon the presence of subunit a. The results described here provide further evidence for an aqueous-accessible region at the interface of subunits a and c extending from the middle of the membrane to the cytoplasm.

F1F0 ATP synthase utilizes the energy stored in an H+ or Na+ electrochemical gradient to synthesize ATP in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (1Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The ATP synthase complex is composed of two sectors, i.e. a water-soluble F1 sector that is bound to a membrane-embedded F0 sector. In bacteria F1 is composed of five subunits in a α3β3γδ∈ ratio and contains three catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis centered at the α/β subunit interfaces (4Weber J. Senior A.

Ion translocation through F0 drives rotation of a cylindrical ring of c-subunits which is coupled to rotation of the γ subunit within the (αβ)3 hexamer of F1 to force conformational changes in the three active sites and catalyze synthesis of ATP by the binding change mechanism (9Noji H.

A recent high resolution structure of the Na+-translocating c11-ring from Ilyobacter tartaricus defined the Na+ binding site formed between two interacting c subunits (13Meier T. Polzer P.

The essential Na+ binding Glu residue, which corresponds to Asp-61 in E. coli, lies on TMH2 in the middle of the lipid bilayer. Subunit a consists of five transmembrane helices, four of which likely interact as a four helix bundle (14Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). During ion translocation through F0, the essential Arg-210 on TMH4 of subunit a is postulated to facilitate the protonation and deprotonation of Asp-61 of subunit c and cause the rotation of the c-ring past the stationary subunit a (16Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Cysteine substitution mutagenesis has been widely used to probe aqueous accessible positions in transmembrane proteins (17Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The reactivity of a substituted cysteine to thiolate-directed probes provides an indication of aqueous accessibility since the highly reactive thiolate form is preferentially formed in an aqueous environment. The method has been applied previously to the alternating access model of LacY using N-ethylmaleimide as a probe (18Kaback H.R. Dunten R. Frillingos S. Venkatesan P. Kwaw I. Zhang W. Ermolova N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and to map pore-forming residues in a K+ channel using silver ion as a probe (19Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The aqueous accessibility of the five TMHs in subunit a of E. coli F0 have been probed using silver ion and NEM. The results suggest the presence of an aqueous accessible channel in subunit a in the center of TMHs 2–5 extending from the periplasm to the center of the membrane (20Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protons entering through this periplasmic access channel are postulated to bind to the essential Asp-61 residues of the c-ring, and the protonated subunit is then carried through a full rotation before the protons exit by a still uncertain pathway to the cytoplasm.During H+-driven ATP synthesis, two models for the cytoplasmic exit pathway for H+ have been proposed. The models alternatively propose that the ions exit to the cytoplasm either through a second half-channel in subunit a (20Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies of the c-ring from the I. tartaricus enzyme indicate that Na+ can access Glu-65 in the absence of other F0 subunits, suggesting an intrinsic channel in subunit c (23von Ballmoos C. Meier T. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5581-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Meier T. Matthey U. von Ballmoos C. Vonck J. Krug von Nidda T. Kuhlbrandt W. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, no such channel was apparent in the crystal structure of the c11 ring (13Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Chemical modification studies of Cys-substituted subunit a of E. coli revealed an aqueous-accessible surface of TMH4, including the essential Arg-210 residue, which extended from the center of the membrane to the cytoplasm and suggested that the ion exit channel may lie at the a-c interface (20Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To further define the role of subunit c in providing aqueous access to the cytoplasm, we have extended our probing of thiolate reactivity of substituted Cys to TMH2 of subunit c using various thiolate-reactive reagents. Despite the hydrophobicity of the region, a large proportion of the substituted Cys from M65C at the center of the membrane to the cytoplasmic membrane surface proved to be reactive with Ag+. Furthermore, reagent access to at least one position in this membrane-embedded region of subunit c was facilitated by subunit a. The experiments provide more information on the aqueous pathway by which H3O+ may be transported through F0 and provide additional evidence that subunit a participates directly in the ion exit pathway from cAsp-61 at the center of the membrane to the cytoplasm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis—A two-step PCR method that utilizes a mutagenic primer and two wild type primers (25Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 203-215PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate the cysteine substitutions in subunit c. The template plasmid, pCMA113, codes the eight structural genes of F1F0, wherein all endogenous cysteines are replaced with alanine or serine and subunit a is modified with a C-terminal His tag (20Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutant PCR fragments were transferred into pCMA113 between the BsrGI and BssHII (or PpuMI) restriction sites. The presence of each substitution was confirmed by DNA sequencing through the ligation sites. An in-frame deletion of subunit a (uncB) was combined with the cG58C substitution by amplifying the deletion region from the chromosomal uncB deletion strain VF245 (26Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment containing the deletion was then inserted into the pCMA113 plasmid between the HindIII and BsrGI restriction sites. The presence of the ΔuncB deletion and the cG58C substitution were confirmed by DNA sequencing through the deletion fragment ligation sites and the uncE gene encoding G58C subunit c. All mutant plasmids were transferred into the chromosomal unc operon deletion strain JWP292 (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Growth yields of the mutant strains on glucose minimal medium and succinate minimal medium agar plates were assayed as described previously (20Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Membrane Preparation—JWP292 transformant strains were grown in M63 minimal medium containing 0.6% glucose, 0.2 mm uracil, 1 mm arginine, 2 μg/ml thiamine, 40 μm 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 10% LB broth. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in the late exponential stage of growth. Cell pellets were suspended in TMG acetate (50 mm Tris acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease I and disrupted by passage through a French press at 108 nt/m2. Cell debris was cleared by low speed centrifugation of the lysate at 7700 × gmax, and membranes were collected by high speed centrifugation of the cleared lysate at 193,000 × gmax. Membranes were washed once with TMG acetate and then resuspended in TMG acetate and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry assay (27Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).ATP-driven ACMA Fluorescence Quenching—Aliquots of membranes prepared from JWP292 transformant strains (1.6 mg at 10 mg/ml) were suspended in 3.2 ml HMK buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm Mg(NO3)2, 10 mm KNO3, pH 7.5) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. ACMA was added to 0.3 μg/ml, and fluorescence quenching was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of 25 mm ATP, pH 7. Each experiment was terminated by adding nigericin to 0.5 μg/ml. The restored level of fluorescence after the addition of nigericin was used as the base-line fluorescence from which the relative quenching of the mutant membranes was calculated. For treatment with silver, AgNO3 was added to the HMK buffer to 40 μm before the addition of membranes. For treatment with NEM, NEM was added to a 1.6-mg aliquot of membranes in 160 μl of TMG acetate buffer to a final concentration of 5 mm. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, treated membranes were diluted into HMK buffer, and the quenching reaction was carried out as described above. Treatments with MTS derivatives were performed as for NEM treatment using variable concentrations and incubation times. Solutions of MTS derivatives were dissolved immediately before use in DMSO solvent. DMSO concentration ranged from 2.5 to 5% during the incubation period and from 0.1 to 0.2% during the measurement of fluorescence.[14C]NEM Labeling of Subunit c—Membranes prepared from JWP292 transformant strains were diluted to 33 mg/ml in TMG acetate, pH 7.5, to a final volume of 3 ml. A 50-μCi aliquot of N-[14C]ethylmaleimide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, specific activity = 33.8 mCi/mmol) was transferred from pentane solution into 200 μl of TMG acetate, pH 7.5, by mixing the pentane solution with the buffer, allowing the phases to separate and evaporating the pentane upper phase under a stream of argon. Membranes were labeled with 50 μCi of [14C]NEM at a final concentration of 0.51 mm. The labeling reaction was stopped after 15 min at room temperature by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 10 mm and unlabeled NEM to 20 mm.Purification of Subunit c—Subunit c was purified from labeled membranes as previously described (29Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3896-3903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Labeled membranes were slowly mixed with 100 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) at 4 °C for 1 h and then filtered through Whatman #1 filter paper. To the filtrate, one-fifth volume of H2O was added and mixed gently at 4 °C. The phases were allowed to separate overnight at 4 °C. The upper phase was removed by suction, and the phase interface was washed with 10 ml of theoretical upper phase mixture (CHCl3:CH3OH: H2O in proportion 3:47:48). One volume of CHCl3 was added to the lower phase with stirring while adding the minimal amount of methanol necessary to keep the solution clear. This solution was evaporated to dryness in a rotoevaporator at 37 °C. The dried residue was dissolved in CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) and mixed with 4.5 volumes of chilled ethyl ether. After incubation overnight at -20 °C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and redissolved in CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1). This “proteolipid” solution was applied to a carboxymethyl cellulose cation exchange column equilibrated with 6 bed volumes of CHCl3: CH3OH (2:1). The column was then washed with 2 bed volumes of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) and one bed volume of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1). Subunit c was eluted as a single peak with CHCl3:CH3OH: H2O (5:5:1). The subunit c concentration in pooled elution fractions was determined using a Lowry assay and the extinction coefficient calculated for purified subunit c previously (30Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6630-6637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Electrophoresis—Subunit c in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (5:5:1) was transferred to aqueous solution by precipitation in 10 volumes chilled acetone. The acetone precipitate was incubated in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4% (w/v) SDS, 12% (w/v) glycerol, pH 8.0) for at least 1 h at room temperature before electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE was carried out in a Tricine-buffered system according to the method of Schaegger and von Jagow (31Schaegger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, sealed in cellophane, and exposed to a phosphor storage screen for 48 h. Amounts of protein and radioactivity were quantitated using Scion Image.ESI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Purified subunit c in CHCl3: CH3OH:H2O (5:5:1) was directly injected into an Agilent LC/MSD TOF mass spectrometer.RESULTSCharacterization of Cysteine Substitutions—Residues on the cytoplasmic half of cTMH2 were mutated to cysteine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a plasmid wherein all endogenous cysteines in F1 were substituted with alanine and wherein the single cysteine in subunit b of F0 was substituted with serine. Wild type subunits a and c lack endogenous cysteine. The mutant plasmid was transferred into the E. coli strain JWP292 in which the unc (atp) operon encoding F1F0 was deleted from the chromosome. Most of the cysteine substitution mutants grew nearly as well as wild type on both glucose and succinate minimal media (Table 1). Inverted membrane vesicles from most of the cysteine substitution strains were functional in ATP-driven proton pumping as assayed by ACMA fluorescence quenching (Table 1). The L59C substitution abolished growth on succinate, the indicator used here for a functional oxidative phosphorylation system, and eliminated ATP-driven proton pumping. The F54C and I55C substitutions led to a puzzling phenotype in which the mutants grew well on glucose and succinate minimal media but failed to carry out ATP-driven proton pumping.TABLE 1Characterization of cysteine substitution mutantsSubstitutionColony size on succinateaAverage colony size of wild type is 2.2 mmGrowth yield on glucosebExpressed as % of wild type growth yield in 0.04% glucose liquid medium.

Mutants F54C, I55C, and L59C could not be tested due to the lack of function in this assay. Ag+ and NEM react preferentially with the thiolate form of the cysteine side chain, which should predominate in an aqueous versus a lipid exposed environment (19Lu Q. Miller C.

(1973) The Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Sulfhydryl Group in Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, Oxford, Pergemon PressGoogle Scholar). Inhibition of proton pumping is thought to reflect obstruction of the proton translocation pathway on reaction of the reagent with the substituted cysteine (20Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All 10 of the residues tested were strongly inhibited by 40 μm AgNO3 (Fig. 1 and Table 2). NEM inhibited proton pumping by the G58C mutant by >90% and proton pumping by the P64C and M65C mutants by ∼20% (Fig. 1 and Table 2). In experiments that are not shown with the G58C mutant, silver caused maximum inhibition within 30 s of treatment, and NEM inhibition reached a maximum within 5 min of treatment.TABLE 2Sensitivity of mutants to sulfhydryl-reactive reagents MTSM, MTS-methyl; MTSCE, MTS-carboxyethyl.SubstitutionInhibition of ATP driven quenchingaEach determination is the average of ≥2 trials.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and can be widely derivatized to make them versatile probes for aqueous accessibility. We probed the substituted Cys with the MTS derivatives shown in Fig. 2 by testing for inhibition of proton pumping as above. The results are summarized in Table 2. Maximum inhibition by MTS reagents occurred within 1 min of reagent addition, which is consistent with the published reactivity of these reagents with cysteines in other proteins (35Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 36Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Every derivative of MTS tested profoundly inhibited proton pumping by the G58C mutant (Fig. 3, A and B). MTSES and MTSET significantly inhibited proton pumping by both the M57C and G58C mutants and slightly inhibited proton pumping by the Q52C mutant. Inhibition by MTSES and MTSET in this region of the protein is of particular interest given that these reagents cannot cross liposomes or the E. coli inner membrane (35Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10491-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, MTSES and MTSET must be accessing residues 57 and 58 from the “cytoplasmic” side of the inverted vesicle. On testing inhibition of the cG58C mutant by MTS reagents over a range of concentrations, the positively charged reagents were found to cause greater inhibition at lower concentrations than the negatively charged reagents of similar size (Fig. 3C). The positively charged but membrane-permeant MTSEA (35Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was very inhibitory with the M57C, A62C, I63C, P64C, and M65C mutants but caused little or no inhibition with the Q52C, F53C, V56C, and V60C mutants.FIGURE 2Reaction of MTS reagents with a cysteine thiolate in a polypeptide chain.

MTS-methyl (MTSM) and the neutral form of MTS-carboxyethyl (MTSCE) are also expected to be membrane-permeable. MTSES and MTSET are membrane-impermeable (35Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G.

Radioactive labeling studies were conducted with 0.5 mm [14C]NEM, a concentration that resulted in 90% inhibition of proton pumping versus the maximal inhibition of 94% seen with 5 mm NEM. Subunit c was purified from [14C]NEM-labeled, inverted membrane vesicles, and the incorporation of radioactivity into subunit c was detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and also quantitated by scintillation counting. A determination of [14C]NEM incorporation per mg of purified subunit c revealed that the ratio of labeled subunits per total subunits was 0.06–0.07 (Fig. 4A) and suggested that only one monomer per decameric c-ring need react for maximal inhibition.FIGURE 4Stoichiometry of NEM modification of G58C subunit c.

https://openalex.org/W1966585633,"Although pancreatic exocrine acinar cells have the potential to transdifferentiate into pancreatic endocrine cells, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that intracellular signaling pathways, including those involving MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase, are activated by enzymatic dissociation of pancreatic acinar cells and that spherical cell clusters are formed by cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion during transdifferentiation. Inhibition of PI3-kinase by LY294002 prevents spheroid formation by degrading E-cadherin and β-catenin, blocking transdifferentiation into insulin-secreting cells. In addition, neutralizing antibody against E-cadherin suppresses the induction of genes characteristic of pancreatic β-cells. We also show that loss of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion induces and maintains a dedifferentiated state in isolated pancreatic acinar cells. Thus, disruption and remodeling of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is critical in pancreatic exocrine-to-endocrine transdifferentiation, in which the PI3-kinase pathway plays an essential role. Although pancreatic exocrine acinar cells have the potential to transdifferentiate into pancreatic endocrine cells, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that intracellular signaling pathways, including those involving MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase, are activated by enzymatic dissociation of pancreatic acinar cells and that spherical cell clusters are formed by cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion during transdifferentiation.

Although it has long been thought that the terminally differentiated state of cells is fixed, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that even functionally differentiated cells in adults can change their phenotype under certain conditions (1Tosh D.

Transdifferentiation, the conversion of one already differentiated cell type to another, is a prominent example of phenotypic plasticity of adult cells. In general, such phenotypic changes occur in tissues with chronic damage and in situations of tissue regeneration (2Eguchi G. Kodama R. Curr. Opin.

In addition, hepatocyte-like cells (liver metaplasia) appear in human pancreatic cancer in some cases (7Yeung R.S. Weese J.L. Hoffman J.P. Solin L.J. Paul A.R. Engstrom P.F. Litwin S. Kowalyshyn M.J.

However, the precise roles of these signals in transdifferentiation are not clear. In addition, putative progenitor cell markers such as nestin (13Means A.L. Meszoely I.M. Suzuki K. Miyamoto Y.

Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 907-914.17Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have been detected in transdifferentiating pancreatic acinar cells, suggesting that dedifferentiated intermediate cells were generated in the course of the transdifferentiation, as seen in lens or tail regeneration in amphibia (2Eguchi G. Kodama R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Echeverri K. Tanaka E.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, such dedifferentiated states are transient, and acinar cell-derived intermediate cells have not been obtained and characterized. Thus, the details of the process of transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells are largely still unknown. Clarification of the signaling mechanism of the transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells should both provide new insight into the mechanism of normal development of pancreas and cell type specification and facilitate the development of cell-based therapy in diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of pancreatic exocrine-to-endocrine transdifferentiation in adult mice in vitro. We found that formation of spherical three-dimensional structures by cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion plays a critical role in the induction of β-cell-specific gene expression in acinar-derived cells and that PI3-kinase activity is involved in both the formation of spheroids and the completion of transdifferentiation into insulin-secreting cells. We also show that a dedifferentiated state can be induced in isolated pancreatic acinar cells by inhibiting the restoration of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the presence of PI3-kinase inhibitor. Isolation and Culture of Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from streptozotocin-injected 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice as described (14Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15116-15121Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 17Okuno M. Minami K. Okumachi A. Miyawaki K. Yokoi N. Toyokuni S. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: E158-E165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To remove almost all the β-cells, we used an excessive dosage of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for this strain, by which more than a half of the mice die within a week without insulin treatment. Mice with blood glucose concentration above 350 mg/dl were used for the present study. Pancreas was digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics) and subjected to discontinuous Ficoll (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation. The exocrine acinar cell-enriched fraction recovered as a pellet was stained with sterilized dithizone solution (0.1 mg/ml) to confirm that there was no contamination of pre-existing pancreatic β-cells. The fraction contained >90% of acinar cells and ∼5% of ductal cells. Only a trace amount (<0.001% of normal pancreas) of mRNA expressions of both insulin 1 and insulin 2 were detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis, indicating that contamination of pancreatic β-cells in this fraction was negligible. The purified acinar-enriched exocrine cells were precultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum for 6 h. Floating cells were then collected and replated on low cell-binding dishes (Nalge Nunc) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, 20 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. As found in previous studies (14Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2007; 292: E158-E165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the total cell number decreased to ∼25% of that in the initial preparation, and cell proliferation was rarely detected under these conditions. To inhibit spheroid formation of isolated pancreatic acinar cells, the neutralizing antibody against E-cadherin (ECCD-1: Takara) was added to the culture at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. Rat IgG2b isotype control (R&D Systems) was used as a negative control. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research Committees of Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine and Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. Generation and Infection of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Mouse inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF4 (ICAT) cDNA (obtained by RT-PCR) and Myc-His-tagged mouse myr-Akt1 cDNA (purchased from Upstate Biotechnology) were cloned into pENTR vector (Invitrogen). Adenoviruses were generated by using ViraPower adenoviral expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were infected with these adenoviruses on day 0 (the day of cell isolation) for 6 h. Multiplicity of infection is indicated in the legend for Fig. 1. Adenovirus expressing Cre-recombinase was used as a negative control. Immunofluorescence—Cells were pelleted and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen sections were stained with antibodies against E-cadherin (ECCD-2: Takara) (1:200), β-catenin (Cell Signaling Technologies) (1:100), or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (Chemicon) (1:500). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488- or 546-conjugated IgGs (Molecular Probes) (1:400). For F-actin staining, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used. Images were obtained by a fluorescent microscope (IX-71; Olympus) equipped with an objective lens (UPLFLN ×20 and ×40) and a CCD camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics). Deconvoluted images were obtained by BZ9000 microscope (Keyence). Figures were then generated using PhotoShop 7.0 and Illustrator 10 (Adobe). Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Total cellular proteins were extracted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxysholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai). Subcellular fractionation of the cells was performed by using a ProteoExtract subcellular extraction kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay system (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were probed with antibodies against E-cadherin (H-108, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; RDI-ECADHERabm: Fitzgerald); β-catenin (catalog number 9587 (C-terminal antigen); Cell Signaling Technology; ab2982 (full-length antigen, AbCam); NCAM (AB5032, Chemicon); Erk1/2 (catalog number 9102, Cell Signaling Technology); phospho-Erk1/2 (catalog number 9101, Cell Signaling Technology); p38 MAP kinase (catalog number 9212, Cell Signaling Technology); phospho-p38 (catalog number 9211, Cell Signaling Technology); JNK (catalog number 9252, Cell Signaling Technology); phospho-JNK (catalog number 9251, Cell Signaling Technology); Akt (catalog number 9272, Cell Signaling Technology); or phosph-Akt (catalog number 9271 and catalog number 9275, Cell Signaling Technology). RNA Analyses—Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with DNase I (Qiagen), the RNA was reverse-transcribed by ReverTra Ace (Toyobo), and the resultant cDNA was subjected to PCR using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers were designed such that the amplified regions spanned introns in the gene, except for Kir6.2, which has no intron in the protein-coding region. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 59 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s, with hot start at 95 °C for 10 min. Nucleotide sequences of the primers were described previously (14Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15116-15121Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) with a model 7300 real-time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Measurement of the expression levels of 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as internal control. Measurement of Insulin Secretion—Cells in the culture were harvested and resuspended with the Krebs-HEPES buffer (119 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 1.19 mm MgCl2, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were preincubated in the buffer with 3 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, aliquots of the cell suspension were incubated for a further 60 min with various secretagogues as indicated. After incubation, the solutions were collected to measure insulin concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Shibayagi). Total protein was extracted in 1 n NaOH, and the concentration was determined using Coomassie Brilliant Blue-G250 reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Intracellular Signals Essential for Transdifferentiation of Pancreatic Acinar Cells—We have previously shown that enzymatic dissociation of pancreas causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in pancreatic acinar cells, leading to activation of its downstream intracellular signals and enabling the isolated acinar cells to transdifferentiate into insulin-secreting cells even without the addition of EGF (14Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15116-15121Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although activation of the EGF receptor is essential for the transdifferentiation of acinar cells into insulin-secreting cells, it is not clear which intracellular signals are responsible for the transdifferentiation. To further confirm and quantify signal activations by isolation of pancreatic acinar cells, we investigated phosphorylation of the major signaling molecules downstream of the EGF receptor using phospho-specific antibodies. Phosphorylated forms of Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and Akt were found to be increased in dissociated pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 1A). Quantification by densitometric analysis of the blots showed that the increments in phosphorylation all were statistically significant (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the MAPK and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways are activated during the acinar cell isolation procedure. The addition of EGF in the culture enhanced and/or prolonged activation of the signals (data not shown). We then determined which signals are critical for transdifferentiation of acinar cells into insulin-secreting cells by utilizing inhibitors specific for each pathway (Fig. 1B). Among the inhibitors used, LY294002, a specific PI3-kinase inhibitor, showed the strongest effect on transdifferentiation (Fig. 1C). Gene expressions of insulins (both 1 and 2), glucokinase, SUR1, and Kir6.2 were not induced in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 1C). Pdx1 expression was markedly diminished under these conditions (Fig. 1C). No insulin secretion was observed in acinar-derived cells cultured with LY294002 (data not shown). In addition, introduction of constitutively activated Akt (myrAkt) (21Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) by adenovirus under inhibition of PI3-kinase induced expressions of insulins, glucokinase, and pdx1 (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that the expressions of these genes are regulated by PI3-kinase/Akt signaling in transdifferentiating pancreatic acinar cells. Indeed, Akt inhibitor IV, an Akt-specific inhibitor, prevented induction of these genes (Fig. 1E). Because the expressions of SUR1 and Kir6.2 were suppressed by the Akt inhibitor (Fig. 1E) and were not recovered by gene transfer of constitutively activated Akt (Fig. 1D), activation of Akt is necessary but not sufficient for the expressions of SUR1 and Kir6.2. In addition, these results demonstrate that activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is essential for transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells into insulin-secreting cells. Destruction and Restoration of Intercellular Contacts in Isolated Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Collagenase digestion resulted in dissociation of pancreatic acinus into single cells or small clumps (Fig. 2A, left panel). When cultured in suspension with the addition of EGF, the conditions under which transdifferentiation into insulin-secreting cells occurs, the isolated acinar cells formed three-dimensional spherical structures within a few days (Fig. 2A, middle panel), as described previously (14Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15116-15121Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Since cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is essential for intercellular contact of epithelial cells (22Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the expression and subcellular localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin, the major components of adherens junctions, were examined. In native pancreatic acinar cells, both E-cadherin and β-catenin were localized exclusively in the intercellular region of plasma membranes (Fig. 2B, left panels). Some loss of E-cadherin was detected in isolated acinar cells, and strikingly, most β-catenin was dissociated from E-cadherin and distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2B, left middle panels). However, after 4 days of culture in the presence of EGF, cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion recovered, as evidenced by membrane distribution of both E-cadherin and β-catenin in these acinar-derived cells (Fig. 2B, right middle panels). Pancreatic acinar cells are known to be highly polarized. Indeed, F-actin is predominantly localized to apical membrane in native pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 2C, upper panels). However, the cultured acinar cells that formed spheroids exhibited uniform membrane distribution of F-actin (Fig. 2C, right upper panel), indicating alteration of the cell polarity during the transdifferentiation. The honey-comb appearance of F-actin staining in transdifferentiated acinar cell clusters resembles that in islet cells (Fig. 2C, upper panels). The difference in cell polarity between endocrine (islet) and exocrine (acinar) cells has been shown to be caused, at least in part, by the expression of NCAM (23Esni F. Taljedal I.B. Perl A.K. Cremer H. Christofori G. Semb H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islet cells express NCAM, but acinar cells do not (Fig. 2C, lower panels). Interestingly, NCAM expression was induced in isolated pancreatic acinar cells by culture (Fig. 2, D and E), and many of the transdifferentiated acinar cells were positive for NCAM (Fig. 2C, right lower panel). These results demonstrate that the cell polarity seen in native pancreatic acinar cells is first lost and then remodeled to islet-like membrane organization and suggest that induction of NCAM expression has a role in this alteration of cell polarity. Role of PI3-Kinase in Cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Adhesion— Pancreatic acinar cells cultured in the presence of LY294002 did not form spherical structures (Fig. 2B, right panels). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that E-cadherin was expressed at the intercellular contacts of some cell clumps, but many of the cells were negative for E-cadherin 4 days after culture with LY294002 (Fig. 2B, right panels). Expression of β-catenin was rarely detected (Fig. 2B, right panels). These results demonstrate that recovery of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in isolated pancreatic acinar cells is dependent on PI3-kinase activity. In the absence of PI3-kinase inhibitor, expressions of E-cadherin and β-catenin were increased by culture at both protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, although mRNA levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin were not decreased, both proteins were decreased to almost undetectable levels by culture in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 3, E–I), suggesting the involvement of posttranscriptional events in the loss of these molecules. Interestingly, as the full-length form of E-cadherin was decreased, a low molecular weight band was increased (Fig. 3F; arrow). Using a different antibody (purchased from Fitzgerald Industries International), it became clear that the full-length form of E-cadherin decreased, whereas lower molecular weight bands gradually increased in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 3G), indicating that E-cadherin was degraded during culture. In addition, although only the full-length form of β-catenin was detected by the antibody against the C-terminal peptide of β-catenin (catalog number 9587), bands of some smaller molecules were detected when the antibody against full-length β-catenin (purchased from AbCam) was used (Fig. 3J), indicating that β-catenin also was degraded during culture under these conditions. Degradation products of β-catenin also were detected in the presence of EGF without LY294002 when the antibody from AbCam was used, but the full-length protein was predominant at day 4 (data not shown). These findings suggest that the recovery of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which was disrupted by the isolation of the pancreatic acinar cells, depends on PI3-kinase activity, most probably because of its prevention of the degradation of both E-cadherin and β-catenin. Suppressed Induction of β-Cell-specific Genes by Loss of Cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Adhesion—Since intercellular contact and communication are involved in both cellular functions and differentiation (24Potter E. Bergwitz C. Brabant G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 207-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and transdifferentiation in pancreatic acinar cells. ECCD-1, a monoclonal antibody to mouse E-cadherin, has been shown to inhibit cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (25Kanno Y. Sasaki Y. Shiba Y. Yoshida-Noro C. Takeichi M. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the presence of ECCD-1 (200 μg/ml), isolated pancreatic acinar cells did not form spherical structures (Fig. 4A), and the inductions of genes characteristic of pancreatic β-cells, including insulins, glucokinase, SUR1, and Kir6.2, were significantly reduced (Fig. 4B). In contrast, transcription factors seen in the early developing pancreas, such as Pdx1, HNF6, Foxa2, and Nkx2.2, were similarly up-regulated regardless of the presence of the neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4B). Amylase expression was drastically decreased in all conditions. Induction of CK19 tended to be increased in the presence of ECCD-1, but the difference was not significant (Fig. 4B). Rat IgG2b, used as a negative control, had no effect on morphology and gene expressions (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that spheroid formation by cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion facilitates transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells into insulin-secreting cells. Dedifferentiation of Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Although the expressions of β-cell-specific genes were markedly suppressed by the loss of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion caused by the addition of LY294002 or ECCD-1, transcription factors such as Foxa2, HNF6, and Nkx2.2 were induced regardless of the presence or absence of the inhibitors (Figs. 1C and 4B). This suggests that isolated pancreatic acinar cells dedifferentiate but do not undergo complete transdifferentiation under the condition of disrupted cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. To investigate this possibility, pancreatic acinar cells cultured in the presence of LY294002 were subjected to gene expression profiling by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. Because the addition of the PI3-kinase inhibitor damages the cells, nicotinamide (10 mm) was added to improve cell survival. Nicotinamide has been shown to prevent cell damage due to activation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase/polymerase (26Yamamoto H. Uchigata Y. Okamoto H. Nature. 1981; 294: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Indeed, the addition of nicotinamide doubled viable cell number in our culture system (14Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K.

https://openalex.org/W2086921213,"Morphine, the principal active agent in opium, is not restricted to plants, but is also present in different animal tissues and cell types, including the mammalian brain. In fact, its biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated in a human neural cell line. These data suggest a role for morphine in brain physiology (e.g., neurotransmission), but this hypothesis remains a matter of debate. Recently, using the adrenal neuroendocrine chromaffin cell model, we have shown the presence of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) in secretory granules and their secretion products, leading us to propose that these endogenous alkaloids might represent new neuroendocrine factors. Here, we investigate the potential function of endogenous alkaloids in the central nervous system.Microscopy, molecular biology, electrophysiology, and proteomic tools were applied to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (i) to characterize morphine and M6G, and (ii) to demonstrate the presence of the UDP-glucuronyltransferase 2B7 enzyme, which is responsible for the formation of M6G from morphine. We show that morphine is secreted in response to nicotine stimulation via a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism involving specific storage and release mechanisms. We also show that morphine and M6G at concentrations as low as 10(-10) M are able to evoke specific naloxone-reversible membrane currents, indicating possible autocrine/paracrine regulation in SH-SY5Y cells. Microscopy and proteomic approaches were employed to detect and quantify endogenous morphine in the mouse brain. Morphine is present in the hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum at concentration ranging from 1.45 to 7.5 pmol/g. In the cerebellum, morphine immunoreactivity is localized to GABA basket cells and their termini, which form close contacts on Purkinje cell bodies.The presence of morphine in the brain and its localization in particular areas lead us to conclude that it has a specific function in neuromodulation and/or neurotransmission. Furthermore, its presence in cerebellar basket cell termini suggests that morphine has signaling functions in Purkinje cells that remain to be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W1979770366,"Annexin A2, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, is abundantly expressed in alveolar type II cells where it plays a role in lung surfactant secretion. Nevertheless, little is known about the details of its cellular pathways. To identify annexin A2-regulated or associated proteins, we silenced endogenous annexin A2 expression in rat alveolar type II cells by RNA interference and assessed the change of the cellular transcriptome by DNA microarray analysis. The loss of annexin A2 resulted in the change of 61 genes. Thirteen of the selected genes (11 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated genes) were validated by real time quantitative PCR. When the loss of rat annexin A2 was rescued by overexpressing EGFP-tagged human annexin A2, six of seven selected targets returned to their normal expression level, indicating that these genes are indeed annexin A2-associated targets. One of the targets, Rab14, co-immunoprecipitated with annexin A2. Rab14 also co-localized in part with annexin A2 and lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells. The silencing of Rab14 resulted in a decrease in surfactant secretion, suggesting that Rab14 may play a role in surfactant secretion.

The silencing of Rab14 resulted in a decrease in surfactant secretion, suggesting that Rab14 may play a role in surfactant secretion. The alveolar epithelium is composed of morphologically and functionally distinct type I and II cells. Type I cells provide the bulk of the surface area for gas exchange, whereas type II cells secrete lung surfactant to maintain mechanical stability of the alveoli (1Dietl P. Haller T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Fehrenbach H. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 3Andreeva A.V. Kutuzov M.A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: L259-L271Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Lung surfactant is stored and secreted by exocytosis of lamellar bodies, which are specialized organelles found in type II cells. Exocytosis of the lamellar bodies is triggered by several intracellular signaling pathways. A key component of signaling involves the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in type II cells (4Ichimura H. Parthasarathi K. Lindert J. Bhattacharya J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: L596-L601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Haller T. Auktor K. Frick M. Mair N. Dietl P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L893-L900PubMed Google Scholar). Because lung surfactant secretion is regulated by Ca2+ signals, it is important to identify Ca2+-regulated proteins for exocytosis. Annexins are a family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. More than 50 different annexin isoforms have been identified (6Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 7Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Each annexin consists of a short variable N-terminal segment and a conserved C-terminal core domain. They have unique Ca2+-binding sites, which enable them to bind with negatively charged lipids. Annexins participate in many membrane-related events, such as the organization of membrane domains, the linkages of membrane-cytoskeleton, exocytosis and endocytosis, and the regulation of ion fluxes (7Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Annexin A2 is abundant in alveolar type II cells. Several studies have indicated that annexin A2 is involved in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis (8Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Umbrecht-Jenck E. Knight D. Gerke V. Bader M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1108-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Ali S.M. Geisow M.J. Burgoyne R.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Knop M. Aareskjold E. Bode G. Gerke V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2982-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In permeabilized chromaffin cells, the time-dependent loss of secretory capacity can be blocked by the addition of annexin A2 to the culture medium (9Ali S.M. Geisow M.J. Burgoyne R.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Knockdown of annexin A2 reduces the Ca2+-evoked exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells (10Knop M. Aareskjold E. Bode G. Gerke V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2982-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In alveolar type II cells, accumulating evidence supports a role for annexin A2 in controlling the fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane and promoting surfactant secretion (11Chattopadhyay S.

Signal. 1999; 11: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of annexin A2 action in this process, especially in relation to its targets and biological pathways. In this study, the expression of annexin A2 in rat type II cells was silenced by adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: shRNA, short hairpin RNA; siRNA, short interfering RNA; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; SAM, significance of microarray; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RNAi, RNA interference. to identify annexin A2-related genes at a genomic level. The genes that were up- or down-regulated because of the loss of annexin A2 were identified by the significance of microarray (SAM) test. Thirteen selected genes were validated by real time quantitative PCR, and six were further confirmed by rescuing the loss of annexin A2 with overexpression of human annexin A2. Most of the genes have not been previously reported as annexin A2-related genes. Of great interest is Rab14, which physically interacts with annexin A2 and is functionally related to annexin A2-mediated surfactant secretion. This finding provides another piece to the puzzle of the mechanisms of lung surfactant secretion and will help guide future experiments in this field of research. Alveolar Type II Cell Isolation and Culture—Type II cells were isolated from 180-to 200-g Sprague-Dawley rats, according to the method of Dobbs et al. (15Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar). The purities of type II cells preparations were >90% as determined by the modified Papanicolaou staining. The viability of these cells was over 92%. To maintain the phenotype, isolated type II cells were cultured in an air-liquid model as described before (16Mason R.J. Lewis M.C. Edeen K.E. McCormick-Shannon K. Nielsen L.D. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L249-L258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Construction of RNA Interference and Overexpression Vectors— A new pK4-shRNA vector was used to silence gene efficiently, in which the simultaneous expression of four different shRNA sequences was driven by four different polymerase III promoters (human U6, H1, 7SK, and mouse U6) in a single vector (Fig. 1A) as described previously (17Gou D. Weng T. Wang Y. Wang Z. Zhang H. Gao L. Chen Z. Wang P. Liu L. J. Gene Med. 2007; 9: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two sets of four siRNA sequences against rat annexin A2 were selected for constructing the K4 vectors for silencing annexin A2 (Fig. 1B, Ad.K4-shAIIa and Ad.K4-shAIIb). One set of four siRNA sequences targeting to rat Rab14 at the positions 11–31, 111–131, 139–159, and 438–456 were used to silence Rab14 (Ad.K4-shRab14). The control vector, Ad.K4-shCon, contains four siRNAs without obvious homologies to mammalian genes (5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′, 5′-GACAGCTAGGTTATCACGATC-3′, 5′-TGCGTTAGCTGCGTCAAGCAT-3′, and 5′-ACTTACTGTGCGTAGTTAGCC-3′). To construct overexpression vectors, full-length human annexin A2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from the I.M.A.G.E. clone of 3535154 with the primer set of 5′-GAGGATCCATGTCTACTGTTCACGAA-3′ and 5′-GGACTAGTTCATCTCCACCACACA-3′. The full-length cDNA sequences of id1, p55cdc, retnla, and prdx6 were PCR-amplified from cDNA of rat type II cells with the corresponding primer sets as follows: 5′-GAGGATCCATGAAGGTCGCCAGTAGCAGTG-3′ and 5′-TGGACTAGTGATTTGCGACACAAGATGCG-3′ (for id1); 5′-GAGGATCCATGGCGCAGTTCGTGTTCGAGAGCGATTTG-3′ and 5′-GACTAGTGACCGGATGCCTTGGTGGATGAGGCTAC-3′ (for p55cdc); 5′-GAGGATCCATGAAGACTGCAACCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-TGGACTAGTGAGGACAGTTGGCAGCAG-3′ (for retnla); and 5′-GAAGATCTATGCCCGGAGGGCTGCTTCTC-3′ and 5′-GACTAGTGAAGGCTGGGGCGTATAACGGA-3′ (for prdx6). After double digestion with BamHI and SpeI, human annexin A2, rat id1, rat p55cdc, rat retnla, and rat prdx6 were cloned into our previously reported pENTR/CMV-EGFP vector through corresponding sites (18Gou D. Narasaraju T. Chintagari N. Jin N. Wang P. Liu L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e134Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-Rab14 overexpression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Richard H. Scheller (19Junutula J.R. De Maziere A.M. Peden A.A. Ervin K.E. Advani R.J. van Dijk S.M. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The expression of the EGFP fusion protein was verified by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy. Adenovirus Generation—To construct the adenoviral vectors, the expression cassettes within the pENTR vectors were shuttled into an adenoviral vector, pAd/PL-DEST, through the Gateway recombination method (Invitrogen). After being linearized by PacI, the adenoviral plasmids were transfected into 293A cells for the generation of adenovirus. Viruses were purified by the Adeno-X mini purification kit (Clontech) and titered according to the EGFP signal on 293A transducted cells. Adenovirus Transduction and RNA Preparation—Freshly isolated alveolar type II cells were mixed with adenovirus at different multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) and cultured on an air-liquid model (16Mason R.J. Lewis M.C. Edeen K.E. McCormick-Shannon K. Nielsen L.D. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L249-L258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for various days. Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). For the rescue experiment, adenovirus expressing an EGFP-tagged human annexin A2 fusion protein (hAII-EGFP) was added to type II cells 1 day after the transduction of Ad.K4-shAIIa and continually cultured for an additional 2 days before the samples were collected. Microarray Hybridization—The DNA microarray slides were prepared in-house using the Pan Rat 10K oligonucleotide set (MWG Biotec Inc., High Point, NC) that contains 6,221 known rat genes, 3,594 rat expressed sequence tags, and 169 Arabidopsis negative controls as described previously (20Chen Z. Chen J.W. Weng T. Jin N. Liu L. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two shRNA vectors (Ad.K4-shAIIa and Ad.K4-shAIIb) were used for the silencing of annexin A2. Ad.K4-shCon was used as the virus control. The blank control without virus transduction was applied to evaluate the potential effects of adenovirus on alveolar type II cells. Reference RNA (Ref) obtained from SuperArray Co. was used to monitor the change in gene expression level. A reference design was performed as follows: Ad.K4-shAIIa/Ref, Ad.K4-shAIIb/Ref, Ad.K4-shCon/Ref, and Blank/Ref, each with dye flipping. There were four biological replications. RNA (10 μg total) from each sample was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Cy3 (green)- or Alexa 647 (red)-specific oligo(dT) primers from the 3DNA Array 50 kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA). The cDNA was purified with Microcom YM-30 columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and dissolved in 1× hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 6× SSC, and 0.2% SDS) at the concentration of 0.3 μg/μl. The two-step microarray hybridization was carried out with the 3DNA 50 expression kit. Before hybridization, the slides were washed with 0.2% SDS once and with deionized water four times and then dried by centrifugation. The denatured two color-paired cDNA mixture was added to DNA microarray slides and hybridized at 42 °C for 48 h. After being washed, the slides were re-hybridized with Cy3- and Alexa 647-specific capture reagents at 42 °C for 2 h and scanned twice with a ScanArray Express scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Microarray Data Analysis—The signal intensity for each spot was captured by Genepix 5.0. The ratios between each sample and reference cDNA were normalized by LOWESS normalization using the RealSpot software package developed in our laboratory (21Chen Z. Liu L. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A quality index for each spot, based on signal intensity and signal-to-background ratio, was calculated by RealSpot. Data with a mean quality index of <1 were discarded. One class SAM statistical test was applied to the remaining genes using a cutoff q value of <0.05. The major functional categories were assigned using gene ontology. Quantitative Real Time PCR—The validation of selected target genes with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was performed. Each RNA sample was treated with 1 μg of DNase and was reverse-transcribed into cDNAs with 0.2 μg/μl (dT)17, 0.3 μg/μl random hexamer primer, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The real time PCR thermal conditions for all genes were 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles each at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 77 °C for 35 s (signal collection temperature). The primer pairs are listed in Table 1. The relative real time PCR quantification was based on the ΔΔCt method. The endogenous reference gene was GAPDH.TABLE 1Primers used in real time PCRGene nameForward sequence (5′–3′)Reversed sequence (5′–3′)Annexin A2CACCTCCAGAAAGTGTTCGAAAGGGCTTGTTCTGAATGCACTGAAgapdhAACTCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAACACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGAretnlaCCTGCTGGGATGACTGCTACTTCAACGATTAAGCACAGGCAGTTid-1GAACGTTCTGCTCTACGACATGAGCAGTATCTCCACCTTGCTCACTTrab14ACCTCACCAACCAAACACTGTAACATTCTCTCCCGTTTTTGCACTatp1a1CTGGGAGGCTTCTTCACTTATTGCTGTCCTCCACATCATTGATatp2a1TCTGGCTTCTCGGTTCCATCTGACCATGAGCCACTGGGTAAAGcoq7GCAGGTCATTAAGCAATTTCGACGGCCTGGATAAGTCTCTTCAAsp-cAGCTCCAGGAACCTACTGCTACATAGGACTTGGCCTGGAAGTTCTTdcxCTAGCAGTCAGCTCTCAACACCTAAGGAATCGCCAAGTGAATCAGAfn1GGCAACAAATGATCTTTGAGGAACATCTACATTCGGCAGGTATGGTgnb2CAGACATTCATAGGTCACGAATCGAGGTCAAACAGGCGACATGTGgts8AAGAAGTCAGTGCTCCTGTGTTGTTCCAGGTTGCAGGAACTTCTTAAmap17CCCCAGGCTACAGGGAATGTGCCTGAGATGGCTGTGATTCAp55cdcGGCAACAGGAGGAGGTACCAATGGAGCACACCTGGGAATGprdx6GCTGCAGTTCCGTAGAAAGATTGAATGTTTTGGTGCCATTTCCATps20GATGGTCCGGAGGAAGTGTTACTGCAGGATGTGGCACTCATAGpstiCTGCACAGTTCTTCTGAGTTTTGGATATGCAAATCCACCTACCTGCTAAs100A1CACGGTGGCTTGTAACAACTTCTTAGGGAGATACAGGTGGGATGAGs100A6GACCGTAACAAGGATCAGGAAGTAACTGCCTTCCCATTTTATTTCAGAsp4ACATTGAAGGGTGTGGGAAAGTTTGCCACAAAACATCCAGTTGtspan8AAATGCCAAGCTTTTGTCAGAAACAAATCTCAAGCCACAGCACTTA Open table in a new tab Western Blot—Adenovirus-treated or untreated type II cells were extracted using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice. Protein samples (20 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. After being blocked with 5% fat-free milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, the blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-annexin A2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2,000 dilution); mouse monoclonal anti-annexin A2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; 1:1000 dilution); rabbit anti-Rab14 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard H. Scheller; 1:500 dilution); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500 dilution); mouse monoclonal anti-GADPH (Ambion; 1:5000); rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma; 1:2000 dilution). Protein loading controls were done with either rabbit anti-β-actin antibody or anti-GADPH. The membrane was washed with TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (1:1000–2,000 dilution) for 1 h. The membrane was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Immunoprecipitation—To overexpress selected targets (Id1, Retnla, Prdx6, and Rab14) with an EGFP tag, 1 μg of each plasmid (pEGFP-Rab14, pENTR/CMV-Prdx6EGFP, pENTR/CMV-RetnlaEGFP, and pENTR/CMV-p55cdcEGFP) was transfected into 293A cells cultured on 6-well plates. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 when the cells reached 80% confluence. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 48 h after transfection and lysed in 500 μl of M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce). Centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min was performed to remove the insoluble materials. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (whole serum, 1 μl; Abcam) or control rabbit IgG was incubated with 250 μg of protein of cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-agarose and 10 μl of protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. For p65 immunoprecipitation, 250 μg of protein of cell lysate was directly incubated with 20 μl of NF-κB p65 (c-20) AC rabbit polyclonal IgG-conjugated agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline four times, and boiled with 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The soluble fractions were detected by Western blotting. Immunolocalization of Rab14 in Alveolar Type II Cells—Immunolocalization was performed exactly as described earlier (22Chintagari N.R. Jin N. Wang P. Narasaraju T.A. Chen J. Liu L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly isolated type II cells (0.5 × 106) were suspended in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum; 1× nonessential amino acids and antibiotics) and cultured on sterile glass coverslips. Following overnight culture, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h before incubating with rabbit anti-Rab14 (1:100) and mouse anti-LB180 antibodies (1:500) or mouse anti-annexin A2 antibodies (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Later the cells were washed and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies at a dilution of 1:250 for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, the slides were mounted onto glass slides by adding anti-fade to prevent the quenching of the fluorophores. The proteins were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescent microscope. Lung Surfactant Secretion—Alveolar type II cells were cultured on an air-liquid model as described (16Mason R.J. Lewis M.C. Edeen K.E. McCormick-Shannon K. Nielsen L.D. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L249-L258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Adenovirus (100 m.o.i.) was added on day 3. Lung surfactant secretion was performed on day 7 as described previously (23Gou D. Wang P. Jin N. Liu L. Annexins. 2004; 1: 31-36Google Scholar). Annexin A2 Knockdown in Primary Alveolar Type II Cells with the Adenovirus-based Ad.K4-shRNA System—We have recently developed a new vector expressing multiple shRNAs that enhances silencing efficiency and reduces the amount of adenovirus required to achieve maximal silencing (17Gou D. Weng T. Wang Y. Wang Z. Zhang H. Gao L. Chen Z. Wang P. Liu L. J. Gene Med. 2007; 9: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This vector contains four different shRNA expression cassettes driven by the human U6, H1, 7SK promoters, and the mouse U6 promoter (Fig. 1A). To silence the rat annexin A2 gene, we constructed two adenoviral vectors, Ad.K4-shAIIa and Ad.K4-shAIIb (Fig. 1B), both containing four siRNA sequences targeting to the coding sequences of rat annexin A2 at different positions. The Ad.shCon vector expressing four different shRNAs without obvious homologies to mammalian DNA sequences was used as a negative control. At an m.o.i. of 50, a time course analysis that tested the effects of the adenovirus at 24, 48, and 72 h showed that the amount of annexin A2 protein was reduced by >98% 72 h after transduction of Ad.K4-shAIIa (Fig. 1C, A1–A3). The control vector Ad.K4-shCon (Fig. 1C, C1–C3) as well as the blank control (N1–N3) had no effect on the expression of annexin A2. A dose-response experiment showed that the transduction of Ad.K4-shAIIa virus at an m.o.i. of 20 inhibited >95% of annexin A2 protein expression (Fig. 1D). The control vector showed no differences in the annexin A2 protein levels at all four doses. Ad.K4-shAIIb had a similar silencing efficiency as Ad.K4-shAIIb at both mRNA and protein levels using an m.o.i. of 50 (Fig. 1E). Based on these data, we used RNA samples prepared from type II cells 72 h after virus transduction at an m.o.i. of 50 for the DNA microarray. Changes in the Cellular Transcriptome upon RNAi-mediated Inhibition of Annexin A2 Expression—To evaluate the effect of annexin A2 knockdown on global gene expression in type II cells, two K4-shRNA vectors, Ad.K4-shAIIa and Ad.K4-shAIIb, were used to silence annexin A2. We reasoned that if K4-shRNAs can elicit a target-specific response, both should induce the same changes in the gene expression profiles. Ad.K4-shCon was used as a control to correct for potential off-target effects that could be induced by siRNAs in general or by the virus transduction. By analyzing a genome-wide microarray of ∼10,000 genes, we observed significant changes of 135 genes in Ad.K4-shAIIa and 185 genes in Ad.K4-shAIIb. Of them, 61 genes are commonly changed in both Ad.K4-shAIIa and Ad.K4-shAIIb. These genes were catalogued according to their gene ontology information. The pie chart in Fig. 2 shows the percentage of the genes in major functional categories for up- and down-regulated genes. Table 2 lists the commonly changed genes that were up- or down-regulated by more than 2-fold. Nineteen genes were down-regulated and seven genes were up-regulated in the absence of annexin A2. The identified set included genes that are involved in diverse processes, including cell adhesion, membrane fusion, fatty acid metabolism, and antioxidant defense. There are several genes related to calcium iron binding and intracellular transport, indicating that those targets are functionally close to annexin A2 in type II cells.TABLE 2Commonly changed genes (> 2-fold) in annexin A2-silenced type II cellsGenBank™ GeneIDSymbolGene name-Fold changeNM_019905anxa2Annexin A2–5.24NM_053333retnlaResistin-like molecule α–4.33S68809s100a1s100a1 protein–4.16NM_019143fn1Fibronectin 1–2.87NM_053485s100a6s100a6 protein–2.74AF037272ps20Wap four-disulfide core domain protein–2.66NM_012504atp1a1ATPase Na+/K+-transporting α1 polypeptide–2.56NM_012761sp4Sp4 transcription factor–2.47D11325psTIPancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor–2.45NM_017342sftpcSurfactant associated protein C–2.36NM_012797id1Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 helix-loop-helix protein–2.34X81449keratin 19Keratin 19–2.32NM_031834sult1a1Sulfotransferase family 1A–2.32NM_133526tm4sf3Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 3–2.27U46149coq7COQ7–2.18X62660Glutathione transferase subunit 8–2.15AF397193gnb2G-protein β2 subunit–2.07NM_053589rab14Small GTP-binding protein RAB14–2.05NM_053576prdx6Peroxiredoxin 6–2.04AF402772map17Membrane-associated protein MAP17–2.00S39779preproET-3Preproendothelin-32.03NM_058213atp2a1ATPase, Ca2+-transporting, fast twitch 12.10NM_053379dcxDoublecortin gene2.16U05341p55cdcp55CDC2.18M58653grp-caGlutamine/glutamic acid-rich protein isoform calcium2.29AF016180go-vn3Putative pheromone receptor2.43NM_012556fabp1Fatty acid-binding protein 12.51 Open table in a new tab Real Time PCR Verification—To examine the reliability of the microarray data, 18 genes (16 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated) were chosen from Table 2 for validation. These 18 genes were chosen based on their possible association with annexin A2-mediated cellular functions. The RNAs from the same samples used in the DNA microarray were used for quantitative real time PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, 13 of 18 genes were validated by real time PCR, including 11 that were down-regulated (annexin A2, atp1a1, fn1, gb2, id1, prdx6, rab14, sp-c, gts8, retnla, and ps20) and 2 that were up-regulated (atp2a1 and p55cdc). Coq7, S100A1, MAP17, Tspan8, and Sp4 were not significantly changed as seen by real time RT-PCR, but the microarray assay indicated that those genes were expressed significantly higher in the control type II cells than annexin A2-depleted type II cells. For Tspan8, the expression level decreased in one of the treatments as revealed by real time PCR. The inconsistent results of five genes were likely because of low mRNA abundance, high variation among samples, or differences in data normalization (locally weighted regression and scatterplot smoothing or LOWESS versus housekeeping gene). Four genes (prepro-et-3, psti, dcx, and grp-ca) were inconclusive because of the poor amplification (data not shown). Rescue of Silencing by the Overexpression Construct—To confirm the specificity of the RNAi phenotype, annexin A2 silencing was rescued by overexpressing an RNAi-resistant human annexin A2 construct to see whether the RNAi effect could be reversed. One approach to generate an RNAi-resistant construct is to create silent point mutations in the target site of the coding sequence or to select an siRNA targeted to the sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of a gene. Another way is to use a cross-species DNA construct if these are mismatches in the target sites among species. 2–5 base mismatches exist in each of the four siRNA sequences of the Ad.K4-shAIIa vector between rat and human annexin A2. We have previously shown that the transduction of the Ad.K4-shAIIa vector into human A549 cells had little effect on the expression of human annexin A2 (17Gou D. Weng T. Wang Y. Wang Z. Zhang H. Gao L. Chen Z. Wang P. Liu L. J. Gene Med. 2007; 9: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that human annexin A2 can be used to rescue the loss of annexin A2 caused by Ad.K4-shAIIa in rat cells. We used the adenoviral vector, Ad.CMV-hAII-EGFP, that contains the human annexin A2 fused with an EGFP tag under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The C-terminal EGFP tag makes it easily to distinguish overexpressed annexin A2 from endogenous annexin A2. In our experimental design (Fig. 4A), the rescuing viral vector was added to the cells 1 day after the knockdown of annexin A2. The culture continued for additional 2 days prior to sample collection. We found that Ad.K4-shAIIa viral vector silenced >95% of endogenous rat annexin A2 but had no effect on the expression of the hAII-EGFP fusion protein as examined by Western blot (Fig. 4B). Real time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of Prdx6, Rab14, and Retnla returned to the control level after rescuing the loss of endogenous annexin A2 by the hAII-EGFP fusion protein (Fig. 4C). Other genes were variable or partially reversed to the control level. Because the targets confirmed by the rescue experiment may be functionally regulated or associated by annexin A2, we selected these targets for a physical interaction study. Identification of Annexin A2-interacting Proteins by Immunoprecipitation—To assess the possibility that annexin A2 directly interacts with any of the identified targets by microarray analysis, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. pEGFP-Rab14 was transiently transfected into 293A cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibodies. pEGFP expressing EGFP alone was used as a control. Anti-GFP antibodies pulled down Rab14-EGFP in the pEGFP-Rab14-transfected cells, and endogenous annexin A2 was co-precipitated with it (Fig. 5A). In the pEGFP-transfected cells and untransfected cells, no annexin A2 appeared in the immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitation using the control IgG showed no GFP or annexin A2 expression as expected (data not shown). Similar results were performed with pENTR/CMV-Prdx6EGFP, pENTR/CMV-RetnlaEGFP, or pENTR/CMV-p55CDCEGFP. Little annexin A2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates using anti-GFP anti"

IMP concentrations are regulated by Ras through induction of autodegradation and can modulate signal/response thresholds by directly limiting the assembly of functional KSR1-dependent Raf·MEK complexes. Here, we show that the capacity of IMP to inhibit signal propagation through Raf to MEK is a consequence of disrupting KSR1 homooligomerization and B-Raf/c-Raf hetero-oligomerization. This impairs both the recruitment of MEK to activated Raf family members and the contribution of Raf oligomers to c-Raf kinase activation.

A great deal of information has been gathered about the acute participation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction circuitry in the modulation and/or propagation of a broad range of dynamic cell regulatory events ranging from cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis to differentiation and cell specialization (1Pearson G.

Attention is now necessarily becoming focused on understanding the molecular architecture that allows the core enzymatic components of this cascade to be shared among multiple regulatory pathways yet produce distinct biological outcomes in response to discrete inductive signals. There is accumulating evidence that control of the amplitude, duration, and subcellular compartmentalization of ERK activation are all critical determinants of the biological response (4Whitehurst A.

The discovery and characterization of non-catalytic accessory components, or scaffolds, that generate higher order molecular organization to modulate the assembly, activation, and compartmentalization of MAPK cascades are beginning to reveal mechanisms that generate specificity in the coupling of MAPK activation to appropriate biological responses (8Bumeister R.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3143-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have recently described IMP (impedes mitogenic signal propagation) as a specifier of ERK activation amplitude through inhibition of functional coupling between Raf and MEK kinases (12Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The mode of action of IMP is dependent upon the presence of the Raf-MEK-ERK scaffolding protein KSR1 (kinase suppressor of Ras 1) and is a consequence of impairing the capacity of this scaffold to promote signal propagation through Raf to MEK (13Ory S. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R277-R278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined how IMP association with KSR1 can limit Raf·MEK·ERK complex formation and function. We find that KSR1 homo-oligomerization is required to couple distinct KSR·MEK and KSR·B-Raf complexes to allow MEK activation. Furthermore, KSR1 promotes formation of B-Raf/c-Raf hetero-oligomers that contribute to c-Raf kinase activation. IMP association blocks both KSR1 homo-oligomerization and B-Raf/c-Raf hetero-oligomerization to impair both MEK activation and the contribution of Raf oligomers to c-Raf kinase activation. These observations reveal the participation of KSR1 both upstream and downstream of Raf kinase activation in human cells and highlight Raf family oligomerization as a basic control point for modulation of signal amplitude by IMP.

White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared with the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics). Reverse transcriptase reaction was done with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was carried out using the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics). The following primers were used for PCR amplification: IMP-FW (TGCACGGTGTGTCTGGAG) and IMP-RV (GCAAACAGGACACGTGGT). To quantify the transcripts in this study, parallel experiments were done using the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control. Values were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and analyzed using the relative quantification mathematical model (Pfaffl) as described previously (19Whitehurst A.W. Bodemann B.O. Cardenas J. Ferguson D. Girard L. Peyton M. Minna J.D. Michnoff C. Hao W. Roth M.G. Xie X.J. White M.A. Nature. 2007; 446: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To investigate how IMP limits the capacity of KSR1 to promote productive Raf-MEK interactions and MEK activation, we examined the impact of IMP on KSR1·Raf·MEK complex formation and function. Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged KSR1 from serum-starved HEK293 cells resulted in the specific coprecipitation of endogenous MEK and B-Raf (Fig. 1A). A portion of the MEK present in KSR1 complexes was active independently of exogenous stimuli, as indicated by immunoreactivity with antibodies that selectively recognize the activating phosphorylations on MEK1/2. Expression of IMP reduced the population of active MEK in KSR1 complexes without affecting KSR1 association with MEK or B-Raf. IMP was detected in KSR1 complexes; however, direct immunoprecipitation of IMP, under identical conditions, recovered KSR1 and endogenous MEK but not B-Raf (Fig. 1B). In light of our previous finding that IMP can inhibit Raf·MEK complex formation (12Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), these observations suggested the possibility that IMP impairs the oligomerization of distinct KSR1·MEK and KSR1·B-Raf complexes to limit the accessibility of MEK for activation by B-Raf. Consistent with this, we found that KSR1 proteins can homo-oligomerize through interactions in the carboxyl-terminal half (Fig. 1, C and D) and that IMP expression blocks this interaction (Fig. 1D). The capacity of KSR homo-oligomerization to participate in Raf-MEK signal propagation was reminiscent of recent observations describing the role of Raf family oligomerization in MEK activation (17Garnett M.J. Rana S. Paterson H. Barford D. Marais R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The participation of KSR1 in Raf family oligomerization is unknown; however, B-Raf/c-Raf hetero-oligomer formation correlates with ERK1/2 pathway activation, and recently discovered low activity B-Raf mutations in melanomas require association with c-Raf to induce stimulus-independent ERK1/2 activation (16Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R.

Expression of IMP blocked B-Raf·c-Raf (Fig. 2A) complex formation as detected by immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged B-Raf or by immunoprecipitation of endogenous c-Raf from cells expressing either wild-type B-Raf or the low activity oncogenic variant B-Raf(G596R) (B) (16Wan P.T.

Although 14-3-3 association has been implicated as a prerequisite for B-Raf·c-Raf complex formation (16Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3595-3598PubMed Google Scholar), IMP impaired Raf hetero-oligomerization without affecting the relative amounts of 14-3-3 coprecipitating with B-Raf (Fig. 2A). To examine the contribution of IMP to modulation of native B-Raf·c-Raf complex formation, endogenous IMP was depleted by RNA interference followed by EGF stimulation (Fig. 2D). B-Raf·c-Raf complex formation was induced upon EGF stimulation, and depletion of IMP resulted in an increase in both detectable B-Raf·c-Raf complexes (Fig. 2C). These observations indicate that IMP is both necessary and sufficient to limit generation of active B-Raf·c-Raf protein complexes. B-Raf/c-Raf heteroduplexes have been reported to have greater specific activity than corresponding B-Raf or c-Raf homoduplexes or monomers (21Rushworth L.K. Hindley A.D. O'Neill E. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis of this increased activity is unclear, and the mechanism regulating heteroduplex formation is unknown. We employed c-Raf-BXB, an oncogenic c-Raf variant that lacks the amino-terminal regulatory domain and is constitutively active independently of mitogen stimulation, to examine the consequence of IMP-dependent modulation of Raf complex formation on Raf function in serum-starved cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, c-Raf-BXB interacts with both the wild-type and a kinase-dead B-Raf variant with a K483M substitution (B-Raf-KD). Consistent with published observations (21Rushworth L.K. Hindley A.D. O'Neill E. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), B-Raf-KD enhanced the activity of c-Raf-BXB in cells as indicated by the increased accumulation of active MEK (Fig. 3A) and by a significant increase in specific activity as measured in vitro (Fig. 3E). Importantly, unlike c-Raf (12Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), B-Raf associates with MEK independently of stimulation recruiting both c-Raf-BXB and MEK (Fig. 3B). Therefore, Raf family oligomerization may enhance both Raf kinase activity and substrate availability. IMP expression inhibited B-Raf·c-Raf-BXB complex formation together with blocking endogenous MEK activation (Fig. 3, C and D). The capacity of B-Raf-KD to enhance the specific activity of c-Raf-BXB was also impaired by IMP (Fig. 3E). Using KSR1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we have demonstrated previously that the capacity of IMP to limit signaling through the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is KSR1-dependent (12Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This finding together with those above suggest that KSR1 may promote B-Raf/c-Raf heteroduplex formation. Consistent with this, we found that EGF-dependent induction of B-Raf·c-Raf complexes was undetectable in KSR1–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts but was restored upon reintroduction of KSR1 at near physiological concentrations (Fig. 4A). In addition, KSR1 expression was sufficient to enhance the recovery of endogenous B-Raf in c-Raf immunocomplexes from HEK293 cells, and this was blocked by IMP (Fig. 4B). This phenotype was evident with both full-length c-Raf and the amino-terminal regulatory domain (c-Raf-N′). This observation prompted us to evaluate the impact of IMP on the presence of native c-Raf in KSR1 immunocomplexes. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, IMP significantly inhibited the association of c-Raf with KSR1. This is in stark contrast to the insensitivity of KSR1·B-Raf complexes to IMP expression (Fig. 1A), raising the possibility that c-Raf function may be acutely dependent on scaffolding complexes. To examine this relationship in the context of mitogenic signaling, we tested the relative contributions of IMP and c-Raf to EGF-dependent MEK activation. IMP expression was sufficient to impair EGF-induced MEK activation and to reverse the enhanced EGF-induced MEK activation observed upon c-Raf overexpression (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the reduced levels of EGF-stimulated MEK activation, resulting from RNA interference-mediated c-Raf depletion, were insensitive to IMP expression (Fig. 5B), and the enhanced MEK activation normally observed upon IMP depletion was reversed by codepletion of c-Raf (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5c-Raf function in mitogenic signaling is sensitive to IMP expression.

Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). IMP interacts with the MAPK scaffold protein KSR1 and requires KSR1 expression to influence MEK activation. KSR1 has been shown to act as an obligate mediator of functional Raf·MEK complex formation in a variety of cell systems (11Claperon A. Therrien M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3143-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Morrison D.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which KSR1 promotes Raf-MEK coupling is unclear but most likely involves direct binding to both Raf and MEK. Our observations suggest that distinct KSR1·MEK and KSR1·B-Raf complexes are present in cells and that pathway activation requires KSR1 homooligomerization to bring Raf together with its substrate. IMP expression inhibits Raf·MEK complex formation in cells, and this is apparently a consequence of blocking KSR1 homooligomerization without affecting the interaction of KSR1 with MEK1 or B-Raf. Remarkably, IMP has distinct consequences on the mobilization of c-Raf versus B-Raf for mitogenic signaling. In addition to promoting Raf·MEK complex assembly, we found that KSR1 promotes B-Raf/c-Raf hetero-oligomerization, and this is likewise impaired by IMP expression. Recently B-Raf/c-Raf heterooligomerization has been revealed as an essential step for maximal c-Raf kinase activation and is required for biological responses to low activity B-Raf variants in melanomas (16Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R.

Cell. 2005; 20: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how B-Raf·c-Raf complex formation triggers c-Raf activation and whether this requires B-Raf kinase activity (17Garnett M.J. Rana S. Paterson H. Barford D. Marais R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 21Rushworth L.K. Hindley A.D. O'Neill E. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2262-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We find that kinase-inactive B-Raf has the capacity to drive activation of the c-Raf catalytic domain, suggesting that B-Raf association either can facilitate autoactivating c-Raf transphosphorylation events or can recruit additional upstream regulators that facilitate c-Raf kinase activation. Importantly, KSR1 promotes B-Raf/c-Raf hetero-oligomerization, and this is blocked by IMP. As a consequence, we find that IMP reverses the capacity of kinase-dead B-Raf to increase the specific activity of the c-Raf catalytic domain, and IMP uncouples c-Raf from KSR1 complexes. Current paradigms suggest mammalian KSR1 is primarily responsible for coupling active Raf kinases to their substrates, MEK1 and MEK2 (23Muller J. Ory S. Copeland T. Piwnica-Worms H. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Roy F. Laberge G. Douziech M. Ferland-McCollough D. Therrien M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, although Drosophila KSR plays a similar role, it is also clearly required for Raf kinase activation (25Anselmo A.N. Bumeister R. Thomas J.M. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5940-5943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Douziech M. Sahmi M. Laberge G. Therrien M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that, like the Drosophila ortholog, human KSR1 acts both upstream and downstream of Raf kinase activation. However, c-Raf is selectively sensitive to this contribution of KSR1 to signal propagation. A simple role for KSR1 proteins in assembly of multivalent Raf and MEK complexes could easily account for this epistatic relationship. The capacity of IMP to limit the formation of such complexes highlights this regulatory step as a key axis of control for signal modulation. We thank Richard Marais, Jeffrey A. Frost, and Deborah K. Morrison for generously providing some of the reagents used in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2043360912,"Most human cancers are characterized by genetic aberrations accompanied by altered expression and function of numerous genes. Applying genome-wide, microarray gene expression analysis to identify deregulated genes in different tumour types can provide potential gene candidates as diagnostic and prognostic tools and promising targets for drug development. However, the detection of deregulated genes with low levels of expression remains a major challenge. In this study, we have designed a strategy, termed modified suppression subtractive hybridization (mSSH), to identify genes encoding rare transcripts. The strategy entails incorporating the T7-promoter sequence at the 5′ end of the noncoding cDNA strand during first strand cDNA synthesis to generate unidirectional antisense RNA from the resultant cDNA following conventional SSH. These transcripts are subsequently analysed by Affymetrix oligonucleotide gene arrays. Here, we have used five hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), five breast carcinoma and four nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies separately as testers and their corresponding normal biopsies as drivers to enrich for low abundance tumour type-specific transcripts. The total detectable number of probe sets following mSSH was reduced almost 10-fold in comparison to those detected for the same resected tumour tissues without undergoing subtraction, thus yielding a subtraction efficacy of over 90%. Using this experimental approach, we have identified 48 HCC-specific, 45 breast carcinoma-specific, and 83 NPC-specific genes. In addition, 115 genes were upregulated in all the three cancer types. When compared to gene-profiling data obtained without mSSH, the majority of these identified transcripts were of low abundance in the original cancer tissues. mSSH can therefore serve as a comprehensive molecular strategy for pursuing functional genomic studies of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2059282531,"The leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin mediates the recruitment of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs and is involved in the accumulation of neutrophils at sites of inflammation. In this study, we report the identification of novel isoforms of the mouse L-selectin gene, termed L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2. Sequence analysis revealed that these isoforms are generated by alternative splicing: the L-selectin-v2 transcript includes a previously unknown exon of 100 bp located between the 7th and 8th exons of the mouse L-selectin gene, while the L-selectin-v1 transcript contains the first 49-bp sequence of this new exon. The insertion of each new sequence adds a downstream reading frame, giving rise to predicted proteins that differ in their carboxyl-terminal tails. These splice variants were found in cells that express conventional L-selectin, termed L-selectin-c, including B and T lymphocytes and granulocytes. Functionally, like L-selectin-c, both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 expressed in cultured cells underwent phorbol ester-induced shedding, although L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 were shed to a greater and lesser degree, respectively, than L-selectin-c. Under flow conditions, both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 mediated faster cell rolling than did L-selectin-c. In addition, ligation of L-selectin-c and L-selectin-v1, but not L-selectin-v2, induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation.

These results suggest that alternative splicing is one mechanism for generating functional diversity in L-selectin. Lymphocyte recirculation between the blood and lymphatic system is critical for the maintenance of immune surveillance. Lymphocytes in the blood extravasate into secondary lymphoid organs through specialized postcapillary venules called high endothelial venules, where they tether and roll via L-selectin (CD62L), a member of the selectin family of adhesion receptors expressed on most leukocytes (1Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 2Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). L-selectin is also involved in leukocyte recruitment to both acute and chronic sites of inflammation (3Rosen S.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). P-selectin (CD62P) and E-selectin (CD62E), the other two members of the selectin family, are expressed on the endothelial cells of inflamed venules and also mediate leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation. The three selectins are type I membrane proteins with a C-type lectin domain at the amino terminus, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, several short consensus repeat domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (4Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tails of the three selectins are distinct, although highly conserved among species for any given selectin. The human and mouse L-selectin tails both consist of 17 amino acids, with only 4 residues different between them (5Siegelman M.H. van de Rijn M. Weissman I.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 6Lasky L.A. Singer M.S. Yednock T.A. Dowbenko D. Fennie C. Rodriguez H. Nguyen T. Stachel S. Rosen S.D.

Med. 1989; 170: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain has an important function. The L-selectin cytoplasmic tail has been reported to bind several proteins, including α-actinin, the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) 2The abbreviations used are: ERM, ezrin/radixin/moesin; Ab, antibody; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RT, reverse transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. family of proteins, and calmodulin, and is implicated in the regulation of L-selectin function (8Ivetic A. Ridley A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 1118-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, L-selectin-mediated tethering under flow is facilitated by the topographic distribution of L-selectin on the tips of microvilli, which is partly regulated by the cytoplasmic domain (9von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). L-selectin-mediated rolling is also regulated by the cytoskeletal anchoring of L-selectin via the cytoplasmic domain. Truncation of the 11 carboxyl-terminal residues of the human L-selectin tail disrupts association of L-selectin with α-actinin and abolishes rolling on inflamed venules in vivo without affecting its ligand recognition or microvillar localization (10Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This deletion mutant fails to associate with the cytoskeletal matrix in response to cross-linking by anti-L-selectin antibodies (Abs) or hyperthermia (12Evans S.S. Schleider D.M. Bowman L.A. Francis M.L. Kansas G.S. Black J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3615-3624PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro flow assays demonstrated that this mutant can mediate tethering (13Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the conversion of initial tethers to rolling is impaired by this truncation and is completely abolished by a further 4-residue truncation (13Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that α-actinin acts as a link between L-selectin and the cortical actin cytoskeleton, which might be important for the transition from tethering to rolling. In addition, the L-selectin tail is implicated in the regulation of proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain, called shedding, through its binding to calmodulin (14Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I.

Alternative splicing is widely recognized as a ubiquitous and important mechanism for generating protein diversity (16Lynch K.W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Numerous cell-surface adhesion molecules have been found to undergo alternative splicing that may change their adhesion and/or signaling properties. These include the immunoglobulin superfamily members ICAM-1 (17King P.D. Sandberg E.T. Selvakumar A. Fang P. Beaudet A.L. Dupont B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6080-6093PubMed Google Scholar), VCAM-1 (18Cybulsky M.I. Fries J.W. Williams A.J. Sultan P. Davis V.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 815-820PubMed Google Scholar), and PECAM-1 (CD31) (19Kirschbaum N.E. Gumina R.J. Newman P.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the link protein family member CD44 (20Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Among the selectin family members, human P-selectin is reported to have two variant forms, one predicting a molecule containing eight short consensus repeat domains instead of the typical nine and the other predicting a soluble form (21Johnston G.I. Cook R.G. McEver R.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 1033-1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 22Johnston G.I. Bliss G.A. Newman P.J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21381-21385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat E-selectin has two mRNA species, which differ in the presence of short consensus repeat domain 5 (23Billups K.L. Sherley J.L. Palladino M.A. Tindall J.W. Roberts K.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1995; 126: 580-587PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no splice variants have been reported for L-selectin from any species. In this study, we report two novel isoforms of mouse L-selectin, termed L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2, which are generated by alternative splicing. These isoforms have new sequence insertions that alter the amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic tails: the 11-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence of conventional L-selectin (termed L-selectin-c) is replaced by a new 24-amino acid sequence in L-selectin-v1, and the 8-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence of L-selectin-v1 is further replaced with a new 10-amino acid sequence in L-selectin-v2. We found that, like L-selectin-c, both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 underwent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced shedding as did L-selectin-c, although the three isoforms showed differences in their shedding efficiency. In addition, both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 mediated faster cell rolling than did L-selectin-c under flow conditions. Furthermore, we found that ligation of L-selectin-c and L-selectin-v1, but not L-selectin-v2, induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. These splice variants should prove useful in clarifying the function of the L-selectin cytoplasmic tail. Reagents—The monoclonal antibody (mAb) MEL-14, which recognizes an epitope in the extracellular domain of mouse L-selectin, was purchased from BD Biosciences. The rPSGL-Ig was a kind gift from Wyeth Research (Cambridge, MA). It was developed by linking a truncated human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 to the Fc portion of human IgG1, and it was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been engineered to express α-1,3-fucosyltransferase VII and core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (24Kumar A. Villani M.P. Patel U.K. Keith Jr., J.C. Schaub R.G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1363-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two hinge-proximal amino acids at positions 234 and 237 within the IgG1 Fc portion were mutated to alanine to reduce complement activation and Fc receptor binding. Cells—A mouse pre-B cell line L1.2 was kindly provided by Dr. Eugene Butcher (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. L1.2 cells expressing mouse L-selectin-c, L-selectin-v1, and L-selectin-v2 were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Th1 and Th2 cells were generated in vitro as described previously (25Atarashi K. Hirata T. Matsumoto M. Kanemitsu N. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Granulocytes were isolated from cultured bone marrow cells by centrifugation on Accudenz (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.). Pelleted cells were mostly granulocytes as judged by staining with anti-Gr-1 mAb (RB6-8C5; BD-Biosciences). Cloning of L-selectin Isoforms—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from mouse bone marrow cells. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using 1 μg of RNA with Superscript II and oligo(dT) primers (both from Invitrogen). L-selectin cDNA was amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer (5′-TGAGGATCCGTGCAGGAGGCTGAGGCCTGCAGAG-3′) located in the 5′-untranslated region and a 3′-primer (5′-GTAGAATTCAGTATGGATCATCCATCCTTTCTTG-3′) located in the carboxyl end of the coding region of L-selectin-c. The amplified products were subcloned and sequenced. For the cloning of human L-selectin, RT was performed using the total RNA from human thymus (Clontech). Human L-selectin cDNA was amplified using the 5′-primer 5′-TGCGGATCCTCAAGAGGCTCAATGGGCTGCAGAAG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TACGAATTCTAATATGGGTCATTCATACTTCTCTTG-3′. The amplified products were subcloned and sequenced. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from various mouse cells. In addition, the total RNA from various mouse tissues was purchased from Clontech. RT was performed as described above except that random hexamers (Invitrogen) were used instead of oligo(dT) primers. PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing the cDNA, 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm each primer, and 250 nm TaqMan probe using a 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, followed by 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The primer pairs and probes are listed in Table 1. Eukaryotic 18 S rRNA was amplified as an internal control. To determine the relative abundance of the three L-selectin transcripts, standard curves were generated using serial dilutions of the plasmid for each isoform.TABLE 1Sequences of primers and probes used in quantitative real-time RT-PCRIsoformForward primerReverse primerProbeL-selectin-c5′-cattcctgtagccgtcatggt-3′5′-tcttgagatttcttgcctttttttaac-3′5′-cttgccagccaaatg-3′L-selectin-v15′-cattcctgtagccgtcatggt-3′5′-tcttgagatttcttgcctcaaaact-3′5′-ttggtccgacctttt-3′L-selectin-v25′-ggttaaaaaaaggtcggaccaa-3′5′-tgagtagatctgctagataaacgcggac-3′5′-cagtgcacacctcaa-3′ Open table in a new tab Generation of L1.2 Cells Expressing L-selectin Isoforms—To generate expression plasmids for the L-selectin isoforms, the entire coding region of L-selectin-c, L-selectin-v1, or L-selectin-v2 was amplified by PCR using primers with an XbaI site attached. The amplified products were digested with XbaI and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS with a blasticidin S-resistance marker at the XbaI site. Stable L1.2 cell lines expressing the L-selectin isoforms were made by transfecting L1.2 cells with the plasmids and selecting with 30 μg/ml blasticidin. Flow Cytometry—To examine L-selectin expression on transfected L1.2 cells, the cells were stained with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-L-selectin mAb MEL-14 (BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice, washed, and analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Immunoelectron Microscopy—L1.2 transfectants (5 × 106 cells) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.05% NaN3 were incubated with MEL-14 at 4 °C for 50 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with affinity-purified biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (mouse absorbed; Vector Laboratories) at 4 °C for 50 min. The cells were then reacted with streptavidin-conjugated 15-nm colloidal gold particles (EY Laboratories). The labeled cells were spun at 400 × g, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C for 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and postfixed with 1% OsO4. Finally, the pellets of fixed samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in Quetol 812 epoxy resin (Nisshin EM). Ultrathin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and examined using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1230; JEOL). Control staining was performed in the absence of primary Abs. PMA-induced Shedding of L-selectin—To induce L-selectin shedding, 1 × 106 cells were incubated in 0.1 ml of medium containing 1 μg/ml PMA at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, and 5 mm EDTA and analyzed for L-selectin surface expression by flow cytometry. Cell Adhesion Assays under Flow Conditions—Cell adhesion assays under flow conditions were performed according to the method of Nandi et al. (26Nandi A. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14939-14948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. rPSGL-Ig or control human IgG (Sigma) (10 μg/ml) was immobilized on the inside walls of glass capillaries (inner diameter, 0.69 mm; Drummond Scientific) at 4 °C overnight. The capillaries were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The capillaries were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot 300; Nikon) with a ×4 objective. At this magnification, all the cells rolling at a fixed position of a capillary could be monitored. L1.2 cells expressing each L-selectin isoform were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing either CaCl2 or EDTA and infused into the capillaries at a shear force of 1 dyn/cm2. The rate of flow was controlled by a PHD 2000 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). Three minutes after the start of infusion, cell images were recorded with a cell-viewing system (SRM-100; Nikon) and video recorder (BR-S600; Victor), and the number of rolling cells passing through a fixed plane (at three quarters of the capillary tube from the entrance) perpendicular to the capillary axis was counted. The results are expressed as the number of rolling cells/min. The cells that rolled stably along the wall of the glass capillary tube for at least 3 s were considered to be rolling cells in this assay. The rolling velocity of individual cells was determined from video recordings by measuring the time required for a cell to travel a fixed distance (0.5 mm) for 200 cells. Stimulation of Cells—L1.2 transfectants were washed with RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES (RPMI-HEPES) and serum-starved in RPMI-HEPES for 3 h at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with 20 μg/ml fucoidin (Sigma) at 37 °C for various time periods. At the end of the stimulation, the cells were washed with RPMI-HEPES, lysed in SDS sample buffer, sonicated, boiled for 5 min, and cleared by centrifugation. The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were probed with Abs against p38 MAPK or phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. (Figs. 2 and 4) or S.E. (Fig. 5). Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test.FIGURE 4PMA-induced shedding of the three L-selectin isoforms.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned PCR fragments revealed the presence of two novel transcripts, termed L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 3The nucleotide sequences reported here have been submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan with accession numbers AB353767 and AB353768 for the mouse L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2, respectively. (Fig. 1, A and B). The L-selectin-v1 transcript has a 49-bp insertion, due to the inclusion of a new exon (exon v1) located between the 7th and 8th exons of the mouse L-selectin gene (nucleotides 11026–11074, GenBank™ accession number NC_000067, Gene ID 20343). Part of the L-selectin-v1 sequence is found in the GenBank™ Expressed Sequence Tag data base (BF714815). The L-selectin-v2 transcript includes an additional 51-bp sequence (exon v2) just after the 49-bp insert of the L-selectin-v1 transcript (nucleotides 11075–11125, NC_000067). These two sequences exist continuously without an intervening sequence in the mouse L-selectin gene. Thus, L-selectin-v2 is generated by the inclusion of the full cassette exon v1+v2 that was newly identified, while L-selectin-v1 is generated by the use of an alternative 5′-splice site within this cassette exon. Insertion of the new sequences resulted in new downstream reading frames in L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 (Fig. 1C). Consequently, the 11-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin-c (residues 362–372) is replaced with a new 24-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl end of L-selectin-v1 (residues 362–385). In L-selectin-v2, the 8-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence of the new sequence in L-selectin-v1 (residues 378–385) is further replaced with a new 10-amino acid sequence (residues 378–387). In contrast to the hydrophilic nature of the L-selectin-c cytoplasmic domain, the L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 cytoplasmic domains contain many hydrophobic amino acids, especially in the portion of the new sequence shared by L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 and in the unique carboxyl-terminal tail of L-selectin-v2. An in silico analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the human L-selectin gene failed to detect an equivalent of the exon v1+v2, and RT-PCR using RNA from human thymus failed to detect a human ortholog of L-selectin-v1 or L-selectin-v2. Expression of the Three L-selectin mRNA Species in Mouse Tissues and Cells—The mRNA expression of the three L-selectin isoforms was examined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The primers and probes are shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1. The 3′-primers for L-selectin-c and L-selectin-v1 were designed to span the unique junctions. The 3′-primer for L-selectin-v2 was located in exon v2. The specificity of the primers was verified using the plasmid for each isoform as a template. As expected, L-selectin-c expression was found in lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes and spleen (Fig. 2B). The L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 transcripts were expressed in the same tissues where L-selectin-c was expressed (Fig. 2B). The expression of mRNA for the three isoforms was also confirmed in various cell types, including B and T lymphocytes and granulocytes (Fig. 2C). In addition, the amount of L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 mRNA relative to L-selectin-c mRNA was determined using the plasmid for each isoform as a standard. In B and T lymphocytes, L-selectin-v1 mRNA expression was <2% of that of L-selectin-c, whereas L-selectin-v2 mRNA expression was ∼4–5% (Fig. 2D). In activated T cells, such as Th1 and Th2 cells, and granulocytes, the mRNA expression of L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 was ∼2–3% that of L-selectin-c. Thus, the relative mRNA expression of L-selectin-v1 is higher in activated T cells and granulocytes than in unstimulated lymphocytes, while the relative L-selectin-v2 mRNA expression is higher in unstimulated lymphocytes than in activated T cells and granulocytes. Distribution of L-selectin Isoforms on the Cell Surface—To examine the localization of L-selectin isoforms, L1.2 transfectants expressing L-selectin-c, L-selectin-v1, or L-selectin-v2 were prepared. The novel isoforms were expressed on the cell surface of these cells and were glycosylated with both N-linked and O-linked glycans, similarly to L-selectin-c (supplemental Fig. S1). L-selectin-c is known to be localized to the tips of microvilli. Immunogold staining with the anti-L-selectin mAb MEL-14 showed L-selectin-c was preferentially localized to microvilli (Fig. 3A). Similarly, L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 were also localized to microvilli (Fig. 3, B and C). No specific staining was observed in the control sample lacking the primary mAb MEL-14 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal 11-amino acid sequence of L-selectin-c is not required for its localization to microvilli. Thus, the first 6-amino acid region of the cytoplasmic domain appears to be sufficient for the microvillar localization of L-selectin. Shedding of the Three L-selectin Isoforms—Because the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin has been shown to be critical for L-selectin shedding, we next examined whether these isoforms differ in shedding efficiency. L1.2 cells stably expressing L-selectin-c, L-selectin-v1, or L-selectin-v2 were stimulated with PMA, and the remaining cell surface expression of L-selectin was examined by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4A, the cell surface expression of L-selectin-c was decreased following PMA stimulation. The cell surface expression of L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 also decreased after PMA stimulation (Fig. 4A). Comparison of the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the L-selectins showed that the PMA-induced decrease in the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of L-selectin-v1 was larger than that of L-selectin-c, while that of L-selectin-v2 was smaller (Fig. 4B). These results show that although all three isoforms are shed after PMA stimulation, they differ in their efficiency of shedding. Rolling Behavior of L1.2 Cells Expressing the Three L-selectin Isoforms—We next investigated whether the novel isoforms could mediate cell rolling under flow conditions. When L1.2 cells expressing L-selectin-c, L-selectin-v1, or L-selectin-v2 were infused into capillary tubes coated with rPSGL-Ig under a shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2, the cells rolled (Fig. 5A). This rolling was completely inhibited by the presence of EDTA (data not shown), verifying that it was calcium-dependent. The number of rolling cells was slightly decreased when L-selectin-v1-expressing cells were infused, compared with L-selectin-c-expressing cells, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5A). L-selectin-v2-expressing cells rolled in similar numbers as L-selectin-c-expressing cells and in slightly greater numbers than L-selectin-v1-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). We next examined the rolling velocity of the cells expressing the three L-selectin isoforms. L1.2 cells expressing L-selectin-v1 or L-selectin-v2 rolled at a greater velocity compared with those expressing L-selectin-c (Fig. 5, B and C). These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal 11-amino acid sequence in L-selectin-c plays a role in controlling the rolling velocity. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK upon Ligation of the Three L-selectin Isoforms—The cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin has been shown to be involved in signal transduction (27Crockett-Torabi E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previous studies implicated p38 MAPK in signaling through L-selectin (28Smolen J.E. Petersen T.K. Koch C. O'Keefe S.J. Hanlon W.A. Seo S. Pearson D. Fossett M.C. Simon S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether the three L-selectin isoforms, when ligated, could induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. L1.2 cells stably expressing L-selectin-c, L-selectin-v1, or L-selectin-v2 were stimulated with fucoidin, a sulfated polysaccharide L-selectin ligand, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation was examined by Western blotting. Parental L1.2 cells that hardly express L-selectin were stimulated similarly. As shown in Fig. 6, an increase in the p38 MAPK phosphorylation was detected in L1.2 cells expressing L-selectin-c, but not in parental L1.2 cells, indicating that the induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was L-selectin-dependent. Ligation of L-selectin-v1 also induced an increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, L-selectin-v2 was defective in inducing p38 phosphorylation. These results suggest that the unique cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin-c, as well as the unique tail of L-selectin-v1, is involved in the induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In this study, we identified novel isoforms of the mouse L-selectin gene, termed L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2. These isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and differ from conventional L-selectin, L-selectin-c, only in their cytoplasmic tails. The mRNAs for these novel isoforms are present in the cells and tissues that express L-selectin-c. Functionally, both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 underwent PMA-induced shedding, although L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 were shed to a greater and lesser degree, respectively, than L-selectin-c. In addition, both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 mediated faster cell rolling compared with L-selectin-c under flow conditions. We also showed that ligation of L-selectin-v1, but not L-selectin-v2, induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism for generating protein diversity. Although human P-selectin and rat E-selectin are known to have splice variants, no alternative splicing events have been reported for L-selectin from any species; thus, this is the first demonstration of alternative splicing events of the L-selectin gene. The L-selectin gene comprises 9 exons and locates on chromosome 1, region q23–25 and H2.2 in humans and mice, respectively. The splice variants we identified here contain the new exon v1 or v1+v2 located between exons 7 and 8. As the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin spans from exon 7 through exon 9, the insertion of the new sequences resulted in the alteration in the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain. The selectin splice variants identified previously either exist as a soluble form or differ in the extracellular domain (21Johnston G.I. Cook R.G. McEver R.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 1033-1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 22Johnston G.I. Bliss G.A. Newman P.J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21381-21385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Billups K.L. Sherley J.L. Palladino M.A. Tindall J.W. Roberts K.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1995; 126: 580-587PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the L-selectin splice variants are unique among selectin variants in that they differ in the cytoplasmic domain. Because the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin has been implicated in various functions, these variants should serve as valuable tools to elucidate the role of this domain. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the mRNA species for these novel isoforms were present in the cells and tissues that express L-selectin-c, although the amount of each was <5% of the amount of L-selectin-c mRNA. It has been shown that alternative splicing events of numerous molecules show changes following cell activation (29Ip J.Y. Tong A. Pan Q. Topp J.D. Blencowe B.J. Lynch K.W. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2007; 13: 563-572Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the mRNA expression of the novel isoforms in activated T cells such as Th1 and Th2 cells. There was a tendency for the L-selectin-v1 mRNA to be up-regulated in Th1 cells compared with unstimulated lymphocytes and for the L-selectin-v2 mRNA to be down-regulated relative to the L-selectin-c mRNA. It would be interesting to find situations or diseases where the expression of these novel variants is altered. Our data showed that all three isoforms were localized similarly to microvilli, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal 11-amino acid region of the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin-c is not required for microvillar localization. This finding is in agreement with a previous report showing that a deletion mutant of human L-selectin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acids localizes normally to microvilli (11Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Another study identified Arg357 and Lys362 of the human L-selectin cytoplasmic domain as critical residues for binding to ERM proteins and microvillar positioning (30Ivetic A. Florey O. Deka J. Haskard D.O. Ager A. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33263-33272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These residues are also conserved in mouse L-selectin-c. Arg357 is located in the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain shared by all three isoforms. In L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2, Lys362 is replaced by a functionally similar basic residue arginine; this replacement is unlikely to affect the microvillar localization of these two isoforms and, indeed, appears not to affect it. The function of L-selectin is regulated by the cleavage of its extracellular domain, a process called shedding. Various agents induce L-selectin shedding, including phorbol esters and Abs that cross-link L-selectin molecules (31Smalley D.M. Ley K. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In vivo, L-selectin shedding regulates the trafficking of neutrophils (32Hafezi-Moghadam A. Thomas K.L. Prorock A.J. Huo Y. Ley K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and antigen-activated T cells (33Galkina E. Tanousis K. Preece G. Tolaini M. Kioussis D. Florey O. Haskard D.O. Tedder T.F. Ager A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has been shown that calmodulin associates with the cytoplasmic domain of human L-selectin and regulates shedding by a mechanism in which the bound calmodulin operates as a negative regulator (14Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Leu358 and Lys359 in the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of human L-selectin are critical for calmodulin binding (15Matala E. Alexander S.R. Kishimoto T.K. Walcheck B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These two residues are shared by the three isoforms of mouse L-selectin, suggesting that the calmodulin regulation of L-selectin shedding operates in all three isoforms. In addition, Arg357 and Lys362 of the human L-selectin cytoplasmic domain, which are important for binding ERM proteins, are also involved in shedding (30Ivetic A. Florey O. Deka J. Haskard D.O. Ager A. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33263-33272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As discussed above, all three isoforms have either arginine or lysine at these positions, suggesting that the regulation of shedding by ERM proteins is also functionally active in the three isoforms. Indeed, L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 underwent PMA-induced shedding like L-selectin-c. However, there were slight differences in the shedding efficiency among the three isoforms: L-selectin-v1 was shed to a greater degree and L-selectin-v2 to a lesser degree than L-selectin-c. These observations raise the possibility that the cytoplasmic tail distal to the calmodulin- and ERM-binding sites is also involved in L-selectin shedding. With regard to the function of L-selectin in cell rolling, we found that both L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2 mediated cell rolling in comparable numbers to L-selectin-c. However, they mediated rolling at a higher velocity than did L-selectin-c. A previous study showed that a human L-selectin deletion mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acids fails to interact with α-actinin (11Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This deletion eliminates binding to high endothelial venules in an in vitro frozen section binding assay and also abolishes rolling in exteriorized rat mesenteric venules (10Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the carboxyl-terminal 11-amino acid sequence of mouse L-selectin-c, which is replaced by other sequences in L-selectin-v1 and L-selectin-v2, is also involved in the interaction with α-actinin and the regulation of cell rolling. The L-selectin cytoplasmic domain is also involved in signal transduction. Previous studies showed that ligation of human L-selectin with Abs or sulfated polysaccharide ligands stimulates intracellular signaling, including MAPK phosphorylation. We showed that ligation of L-selectin-c and L-selectin-v1 also induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interestingly, L-selectin-v2 was unable to induce p38 MAPK phosphorylation, suggesting that the unique cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin-c, as well as the unique tail of L-selectin-v1, is involved in the induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the unique cytoplasmic tails of L-selectin-c and L-selectin-v1 have serine residues that can be phosphorylated, Ser364 and Ser381, respectively, as predicted by the Net-Phos server (34Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar), whereas L-selectin-v2 has no potential sites of phosphorylation in its cytoplasmic tail. Future studies are required to clarify the phosphorylation patterns of the three isoforms and to assess whether L-selectin phosphorylation is linked to downstream signaling events, including MAPK phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study shows for the first time alternatively spliced events of the L-selectin gene. L-selectin mediates not only the homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs but also the recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues in various chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, thyroiditis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as to acutely inflamed sites. Thus, regulation of L-selectin function may be a way to regulate leukocyte infiltration at these sites. The three isoforms identified in this study should serve as tools to clarify the functions of L-selectin and the roles of its cytoplasmic region, as well as the regulation of L-selectin-mediated leukocyte trafficking.

Carballo et al., 2008Carballo J.A. Johnson A.L. Sedgwick S.G. Cha R.S. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar now show that the chromosomal protein Hop1 mediates PI3K-like kinase signaling during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in meiosis. During the DNA-damage response, adaptor proteins mediate signaling between the PI3K-like sensor kinases, ATM and ATR, and serine/threonine effector kinases. Carballo et al., 2008Carballo J.A. Johnson A.L. Sedgwick S.G. Cha R.S. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar now show that the chromosomal protein Hop1 mediates PI3K-like kinase signaling during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in meiosis. The DNA-damage response senses a variety of DNA lesions and orchestrates a broad cellular response, which includes facilitating DNA repair and regulating cell-cycle progression. A major branch of the DNA-damage response is a phosphokinase signal transduction pathway comprising three basic elements: a sensor kinase, an adaptor or mediator, and a serine/threonine effector kinase (Harper and Elledge, 2007Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, Melo and Toczyski, 2002Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Two large protein kinases, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinases, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), and ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related), are activated at sites of DNA damage. DSBs are detected by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, which recruits ATM and activates it by autophosphorylation. Although ATM activation is the primary response to DSBs, ATR is also activated, more slowly and via an ATM-dependent process. At blocked replication forks, single-stranded DNA in association with the single-stranded binding complex, RPA, independently recruits both ATR and the PCNA-related 911 complex whose juxtaposition results in ATR activation. The archetypal adaptor proteins, Rad9 and Mrc1, were identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad9 is the primary mediator of signaling initiated by DNA DSBs, whereas stalled replication forks result in signaling via Mrc1. Both proteins undergo damage-induced phosphorylation by the PI3K-like kinases whereupon they bind to the serine/threonine kinases, Rad53 or Chk1, and facilitate their activation through phosphorylation (Melo and Toczyski, 2002Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In their new study, Carballo et al., 2008Carballo J.A. Johnson A.L. Sedgwick S.G. Cha R.S. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar provide evidence that the chromosomal protein Hop1 is an adaptor protein for the signaling response during meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae. Homologous recombination during meiosis is radically different from that in somatic cells (Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic Recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar). To start with, self-inflicted DSB formation is an intrinsic part of the meiotic program. Moreover, repair of DSBs can be considered a secondary goal of meiotic recombination, whose primary function is to facilitate pairing and crossing-over between homologous chromosomes. To this end, meiotic recombination favors homologous chromosomes as repair templates; by contrast, in somatic cells, sister chromatids are the favored templates. In fact, recombination between sister chromatids is actively prevented by the meiotic DNA-damage signaling response (Carballo et al., 2008Carballo J.A. Johnson A.L. Sedgwick S.G. Cha R.S. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar, Niu et al., 2005Niu H. Wan L. Baumgartner B. Schaefer D. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5804-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These unique features of meiotic recombination are achieved by modulating the core DNA recombination and damage-response machinery. For example, yeast cells possess a meiosis-specific serine/threonine effector kinase, Mek1, which activates the signaling response to DSBs formed during meiosis (Wan et al., 2004Wan L. de los Santos T. Zhang C. Shokat K. Hollingsworth N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Absence of signaling via Mek1 causes three distinct defects: (1) decreased formation of DSBs; (2) failure to arrest the progression of meiotic prophase in dmc1Δ mutant yeast cells, which lack the meiosis-specific strand-exchange protein Dmc1; and (3) inappropriate recombination between sister chromatids, that is, loss of interhomolog bias. Activation of Mek1 requires the formation of DSBs and the presence of Mec1, the S. cerevisiae ortholog of ATR. Rad9 is not required for Mek1 activation, however, implying the existence of a meiosis-specific adaptor protein. Likely candidates include the meiosis-specific Red1 and Hop1 proteins, but conclusive evidence of mediator function has been lacking until now. Both Red1 and Hop1 are major components of the chromosome axes that assemble along homologs during meiotic prophase. Red1 is a coiled-coil protein but contains no clear functional motifs. Red1 does, however, undergo meiosis-specific (but apparently DSB-independent) phosphorylation, interacts directly with Mek1, and is required for Mek1 activation (Niu et al., 2007Niu H. Li X. Job E. Park C. Moazed D. Gygi S.P. Hollingsworth N.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5456-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hop1 contains a DNA-binding zinc finger domain, a putative protein-protein interaction and oligomerization motif called a HORMA domain, and a C domain, which is required for DSB-dependent phosphorylation of Hop1 (Niu et al., 2005Niu H. Wan L. Baumgartner B. Schaefer D. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5804-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Notably, inducing ectopic dimerization of the Mek1 kinase by fusing it with glutathione S-transferase (which self-dimerizes) suppresses the effects of mutations in the Hop1 C domain. This implies that Hop1 phosphorylation normally facilitates Mek1 dimerization enabling its self-activation through autophosphorylation (Niu et al., 2005Niu H. Wan L. Baumgartner B. Schaefer D. Loidl J. Hollingsworth N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5804-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Carballo et al., 2008Carballo J.A. Johnson A.L. Sedgwick S.G. Cha R.S. Cell. 2008; (this issue)PubMed Google Scholar now identify a new functional motif in Hop1, an [S/T]Q cluster domain (SCD) comprising three adjacent PI3K-like kinase target sites (Figure 1). They further show that this domain undergoes physiologically relevant phosphorylation by the ATM and ATR orthologs, Tel1 and Mec1, in response to meiotic DSB formation. Site-specific mutation of HOP1 that diminishes phosphorylation of the SCD motif (hop1SCD) prevents chromosomal localization of Mek1 kinase and its activation, consistent with Hop1 acting as an archetypal adaptor of the DNA-damage response. Similar to a hop1Δ null mutation, the hop1SCD allele results in formation of dead spores and alleviates the normally robust prophase arrest of dmc1Δ mutants. However, hop1SCD mutant yeast have distinct and informative differences compared with hop1Δ null mutants. First, both Hop1 and Red1 are localized normally along meiotic chromosomes, suggesting that homolog axes assemble correctly in hop1SCD mutant cells. Second, there is the usual number of DSBs in hop1SCD mutant cells, whereas hop1Δ cells form only 5%–10% of the DSBs found in wild-type cells. Third, DSBs are rapidly and efficiently repaired in hop1SCD mutants, but recombination occurs primarily between sister chromatids. This loss of interhomolog bias explains why hop1SCD mutants produce only dead spores. Fourth, the hop1SCD allele alleviates the arrest phenotype of dmc1Δ mutants by permitting a second strand-exchange protein, Rad51, to catalyze recombination between sister chromatids. Thus, the hop1SCD allele unambiguously reveals that Hop1 has another function in addition to facilitating meiotic DSB formation, namely, preventing Rad51-dependent recombination between sister chromatids. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Hop1 by Mec1/Tel1 is necessary and sufficient for Hop1 to perform this additional function. The hop1SCD allele essentially phenocopies inhibition of Mek1 kinase activity by small molecules (Wan et al., 2004Wan L. de los Santos T. Zhang C. Shokat K. Hollingsworth N.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), lending further support to the inference that Hop1 is the cognate adaptor for Mek1. Identification of the downstream targets of Mek1 and an understanding of how their phosphorylation inhibits intersister recombination are now eagerly anticipated. But still to be resolved is the function of Red1, which also interacts with Mek1 and is required for its activation. To a certain extent, the functions of Red1 and Hop1 are inseparable, and the two proteins may be a composite adaptor. Red1 interacts directly with Hop1 and is required for the morphogenesis of Red1-Hop1 homolog axes. Perhaps the two proteins co-oligomerize along chromosomes resulting in broad signaling platforms in the vicinity of DNA DSBs. A key question for the future is whether aspects of this meiotic DNA-damage response pathway are conserved in metazoans that contain Hop1-related proteins but appear to lack Mek1 and Red1 homologs. In summary, Hop1 is a DNA-damage-response adaptor with multiple interrelated functions, such as binding to DNA, facilitating DSB formation, oligomerization along chromosome axes, and mediating signaling as part of the meiotic DNA-damage response. The dynamics of Hop1 localization on chromosomes also suggest that Hop1 may monitor the progression of recombination and the intimate pairing of homologous chromosomes (synapsis). Indeed, Hop1 staining is lost from regions where homologs have paired and synapsis has occurred, and where recombination has progressed beyond the initial step of strand exchange (Smith and Roeder, 1997Smith A.V. Roeder G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The activities of Hop1 highlight the striking structural and functional complexity of adaptor proteins, and it is clear that the basic picture of adaptor proteins as passive scaffolds for the mediation and amplification of signaling between PI3K-like kinases and serine/threonine effector kinases is grossly oversimplified. For example, yeast Mrc1 and its human homolog Claspin independently localize to replication forks through direct DNA contacts and protein-protein interactions (Lee et al., 2005Lee J. Gold D.A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5269-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Zhao and Russell, 2004Zhao H. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53023-53027Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rad9 and its homologs Crb2 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human 53BP1 associate with chromatin at sites of DNA damage through conserved tudor domains (Figure 1; Adams and Carpenter, 2006Adams M.M. Carpenter P.B. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Hammet et al., 2007Hammet A. Magill C. Heierhorst J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Wood et al., 2007Wood J.L. Singh N. Mer G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35416-35423Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Wysocki et al., 2005Wysocki R. Javaheri A. Allard S. Sha F. Cote J. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8430-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These activities are consistent with the idea that, in addition to primary signal mediation of the DNA-damage response, each adaptor may also play context-specific roles in secondary signaling, damage verification, or the monitoring of repair. Phosphorylation of the Axial Element Protein Hop1 by Mec1/Tel1 Ensures Meiotic Interhomolog RecombinationCarballo et al.CellMarch 07, 2008In BriefAn essential feature of meiosis is interhomolog recombination whereby a significant fraction of the programmed meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) is repaired using an intact homologous non-sister chromatid rather than a sister. Involvement of Mec1 and Tel1, the budding yeast homologs of the mammalian ATR and ATM kinases, in meiotic interhomlog bias has been implicated, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Mec1 and Tel1 promote meiotic interhomolog recombination by targeting the axial element protein Hop1. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
