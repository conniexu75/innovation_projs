https://openalex.org/W2035021512,"ON three independent occasions an exceptional trait has been recovered in collections from Nature of females of D. bifasciata: in Pavia in 19431 and 1947, and in Mergozzo (Lago Maggiore) in 1947. This trait expresses itself in an abnormal sex-ratio of offspring from females mated to any type of male. By analogy with previously described cases2, the character has been designated as ‘sex-ratio’. The strain used in the experiments discussed here originated from the 1947 collection in Pavia. The behaviour of this stock can be summarized as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2004456625,"THE aluminium salts of higher fatty acids find considerable use for various industrial purposes. Their nature and composition are, however, surprisingly obscure. Even the existence of the tri-soaps has been doubted by a number of workers1, whereas Lawrence2 believes that tri-soaps of aluminium do exist, and Glazer, McRoberts and Schuman3 have reported the preparation of aluminium tri-laurate by the reaction between aluminium tri-methyl and lauric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2087015715,"A SOLUTION of benzidine in acetic acid has been used by Horrocks and Manning1 as a chromatographic spray reagent for the detection of sugars. A quantitative technique, using this reagent, has been perfected and found to be satisfactory for the majority of common sugars (cf. McCance2) and their methylated derivatives with the exception of ketoses. Concentrations as low as 0.1 mgm./ml. were estimated, with errors of less than 3 per cent."

Eventually, the strain of P. knowlesi was being maintained for chemotherapeutic and other studies by the Malaria Institute of India, Delhi, and by some laboratories in Great Britain and the United States."

https://openalex.org/W2004320314,HENZE1 was the first to show that vanadium is present in the blood of certain ascidians. Webb2 demonstrated that the metal is accumulated by the primitive families but not by the more specialized families of the Ascidiacea. Also he showed that the vanadium chromogen is located in a special type of cell which he termed a vanadocyte.

The final, lyophilized product had an activity varying, in different preparations, from 600 to 900 cat units1 per mgm. ash-free substance."

https://openalex.org/W2003589672,"THE amount of deoxyribonucleic acid recovered from ultra-violet light irradiated intact rat thymocytes has been found to be significantly less than the amount recovered from non-irradiated controls. The thymus glands of twenty normal 150-gm. Wistar-strain male rats were removed immediately after decapitation of the animals, placed in 140 ml. of Ringer's solution and homogenized for 30 sec. in a Waring blendor. The resultant suspension of thymocytes was removed to a dark-room and divided into two equal portions, one of which served as a control. The other was placed in an 80-ml. quartz-bottom van Tieghem cell. While being constantly agitated by a slowly rotating stirrer, in order to ensure uniform exposure of all the cells, the suspension was irradiated from below for 30 min. with ultra-violet light (3.4 × 108 ergs). The ultra-violet source, used without filters, was an air-cooled, quartz-spiral mercury resonance lamp (Hanovia), which, according to a Hanovia ultra-violet meter, Model AV971, emits about 25 per cent of the total output in the ultra-violet below λ = 2800 A. The irradiated and control suspensions were left in the dark-room to avoid possible side effects due to photo-reactivation. A period of 5½ hr. was allowed to elapse before extraction of deoxyribonucleic acid, in order to provide sufficient time for possible depolymerization of the acid induced by the radiation. Thymocyte viability for a period of 5½ hr. after homogenization and irradiation was verified by means of tissue culture. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted according to the Limperos modification1 of the Mirsky–Pollister method2, dissolved in distilled water and then lyophilized. The weight of deoxyribonucleic acid obtained from irradiated tissue homogenates (seven replicate experiments) was only 52.9 per cent (S.E.mean 4.6) of the weight of that obtained from the non-irradiated controls. Nitrogen and phosphorus content were determined on aliquot portions made up on the basis of percentage weight of deoxyribonucleic acid. Adjustment to equal concentrations of the acid was based on phosphorus content. No appreciable differences between irradiated and control samples were found in relative viscosities, structural viscosities, or sedimentation rates."
https://openalex.org/W2032991964,"ALTHOUGH ninhydrin has long been used as a sensitive reagent for the detection of amino-acids, its remarkable cross-linking action on protein fibres appears to be unknown. In the case of wool keratin, the reaction, the extent of which is independent of pH between pH 4.8 and 8.3, takes place slowly at ordinary temperatures and is incomplete in 48 hr. With a boiling 0.0685 M solution at pH 4.8, however, cross-linking proceeds so rapidly that after treatment for 15 min. the fibres show a 25.8 per cent increase in resistance to extension (30 per cent) in water at 22.2° C. Since the extent of reaction is reduced when the lysine side-chains are blocked by means of 1-fluoro-2 : 4-dinitrobenzene or nitroso-benzene, and since no strengthening is obtained with completely deaminated fibres, the basic side-chains of keratin must play a fundamental part in the cross-linking reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2083653112,"THE horse pituitary extract AP.118.B induces superovulation in albino does at 12 weeks of age, provided the animals are fed at a high level from birth. Treatment consists of six subcutaneous injections of this pituitary extract at 12-hr. intervals, followed by an intravenous injection of 25 I.U. prolan 12 hr. later. When this treatment was repeated in the same does at 28-day intervals, in 95 per cent of the experiments the ovarian response was poor and ovulation did not occur. Ovulation did occur at sexual maturity, but only the normal number of ova was shed."

https://openalex.org/W4251603121,"WE have recently prepared isoxanthopterin (2-amino-4:7-dihydroxypteridine) by a new synthesis, namely, the condensation of triamino-4-hydroxypyrimidine with ethyl glyoxylate hemiacetal. The synthesis, purification and analysis will be reported in detail elsewhere. The ultra-violet spectrum of the product consisted of three peaks at the λmax. values previously reported1,2, but the extinction coefficients were so much higher as to suggest that the samples previously examined contained no more than 80 per cent of isoxanthopterin. Our results are as follows (material dried at 150°, analysing as anhydrous, dissolved in 0.1 N potassium hydroxide)."

https://openalex.org/W2065517024,"INFORMATION relative to the filterability of species of the genus Eperythrozoon apparently has not been published previously1. These blood parasites are classified1 in the order Rickettsiales, a group which includes numerous filterable agents. It is apparent that passage or retention of Eperythrozoon by the usual bacteriological filters would not serve as any criterion for altering their present classification."
https://openalex.org/W1999733666,"THE parasitism of barnacles of many species by various isopods, gregarines and trematodes, often with the resultant castration of the host, is well known. Recent observations on Balanus balanus collected in the Firth of Clyde, at a depth of about 20 metres, have shown that parasitism may not result in complete castration, but only in non-liberation of the nauplii."
