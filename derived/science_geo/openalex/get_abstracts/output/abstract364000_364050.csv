https://openalex.org/W2047189523,"Amazon forests are a key but poorly understood component of the global carbon cycle. If, as anticipated, they dry this century, they might accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changed surface energy balances. We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 × 10 15 to 1.6 × 10 15 grams). Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change."

We used resonant x-ray scattering to probe the relative phases of constituent atomic orbitals in an electronic wave function, which uncovers the unconventional Mott insulating state induced by relativistic spin-orbit coupling in the layered 5 d transition metal oxide Sr 2 IrO 4 . A selection rule based on intra-atomic interference effects establishes a complex spin-orbital state represented by an effective total angular momentum = 1/2 quantum number, the phase of which can lead to a quantum topological state of matter."
https://openalex.org/W2020040634,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are regularly used to map genomic regions contributing to common human diseases, but they often do not identify the precise causative genes and sequence variants. To identify causative type 1 diabetes (T1D) variants, we resequenced exons and splice sites of 10 candidate genes in pools of DNA from 480 patients and 480 controls and tested their disease association in over 30,000 participants. We discovered four rare variants that lowered T1D risk independently of each other (odds ratio = 0.51 to 0.74; P = 1.3 × 10 –3 to 2.1 × 10 –16 ) in IFIH1 ( interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 ), a gene located in a region previously associated with T1D by GWASs. These variants are predicted to alter the expression and structure of IFIH1 [MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5)], a cytoplasmic helicase that mediates induction of interferon response to viral RNA. This finding firmly establishes the role of IFIH1 in T1D and demonstrates that resequencing studies can pinpoint disease-causing genes in genomic regions initially identified by GWASs."
https://openalex.org/W2140872369,"Through complete sequencing of the protein-coding genes in a patient with familial pancreatic cancer, we identified a germline, truncating mutation in PALB2 that appeared responsible for this patient's predisposition to the disease. Analysis of 96 additional patients with familial pancreatic cancer revealed three distinct protein-truncating mutations, thereby validating the role of PALB2 as a susceptibility gene for pancreatic cancer. PALB2 mutations have been previously reported in patients with familial breast cancer, and the PALB2 protein is a binding partner for BRCA2. These results illustrate that complete, unbiased sequencing of protein-coding genes can lead to the identification of a gene responsible for a hereditary disease."
https://openalex.org/W2158924104,"Patten recognition receptors, which recognize pathogens or components of injured cells (danger), trigger activation of the innate immune system. Whether and how the host distinguishes between danger- versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns remains unresolved. We report that CD24-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to danger- but not pathogen-associated molecular patterns. CD24 associates with high mobility group box 1, heat shock protein 70, and heat shock protein 90; negatively regulates their stimulatory activity; and inhibits nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. This occurs at least in part through CD24 association with Siglec-10 in humans or Siglec-G in mice. Our results reveal that the CD24–Siglec G pathway protects the host against a lethal response to pathological cell death and discriminates danger- versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2054735667,"The small molecular weight G-protein RAB7 is localized to both early and late endosomes and has been shown to be critical for trafficking through the endocytic pathway. The role of RAB7 in the endocytic pathway has been controversial, with some groups reporting that it regulates trafficking from early to late endosomes and others ascribing its role to trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes. In this study, we use RNA interference to identify the exact step RAB7 regulates in the movement of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from the cell surface to the lysosome. In the absence of RAB7, trafficking of the EGF.EGFR complex through the early endosome to the late endosome/multivesicular body (LE/MVB) does not change, but exiting from the LE/MVB is blocked. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that RAB7 is not required for formation of intraluminal vesicles of the LE/MVB, since RAB7-deficient cells have an increased number of enlarged LE/MVBs densely packed with intraluminal vesicles. Biochemical data indicate that the EGFR complex is sequestered in these intraluminal vesicles. Together, these data provide evidence that RAB7 is required for the transfer of cargo from the LE/MVB to the lysosome and for endocytic organelle maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2045674449,"Glutamate receptors of the AMPA-subtype (AMPARs), together with the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Here, we show by proteomic analysis that the majority of AMPARs in the rat brain are coassembled with two members of the cornichon family of transmembrane proteins, rather than with the TARPs. Coassembly with cornichon homologs 2 and 3 affects AMPARs in two ways: Cornichons increase surface expression of AMPARs, and they alter channel gating by markedly slowing deactivation and desensitization kinetics. These results demonstrate that cornichons are intrinsic auxiliary subunits of native AMPARs and provide previously unknown molecular determinants for glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1979346865,"Objective The antigen, falciparum malaria protein 1 (FMP1), represents the 42-kDa C-terminal fragment of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of the 3D7 clone of P. falciparum. Formulated with AS02 (a proprietary Adjuvant System), it constitutes the FMP1/AS02 candidate malaria vaccine. We evaluated this vaccine's safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in African children. Methods A randomised, double-blind, Phase IIb, comparator-controlled trial.The trial was conducted in 13 field stations of one mile radii within Kombewa Division, Nyanza Province, Western Kenya, an area of holoendemic transmission of P. falciparum. We enrolled 400 children aged 12–47 months in general good health.Children were randomised in a 1∶1 fashion to receive either FMP1/AS02 (50 µg) or Rabipur® rabies vaccine. Vaccinations were administered on a 0, 1, and 2 month schedule. The primary study endpoint was time to first clinical episode of P. falciparum malaria (temperature ≥37.5°C with asexual parasitaemia of ≥50,000 parasites/µL of blood) occurring between 14 days and six months after a third dose. Case detection was both active and passive. Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated for eight months after first immunisations; vaccine efficacy (VE) was measured over a six-month period following third vaccinations. Results 374 of 400 children received all three doses and completed six months of follow-up. FMP1/AS02 had a good safety profile and was well-tolerated but more reactogenic than the comparator. Geometric mean anti-MSP-142 antibody concentrations increased from1.3 µg/mL to 27.3 µg/mL in the FMP1/AS02 recipients, but were unchanged in controls. 97 children in the FMP1/AS02 group and 98 controls had a primary endpoint episode. Overall VE was 5.1% (95% CI: −26% to +28%; p-value = 0.7). Conclusions FMP1/AS02 is not a promising candidate for further development as a monovalent malaria vaccine. Future MSP-142 vaccine development should focus on other formulations and antigen constructs. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00223990"
https://openalex.org/W2057456254,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins are central to host defense in plants and animals. We show that in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, two such proteins that antagonize malaria parasite infections, LRIM1 and APL1C, circulate in the hemolymph as a high-molecular-weight complex held together by disulfide bridges. The complex interacts with the complement C3-like protein, TEP1, promoting its cleavage or stabilization and its subsequent localization on the surface of midgut-invading Plasmodium berghei parasites, targeting them for destruction. LRIM1 and APL1C are members of a protein family with orthologs in other disease vector mosquitoes and appear to be important effectors in innate mosquito defenses against human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2128008192,"Attaining high photoluminescence quantum yields for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in order to broaden their optoelectronics and sensing applications has been a challenging task. Among various nonradiative pathways, sidewall chemisorption of oxygen provides a known defect for exciton quenching through nanotube hole doping. We found that an aliphatic (dodecyl) analog of flavin mononucleotide, FC12, leads to high dispersion of SWNTs, which tend to aggregate into bundles. Unlike other surfactants, the surface organization of FC12 is sufficiently tight to exclude oxygen from the SWNT surface, which led to quantum yields as high as 20%. Toluene-dispersed, FC12-wrapped nanotubes exhibited an absorption spectrum with ultrasharp peaks (widths of 12 to 25 milli–electron volts) devoid of the characteristic background absorption of most nanotube dispersions."
https://openalex.org/W2084936031,"How environmental change affects species abundances depends on both the food web within which species interact and their potential to evolve. Using field experiments, we investigated both ecological and evolutionary responses of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), a common agricultural pest, to increased frequency of episodic heat shocks. One predator species ameliorated the decrease in aphid population growth with increasing heat shocks, whereas a second predator did not, with this contrast caused by behavioral differences between predators. We also compared aphid strains with stably inherited differences in heat tolerance caused by bacterial endosymbionts and showed the potential for rapid evolution for heat-shock tolerance. Our results illustrate how ecological and evolutionary complexities should be incorporated into predictions of the consequences of environmental change for species' populations."
https://openalex.org/W2076565862,"The mutation rates of viroids, plant pathogens with minimal non-protein-coding RNA genomes, are unknown. Their replication is mediated by host RNA polymerases and, in some cases, by hammerhead ribozymes, small self-cleaving motifs embedded in the viroid. By using the principle that the population frequency of nonviable genotypes equals the mutation rate, we screened for changes that inactivated the hammerheads of Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid. We obtained a mutation rate of 1/400 per site, the highest reported for any biological entity. Such error-prone replication can only be tolerated by extremely simple genomes such as those of viroids and, presumably, the primitive replicons of the RNA world. Our results suggest that the emergence of replication fidelity was critical for the evolution of complexity in the early history of life."
https://openalex.org/W2161199533,"Proteins in bacteria often deploy to particular places within the cell, but the cues for localization are frequently mysterious. We found that the peripheral membrane protein SpoVM (VM) recognizes a geometric cue when localizing to a particular membrane during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis . Sporulation involves an inner cell maturing into a spore and an outer cell nurturing the developing spore. VM is produced in the outer cell, where it embeds in the membrane that surrounds the inner cell but not in the cytoplasmic membrane of the outer cell. We found that VM localized by discriminating between the positive curvature of the membrane surrounding the inner cell and the negative curvature of the cytoplasmic membrane. Membrane curvature could be a general cue for protein localization in bacteria."

Consequently, knowledge of signals that regulate β-cell function is of immense clinical relevance. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling plays a critical role in pancreatic development although the role of this pathway in the adult pancreas is obscure. Here, we define an important role of the TGF-β pathway in regulation of insulin gene transcription and β-cell function. We identify insulin as a TGF-β target gene and show that the TGF-β signaling effector Smad3 occupies the insulin gene promoter and represses insulin gene transcription. In contrast, Smad3 small interfering RNAs relieve insulin transcriptional repression and enhance insulin levels. Transduction of adenoviral Smad3 into primary human and non-human primate islets suppresses insulin content, whereas, dominant-negative Smad3 enhances insulin levels. Consistent with this, Smad3-deficient mice exhibit moderate hyperinsulinemia and mild hypoglycemia. Moreover, Smad3 deficiency results in improved glucose tolerance and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo. In ex vivo perifusion assays, Smad3-deficient islets exhibit improved glucose-stimulated insulin release. Interestingly, Smad3-deficient islets harbor an activated insulin-receptor signaling pathway and TGF-β signaling regulates expression of genes involved in β-cell function. Together, these studies emphasize TGF-β/Smad3 signaling as an important regulator of insulin gene transcription and β-cell function and suggest that components of the TGF-β signaling pathway may be dysregulated in diabetes.

Incidence of the “metabolic syndrome,” a complex condition linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity, is increasing worldwide (1Kahn S.E. Hull R.L. Utzschneider K.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (3541) Google Scholar). The pancreatic islet β-cell, due to its unique function of insulin synthesis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, is a prime target of affliction in diabetes (2Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S.

Ligand binding and receptor activation leads to phosphorylation and activation of Smads, which translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. Development of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas is controlled by factors that include members of the TGF-β superfamily (7Kim S.K. Hebrok M.

TGF-β isoforms are expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme of embryonic pancreas and in adult pancreas (14Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Buchler M. Beger H.G. Gold L.I. Korc M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Islet cells demonstrate diffuse cytoplasmic immunostaining for TGF-β isoforms with most of the positive islet cells co-expressing insulin. TGF-β receptors (TβRI and TβRII) are present in the pancreatic epithelium and mesenchyme during early stages of development and postnatally in pancreatic islets and ducts. Furthermore, Smad proteins are expressed in the pancreas, which elucidates that components needed for activation of the canonical TGF-β signaling exist within the pancreas. Disruption of TGF-β signaling at the receptor level using mice expressing the dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor (DNTβRII) resulted in increased proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells and severely perturbed acinar differentiation (15Bottinger E.P.

Although these studies underscore the importance of TGF-β signaling in β-cell development, they do not address its role in postnatal β-cell growth and function. In this article, we examined the role of TGF-β signaling in β-cell function and uncover its importance in regulating insulin levels and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Cell Culture—The pancreatic β-cell line INS-1E (obtained from Dr. C. Wollheim) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES. βHC9 and NIT (ATCC, VA) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured in medium with 10% FBS, which contains less than 0.5–1 ng/ml of total TGF-β1 (greater than 99% of TGF-β1 is in latent form, which is not immediately available to the cells). During TGF-β stimulation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with medium containing 0.2% FBS with 11 mm glucose after which they were treated with/without 2–5 ng/ml of TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Indianapolis, IN). Islet Isolation—Non-human primate and cadaver human pancreatic islets were isolated and cultured as described previously (18Brissova M. Fowler M.J. Nicholson W.E. Chu A. Hirshberg B. Harlan D.M.

Animals were euthanized and their pancreases were inflated with cold collagenase type V (Sigma, C-9263) dissolved in Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing Hanks' balanced salt solution. The pancreatic tissues were digested for 15–20 min at 37 °C. Islets were separated by Ficoll gradient (density: 1.077) by centrifuging at 1700 × g for 5 min. Middle islet-enriched fraction was collected and washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media. The islets were handpicked using a glass pipette under a stereomicroscope for further assays. TGF-β Treatment of Primary Islets—Islets were isolated from 6-week-old wild-type mice as described above and 70–80 islets were plated per well in a 24-well plate with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (with 0.2% FBS). After 1 h, the medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 and 0.2% FBS. Control islets were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium without TGF-β1. After 24 h of incubation, islets were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for RNA isolation and quantitative gene expression. Plasmids—pGL3INS2.9-Luc (hINS-Luc) was generated by subcloning the human insulin promoter (nucleotide -2852 to +1) (kindly provided by Dr. M. German and Dr. G. Bell) into the NheI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). pGL3INS-0.15 kb-Luc was generated by deletion of the entire region upstream of 0.15 kb of the pGL3INS2.9-Luc.

Inhibitor of the TGF-β receptor 1 kinase (SB431542) was from Sigma. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid (hINS-Luc, CAGA12-Luc, SBE4-Luc with/without Renilla luciferase) with/without 0.2 μg of TβRII or Smad expression vectors using FuGENE 6 (Roche). Two days after transfection cells were replaced with medium containing 0.2% FBS with 11 mm glucose and left untreated or stimulated with 2–5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h before harvesting. Reporter activity was measured using the enhanced luciferase assay kit (BD Biosciences) and normalized to total protein measured by the BCA kit (Pierce) or to Renilla luciferase activity. Reporter assays were repeated at least 4–5 times, with each repeat inclusive of triplicates of each transfection or condition (such as siRNA, drug, or ligand treatments). Average of triplicates along with standard deviation is provided for each representative experiment. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—INS-1E or βHC9 cells, with or without transfection with Smad3 + Smad4 expression vectors, were used in ChIP assays that were performed using a commercial kit from Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, proteins and chromatin were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, and sonicated in SDS lysis buffer. Nonspecific binding was eliminated via preincubation with salmon sperm DNA and Protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-Smad3, anti-Pdx1, or control antiserum overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected and histone complex was eluted and reverse cross-linked. Recovered DNA was amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs: pair 1, -316 bp (5′-GGAATGATGTGGAAAAATGCTCAGCCAA-3′), and -131 bp (5′-CTTGCCTGGTGCTAGGTCTGCAGAAA-3′) from the transcriptional start site of rat insulin II promoter to yield a 185-bp fragment in INS-1E cells; pair 2, -327 bp (5′GGAATGATGTGGAAAAATGCTCAGCCAA-3′) and -143 bp (5′-CTTGCCTGGTGCTAGGTCTGCAGAAA-3′) from the transcriptional start site of mouse II insulin promoter to yield an 186-bp fragment in βHC9 cells. RNA Oligonucleotides and siRNA Transfection—siRNA duplexes targeting Smad3 were obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. The sense strand sequence of the siRNA was 5′-TCCGCATGAGCTTCGTCAA-3′. To determine the effect of Smad3 siRNA on reporter constructs, cells were transfected with 25–100 nm Smad3 siRNA or 42% GC control siRNA together with 1 μg of reporter using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in RPMI complete medium (with 10% FBS). Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection and luciferase activity was measured. Insulin and C-peptide Assay—Cells were transfected with Smad3 siRNA or 42% GC control siRNA in RPMI complete media. After 72 h of transfection cells were preincubated for 1 h in RPMI medium containing 0.2% FBS and 11 mm glucose, then replaced with fresh medium and incubated for 2 h. Released insulin/C-peptide was measured from the collected medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Alpco). Total insulin from cells or primary islets was extracted with acid-ethanol overnight at -20 °C and the insulin level was normalized to protein content. Pancreatic insulin was prepared by homogenizing the whole pancreas in acid-ethanol and extracted overnight at -20 °C. Primary islets were transduced with Ad-LacZ, Ad-GFP, Ad-Smad3, and Ad-DN-Smad3 in RPMI complete media with 11 mm glucose. Released or total insulin/C-peptide was measured as described above. Recombinant Adenovirus—Smad3WT and DNSmad3 fragments were subcloned into shuttle vector Ad5CMV-K NpA (ViraQuest). Recombinant adenovirus were amplified and purified by CsCl2 ultracentrifugation. Ad-eGFP and Ad-LacZ were used to monitor the transduction efficiency and as control virus. Transduction efficiency was monitored by evaluating GFP fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1). Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 6–50 viral particles/cell. Primary islets were transduced with 75–100 viral particles/cell in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS with 11 mm glucose, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. The expression levels of Ad-Smad3 and Ad-DN-Smad3 were confirmed by Western blot analyses (data not shown). Each transduction experiment was performed on multiple preparations (n = 5 each) of non-human primate or human cadaver donor islets. Each experiment included triplicates of individual adenoviral transduction (Ad-GFP, Ad-LacZ, Ad-Smad3, or Ad-DN-Smad3). Average of triplicates along with standard deviation is provided for each representative experiment. Animals—Mouse maintenance, breeding, and genotyping were as described elsewhere (27Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless mentioned otherwise, all animals were fed ad libitum on a standard pellet diet with free access to water and were kept in a room in which a 12-h light-dark cycle (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) was enforced. All experiments were conducted on 2–4-month-old age and sex-matched littermates. All animal experiments were approved by the NIH animal care and use committee. Glucose Tolerance Test—Glucose tolerance test was performed on 4-month-old male and female mice after overnight fast. Glucose (2 g/kg of body weight) was injected intraperitoneally. Tail blood samples were drawn before (time 0) and at the indicated times after injection for automated glucose measurement (AscensiaELITE, Bayer, IN). Insulin Secretion Assay—To examine glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, 2-month-old female mice were fasted for 16 h and then injected intraperitoneally with glucose (4 g/kg of body weight). Blood was collected at the indicated time points in heparinized tubes and plasma insulin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Histological and Immunohistochemistry Assessment—Pancreas was removed and fixed in 10% formalin. Sections were prepared at 5-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Sections were immunostained with guinea pig anti-insulin (1:1000, Dako), rabbit antiglucagon (1:200, Sigma), and rabbit anti-Smad3 (1:200, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies. For insulin immunohistochemistry, biotin-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG was used followed by the ABC-AP (alkaline phosphatase) system from Vector Laboratories. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium from Sigma was used as AP substrate to develop a blue-purple color. For immunofluorescence staining, Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes and Invitrogen. Measurement of the β-Cell Mass Ratio—Quantitative evaluation of the β-cell area was performed on insulin-stained sections using image analysis software (Metamorph). The ratio of the β-cell mass was calculated by dividing the entire insulin-positive β-cell area in the whole pancreatic section by the total area of these fields. The analysis was done in three sections (200 μm apart) from one animal and four animals from each group. Islet Perifusion—200 islets from 2-month-old male Smad3+/+ and Smad3-/- mice were handpicked under a dissecting microscope and placed in a plastic perifusion chamber. The perifusate was Krebs buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.2 mmol/liter Ca2+, 0.25% of bovine serum albumin and then equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Islets were cultured for 3–5 days in 10 mm glucose and then perifused. Islets were maintained for the first 20 min at 0 mm glucose. From 20 to 60 min a physiological mixture of amino acids was introduced. At 50 min, a glucose ramp was initiated where glucose was added on top of the amino acids at 0.83 mm/min. At 80 min all stimuli were removed until 100 min where 30 mm KCl was added until 120 min. At the end of the experiment, islets were tested for maximum insulin secretion through KCl-mediated depolarization by introducing 30 mmol/liter KCl. Experiments were performed three times as described earlier with minor modifications (28Collins H. Najafi H. Buettger C. Rombeau J. Settle R.G. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1357-1366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and results from representative experiments are presented as nanograms of insulin/200 islets/min. Western Blot Analyses—Protein extracts for Western blots were prepared from freshly isolated islets in lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Non-idet P-40, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/liter sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche) as described elsewhere (29Yakar S. Liu J.L. Fernandez A.M. Wu Y. Schally A.V. Frystyk J. Chernausek S.D. Mejia W. Le Roith D. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Twenty-five μg of protein was fractionated onto a 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were incubated with the primary antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody before final detection by chemiluminescence and autoradiography. α-Tubulin was used as loading control. Antibodies used were: p-Akt, Akt, p-FoxO1, FoxO1, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and phospho-Smad3 antibody from Cell Signaling Technology; α-tubulin was from Sigma. Total Smad3 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc. Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Islets and INS-1E cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and processed for RNA isolation using the RNeasy® kit (Qiagen, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to complementary cDNA using the ABI reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative gene expression was analyzed by using TaqMan Express Plates (Applied Biosystems). For experiments with islets, three independent samples were prepared from age and sex-matched Smad3+/+ (n = 3) and/or Smad3-/- (n = 3) mice. PCR were carried out in triplicate. The results are presented as percent change in gene expression relative to 18 S expression. Statistical Analyses—All measurements in this study are presented as mean ± S.E. or S.D. The differences between the two groups in glucose tolerance tests were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (SAS 9.1, SAS Inc., NC). All other differences were determined with Student's t tests, the significance was accepted at p < 0.05. TGF-β/Smad3 Represses Insulin Gene Transcription—To examine the potential regulatory effects of TGF-β on insulin gene transcription we studied a 2.9-kb human insulin promoter-driven luciferase reporter (hINS-Luc). Primary rat islets respond to TGF-β as evidenced by a robust activation of the TGF-β responsive reporters, CAGA12-Luciferase and Smad-binding element (SBE)-Luciferase (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, under identical conditions, TGF-β potently repressed hINS-Luc in primary rat islets (Fig. 1A). β-Cell lines INS-1E, βHC9, and NIT exhibit a diminished TGF-β response due to reduced TβRII expression (data not shown). Exogenous TβRII expression restored TGF-β responsiveness to INS-1E cells as demonstrated by enhanced CAGA12-Luc activity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, TβRII effectively repressed basal and TGF-β-mediated hINS-Luc reporter activity (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, TβRII transfection resulted in a dramatic inhibitory effect on hINS-Luc activity independent of ligand (Fig. 1B). Pre-treatment of INS-1E cells with small molecule inhibitors of the TβRI kinase blunted insulin promoter repression by TGFβ1/TβRII (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the suppressive effect of TβRII in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1B) was not completely relieved by the small molecule TβRI kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1C), suggesting that TβRII may have a TGFβ/TβRI-independent effect on insulin promoter activity. To further examine the role of TGF-β in repression of hINS-Luc, we utilized a constitutively active TβRI kinase (CA-activin-like kinase 5; CA-ALK5 or CA-TβRI) that bypasses the need for phosphorylation-dependent activation of TβRI by TβRII. As expected, CA-ALK5 expression enhanced CAGA12-Luc reporter activity and, in contrast, CA-ALK5 effectively repressed the insulin promoter (Fig. 1D). Together, these studies indicate that TGF-β signaling represses insulin promoter activity. Smad proteins are the established intracellular effectors of TGF-β signaling (5Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Upon TGF-β ligand binding, the activated TβRI/ALK-5 receptors recruit and phosphorylate receptor-Smads, i.e. Smad2 and Smad3. We thus examined the role of Smad2 and Smad3 in mediating repression of the insulin promoter. Interestingly, Smad3, but not Smad2, repressed the insulin promoter (Fig. 2A). Wild-type Smad3 and constitutively active Smad3 (CA-Smad3), but not a phosphorylation-defective mutant of Smad3 (SA), activated CAGA12-Luc in INS-1E cells (Fig. 2B). Smad2 or constitutively active Smad2 (CA-Smad2) was unable to activate the CAGA12-Luc reporter (supplemental Fig. S2) that is specific to Smad3-mediated activation (20Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 23Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Wild-type and constitutively active Smad3 (CA-Smad3), but not constitutively activated Smad2 (CA-Smad2), repressed hINS-Luc (Fig. 2C). Dominant-negative Smad3(SA), which cannot be phosphorylated by activated TβRI, was also unable to repress hINS-Luc (Fig. 2C). The MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad3 facilitate its nuclear import and are critical for both the DNA binding activity and the ability of Smad3 to interact with transcription factors (4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 5Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed activation of CAGA12-Luc by wild-type Smad3, but not Smad3 with deletions in the MH1, MH2, or linker domains (Fig. 2D). In contrast, hINS-Luc activity was effectively repressed by wild-type Smad3, but not by Smad3 with deletions within the MHI, MH2, and linker domains (Fig. 2E), suggesting that these domains are required for repression. Taken together, these results illustrate the importance of TβRI-phosphorylated Smad3 in insulin gene repression. TGF-β signaling is propagated via recruitment of Smad transcription factors to promoters of the TGF-β target genes, often in complex with co-activators or co-repressors (4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 5Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 30Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Smad transcription factors bind DNA elements that comprise the core sequence 5′-GTCT-3′. In addition, to the GTCT element, many TGF-β target gene promoters contain Smad box-like elements (31Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comer A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the core GTCT sequence is oriented either “rightward” as 5′-GTCT-3′ or “leftward” as 5′-AGAC-3′ motifs (31Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comer A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1967648719,"Background Increasing evidence implicates the critical roles of epigenetic regulation in cancer. Very recent reports indicate that global gene silencing in cancer is associated with specific epigenetic modifications. However, the relationship between epigenetic switches and more dynamic patterns of gene activation and repression has remained largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Genome-wide profiling of the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and lysine 27 (H3K27me3) was performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with whole genome promoter microarray (ChIP-chip) techniques. Comparison of the ChIP-chip data and microarray gene expression data revealed that loss and/or gain of H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 were strongly associated with differential gene expression, including microRNA expression, between prostate cancer and primary cells. The most common switches were gain or loss of H3K27me3 coupled with low effect on gene expression. The least prevalent switches were between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 coupled with much higher fractions of activated and silenced genes. Promoter patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 corresponded strongly with coordinated expression changes of regulatory gene modules, such as HOX and microRNA genes, and structural gene modules, such as desmosome and gap junction genes. A number of epigenetically switched oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were found overexpressed and underexpressed accordingly in prostate cancer cells. Conclusions/Significance This work offers a dynamic picture of epigenetic switches in carcinogenesis and contributes to an overall understanding of coordinated regulation of gene expression in cancer. Our data indicate an H3K4me3/H3K27me3 epigenetic signature of prostate carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2070710923,"Background Oncogene activation plays a role in metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. We have previously shown that K-ras transformed fibroblasts have a stronger dependence on glycolysis and a reduced oxidative phosphorylation ability as compared to their normal counterparts. Another metabolic adaptation of cancer cells, that has long been established, is their propensity to exhibit increased glutamine consumption, although the effects induced by glutamine deprivation on cancer cells are still controversial. Methodology and Principal Findings Here, by using nutritional perturbations and molecular physiology, we show that reduction or complete depletion of glutamine availability in K-ras transformed fibroblasts causes a strong decrease of proliferation ability and a slower re-entry of synchronized cells into the cell cycle. The reduced proliferation is accompanied by sustained expression of cyclin D and E, abortive S phase entrance and is dependent on Ras signalling deregulation, since it is rescued by expression of a dominant negative guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The growth potential of transformed cells as well as the ability to execute the G1 to S transition is restored by adding the four deoxyribonucleotides, indicating that the arrest of proliferation of K-ras transformed cells induced by glutamine depletion is largely due to a reduced supply of DNA in the presence of signalling pathways promoting G1 to S transition. Conclusions and Significance Our results suggest that the differential effects of glutamine and glucose on cell viability are not a property of the transformed phenotype per se, but rather depend on the specific pathway being activated in transformation. For instance, myc-overexpressing cells have been reported to die under glutamine depletion and not under glucose shortage, while the opposite holds for ras-transformed fibroblasts as shown in this paper. These different responses of transformed cells to nutritional stress should be taken into account when designing anti-cancer therapies that aim to exploit metabolic differences between normal and transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062507766,"Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is an anaerobic intestinal spirochete that colonizes the large intestine of pigs and causes swine dysentery, a disease of significant economic importance. The genome sequence of B. hyodysenteriae strain WA1 was determined, making it the first representative of the genus Brachyspira to be sequenced, and the seventeenth spirochete genome to be reported. The genome consisted of a circular 3,000,694 base pair (bp) chromosome, and a 35,940 bp circular plasmid that has not previously been described. The spirochete had 2,122 protein-coding sequences. Of the predicted proteins, more had similarities to proteins of the enteric Escherichia coli and Clostridium species than they did to proteins of other spirochetes. Many of these genes were associated with transport and metabolism, and they may have been gradually acquired through horizontal gene transfer in the environment of the large intestine. A reconstruction of central metabolic pathways identified a complete set of coding sequences for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, a non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide metabolism, lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, and a respiratory electron transport chain. A notable finding was the presence on the plasmid of the genes involved in rhamnose biosynthesis. Potential virulence genes included those for 15 proteases and six hemolysins. Other adaptations to an enteric lifestyle included the presence of large numbers of genes associated with chemotaxis and motility. B. hyodysenteriae has diverged from other spirochetes in the process of accommodating to its habitat in the porcine large intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2117906569,"Acetylation of p53 at carboxyl-terminal lysine residues enhances its transcriptional activity associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that p53 acetylation at Lys-320/Lys-373/Lys-382 is also required for its transcription-independent functions in BAX activation, reactive oxygen species production, and apoptosis in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and LAQ824. Knock-out of p53 markedly reduced HDACi-induced apoptosis. Unexpectedly, expression of transactivation-deficient p53 variants sensitized p53-null cells to HDACi-mediated BAX-dependent apoptosis, whereas knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 in cancer cells reduced HDACi-mediated cytotoxicity. Evaluation of the mechanisms controlling this response led to the discovery of a novel interaction between p53 and Ku70. The association between these two proteins was acetylation-independent, but acetylation of p53 could prevent and disrupt the Ku70-BAX complex and enhance apoptosis. These results suggest a new mechanism of acetylated p53 transcription-independent regulation of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2012434765,"Aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands in housekeeping gene promoters and widespread genome hypomethylation are typical events occurring in cancer cells. The molecular mechanisms behind these cancer-related changes in DNA methylation patterns are not well understood. Two questions are particularly important: (i) how are CpG islands protected from methylation in normal cells, and how is this protection compromised in cancer cells, and (ii) how does the genome-wide demethylation in cancer cells occur. The latter question is especially intriguing since so far no DNA demethylase enzyme has been found.Our data show that the absence of ADP-ribose polymers (PARs), caused by ectopic over-expression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) in L929 mouse fibroblast cells leads to aberrant methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the Dnmt1 gene, which in turn shuts down its transcription. The transcriptional silencing of Dnmt1 may be responsible for the widespread passive hypomethylation of genomic DNA which we detect on the example of pericentromeric repeat sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results show that in normal cells the Dnmt1 promoter is occupied by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Parp1, suggesting that PARylated Parp1 plays a role in protecting the promoter from methylation.In conclusion, the genome methylation pattern following PARG over-expression mirrors the pattern characteristic of cancer cells, supporting our idea that the right balance between Parp/Parg activities maintains the DNA methylation patterns in normal cells. The finding that in normal cells Parp1 and ADP-ribose polymers localize on the Dnmt1 promoter raises the possibility that PARylated Parp1 marks those sequences in the genome that must remain unmethylated and protects them from methylation, thus playing a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2058538156,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding genes that participate in post-transcription regulation by either degrading mRNA or blocking its translation. It is considered to be very important in regulating insect development and metamorphosis. We conducted a large-scale screening for miRNA genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori using sequence-by-synthesis (SBS) deep sequencing of mixed RNAs from egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. Of 2,227,930 SBS tags, 1,144,485 ranged from 17 to 25 nt, corresponding to 256,604 unique tags. Among these non-redundant tags, 95,184 were matched to the silkworm genome. We identified 3,750 miRNA candidate genes using a computational pipeline combining RNAfold and TripletSVM algorithms. We confirmed 354 miRNA genes using miRNA microarrays and then performed expression profile analysis on these miRNAs for all developmental stages. While 106 miRNAs were expressed in all stages, 248 miRNAs were egg- and pupa-specific, suggesting that insect miRNAs play a significant role in embryogenesis and metamorphosis. We selected eight miRNAs for quantitative RT-PCR analysis; six of these were consistent with our microarray results. In addition, we searched for orthologous miRNA genes in mammals, a nematode, and other insects and found that most silkworm miRNAs are conserved in insects, whereas only a small number of silkworm miRNAs has orthologs in mammals and the nematode. These results suggest that there are many miRNAs unique to insects."
https://openalex.org/W2065229246,"Although many properties of polyatomic metal clusters have been rationalized by an electron shell model resembling that used for free atoms, it remained unclear how reliable this analogy is with respect to the angular momentum eigenstate character of the electronic wave functions. We studied free size-selected negatively charged clusters of sodium atoms (Na n – ) of approximately spherical shape ( n = 19, 40, 55, 58, 147) by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy over a broad range of photon energies (1.5 to 5 electron volts). Highly anisotropic, state- and energy-dependent angular distributions emerged for all sizes. Well-defined classes of energy dependence related to the approximate angular momenta of the bound-state orbitals indicate that the overall character of the valence electron wave functions is not appreciably influenced by the interaction with the ion background. The measured distributions nevertheless deviate strongly from the predictions of single-electron models, hinting at a distinct role of correlated multielectron effects in the photoemission process."
https://openalex.org/W2054610585,"The aim of the present study was to identify the signaling mechanisms to ghrelin-stimulated activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. In human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transfected with GHS-R1a, ghrelin leads to the activation of Akt through the interplay of distinct signaling mechanisms: an early Gi/o protein-dependent pathway and a late pathway mediated by β-arrestins. The starting point is the Gi/o-protein dependent PI3K activation that leads to the membrane recruitment of Akt, which is phosphorylated at Y by c-Src with the subsequent phosphorylation at A-loop (T308) and HM (S473) by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. Once the receptor is activated, a second signaling pathway is mediated by β-arrestins 1 and 2, involving the recruitment of at least β-arrestins, c-Src and Akt. This β-arrestin-scaffolded complex leads to full activation of Akt through PDK1 and mTORC2, which are not associated to the complex. In agreement with these results, assays performed in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells indicate that β-arrestins and c-Src are implicated in the activation of Akt in response to ghrelin through the GHS-R1a. In summary this work reveals that c-Src is crucially involved in the ghrelin-mediated Akt activation. Furthermore, the results support the view that β-arrestins act as both scaffolding proteins and signal transducers on Akt activation."
https://openalex.org/W2102973010,"The present study provides evidence that abnormal patterns of global histone modification are present in the skeletal muscle nuclei of mdx mice and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. A combination of specific histone H3 modifications, including Ser-10 phosphorylation, acetylation of Lys 9 and 14, and Lys 79 methylation, were found enriched in muscle biopsies from human patients affected by DMD and in late-term fetuses, early postnatal pups, or adult mdx mice. In this context, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed an enrichment of these modifications at the loci of genes involved in proliferation or inflammation, suggesting a regulatory effect on gene expression. Remarkably, the reexpression of dystrophin induced by gentamicin treatment or the administration of nitric oxide (NO) donors reversed the abnormal pattern of H3 histone modifications. These findings suggest an unanticipated link between the dystrophin-activated NO signaling and the remodeling of chromatin. In this context, the regulation of class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 and 5 was found altered as a consequence of the reduced NO-dependent protein phosphatase 2A activity, indicating that both NO and class IIa HDACs are important for satellite cell differentiation and gene expression in mdx mice. In conclusion, this work provides the first evidence of a role for NO as an epigenetic regulator in DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2091447825,"Ovulation is an essential physiological process in sexual reproduction; however, the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. We have previously shown that OAMB, a Drosophila G-protein-coupled receptor for octopamine (the insect counterpart of mammalian norepinephrine), is required for ovulation induced upon mating. OAMB is expressed in the nervous and reproductive systems and has two isoforms (OAMB-AS and OAMB-K3) with distinct capacities to increase intracellular Ca2+ or intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP in vitro. Here, we investigated tissue specificity and intracellular signals required for OAMB's function in ovulation. Restricted OAMB expression in the adult oviduct epithelium, but not the nervous system, reinstated ovulation in oamb mutant females, in which either OAMB isoform was sufficient for the rescue. Consistently, strong immunoreactivities for both isoforms were observed in the wild-type oviduct epithelium. To delineate the cellular mechanism by which OAMB regulates ovulation, we explored protein kinases functionally interacting with OAMB by employing a new GAL4 driver with restricted expression in the oviduct epithelium. Conditional inhibition of Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), but not protein kinase A or C, in the oviduct epithelium inhibited ovulation. Moreover, constitutively active CaMKII, but not protein kinase A, expressed only in the adult oviduct epithelium fully rescued the oamb female's phenotype, demonstrating CaMKII as a major downstream molecule conveying the OAMB's ovulation signal. This is consistent with the ability of both OAMB isoforms, whose common intracellular signal in vitro is Ca2+, to reinstate ovulation in oamb females. These observations reveal the critical roles of the oviduct epithelium and its cellular components OAMB and CaMKII in ovulation. It is conceivable that the OAMB-mediated cellular activities stimulated upon mating are crucial for secretory activities suitable for egg transfer from the ovary to the uterus."
https://openalex.org/W2082102400,"Parkinsonism is one of the major neurological symptoms in Wilson disease, and young workers who worked in the copper smelting industry also developed Parkinsonism. We have reported the specific neurotoxic action of copper·dopamine complex in neurons with dopamine uptake. Copper·dopamine complex (100 μm) induces cell death in RCSN-3 cells by disrupting the cellular redox state, as demonstrated by a 1.9-fold increase in oxidized glutathione levels and a 56% cell death inhibition in the presence of 500 μm ascorbic acid; disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential with a spherical shape and well preserved morphology determined by transmission electron microscopy; inhibition (72%, p < 0.001) of phosphatidylserine externalization with 5 μm cyclosporine A; lack of caspase-3 activation; formation of autophagic vacuoles containing mitochondria after 2 h; transfection of cells with green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 plasmid showing that 68% of cells presented autophagosome vacuoles; colocalization of positive staining for green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 and Rhod-2AM, a selective indicator of mitochondrial calcium; and DNA laddering after 12-h incubation. These results suggest that the copper·dopamine complex induces mitochondrial autophagy followed by caspase-3-independent apoptotic cell death. However, a different cell death mechanism was observed when 100 μm copper·dopamine complex was incubated in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H quinone:oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2, also known as DT-diaphorase and NQ01), because a more extensive and rapid cell death was observed. In addition, cyclosporine A had no effect on phosphatidylserine externalization, significant portions of compact chromatin were observed within a vacuolated nuclear membrane, DNA laddering was less pronounced, the mitochondria morphology was more affected, and the number of cells with autophagic vacuoles was a near 4-fold less.

However, a different cell death mechanism was observed when 100 μm copper·dopamine complex was incubated in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H quinone:oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2, also known as DT-diaphorase and NQ01), because a more extensive and rapid cell death was observed. In addition, cyclosporine A had no effect on phosphatidylserine externalization, significant portions of compact chromatin were observed within a vacuolated nuclear membrane, DNA laddering was less pronounced, the mitochondria morphology was more affected, and the number of cells with autophagic vacuoles was a near 4-fold less. A possible role of copper in the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons is supported by the fact that patients with neurological Wilson disease, a copper deposition disorder, display a number of extrapyramidal motor symptoms, including Parkinsonism. The cerebral manifestations in neurological Wilson disease are expressed as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, dyskinesia, and dysarthria (1Oder W. Prayer L. Grimm G. Spatt J. Ferenci P. Kollegger H. Schneider B. Gangl A. Deecke L. Neurology. 1993; 43: 120-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that neurological Wilson disease can be assigned to the group of secondary Parkinsonian syndromes (2Barthel H. Hermann W. Kluge R. Hesse S. Collingridge D.R. Wagner A. Sabri O. Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2003; 24: 234-238PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, young workers who worked in the copper smelting industry also developed Parkinsonism (3Caviedes P. Segura-Aguilar J. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: A25Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Studies performed in rats showed copper (Cu2+)-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Likewise, it was described that copper neurotoxicity in rat substantia nigra and striatum is dependent on NAD(P)H dehydrogenase inhibition (4Diaz-Veliz G. Paris I. Mora S. Raisman-Vozari R. Segura-Aguilar J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Yu W.R. Jiang H. Wang J. Xie J.X. Neurosci. Bull. 2008; 24: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All of these results support a possible role for copper in the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The general mechanism of toxicity, induced by the reduced form of copper (Cu+) catalyzing the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide through the Fenton reaction, cannot explain the specific degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsonism induced in neurological Wilson disease, or in miners working in the copper smelting industry. The selective action of copper can be explained by the ability of copper to form a complex with dopamine, allowing this metal to be transported by cells that have the ability to take up dopamine (6Paris I. Dagnino-Subiabre A. Marcelain K. Bennett L.B. Caviedes P. Caviedes R. Olea-Azar C. Segura-Aguilar J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This specific neurotoxic action of copper in neurons with dopamine uptake is dependent on (i) the ability of copper to form a complex with dopamine (Cu·DA) 2The abbreviations used are: DA, dopamine; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; GFP-LC3, green fluorescent protein-light chain 3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 2The abbreviations used are: DA, dopamine; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; GFP-LC3, green fluorescent protein-light chain 3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance. (6Paris I. Dagnino-Subiabre A. Marcelain K. Bennett L.B. Caviedes P. Caviedes R. Olea-Azar C. Segura-Aguilar J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Kiss T. Gergely A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1985; 25: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), (ii) uptake of Cu·DA complex by dopamine transporters, (iii) oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, and (iv) one-electron reduction of aminochrome by inhibiting NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (6Paris I. Dagnino-Subiabre A. Marcelain K. Bennett L.B. Caviedes P. Caviedes R. Olea-Azar C. Segura-Aguilar J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These findings may explain the selective neurotoxic action of copper in the brain, but they do not explain the cell death mechanism. Currently, cell death is divided into three categories: apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. At the current time, only apoptosis and autophagic cell death are generally accepted as being legitimate forms of programmed cell death. Alternative models of cell death have therefore been proposed, including para-apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, oncosis, and pyroptosis (8Wang Y. Li X. Wang L. Ding P. Zhang Y. Han W. Ma D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Bröker L.E. Kruyt F.A. Giaccone G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 3155-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 10Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar, 11Bredesen D.E.

Necrosis is characterized mostly by the absence of caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation. Apoptotic cells are characterized by the formation of blebs, chromatin condensation, DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the external membrane. This mode of cell death can be dependent or independent of activation of caspases (13Leprêtre C. Scovassi A.I. Shah G.M. Torriglia A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 41: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, autophagy can be distinguished from apoptosis by sequestration of bulk cytoplasm and organelles in double or multimembrane autophagic vacuoles that then fuse with the lysosomal system. Some of these described mechanisms are related to neurological diseases such as Parkinson disease (14Dagda R.K. Zhu J. Kulich S.M. Chu C.T.

Chem. 2008; 283: 23542-23556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Cells can use different methods to activate their own destruction, and more than one death program may be activated at the same time (16Rickmann M. Vaquero E.C. Malagelada J.R. Molero X.

The purpose of this study was to examine the Cu·DA complex-induced cell death mechanism in RCSN-3 cells, a cell line that expresses dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters (18Paris I.

Vector green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) was a gift from Dr. Zsolt Tallocky, Columbia University Medical Center. FuGENE HD was purchased from Roche Applied Science. In all experiments performed in this study, 100 μm Cu·DA complex was used. To obtain 100 μm Cu·DA in cell culture medium containing amino acids, which chelate Cu2+ (20Chikira M. Inoue M. Nagane R. Harada W. Shindo H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 66: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it was necessary to incubate 100 μm dopamine with 1 mm CuSO4 for 2 min (6Paris I. Dagnino-Subiabre A. Marcelain K. Bennett L.B. Caviedes P. Caviedes R. Olea-Azar C. Segura-Aguilar J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The RCSN-3 cell line grows in monolayers, with a doubling time of 52 h, a plating efficiency of 21%, and a saturation density of 56,000 cells/cm2 in normal growth media composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1), 10% bovine serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 40 mg/liter gentamicin sulfate. The cultures were kept in an incubator at 37 °C with 100% humidity, and the cells grew well in atmospheres of both 5% or 10% CO2 (6Paris I. Dagnino-Subiabre A. Marcelain K. Bennett L.B. Caviedes P.

Incubations—In all experiments performed in this study, we incubated RCSN-3 cells with 100 μm Cu·DA complex or 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol. For control conditions, we used 100 μm dopamine, 1 mm CuSO4, or 100 μm dicoumarol incubated alone. Cell Death—For Cu·DA complex cell death experiments, cells were incubated with cell culture medium but in the absence of bovine serum and phenol red for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 h. Cell death was measured by counting live and dead cells after staining with 0.5 μm Calcein AM and 5 μm ethidium homodimer-1 for 45 min at room temperature in the dark (LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit, Molecular Probes). Calcein AM is a marker for live cells, and ethidium homodimer-1 intercalates into the DNA of dead cells. Cells were counted with a phase-contrast microscope equipped with fluorescence using the following filters: Calcein AM: 450–490 nm (excitation) and 515–565 nm (emission); ethidium homodimer-1: 510–560 nm (excitation) and LP-590 nm (emission). GSH/Oxidized Glutathione—The measurement of glutathione was carried out using a fluorometric method (22Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with trypsin to 0.3% for 15 min at 37 °C and were washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in a solution containing 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, and 25% metaphosphoric acid and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. Glutathione in the supernatant was measured using a fluorometric method (22Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine Determination—RCSN-3 cells were incubated as described above for 2 h at 37 °C. Phosphatidylserine externalization was determined by staining the cells with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled annexin V (5 μl of annexin V/100 μl of solution, Vybrant™ Apoptosis Assay Kit #2, Molecular Probes) and 5 μm ethidium homodimer-1 in Annexin Binding Buffer (50 mm HEPES, 700 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were incubated at room temperature for 35 min. After the incubation period, the cells were washed with 1× Annexin Binding Buffer, and the samples were kept in darkness. The cells were counted in a phase-contrast microscope equipped with fluorescence. First the cells were counted using fluorescence and then using the following filters: Alexa Fluor 488: 450–490 nm (excitation) and 515–565 nm (emission); ethidium homodimer-1: 510–560 nm (excitation) and LP-590 nm (emission). Feulgen Staining—The cells were incubated as described above in the absence of bovine serum and phenol red for 3, 4, 7, and 12 h. Cells were fixed in 1 ml of ethanol:acetic acid (3:1) at 4 °C for 1 h and washed with 70% ethanol and distilled water three times for 5 min. The samples were hydrolyzed for 5 min in 5 n HCl at 20 °C and stained by the Feulgen procedure using Schiff reagent (Merck) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The samples were rinsed in acid-metabisulfite solution three times for 10 min and two times in water for 5 min before being dehydrated with alcohol (70, 95, and 100%) and air-dried. The cells were analyzed in a phase-contrast microscope equipped with fluorescence using the following filters: 510–560 nm (excitation) and LP-590 nm (emission). Caspase 3 Activation—RCSN-3 cells were incubated with Cu·DA complex as described above for 7 h were washed and fixed at –20 °C with 1 ml methanol (100%) for 30 min. After washing with PBS and incubation with 1.5% milk for 40 min at room temperature, the cells are incubated with 500 μl of antibodies against activated caspase 3 diluted 1:250 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the samples were incubated with biotinylated IgG anti-rabbit, diluted 1:500 for 90 min at room temperature under dark conditions. The samples were washed and incubated with Cy-3-conjugated Streptavidin at 1.5 μg/ml diluted in PBS for 1 h. To determine the specificity of caspase 3 activation, we used 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK and 100 μm DEVD-CHO preincubated for 1 h before the cells were stained with caspase 3. DNA Laddering—RCSN-3 cells were incubated as described above for 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were be incubated in 90 μl of 10% SDS and 810 μl of buffer TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 2–5 min at room temperature. As a positive control, 100 μm menadione was used. The extracted cells were placed in a tube containing 900 μl of saturated phenol and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was extracted by addition of 900 μl of saturated phenol and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. This procedure was performed twice. The aqueous phase was mixed with 900 μl of 24:1 chloroform:isoamilic ethanol and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min 4 °C. The aqueous phase was removed and resuspended in 90 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and isopropanol to fill the tube, incubated at –20 °C for 24 h, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dried at room temperature and resuspended in TE. The amount of DNA was measured spectrophotometrically, and 4 μg was run on an agarose gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in 2.5% agarose gels in TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1.6 mm EDTA). Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—RCSN-3 cells were incubated as described above for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were incubated in the dark for 40 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 1.5 μg/ml JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) in PBS and then washed three times with PBS. The cells were observed immediately after labeling using a confocal microscope to quantify the intensity of fluorescence simultaneously for the green monomeric form at 488 nm (excitation) and 510–525 nm (emission) and for red fluorescent aggregates-JC1 at 543 nm (excitation) and 570 nm (emission). Background images were obtained from a cell-free section of the coverslip. A ratio image generated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at 590 nm by the fluorescence intensity at 527 nm is reported as a relative mitochondrial membrane electric potential value (23Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells incubated as described above were pelleted and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 120 min, washed three times and post-fixed in osmium tetroxide 1% for 60 min. The cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol battery ranging from 20% to 100%, and were later placed in 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 ratios of propylene oxide or epom-812 resin for 1 h at room temperature, respectively. Ultrathin sections of 70 nm were made and impregnated with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. The sections were visualized in a Zeiss EM-900 transmission electron microscope at 50 kV and photographed. The negatives were scanned at 600 × 600 dpi resolution, and the images obtained were analyzed later with a PC-compatible computer using customized software. GFP-LC3 Plasmid Transfection—Cells were grown in culture medium in 24-well plates for 48 h after being transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid (gift from Dr. Zsolt Tallocky). To form the transfection complex, we used 2 μl of FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 0.5 μg of GFP-LC3 plasmid DNA in 25 μl of total volume of medium for each plate, kept in darkness the for 15 min. Thereafter, the transfection complex in 150 μl of culture medium was added to each plate, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. Then, 350 μl of culture medium was added to each plate and cultured for 2 days. Determination of GFP-LC3 and Rodamine-2AM Colocalization—GFP-LC3-transfected RCSN-3 cells were grown to 60% confluence on coverslips (25-mm diameter) and incubated with cell culture medium alone or in the presence of 3 μm Rhodamine-2AM for 1.5 h. The cells were visualized on a confocal microscope (LSM-410 Axiovert-100, Zeiss). GFP-LC3 fluorescence was determined by using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 510–525 nm. Rhodamine-2AM fluorescence was determined using 543 and 570 for excitation and emission, respectively. Data Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. values. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA for multiple comparisons and Student's t test for comparison between two given groups. Cell Death—A rapid linear increase in the cell death of RCSN-3 cells was observed when the cells were incubated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol for 4 h (82 ± 2% cell death, p < 0.001) This was followed by a slower increase in cell death between 4 and 12 h. Similarly, a slower cell death was induced by the incubation of cells with 100 μm Cu·DA complex alone, in which case a linear increase until 4 h (65 ± 1% cell death, p < 0.001) was also observed. Interestingly, the incubation of cells with 1 mm CuSO4 alone induced only moderate cell death and only after 7-h incubation (35 ± 2% cell death, p < 0.01). No significant cell death was observed when the cells were incubated with 100 μm dopamine or 100 μm dicoumarol alone (Fig. 1A). The oxidized glutathione levels significantly increased when the cells were incubated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence or presence of 100 μm dicoumarol (187%, p < 0.05 and 211%, p < 0.05, respectively). Likewise, the levels of reduced glutathione decreased significantly when the cells were incubated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol (67% decrease, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the redox state was involved in Cu·DA complex-induced cell death, we incubated the cells in the presence of 500 μm ascorbic acid for 2 h. A significant decrease in the cell death was observed in the presence of ascorbic acid in cells treated with Cu·DA complex in the absence or presence of dicoumarol (56%, p < 0.001 and 69%, p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 1C). Phosphatidylserine Externalization—The externalizations of phosphatidylserine and ethidium homodimer-1, as a marker for cell death, were detected in cells incubated for 2 h. The incubation of the cells with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol did not induce a significant increase in the externalization of phosphatidylserine (16 ± 8%) despite the significant cell death (63 ± 9, p < 0.01). These results contrast with a significant increase in phosphatidylserine externalization (64 ± 1%, p < 0.001) with a moderate cell death (29 ± 4%, p < 0.01) induced by Cu·DA complex alone. No significant changes in phosphatidylserine externalization and cell death were observed when the cells were treated with 100 μm dopamine, 100 μm dicoumarol, or 1 mm CuSO4 alone (Fig. 2A). Caspase 3 Activation—The caspase 3 activation was determined in cells incubated for 7 h with Cu·DA complex. We detected caspase 3 activation in cells treated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence and presence of 100 μm dicoumarol, and in cells treated with 100 μm menadione. However, the activation observed in cells treated with Cu·DA complex was not specific, because both 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK and 100 μm DEVD-CHO only inhibited menadione-induced caspase 3 activation (81%, p < 0.001 and 94%, p < 0.001, respectively). Chromatin Alterations—Chromatin alterations were measured by staining cell nuclei with Feulgen. A significant increase in cells with chromatin alterations was observed when the cells were incubated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence (34 ± 9%, p < 0.01) and in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol (35 ± 9%, p < 0.01) at 7 h. No chromatin alterations were observed when the cells were treated with 100 μm dopamine, 100 μm dicoumarol, or 1 mm CuSO4 alone. The positive control of 100 μm menadione exhibited a significant increase of chromatin alterations (90 ± 3%, p < 0.001 (Fig. 3A)). Like to the positive control with menadione, chromatin alterations observed in cells treated with Cu·DA complex in the presence and absence of 100 μm dicoumarol continuously increased from 3 to 12 h (Fig. 3B). DNA Fragmentation—To determine the formation of small fragments resulting from DNA fragmentation, we used a DNA laddering technique after incubation of the cells with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence and presence of 100 μm dicoumarol for 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 h. No small DNA fragments were observed when the cells were incubated with Cu·DA complex in the absence or presence of dicoumarol for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 h (Fig. 4A showed only at 7 h). However, small fragments of DNA were observed in cells incubated for 12 h with Cu·DA complex, both in the absence or presence of 100 μm dicoumarol (Fig. 4B). However, DNA laddering was more pronounced in cells treated with Cu·DA complex alone. Incubation of the cells with 100 μm dopamine, 100 μm dicoumarol or 1 mm CuSO4 did not result in small DNA fragments (Fig. 4). As a positive control, the cells were incubated with 100 μm menadione, which produced small DNA fragments both at 7 and 12 h. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Changes—Caspase independent DNA fragmentation is associated with mitochondrial release of proteins related to oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (24Widlak P. Li L.Y. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48404-48409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential by using JC-1 in cells incubated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence or presence of 100 μm dicoumarol for 2 h. A significant change in the mitochondrial membrane potential was observed both when the cells were incubated with Cu·DA complex in the absence (1.9 ± 0.2 RF, p < 0.05) and presence of dicoumarol (1.2 ± 0.3 RF, p < 0.01) compared with the control cells (3.3 ± 0.4 RF). No significant changes were observed when the cells were incubated with 100 μm dopamine, 100 μm dicoumarol, or 1 mm CuSO4 alone (Fig. 5). The Effect of Cyclosporine A on Cell Death and Phosphatidylserine Externalization—We studied the effect of cyclosporine A on cell death and phosphatidylserine externalization observed after treatment with Cu·DA complex. A 72% inhibition of phosphatidylserine externalization was observed in the presence of 5 μm cyclosporine A (18.4 ± 2%, p < 0.001) when the cells were incubated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex. However, no effect of cyclosporine A on cell death was observed in cells treated with Cu·DA complex. These results contrast with the lack of effect of cyclosporine A on phosphatidylserine externalization and cell death when the cells were treated with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the presence of 100 μm dicoumarol (Fig. 2B). Cytoplasm Ultrastructural Analysis—Transmission electron microscopy was performed to examine cellular changes at the ultrastructural level to obtain more information about the mechanism of cell death induced by Cu·DA complex, because caspase-independent cell death has been observed both during apoptosis and autophagy (25Shrivastava A.

The ultrastructure of cells in control conditions (Fig. 6A) is characterized by a normal morphology of cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. No significant morphological changes in relation to control conditions were observed in cells treated with 100 μm dopamine, 1 mm CuSO4, or 100 μm dicoumarol for 2, 4, and 7 h. However, autophagic vacuoles and residual bodies appeared as a main cellular component characterized by a single or double membrane limited compartment that segregated cytoplasmic constituents during different degradation stages in cells treated for 2 h with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence or presence of 100 μm dicoumarol. Enlarged autophagic compartments were observed in a highly vacuolated cytoplasm after 4 h of treatment with 100 μm Cu·DA complex in the absence and presence of 100 μm dicoumarol.

https://openalex.org/W2094438308,"The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit plays a critical role in hematopoiesis, and gain-of-function mutations of the receptor are frequently seen in several malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and testicular carcinoma. The most common mutation of c-Kit in these disorders is a substitution of the aspartic acid residue in position 816 to a valine (D816V), leading to constitutive activation of the receptor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Src family kinases in c-Kit/D816V signaling. Src family kinases are necessary for the phosphorylation of wild-type c-Kit as well as of activation of downstream signaling pathways including receptor ubiquitination and the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway. Our data demonstrate that, unlike wild-type c-Kit, the phosphorylation of c-Kit/D816V is not dependent on Src family kinases. In addition, we found that neither receptor ubiquitination nor Erk activation by c-Kit/D816V required activation of Src family kinases. In vitro kinase assay using synthetic peptides revealed that c-Kit/D816V had an altered substrate specificity resembling Src and Abl tyrosine kinases. We further present evidence that, in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, Src family kinases are dispensable for c-Kit/D816V cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that the signal transduction pathways mediated by c-Kit/D816V are markedly different from those activated by wild-type c-Kit and that altered substrate specificity of c-Kit circumvents a need for Src family kinases in signaling of growth and survival, thereby contributing to the transforming potential of c-Kit/D816V.

The receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), 2The abbreviations used are: SCF, stem cell factor; PI3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Flt3, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3; M-CSF, macrophage colony stimulating factor; IL-3, interleukin 3; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PE, phycoerythrin. c-Kit, is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the same subfamily as the platelet-derived growth factor receptors, the Flt3 receptor, and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (1.Lennartsson J. Rönnstrand L. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The c-Kit gene is identical to the white spotting locus (W) in the mouse. c-Kit is expressed in the hematopoietic system, in the gastrointestinal system, in melanocytes, and in germ cells, and therefore loss-of-function mutations in c-Kit lead to defects in hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis. Stimulation of the c-Kit receptor with its ligand, SCF, leads to receptor dimerization and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Specific tyrosine residues are autophosphorylated, which results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the Ras/Erk pathway and the PI3-kinase pathway (for review, see Ref. 2.Rönnstrand L. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). One of the crucial steps in oncogenic transformation of cells is the gain of independence of external growth stimuli. This can be achieved in several different ways, including mutations that render receptor tyrosine kinases constitutively active in the absence of ligand stimulation. In the case of c-Kit, these mutations most commonly occur either in exon 11 (encoding the juxtamembrane region) and are found predominantly in gastrointestinal stromal tumors or in exon 17 (encoding the activation loop of the kinase domain). A frequently occurring type of mutation in exon 17 in c-Kit is at codon 816. This type of mutation has been found in several human malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, mastocytosis, germ cell tumors of the seminoma or dysgerminoma types, sinonasal natural killer/T-cell lymphomas, and in intracranial teratomas (3.Ning Z.Q.

These mutations at codon 816 lead to conversion of an aspartic acid residue to a valine, a tyrosine, a phenylalanine, an asparagine, or a histidine residue. The recently elucidated crystal structure of the c-Kit kinase domain has helped define the mechanism of activation by this type of mutation (11.Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L. Scheibe D.N. Snell G.P. Zou H. Sang B.C. Wilson K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31655-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In the unstimulated wild-type c-Kit, the juxtamembrane region inserts directly into the clefts between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal lobes of the kinase domain, disrupting the c-Kit control helix, and physically blocking the conserved kinase DFG motif from attaining a productive conformation. The activation loop folds back over the substrate binding groove and interacts with the active center of the kinase as a pseudosubstrate. It is not fully known how mutation of aspartic acid 816 leads to activation of c-Kit. It has been suggested either that the mutation inverts the conformation of the protein backbone so that the side chain of arginine 815 is being flipped from its position in the autoinhibited or that the effect of aspartic acid 816 mutations may be derived from its ability to stabilize the small positively charge α-helical dipole through its negative charge of its side chain. Asp-816 mutations in c-Kit promote receptor autophosphorylation and thereby constitutively activate downstream signaling pathways independent of SCF binding and therefore contribute to cell transformation (12.Orfao A. Garcia-Montero A.C. Sanchez L. Escribano L. Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 138: 12-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Imatinib (Gleevec) is a well known inhibitor of c-Kit juxtamembrane mutations and has been used in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors with activating mutations in the juxtamembrane region of c-Kit. In contrast, cells expressing c-Kit/D816V are resistant to Imatinib, whereas the Abl/Src dual inhibitor Dasatinib also inhibits the D816V mutant of c-Kit (13.Schittenhelm M.M. Shiraga S. Schroeder A. Corbin A.S. Griffith D. Lee F.Y. Bokemeyer C. Deininger M.W. Druker B.J. Heinrich M.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of c-Kit signaling has been shown to occur mainly through ubiquitin-mediated internalization and degradation of the receptor (14.Zeng S. Xu Z. Lipkowitz S. Longley J.B. Blood. 2005; 105: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15.Masson K. Heiss E. Band H. Rönnstrand L. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is mediated by ubiquitin E3 ligases that attach ubiquitin to their target proteins, resulting in either monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination. Key components in this machinery are the Cbl family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, represented by Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c (16.Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases must be tightly regulated, and inhibition of Cbl activation and receptor ubiquitination can lead to cell transformation (17.Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It has been shown that both direct and indirect binding of Cbl to wild-type c-Kit can induce Cbl activation and receptor ubiquitination followed by receptor internalization and degradation (15.Masson K. Heiss E. Band H. Rönnstrand L. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18.Sun J. Pedersen M. Bengtsson S. Rönnstrand L. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3935-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanisms behind negative regulation of the oncogenic c-Kit/D816V are so far unknown. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) proteins are the evolutionary conserved products of the two genes, Erk1 and Erk2, and are central proteins in the Ras/Erk signaling pathway. Erk1 and Erk2 are activated by dual phosphorylation on their regulatory tyrosine and threonine residues (19.Shaul Y.D. Seger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is activated downstream of PI3-kinase and plays a central role in signaling induced by growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli (20.Hennessy B.T. Smith D.L. Ram P.T. Lu Y. Mills G.B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 988-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The Ras/Erk pathway and the PI3-kinase pathway are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation induced by c-Kit. A key player in the relay of signals from c-Kit into the cells is Src. Binding of Src to Tyr-568 in c-Kit leads to its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Shc and activation of the Ras/Erk pathway (21.Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase is activated by c-Kit through two alternate routes, either through direct binding to Tyr-721 in c-Kit (22.Serve H. Hsu Y.C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or through indirect binding to the scaffolding protein Gab2, which associates to c-Kit via the adapter protein Grb2. Activation of PI3-kinase is dependent on Src-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 (23.Sun J. Pedersen M. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27444-27451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other investigators have shown that neither Erk nor Akt is constitutively activated in cells expressing c-Kit/D816V (24.Chian R. Young S. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Rönnstrand L. Leonard E. Ferrao P. Ashman L. Linnekin D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that in c-Kit/D816V-expressing Ba/F3 cells, a low constitutive activation of both Erk and Akt exists and that this activation can be further augmented by SCF stimulation. We also present data showing that c-Kit/D816V evades the need of Src family kinases for receptor ubiquitination and Erk activation by having an altered substrate specificity resembling Src family kinases. We conclude that Src family kinases play different roles in wild-type c-Kit and c-Kit/D816V-induced cell survival and growth. Cytokines, Antibodies, and Peptides—Recombinant human SCF was purchased from Prospec Tany (Rehovot, Israel). The rabbit antiserum KitC1, recognizing the carboxyl-terminal tail of human c-Kit, was purified as described (25.Blume-Jensen P. Siegbahn A. Stabel S. Heldin C.H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4199-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antibodies recognizing pTyr-568, pTyr-703, pTyr-Y721, and pTyr-936 in human c-Kit were generated by immunizing rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the phosphorylation sites and extensive affinity purification (26.Voytyuk O.

The following antibodies were used in the study: Cbl, phospho-Erk (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA), ubiquitin antibody P4D1 (Covance, Denver, PA), PE-labeled c-Kit antibody 104D2 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), and Shc (BD Biosciences). Src optimal peptide (AEEEIYGEFEAKKKK) and Abl optimal peptide (EAIYAAPFAKKK) were synthesized according to (27.Songyang Z. Carraway K.L.I. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M.

All peptides were synthesized by JPT Peptide Technology (Berlin, Germany), except the Src optimal peptide that was kindly synthesized by Ulla Engström at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden. Kits and Reagents—The QuikChange mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Src family kinase inhibitor SU6656 and ATP were from Sigma. Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit was from BD Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP was from GE Healthcare. Cell Culture—The EcoPack virus packaging cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3. To establish Ba/F3 cell lines expressing c-Kit, EcoPack cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant c-Kit constructs in the pMSCVpuro vector. Supernatants were collected and used to infect Ba/F3 cells followed by a 2-week selection process in puromycin. Expression levels of c-Kit were confirmed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells were grown in the same medium as Ba/F3 cells supplemented with 1.2 μg/ml puromycin. Cell Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Ba/F3 cells were starved for 5 h in medium without serum and without IL-3 followed by SCF stimulation (100 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed as described (23.Sun J. Pedersen M. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27444-27451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Kinase Activity Assay—Ba/F3 cells were starved for 5 h in medium without serum and without IL-3 and subsequently stimulated with SCF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Thereafter cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, immunoprecipitated with the KitC1 antibody, and processed for in vitro kinase assay as described (28.Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with the exception that Src optimal and Abl optimal peptide, respectively, was used. To determine the Km of the Src optimal peptide, a kinase reaction was performed varying the peptide concentration (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μm) on immunoprecipitates of c-Kit or Lyn, respectively. Cell Survival and Proliferation Assay—Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type c-Kit or various mutants of c-Kit were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in Ba/F3 complete medium without IL-3, and seeded in 6-well plates with either 100 ng/ml SCF or 10 ng/ml IL-3 or without any cytokine as control. After a 48-h incubation, cells were stained with the annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). The living cells, apoptotic cells, and dead cells were counted using flow cytometry. For the cell proliferation assay, living cells were counted under the microscope. Colony Formation in Semisolid Medium—Ba/F3 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to wash away IL-3 and mixed with methylcellulose hematopoietic colony assay medium (MethoCult M3231, Stem Cell Technologies) at the concentration of 30,000 cells/ml, in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml SCF, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere for 5 days. Constitutive Phosphorylation and Ubiquitination of c-Kit/D816V Leads to Lower Cell Surface Expression of c-Kit as Compared with Wild-type Receptor—It has been shown that inhibition of negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases due to impaired Cbl activation and subsequent receptor ubiquitination contributes to transformation in a number of mutated, oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 29.Peschard P. Park M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to investigate the ubiquitination status of the oncogenic D816V mutant of c-Kit to examine whether diminished ubiquitination of this mutant contributes to its oncogenic phenotype. Both wild-type c-Kit and the D816V mutant of c-Kit were stably transfected into the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 followed by analysis of receptor surface expression. The D816V mutant of c-Kit showed much lower surface expression than wild-type receptor when examined by flow cytometry and Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B). Next we wanted to investigate the phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues on the D816V c-Kit mutant to see whether the phosphorylation sites would be different from wild-type c-Kit. In SCF-induced c-Kit signaling, phosphorylated Tyr-568 is responsible for activation of Src kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate both the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl and the Ras/Erk signaling pathway. Phosphorylated Tyr-703 and Tyr-936 are known to associate with the adapter protein Grb2, which indirectly recruits both Cbl as well as the scaffolding protein Gab2 to c-Kit (18.Sun J. Pedersen M. Bengtsson S. Rönnstrand L. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3935-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23.Sun J. Pedersen M. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27444-27451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another important phosphorylation site is Tyr-721, the binding site for PI3-kinase, which in previous studies was shown to be of great importance for c-Kit/D816V-induced cell transformation (24.Chian R. Young S. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Rönnstrand L. Leonard E. Ferrao P. Ashman L. Linnekin D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30.Hashimoto K. Matsumura I. Tsujimura T. Kim D.K. Ogihara H. Ikeda H. Ueda S. Mizuki M. Sugahara H. Shibayama H. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using phosphospecific antibodies against pTyr-568, pTyr-703, pTyr-721, and pTyr-936 in c-Kit, we investigated the ligand-induced phosphorylation of wild-type receptor as compared with D816V mutant. We found that Tyr-568, Tyr-703, Tyr-721, and Tyr-936 were all constitutively phosphorylated in c-Kit/D816V (Fig. 1C). Thus, the binding sites for signal transduction molecules downstream of c-Kit were all phosphorylated in c-Kit/D816V and potentially involved in signal transduction downstream of c-Kit/D816V. Because cell surface expression of c-Kit/D816V was significantly lower than wild-type c-Kit (Fig. 1A), we were interested in investigating whether this was due to differences in Cbl activation and ubiquitination. We could show that cells expressing c-Kit/D816V exhibited constitutive Cbl phosphorylation as well as constitutive receptor ubiquitination (Fig. 2, A and B). To investigate whether the constitutive ubiquitination and subsequent rapid receptor turnover contributed to the lower levels of cell surface expression of c-Kit/D816V as compared with wild-type receptor, we used the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib to block the constitutive activation of c-Kit/D816V. Dasatinib treatment blocked receptor phosphorylation and receptor ubiquitination and, furthermore, increased the cell surface expression of c-Kit/D816V dramatically (p < 0.05 by Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, our results suggest that the constitutive activation of c-Kit/D816V through ubiquitin-mediated degradation contributes to its low cell surface expression.FIGURE 2Constitutive activation of Cbl and ubiquitination of c-Kit in Ba/F3 cells expressing c-Kit/D816V. Ba/F3 cells expressing c-Kit/D816V were starved and stimulated with SCF (100 ng/ml).

The data shown are the average of three independent experiments with error bars defining the standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Src Family Kinases Are Not Required for the Phosphorylation and Ubiquitination of c-Kit/D816V—Src family kinases have been shown to play an important role in phosphorylation and ubiquitination induced by wild-type c-Kit (15.Masson K. Heiss E. Band H. Rönnstrand L. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31.Shivakrupa R. Linnekin D. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Src family kinases in the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of c-Kit/D816V, we generated mutants of the Src binding site Tyr-568 in both wild-type c-Kit and c-Kit/D816V background, which were transduced into Ba/F3 cells. Using Y568F mutants and the Src-selective inhibitor SU6656, we could examine the involvement of Src kinases in c-Kit/D816V-mediated phosphorylation. Both Y568F mutant and Src inhibitor SU6656 blocked the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of wild-type c-Kit. To our surprise, neither the Y568F mutant nor SU6656 blocked the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of c-Kit/D816V (Fig. 4A), suggesting differences in downstream signaling pathways between wild-type c-Kit and c-Kit/D816V. Because the ubiquitin E3 ligase Cbl is responsible for SCF-stimulated ubiquitination of wild-type c-Kit, we examined the phosphorylation of Cbl in c-Kit/D816V. In agreement with the effect of Y568F and SU6656 on receptor ubiquitination, in contrast to the phosphorylation mediated by wild-type c-Kit, neither Y568F nor SU6656 could block the phosphorylation of Cbl induced by c-Kit/D816V, (Fig. 4B). c-Kit/D816V-induced Activation of Erk Is Not Dependent on Src Family Kinases—Next we examined the c-Kit/D816V-induced activation of Erk and Akt in Ba/F3 cells. c-Kit/D816V could induce weak constitutive activation of both Erk and Akt, and this activation was further increased by SCF stimulation (Fig. 5A). In wild-type c-Kit signaling, phosphorylation of Tyr-568 leads to activation of Src family kinases, which in turn phosphorylates Shc and finally activates the Ras/Erk signaling pathway (21.Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because we found Src family kinases to be dispensable for c-Kit/D816V-induced receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination, we wanted to investigate how c-Kit/D816V activates the Ras/Erk pathway. Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type c-Kit or c-Kit/D816V, with or without the Src binding mutation Y568F, were preincubated with the Src kinase inhibitor SU6656 followed by SCF stimulation and analyzed for Erk phosphorylation. We could show that Erk phosphorylation in cells expressing wild-type c-Kit was blocked by introduction of either the Y568F mutation or the Src-selective inhibitor SU6656. In the case of c-Kit/D816V, Erk phosphorylation was not dependent on Src family kinases (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, in contrast to wild-type c-Kit signaling, the c-Kit/D816V-induced activation of the adaptor protein Shc was not dependent on Src kinase activity (Fig. 5D). c-Kit/D816V Gains Src- and Abl-like Activity—The above results suggest that signaling through c-Kit/D816V is able to circumvent the requirement of Src family kinases. To further address the question of whether c-Kit/D816V gains a Src-like kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase assays using either the so-called Src optimal peptide or the Abl optimal peptide as substrates. These peptides are highly selective for their respective kinase while being poor substrates for receptor tyrosine kinases (27.Songyang Z. Carraway K.L.I. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type c-Kit, the c-Kit/D816V mutant readily phosphorylated both peptides, and the activity could be further increased by SCF stimulation (Fig. 6; Abl kinase data not shown). Kinetic analysis of D816V c-Kit was performed and compared with Lyn, which is the most abundant Src family kinase in Ba/F3 cells. The Km for D816V c-Kit with respect to the Src optimal peptide was estimated to ∼20 μm, whereas Lyn showed a Km of ∼80 μm (data not shown). This was in the same range as has been described for Src (33 μm (27.Songyang Z. Carraway K.L.I. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). This suggests that c-Kit/D816V circumvents a need for Src family kinases by mimicking Src in its kinase specificity. Phosphorylation of Tyr-568 Is Dispensable for c-Kit/D816V-induced Cell Survival—To specify the role of Tyr-568 in cell signaling, we next examined cell survival in Ba/F3 cells expressing either wild-type c-Kit or c-Kit/D816V. Cells were kept in medium in the presence or absence of SCF. Living cells, apoptotic cells, and dead cells were identified using the annexin-PE detection kit staining and flow cytometry analysis. As expected, Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type c-Kit survived in the presence of SCF, whereas this effect was abolished in the Y568F mutant. In contrast, Ba/F3 cells expressing c-Kit/D816V survived in the absence of ligand and, furthermore, ligand stimulation did not further enhance cell survival. Additionally, in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, introduction of the Y568F mutation did not affect cell survival (Fig. 7A). Tyr-568 Inhibits Cell Proliferation Induced by the c-Kit/D816V Mutant—We thereafter wanted to explore the role of Tyr-568 in c-Kit-induced cell proliferation. Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type c-Kit or c-Kit/D816V, with or without the Y568F mutation, were incubated with SCF for 48 h and subsequently scored for trypan blue exclusion. Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type c-Kit proliferated upon SCF stimulation, and in agreement with the results from the survival assay, no living cells were detected if Tyr-568 was mutated. Ba/F3 cells expressing c-Kit/D816V could proliferate without SCF, and the addition of ligand did not further accelerate cell proliferation (Fig. 7B). The cells expressing Y568F mutation in addition to D816V had higher proliferation as compared with cells that only expressed c-Kit/D816V. Our data indicate a role of Tyr-568 in the inhibition of c-Kit/D816V-induced cell proliferation. c-Kit/D816V Induces Colon Formation in Methylcellulose Independent of Activation of Src—Because recruitment of Src to Tyr-568 of c-Kit is important for wild-type c-Kit-mediated proliferation and survival, but not for c-Kit/D816V, we wanted to investigate whether the growth in semisolid medium was also independent of Src recruitment to Tyr-568 of c-Kit. These data clearly show that although colony formation by wild-type c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells even in the presence of ligand was very weak, the c-Kit/D816V induced colony formation (Fig. 7C). Introduction of the Y568F mutation in c-Kit/D816V led to formation of even bigger colonies as compared with c-Kit/D816V. The cells in the colonies also appeared to have a greater tendency to scatter. The mechanisms of signal transduction by the wild-type c-Kit are quite well characterized. Ligand binding to the receptor causes dimerization and activation of its intrinsic kinase activity, leading to phosphorylation of downstream signal transduction molecules, involving the Ras/Erk pathway and the PI3-kinase pathway (for review, see Ref. 2.Rönnstrand L. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism by which the oncogenic mutant D816V of c-Kit signals is only partially known. In this study, we have analyzed the downstream signaling events in D816V/c-Kit and compared it with wild-type c-Kit signaling. Mutations analogous to D816V have been found in the closely related receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3, at aspartic acid 835, which is mutated in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients (32.Yamamoto Y. Kiyoi H. Nakano Y. Suzuki R. Kodera Y. Miyawaki S. Asou N. Kuriyama K. Yagasaki F. Shimazaki C. Akiyama H. Saito K. Nishimura M. Motoji T. Shinagawa K. Takeshita A. Saito H. Ueda R. Ohno R. Naoe T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The analogous residue in the c-Met receptor (D1264N) has been found to be mutated in papillary renal carcinoma, where it stabilized the active form of the receptor. D1264N displays altered kinase specificity in that CrkII, a known Abl kinase substrate, is phosphorylated by D1264N but not by wild-type c-Met (33.Miller M. Ginalski K. Lesyng B. Nakaigawa N. Schmidt L. Zbar B. Proteins. 2001; 44: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another oncogenic mutant of c-Met, M1268T, elevates c-Src phosphorylation, and its oncogenic activity was found to be inhibited by dominant negative forms of c-Src (34.Nakaigawa N. Weirich G. Schmidt L. Zbar B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2996-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the D816V mutant of c-Kit gains both Src-like and Abl-like kinase activity. This is not due to increased binding of Src to c-Kit because the Y568F mutant of D816V shows the same ability to phosphorylate the Src optimal peptide (data not shown). It has previously been shown that the D816V mutant alters the specificity of c-Kit to resemble the Abl kinase (35.Piao X. Paulson R. van der Geer P. Pawson T. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14665-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but that study failed to detect Src-like kinase activity in the D816V mutant. The reason for the discrepancy between the two studies is unclear. One possibility could be that the peptide sequence used in the study by Piao et al. (35.Piao X. Paulson R. van der Geer P. Pawson T. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14665-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) slightly differs from the one described by Songyang et al. (27.Songyang Z. Carraway K.L.I. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), which is identical to the peptide that was used in this study. A lowered degree of cell surface expression of oncogenic receptor mutants has been described in numerous cases of receptor tyrosine kinases. The mechanism is not fully understood. It has been shown that the D816V mutant of c-Kit drives transformation through intracellularly receptors trapped to the Golgi (36.Xiang Z. Kreisel F. Cain J. Colson A. Tomasson M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Constitutive phosphorylation of Cbl and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation could also contribute to the low cell surface expression, as proposed in this study. Several phosphorylation sites in c-Kit are multifunctional docking sites for signal transduction molecules. One such site is Tyr-568 in the juxtamembrane region of c-Kit, which has been shown to associate with Src family kinases, CHK, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, Cbl, and the adapter protein APS (15.Masson K. Heiss E. Band H. Rönnstrand L. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L.

J. 2003; 370: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of Tyr-568 will affect both signal transduction molecules involved in positive signaling (Src, SHP2) as well as in negative signaling (CHK, Cbl, and APS). One of the proteins known to be targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the D816V mutant is the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (35.Piao X. Paulson R. van der Geer P. Pawson T. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14665-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). SHP1 is a well known negative regulator of c-Kit signaling (40.Paulson R.F. Vesely S. Siminovitch K.A. Bernstein A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The observed increased survival and proliferation of the D816V/Y568F mutant as compared with the D816V mutant could also very well be ascribed to such effects. Other investigators have found the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Fes to be preferentially activated by the D816V mutant but not by wild-type c-Kit (41.Voisset E. Lopez S. Dubreuil P. De Sepulveda P. Blood. 2007; 110: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although several signal transduction pathways were constitutively activated in D816V/c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells, the addition of ligand further increased the phosphorylation of both Erk and Akt (Fig. 5, A and B). This is puzzling because the receptor is already constitutively active in the absence of ligand. However, in Jurkat cells transfected with D816V/c-Kit, SCF triggered a more potent chemotactic response than in cells transfected with wild-type c-Kit (42.Taylor M.L. Dastych J. Sehgal D. Sundström M. Nilsson G. Akin C. Mage R.G. Metcalfe D.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1195-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests that ligand does something qualitatively different from the oncogenic mutants. Furthermore, in the case of the receptor tyrosine kinase Met, the oncogenic mutant D1228N was dependent on the presence of ligand for full transformation of NIH3T3 cells (43.Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffe A. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). One explanation might be that ligand induces internalization of the receptors to intracellular compartments where it interacts with specific signal transduction molecules. It is clear from several studies that the subcellular localization of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases is critical for their signaling capabilities; e.g. trapping of the oncogenic Flt3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutant to the endoplasmic reticulum leads to selective phosphorylation of STAT5, whereas wild-type Flt3 does not phosphorylate STAT5 (44.Schmidt-Arras, D., Böhmer, S. A., Koch, S., Müller, J., Blei, L., Cornils, H., Bauer, R., Korasikha, S., Thiede, C., and Böhmer, F. D. (2009) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar). To summarize, our data show that the D816V mutant is not only an activating mutation that mimics the ligand-bound receptor but that it also has a qualitatively different substrate specificity that leads to activation of signal transduction molecules and downstream biological responses that are quite distinct from those induced by the wild-type receptor. The mechanism by which this mutant causes altered kinase specificity is not fully understood. However, this opens for the possibility that the D816V phosphorylates additional substrate molecules that are not phosphorylated by wild-type c-Kit that could provide novel targets for selective therapy against the oncogenic versions of c-Kit. Future work is aiming at identifying such signal transduction molecules. We thank Susanne Bengtsson for expert technical assistance and Dr. Rasheed Khan for help with statistical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1994561364,"Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) prions are efficiently propagated and the on-going generation and transmission of prion seeds (propagons) to daughter cells during cell division ensures a high degree of mitotic stability. The reversible inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp104p by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) results in cell division-dependent elimination of yeast prions due to a block in propagon generation and the subsequent dilution out of propagons by cell division.Analysing the kinetics of the GdnHCl-induced elimination of the yeast [PSI+] prion has allowed us to develop novel statistical models that aid our understanding of prion propagation in yeast cells. Here we describe the application of a new stochastic model that allows us to estimate more accurately the mean number of propagons in a [PSI+] cell. To achieve this accuracy we also experimentally determine key cell reproduction parameters and show that the presence of the [PSI+] prion has no impact on these key processes. Additionally, we experimentally determine the proportion of propagons transmitted to a daughter cell and show this reflects the relative cell volume of mother and daughter cells at cell division.While propagon generation is an ATP-driven process, the partition of propagons to daughter cells occurs by passive transfer via the distribution of cytoplasm. Furthermore, our new estimates of n(0), the number of propagons per cell (500-1000), are some five times higher than our previous estimates and this has important implications for our understanding of the inheritance of the [PSI+] and the spontaneous formation of prion-free cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063858377,"It is widely accepted that of the four Replication Factor C (RFC) complexes (defined by the associations of either Rfc1p, Ctf18p, Elg1p or Rad24p with Rfc2p-Rfc5p), only Ctf18-RFC functions in sister chromatid cohesion. This model is based on findings that CTF18 deletion is lethal in combination with mutations in either CTF7ECO1 or MCD1 sister chromatid cohesion genes and that ctf18 mutant cells exhibit cohesion defects. Here, we report that Elg1-RFC not only participates in cohesion but performs a function that is distinct from that of Ctf18-RFC. The results show that deletion of ELG1 rescues both ctf7eco1 mutant cell temperature sensitivity and cohesion defects. Moreover, over-expression of ELG1 enhances ctf7eco1 mutant cell phenotypes. These findings suggest that the balance of Ctf7pEco1p activity depends on both Ctf18-RFC and Elg1-RFC. We also report that ELG1 deletion produces cohesion defects and intensifies the conditional phenotype of mcd1 mutant cells, further supporting a role for Elg1-RFC in cohesion. Attesting to the specificity of these interactions, deletion of RAD24 neither suppressed nor exacerbated cohesion defects in either ctf7eco1 or mcd1 mutant cells. While parallel analyses failed to uncover a similar role in cohesion for Rad24-RFC, it is well known that Rad24-RFC, Elg1-RFC and Ctf18-RFC play key roles in DNA damage responses. We tested and found that Ctf7pEco1p plays a significant role in Rad24-RFC-based DNA response pathways. In combination, these findings challenge current views and document new and distinct roles for RFC complexes in cohesion and for Ctf7pEco1p in DNA repair."

Although the roles of several carbohydrate epitopes in the central nervous system, including polysialic acid, the human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate, α2,3-sialic acid, and oligomannosides, have been investigated, those of the glycan backbone structures, such as Galβ1-4GlcNAc and Galβ1-3GlcNAc, are not fully examined.

Each β4GalT has a tissue-specific expression pattern and substrate specificity with overlapping, suggesting each β4GalT has its own biological role as well as redundant functions. β4GalT-I and β4GalT-II share the highest identity (52% at the amino acid level) among the β4GalTs (12Almeida R.

These results suggest that the Galβ1-4GlcNAc structure in the HNK-1 carbohydrate is mainly synthesized by β4GalT-II and that glycans synthesized by β4GalT-II have essential roles in higher brain functions, including ones that are HNK-1 carbohydrate-dependent and ones that are independent of HNK-1. Generation of β4GalT-II-/- Mice—The strategy for the β4GalT-II gene targeting was to replace exons 1 and 2 and part of exon 3 with the neomycin resistance gene (20Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). Because exon 2 contains the translation initiation codon, ATG, as well as the Golgi retention signal, the deletion of exon 2 was expected to result in null function. A targeting vector with an upstream DT-A cassette (21Yagi T. Nada S. Watanabe N. Tamemoto H. Kohmura N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was used to transfect E14-1 embryonic stem cells (22Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Science. 1991; 254: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) by electroporation, and the transformed cells were selected with G418 (2Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Disruption of the β4GalT-II gene was verified by Southern blot hybridization using external 5′ and 3′ probes. Chimeric mice were generated by the aggregation method (23Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) and mated to C57BL/6 mice to confirm germ line transmission. The absence of β4GalT-II gene expression in the homozygous mutant mice was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization using a specific probe and by reverse transcription-PCR with a primer set that detected the deleted region. The mice used for the experiments were obtained by cross-breeding male homozygous and female heterozygous mutant mice. In most cases, mice backcrossed to the C57BL/6J strain for eight generations were used in the behavioral analyses, and other experiments were carried out using mice of a mixed 129/Ola × C57BL/6J background. The exceptional cases are described under “Results.” Preparation of Brain Homogenate and Membrane Fraction—Whole brains from postnatal day 0 (P0), 2-week-old, and 11-week-old mice were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 9 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The homogenate was spun at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the nuclei and then spun again at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was used as the membrane fraction. After being resuspended in PBS, the protein concentration in the homogenate and membrane fraction was measured using the DC-Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Lectin Blot—Western blotting and lectin blotting were carried out as described previously (24Tagawa H. Kizuka Y. Ikeda T. Itoh S. Kawasaki N. Kurihara H. Onozato M.L. Tojo A. Sakai T. Kawasaki T. Oka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23876-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 5-20% gradient SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For Western blots, after being blocked with 5% skim milk (or, for the detection of PSA, 2% bovine serum albumin) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. For lectin blots, after being blocked with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS (T-TBS), the membranes were incubated with HRP- or biotin-conjugated lectins in T-TBS. To detect biotinylated lectins, we used the Vectastain-ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein bands were detected with SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) using a Luminoimage Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). In these analyses, an anti-HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA; the anti-polysialic acid mAb (clone 12E3) was a generous gift from Dr. T. Seki (Juntendo University). The rat anti-mouse neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) mAb (clone H28) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Ono (National Institute for Physiological Sciences). The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM was purchased from Cappel Laboratories, and the HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgM, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-rat IgG were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Biotinylated lectins (Maackia amurensis agglutinin and Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin) and HRP-conjugated lectins (concanavalin A and RCA120) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Concanavalin A, RCA120 (Ricinus communis agglutinin), M. amurensis agglutinin, and S. sieboldiana agglutinin recognized mannose, Galβ1-4GlcNAc, Siaα2-3Gal, and Siaα2-6Gal, respectively. Histological Procedures—Two-week- and 11-week-old and 2-month- and 6-month-old mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether and perfused with PBS containing 0.1% heparin and then with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain was post-fixed overnight and then sunk in 30% sucrose solution or embedded in paraffin. Cryo- or paraffin sections were cut in the sagittal or coronal plane. For a broad morphologic investigation, Kluver-Barrera's stain was used with 0.1% Luxol Fast Blue and 0.1% Cresyl Violet solutions. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the morphologic features of neural cells, the number of each cell type, and their glycosylation status. The primary antibodies were as follows: anti-HNK-1 mAb (TIB-20; ATCC, Manassas, VA); anti-PSA mAb (12E3); anti-NeuN mAb (MAB377; Chemicon, CA); anti-Nestin mAb (MAB353; Chemicon, CA); and anti-calbindin D-28K mAb (CB-955; C9848, Sigma). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, rinsed twice in PBS, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-488- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was evaluated by confocal microscopy (LSM 5 Pascal, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany; Fluoview laser confocal microscope system, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). For the calbindin D-28K immunohistochemical staining, the number of calbindin-positive cells in the 4th and 5th cerebellar lobules was counted manually. Disturbed alignment of cerebellar Purkinje cells was evaluated by counting the number of disturbed lobules using the sections in which apparent eight lobules were observed. For this quantitative analysis, five sagittal sections (0.12-0.84 mm lateral to the midline) (25Paxinos G. Franklin K. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2001Google Scholar) per animal were investigated, and the total number of 40 lobules in an animal (five sections by eight lobules) was examined. For the assessment of BrdUrd incorporation, 100 mg/kg BrdUrd solution was injected once a day intraperitoneally for 5 days, and the animals were perfused intracardially 24 h after the last injection. BrdUrd immunostaining was carried out using a BrdUrd labeling and detection kit II (Roche Diagnostics), and the sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red. Behavioral Tests, General Procedures—Three-month-old male β4GalT-II-/- mice (n = 15), β4GalT-II+/- littermates (n = 13), GlcAT-P-/- mice (n = 11), and GlcAT-p+/+ mice (n = 9), kept under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Institute for Experimental Animals (Advanced Science Research Center, Kanazawa University), were used for behavioral analyses. The subjects were housed individually with ad libitum access to food and water 1 week before the behavioral testing. All tests were conducted during the light period of the light/dark cycle (08:45-20:45 h). To evaluate the behavioral responses in every test situation, the products of O'Hara & Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) were used. In addition, for the quantitative analysis in the open field and Morris water maze test, we used ImageJ LD4 (O'Hara & Co., Ltd.), a modified software based on the public domain ImageJ program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on line at www.nih.gov). Each animal was subjected to a battery of the following five behavioral paradigms with an ∼1-week rest period between each test. The animal experiments were conducted according to Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, and to the safety guidelines for gene manipulation experiments at Kanazawa University. All efforts were made to minimize both the number and the suffering of the animals used. Open Field Test—The general activity of animals in a novel environment was measured in an open field situation. The open field chamber (60 × 60 × 40 cm) was made of gray vinyl chloride, and the illumination of the center of the floor was kept at 50 lux by white LEDs set just above the chamber. The mice were allowed free exploration of the apparatus for 10 min per day on 3 successive days. The moving distance, speed, staying area, and number of rearing were analyzed. Morris Water Maze Task—The Morris water maze task (26Morris R.G. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N. O'Keefe J. Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate spatial learning. The apparatus consisted of a pool (100 cm in diameter) filled with opaque water (23 ± 2 °C) and containing a submerged hidden goal platform (10 cm in diameter) 1 cm below the surface of the water. Mice were given six training trials (inter-trial interval, 10-15 min) per day for 8 consecutive days. The trials were initiated from each of four possible start locations in a randomized manner, and the mice were required to reach the platform within 60 s. Following 2 days of extinction trials, a “landmark task,” with a visible cue on the platform was carried out to determine visual impairment. The latency to reach the platform and the length of the swimming pass were analyzed as learning performance. Passive Avoidance Response—The passive avoidance apparatus consisted of a vinyl chloride chamber (30 × 10 × 9 cm) with a steel-grid floor that was divided into dark and light compartments. In the test trial, mice were placed in the light room and received scrambled electrical foot shocks (0.22 mA) for 5 s through the grid floor of the dark room when they entered it. To test memory retention, each animal was again placed into the light room 24 h after the training. The step-through latency was measured without electric foot shocks as an indicator of the memory of shock experience. An upper cutoff of 300 s was set. Rota-rod Test—To investigate the motor coordination/motor learning abilities, the accelerating rota-rod paradigm (27Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Cell. 1996; 86: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) was used. Animals were tested in three trials per day for 3 consecutive days with a 300-s accelerating program (from 5 to 40 rpm). The latency to fall from the rod was recorded. On day 4, the number of hind limb steps at 7 rpm was measured to examine whether there was a motility defect. Balance Beam Test—Motor coordination and balance were evaluated by a balance beam apparatus (28Carter R.J. Morton J. Dunnett S.B. Current Protocols in Neuroscience. Wiley-Liss, Hoboken, NJ2003: 8.12.1-8.12.14Google Scholar). The beam consisted of a 100-cm-long horizontal steel bar (28 or 11 mm in diameter) placed 50 cm above the floor. Following the habituation trials, the mice were placed at the starting point of the bar. The number of hind limb slips off the beam before reaching an enclosed goal box was counted. Every mouse was tested using both bar diameters. Statistical Analysis—In the behavioral experiments statistical significance was determined by two-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc protected least significant difference test or unpaired t test. Performance in the open field test and Morris water maze task was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance in which the trial/day effect was a within-subject factor and genotype was a between-subject factor. In the other behavioral tests, the effect of genotype was verified by the t test. Generation of β4GalT-II-/- Mice—The targeting strategy for the deletion of the β4GalT-II gene is shown in Fig. 1A. The targeting vector was introduced into E14-1 embryonic stem cells by electroporation, and G-418-resistant colonies were picked up. Three embryonic stem clones were selected by Southern blot screening of 600 colonies and were verified to have the desired homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). β4GalT-II-/- mice were generated from two independent embryonic stem clones, and behavioral experiments were conducted using mice that had been back-crossed to C57BL/6 mice for eight generations. The targeted deletion of exons 1 and 2 of the β4GalT-II gene and the loss of β4GalT-II mRNA in the brain were confirmed by Southern (Fig. 1B) and Northern (Fig. 1C) blot analyses, respectively. In the heterozygous cross-breeding, β4GalT-II-/- mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, were fertile (data not shown), and exhibited no obvious behavioral phenotypes in an ordinary home-cage environment. Histological Features of the Brain—The brain weight of β4GalT-II-/- mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background was nearly identical to that of the β4GalT-II+/- mice at least until 2 months of age. However, the brain weight was significantly reduced in the β4GalT-II-/- mice at 6-9 months of age (Fig. 2A). Kluver-Barrera's staining (Fig. 2, B and C) revealed that the thickness of the cerebral cortex was slightly reduced, and the lateral ventricle was enlarged in the 8-month-old β4GalT-II-/- mice, indicating that the cerebral cortex of these mice atrophied slightly with age. In the cerebellum, no prominent morphological differences were observed between the genotypes. Brain sections from adult mice were immunostained with several neuronal markers. NeuN-positive mature neurons were appropriately located in the cerebellar granular cell layer, cerebellar nuclei, and CA region/dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in both the β4GalT-II+/- and β4GalT-II-/- mice (Fig. 3A). Nestin-positive neural progenitor cells were present in the DG and rostral migratory stream near the olfactory bulb in both genotypes (Fig. 3B). In the cerebellum of the β4GalT-II-/- mice, however, several calbindin-positive Purkinje cells were ectopically located, and their alignment was partially disturbed (Fig. 3C). Quantitative analysis showed that the β4GalT-II-/- mice had significantly more disturbed cerebellar lobules than β4GalT-II+/- mice (Fig. 3D, upper). In addition, the number of Purkinje cells was significantly reduced in the 4th and 5th cerebellar lobules of the β4GalT-II-/- mice compared with β4GalT-II+/- mice (Fig. 3D, lower). In the subventricular zone and DG of the hippocampus of the β4GalT-II-/- mice, the pattern of BrdUrd-labeled cells was the same as in the β4GalT-II+/- mice (Fig. 3E). Reduced Expression of the HNK-1 Carbohydrate in the β4GalT-II-/- Mouse Brain—Because the HNK-1 carbohydrate and PSA, which are well known functional carbohydrates in the nervous system, are expressed on the β4-galactose epitope, we investigated the expression of these carbohydrates in the β4GalT-II-/- mouse brain. Immunohistochemical staining with an anti-HNK-1 antibody revealed strong and widespread expression of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in the 2-week-old β4GalT-II+/+ mouse brain, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and comparatively less expression in the cerebellum (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the immunoreactivity of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in the 2-week-old β4GalT-II-/- mice was markedly reduced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the 11-week-old β4GalT-II-/- mouse brain (Fig. 4B), the HNK-1 reactivity was barely detectable only in the DG of the hippocampus, layers III-IV of the cerebral cortex, and the cerebellar lobule. In the cerebellar nuclei of the β4GalT-II-/- mice, no reduction of the HNK-1 carbohydrate was apparent, in contrast to the other brain regions. By Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C), we further confirmed that the HNK-1 carbohydrate in the β4GalT-II-/- mouse brain largely disappeared, except for faint bands of >250 kDa at every postnatal stage. On the other hand, the expression of NCAM, which is one of major carrier proteins of the HNK-1 carbohydrate, did not differ among the wild-type, β4GalT-II+/-, and β4GalT-II-/- genotypes. Expression of PSA Is Not Changed in the β4GalT-II-/- Mouse Brain—Immunohistochemical staining with an anti-PSA antibody showed that PSA was highly expressed in the hippocampus and corpus callosum and at lower levels in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar lobule of the 2-week-old β4GalT-II+/+ mouse brain (Fig. 5A). Weak PSA expression was detected in the DG and CA3 fields of the hippocampus of the 11-week-old β4GalT-II+/+ mouse (Fig. 5B). No obvious change in PSA expression was observed in the β4GalT-II-/- brain (Fig. 5, A and B). The comparable PSA expression in the mutant was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C) using the P0 mouse brain. The expression of NCAM also did not differ among the wild-type, β4GalT-II+/-, and β4GalT-II-/- genotypes (Fig. 5C). To examine the carbohydrate structures in the β4GalT-II-/- brain, lectin blot analysis using concanavalin A, RCA120, S. sieboldiana agglutinin, and M. amurensis agglutinin was performed. Although a few bands disappeared in the membrane fractions of the β4GalT-II-/- brain, most of the band patterns in the β4GalT-II+/+ and β4GalT-II-/- brains of 2- and 11-week-old mice were comparable (supplemental Fig. 1). Spontaneous Activity of β4GalT-II-/- Mice in the Open Field Test—To assess their spontaneous activity in a novel environment, the mice were subjected to an open field test for 3 days. Their spontaneous activity was typically and usually repressed at the initial phase of day 1 (Fig. 6A), probably because the animals became nervous in a novel environment. On every trial day, the greatest distance moved was recorded during the first phase of the trial (except for day 1), and this activity gradually decreased. This behavioral pattern did not significantly differ between the β4GalT-II+/- and β4GalT-II-/- mice. The β4GalT-II-/- mice also showed similar spontaneous activity in terms of their speed (Fig. 6C) and the number of rearing (Fig. 6D) as their heterozygous littermates, although the time spent in the central area of the chamber was slightly greater for the β4GalT-II-/- mice (Fig. 6B). Performance of β4GalT-II-/- Mice Is Impaired in the Morris Water Maze but Not in the Passive Avoidance Response Test—In the Morris water maze paradigm, the swimming latency gradually decreased with the number of training trials and days for both the β4GalT-II+/- and β4GalT-II-/- mice (Fig. 7A). In the late phase of training, especially after day 6, the β4GalT-II-/- mice showed a significantly prolonged escape lat"
https://openalex.org/W2064149563,"Because they provide exclusive property rights, patents are generally considered to be an effective way to promote intellectual discovery. Here, we propose a different compensation scheme, in which everyone holds shares in the components of potential discoveries and can trade those shares in an anonymous market. In it, incentives to invent are indirect, through changes in share prices. In a series of experiments, we used the knapsack problem (in which participants have to determine the most valuable subset of objects that can fit in a knapsack of fixed volume) as a typical representation of intellectual discovery problems. We found that our “markets system” performed better than the patent system."
https://openalex.org/W2082226075,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) induces an innate immune response, leading to an inflammatory reaction and tissue damage that have been attributed to engagement of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4. However, the respective roles of TLR2 and/or TLR4 in mediating downstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways during IRI have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 is activated in both intact kidneys and cultured renal tubule epithelial cells (RTECs) from wildtype and Tlr4 knockout mice, but not those from Tlr2 knockout mice subjected to transient ischemia. Geldanamycin (GA), an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 and reticulum endoplasmic-resident gp96, and gp96 mRNA silencing (siRNA), did not affect ERK1/2 activation in either post-hypoxic wild-type or Tlr4-deficient RTECs, but did restore its activation in post-hypoxic Tlr2-deficient RTECs. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that gp96 co-immunoprecipitates with the serine-threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), identified as a negative modulator of the mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway, in unstressed wild-type and post-hypoxic Tlr2-deficient RTECs. In contrast, PP5 co-immunoprecipitation with gp96 was strikingly reduced in post-hypoxic wild-type RTECs, suggesting that the inactivation of PP5 resulting from the dissociation of PP5 from gp96 allows the activation of ERK1/2 to occur. Inhibition of PP5 by okadaic acid, and Pp5 siRNA also restored TLR2-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptosis in post-hypoxic Tlr2-deficient RTECs. These findings indicate that gp96 interacts with PP5 and controls TLR2-mediated induction of ERK1/2 in post-hypoxic renal tubule cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001426279,"In biology, economics, and politics, distributive power is the key for understanding asymmetrical relationships and it can be obtained by force (dominance) or trading (leverage). Whenever males cannot use force, they largely depend on females for breeding opportunities and the balance of power tilts in favour of females. Thus, males are expected not only to compete within their sex-class but also to exchange services with the opposite sex. Does this mating market, described for humans and apes, apply also to prosimians, the most ancestral primate group? To answer the question, we studied a scent-oriented and gregarious lemur, Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka), showing female dominance, promiscuous mating, and seasonal breeding. We collected 57 copulations involving 8 males and 4 females in the wild (Berenty Reserve, South Madagascar), and data (all occurrences) on grooming, aggressions, and marking behaviour. We performed the analyses via exact Spearman and matrix correlations. Male mating priority rank correlated with the frequency of male countermarking over female scents but not with the proportion of fights won by males over females. Thus, males competed in an olfactory tournament more than in an arena of aggressive encounters. The copulation frequency correlated neither with the proportion of fights won by males nor with the frequency of male countermarking on female scents. Male-to-female grooming correlated with female-to-male grooming only during premating. Instead, in the mating period male-to-female grooming correlated with the copulation frequency. In short, the biological market underwent seasonal fluctuations, since males bargained grooming for sex in the mating days and grooming for itself in the premating period. Top scent-releasers gained mating priority (they mated first) and top groomers ensured a higher number of renewed copulations (they mated more). In conclusion, males maximize their reproduction probability by adopting a double tactic and by following market fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2012303003,"Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is a blood biomarker that is routinely used to monitor the progression of human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and is encoded by MUC16, a member of the mucin gene family. The biological function of CA125/MUC16 and its potential role in EOC are poorly understood. Here we report the targeted disruption of the of the Muc16 gene in the mouse. To generate Muc16 knockout mice, 6.0 kb was deleted that included the majority of exon 3 and a portion of intron 3 and replaced with a lacZ reporter cassette. Loss of Muc16 protein expression suggests that Muc16 homozygous mutant mice are null mutants. Muc16 homozygous mutant mice are viable, fertile, and develop normally. Histological analysis shows that Muc16 homozygous mutant tissues are normal. By the age of 1 year, Muc16 homozygous mutant mice appear normal. Downregulation of transcripts from another mucin gene (Muc1) was detected in the Muc16 homozygous mutant uterus. Lack of any prominent abnormal phenotype in these Muc16 knockout mice suggests that CA125/MUC16 is not required for normal development or reproduction. These knockout mice provide a unique platform for future studies to identify the role of CA125/MUC16 in organ homeostasis and ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1991342515,"Although large scale informatics studies on introns can be useful in making broad inferences concerning patterns of intron gain and loss, more specific questions about intron evolution at a finer scale can be addressed using a gene family where structure and function are well known. Genome wide surveys of tetraspanins from a broad array of organisms with fully sequenced genomes are an excellent means to understand specifics of intron evolution. Our approach incorporated several new fully sequenced genomes that cover the major lineages of the animal kingdom as well as plants, protists and fungi. The analysis of exon/intron gene structure in such an evolutionary broad set of genomes allowed us to identify ancestral intron structure in tetraspanins throughout the eukaryotic tree of life.We performed a phylogenomic analysis of the intron/exon structure of the tetraspanin protein family. In addition, to the already characterized tetraspanin introns numbered 1 through 6 found in animals, three additional ancient, phase 0 introns we call 4a, 4b and 4c were found. These three novel introns in combination with the ancestral introns 1 to 6, define three basic tetraspanin gene structures which have been conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Our phylogenomic approach also allows the estimation of the time at which the introns of the 33 human tetraspanin paralogs appeared, which in many cases coincides with the concomitant acquisition of new introns. On the other hand, we observed that new introns (introns other than 1-6, 4a, b and c) were not randomly inserted into the tetraspanin gene structure. The region of tetraspanin genes corresponding to the small extracellular loop (SEL) accounts for only 10.5% of the total sequence length but had 46% of the new animal intron insertions.Our results indicate that tests of intron evolution are strengthened by the phylogenomic approach with specific gene families like tetraspanins. These tests add to our understanding of genomic innovation coupled to major evolutionary divergence events, functional constraints and the timing of the appearance of evolutionary novelty."
https://openalex.org/W2002375937,"Background The PIP (prolactin-inducible protein) gene has been shown to be expressed in breast cancers, with contradictory results concerning its implication. As both the physiological role and the molecular pathways in which PIP is involved are poorly understood, we conducted combined gene expression profiling and network analysis studies on selected breast cancer cell lines presenting distinct PIP expression levels and hormonal receptor status, to explore the functional and regulatory network of PIP co-modulated genes. Principal Findings Microarray analysis allowed identification of genes co-modulated with PIP independently of modulations resulting from hormonal treatment or cell line heterogeneity. Relevant clusters of genes that can discriminate between [PIP+] and [PIP−] cells were identified. Functional and regulatory network analyses based on a knowledge database revealed a master network of PIP co-modulated genes, including many interconnecting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, half of which were detected as differentially expressed through high-precision measurements. The network identified appears associated with an inhibition of proliferation coupled with an increase of apoptosis and an enhancement of cell adhesion in breast cancer cell lines, and contains many genes with a STAT5 regulatory motif in their promoters. Conclusions Our global exploratory approach identified biological pathways modulated along with PIP expression, providing further support for its good prognostic value of disease-free survival in breast cancer. Moreover, our data pointed to the importance of a regulatory subnetwork associated with PIP expression in which STAT5 appears as a potential transcriptional regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2073503603,"Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two of the main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition, obesity is the most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown whether patients with diabetes have more severe SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. The aim of this cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate whether obese patients with T2DM are more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the percentage of time spent at saturations below 90% (CT90). A high prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM:80%, nondiabetic:78.3%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected (20.2±30.2% vs. 6.8±13,5%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted: 79.7±18.1 vs. 100.1±22.8; p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with CT90. Conclusions/Significance T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory."

https://openalex.org/W2075441161,"Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are important regulators of signal transduction processes mediated by cAMP and cGMP. One PDE family member, PDE3B, plays an important role in the regulation of a variety of metabolic processes such as lipolysis and insulin secretion. In this study, the cellular localization and the role of PDE3B in the regulation of triglyceride, cholesterol and glucose metabolism in hepatocytes were investigated. PDE3B was identified in caveolae, specific regions in the plasma membrane, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In caveolin-1 knock out mice, which lack caveolae, the amount of PDE3B protein and activity were reduced indicating a role of caveolin-1/caveolae in the stabilization of enzyme protein. Hepatocytes from PDE3B knock out mice displayed increased glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which was associated with increased expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes/enzymes including, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In conclusion, hepatocyte PDE3B is localized in caveolae and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and plays important roles in the regulation of glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism. Dysregulation of PDE3B could have a role in the development of fatty liver, a condition highly relevant in the context of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1964543134,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning proteins involved in a wide array of physiological functions and are the most common targets of pharmaceuticals. This study aims to identify a cohort or clique of positions that share high mutual information. Using a multiple sequence alignment of the transmembrane (TM) domains, we calculated the mutual information between all inter-TM pairs of aligned positions and ranked the pairs by mutual information. A mutual information graph was constructed with vertices that corresponded to TM positions and edges between vertices were drawn if the mutual information exceeded a threshold of statistical significance. Positions with high degree (i.e. had significant mutual information with a large number of other positions) were found to line a well defined inter-TM ligand binding cavity for class A as well as class C GPCRs. Although the natural ligands of class C receptors bind to their extracellular N-terminal domains, the possibility of modulating their activity through ligands that bind to their helical bundle has been reported. Such positions were not found for class B GPCRs, in agreement with the observation that there are not known ligands that bind within their TM helical bundle. All identified key positions formed a clique within the MI graph of interest. For a subset of class A receptors we also considered the alignment of a portion of the second extracellular loop, and found that the two positions adjacent to the conserved Cys that bridges the loop with the TM3 qualified as key positions. Our algorithm may be useful for localizing topologically conserved regions in other protein families."
https://openalex.org/W1983384768,"In response to vascular injury, differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) undergo a unique process known as “phenotype modulation,” transitioning from a quiescent, “contractile” phenotype to a proliferative, “synthetic” state. We have demonstrated previously that the signaling pathway of bone morphogenetic proteins, members of the transforming growth factor β family, play a role in the induction and maintenance of a contractile phenotype in human primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In this study, we show that a four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) inhibits transcriptional activation of vSMC-specific genes mediated by the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway through the CArG box-binding proteins, such as serum response factor and members of the myocardin (Myocd) family. Interestingly, FHL2 does not affect recruitment of serum response factor or Myocd, however, it inhibits recruitment of a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, Brg1, and RNA polymerase II, which are essential for the transcriptional activation. This is a novel mechanism of regulation of SMC-specific contractile genes by FHL2. Finally, aortic rings from homozygous FHL2-null mice display abnormalities in both endothelial-dependent and -independent relaxation, suggesting that FHL2 is essential for the regulation of vasomotor tone.

This plasticity is crucial for the normal development of vessels, homeostasis of blood pressure, and repair of injury, but it also contributes to the development of various vascular pathologies. Therefore, it is critical to understand the signaling pathways that modulate the phenotype of vSMCs to develop agents that can regulate aberrant vSMC responses in diseased vessels. Recently we demonstrated that the BMP signaling pathway plays an important role in the phenotype modulation of PASMCs. Activation of the BMP pathway is required not only for maintenance of the contractile phenotype in PASMCs, but also for induction of vSMC marker gene expression in non-SMCs, such as mouse mesenchymal C3H10T½ (10T½) cells (2Chan M.C.

It is unclear why dysregulation of BMP signaling causes pulmonary hypertension but not systemic hypertension, because BMP is able to modulate the phenotype of SMCs derived from tissues other than the pulmonary vasculature, including myometrial, aortic, and umbilical cord SMCs. 3B. N. Davis and A. Hata, unpublished results. Nearly all vSMC-specific contractile genes studied, including smooth muscle α-actin (SMA), smooth muscle calponin (CNN1), and SM22α (SM22), require a conserved cis-acting element called the “CArG box” (CC(AT)6GG) found within their promoter or intronic sequences (19Hendrix J.A.

CArG boxes bind the transcription factor SRF, first identified and named for its ability to confer serum inducibility to the c-fos gene. A variety of cofactors are known to modulate SRF transcription activity and affinity for the CArG box, including proteins of the Myocd family, such as Myocd, MRTF-A, and MRTF-B. These are all extremely potent coactivators of SRF and have been shown to induce expression of all CArG-dependent vSMC marker genes (19Hendrix J.A. Wamhoff B.R. McDonald O.G. Sinha S. Yoshida T.

Our previous study shows that BMP signaling mediates nuclear translocation of MRTF-A and MRTF-B and activates the expression of vSMC-specific genes through the CArG box (3Lagna G. Ku M.M. Nguyen P.H. Neuman N.A. Davis B.N. Hata A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37244-37255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that the LIM domain proteins CRP1, CRP2, and Leupaxin are also involved in the regulation of vSMC marker genes. CRP1 and CRP2 act as adaptor proteins that tether SRF and GATA4/5/6 to confer activation of SMC genes in cardiac myocytes (22Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Chang J. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Leupaxin forms a complex with SRF, binds to the CArG box, and activates CArG-containing gene transcription as a cofactor of SRF (23Sundberg-Smith L.J. DiMichele L.A. Sayers R.L. Mack C.P. Taylor J.M. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). FHL2 (also known as DRAL or Slim3) is also a LIM-containing protein. FHL2 interacts with both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and plays a role in modulation of various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, transcription, and signal transduction (24Johannessen M. Moller S. Hansen T. Moens U. Van Ghelue M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 268-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). FHL2 is highly expressed in early cardiac precursor cells and in the heart in adults (25Chan K.K. Tsui S.K. Lee S.M. Luk S.C. Liew C.C. Fung K.P. Waye M.M. Lee C.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but low levels of expression were detected in other tissues, including the vasculature (24Johannessen M. Moller S.

Physiol. 2008; 295: H1067-H1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been shown that transcription of the FHL2 gene is up-regulated in an SRF-dependent manner (27Philippar U. Schratt G. Dieterich C. Muller J.M. Galgoczy P. Engel F.B. Keating M.T. Gertler F. Schule R. Vingron M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FHL2 antagonizes RhoA-mediated induction of SMA and SM22 (27Philippar U. Schratt G. Dieterich C. Muller J.M. Galgoczy P. Engel F.B. Keating M.T. Gertler F. Schule R. Vingron M. Nordheim A. Mol.

Genetic evidence that patients with PAH carry truncation mutations of the tail domain of BMPRII suggests an important role of the tail domain in the BMP signaling function. FHL2 was cloned by yeast two-hybrid screen using BMPRII tail domain as bait. Here, we show that FHL2 translocates to the nucleus upon stimulation with BMP and antagonizes the BMP-mediated transcriptional activation of vSMC-specific contractile genes in PASMCs. We demonstrate that FHL2 does not inhibit recruitment of SRF, or of its cofactor MRTF-A, to the CArG sequence, but inhibits recruitment of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex protein Brg1 and RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, aortic vessels from FHL2-null mice are resistant to relaxation upon vasodilator stimuli. Altogether these data indicate that the essential role of FHL2 in the regulation of vascular tone and contractile responses mediated by contractile stimuli, such as BMP signaling.

Briefly, PASMCs transfected with siFHL2 or control siRNA (siControl) were embedded in attached collagen matrices, followed by 3 nm BMP4 treatment for 24 h. Upon releasing the collagen lattice from the culture dish, the embedded cells become free to contract the deformable collagen lattice and the surface area of collagen lattice becomes smaller (38Jeon E.S.

There was no difference between WT (0.148 ± 0.02 g) and FHL2(KO) (0.135 ± 0.03) mice (n = 6 each) in response to KCl (30 mm). Following maximal contraction with phenylephrine in the dose range of 10-8 m to 3 × 10-6 m, increasing concentrations (10-8 m to 3 × 10-6 m) of acetylcholine (Ach) was applied. Aortic rings were further relaxed by a treatment with two doses of S-nitroprusside (SNP) (10-8 m or 3 × 10-8m). For Ach and SNP relaxation, total rings studied were as follows: WT, n = 10; FHL2(KO), n = 6. For phenylephrine studies, 18 rings were studied. Isolation of vSMCs from Mice—Carotid artery explants were harvested from wild-type and FHL2(KO) mice. Adventitia were dissected from media, which was cultured to yield vSMCs, whose phenotype was confirmed by typical morphology and immunohistochemical staining for SMA. Seven separate isolates of vSMCs were obtained and characterized, derived from a pool of aortas from three individual mice per each genotype. Statistical Analysis—The results presented are average of at least three experiments each performed in triplicate with standard errors. For pairwise analysis, Student's t tests were used. Multiple group comparisons were made by one-way or two-way analysis of variance, and multiple pairwise comparisons were made with the Student-Newman-Keuls method. For all statistical comparisons, p < 0.05 was considered significant and the values are indicated with asterisks. We sought to identify tail domain-interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid screen. We used the full length of BMPRII tail domain (TD, amino acids 501-1038) or truncation mutation of tail domain found in IPAH, which contains amino acids 501-860, fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain as bait and screened a mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3 library. Among the eight positive clones obtained from the screen with the full-length tail domain bait, one clone encoding a full-length FHL2 failed to interact with the truncated tail domain bait suggesting a possible involvement of FHL2 in pathogenesis of PAH. The interaction between FHL2 and BMPRII was confirmed in mammalian cells. The mammalian expression plasmid pCMV5 encoding Myc-epitope-tagged full-length mouse FHL2 was cotransfected into COS7 cells with expression plasmids encoding FLAG-epitope-tagged BMPRII. The interaction between FHL2 and BMPRII was detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot (Fig. 1A). Interaction between FHL2 and BMPRII was slightly decreased after BMP4 stimulation (Fig. 1A). Next we examined whether FHL2 colocalizes with BMPRII at the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence staining. When the wild-type BMPRII receptor (BMPRII(WT)) was coexpressed, FHL2 localized, in part, with BMPRII at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, top panels). The ectopically expressed tail-deletion mutant BMPRII (ΔT) (Leu-530 to stop codon), which is properly expressed at the plasma membrane, was not able to localize FHL2 on the cell surface (Fig. 1B, middle panels). These results suggest that FHL2 colocalizes with BMPRII on the cell surface through interaction with the BMPRII(TD). We also examined the ability of FHL2 to interact with a partial TD deletion mutant of BMPRII found in IPAH, BMPRII(Δ860) (Asn-861 to stop codon). Consistent with an observation in yeast two-hybrid assay, an immunofluorescence stain showed no colocalization between FHL2 and BMPRII(Δ860) (Fig. 1B, bottom panels), indicating that the N-terminal region of the BMPRII(TD) located between amino acids 530 and 860 is not sufficient for FHL2 interaction. Subcellular localization of endogenous FHL2 was examined in human primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Weak and ubiquitous localization of FHL2 was observed at a basal state, however, FHL2 was enriched in the nucleus upon BMP4 stimulation similar to FBS treatment (27Philippar U. Schratt G. Dieterich C. Muller J.M. Galgoczy P. Engel F.B. Keating M.T. Gertler F. Schule R. Vingron M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that BMP stimulates nuclear accumulation of FHL2, possibly by facilitating translocation of a plasma membrane-associated population of FHL2 to the nucleus. We have reported previously that BMP signaling induces vSMC-specific genes in both mouse pluripotent C3H10T½ (10T½) and PASMCs cells through activation of the Smad pathway and the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway and mediates differentiation into a SMC-like phenotype (3Lagna G. Ku M.M. Nguyen P.H. Neuman N.A. Davis B.N. Hata A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37244-37255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the potential role of FHL2 on the BMP-mediated transcriptional activation of vSMC genes in 10T1/2 cells. The luciferase constructs containing the promoter region of SM22α (SM22-luc), smooth muscle α-actin (SMA-luc), or smooth muscle calponin (CNN-luc), which contain a CArG box sequence, were transfected with increasing amounts of FHL2 expression plasmid (Fig. 2). FHL2 inhibited the BMP4-mediated activation of all three vSMC reporters in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). A mutant SM22-luc construct, which is mutated in critical residues of the CArG box, was not affected by FHL2 (Fig. 2, SM22 (MUT)-Luc). Interestingly, FHL2 did not affect the activity of the non-vSMC gene Vent-2, a known target of the BMP-Smad pathway (Xvent2-luc) (29Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), suggesting that the inhibitory action of FHL2 is restricted to vSMC-specific genes (Fig. 2). These results unveil an antagonistic effect of FHL2 on BMP-mediated vSMC-specific gene expression. The antagonistic activity of FHL2 was confirmed by examining endogenous vSMC-specific gene expression in human primary vSMC, PASMCs. PASMCs were infected with recombinant adenovirus carrying cDNAs encoding FHL2 or GFP (control). qRT-PCR analyses indicate that BMP4-mediated induction of vSMC genes, SMA and CNN, was reduced to 40% in FHL2-expressing cells compared with control GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3A, top). Consistent with the Xvent2-luc result (Fig. 2), FHL2 showed no effect on the non-vSMC-specific BMP-target gene Id3 (Fig. 3A). FHL2-mediated reduction in SMA protein expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining in PASMCs (Fig. 3A, bottom). To assess the role of endogenous FHL2 in the BMP-mediated activation of vSMC genes, FHL2 was down-regulated by transfection of siRNA (siFHL2) in PASMCs. qRT-PCR analysis indicates that siFHL2 transfection reduced FHL2 mRNA expression to ∼50% in comparison with cells transfected with non-targeting, control siRNA (siCtr, Fig. 3B). Upon down-regulation of FHL2, both the basal and BMP4-induced expression of all three vSMC genes examined was significantly elevated compared with siCtr-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, increased level of SMA protein by siFHL2 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained in aortic SMCs (data not shown). Additionally, the up-regulation of vSMC genes by knockdown of FHL2 was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative BMP receptor type 1B (dnALK6), suggesting that this effect is dependent on endogenous autocrine BMP signaling (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results confirm that FHL2 is a negative regulator of BMP-mediated transcriptional activation of vSMC genes. A role of FHL2 in the regulation of contractile response of vSMCs as a result of change in contractile gene expression was examined by the collagen"

Significant effects are induced by either proline or threonine substitutions in the lower third of segment IIS6 (“bundle crossing region”), where S6 segments are likely to seal the channel in the closed conformation (Hohaus, A., Beyl, S., Kudrnac, M., Berjukow, S., Timin, E. N., Marksteiner, R., Maw, M. A., and Hering, S. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 38471–38477). Here we report that S435P in IS6 results in a large shift of the activation curve (-25.9 ± 1.2 mV) and slower current kinetics. Threonine substitutions at positions Leu-429 and Leu-434 induced a similar kinetic phenotype with shifted activation curves (L429T by -6.6 ± 1.2 and L434T by -12.1 ± 1.7 mV). Inactivation curves of all mutants were shifted to comparable extents as the activation curves. Interdependence of IS6 and IIS6 mutations was analyzed by means of mutant cycle analysis. Double mutations in segments IS6 and IIS6 induce either additive (L429T/I781T, -34.1 ± 1.4 mV; L434T/I781T, -40.4 ± 1.3 mV; L429T/L779T, -12.6 ± 1.3 mV; and L434T/L779T, -22.4 ± 1.3 mV) or nonadditive shifts of the activation curves along the voltage axis (S435P/I781T, -33.8 ± 1.4 mV). Mutant cycle analysis revealed energetic coupling between residues Ser-435 and Ile-781, whereas other paired mutations in segments IS6 and IIS6 had independent effects on activation gating.

Mutant cycle analysis revealed energetic coupling between residues Ser-435 and Ile-781, whereas other paired mutations in segments IS6 and IIS6 had independent effects on activation gating. Ca2+ current through CaV1.2 channels initiates muscle contraction, release of hormones and neurotransmitters, and affects physiological processes such as vision, hearing, and gene expression (1Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Snutch T.P. Perez-Reyes E. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Their pore-forming α1-subunit is composed of four homologous domains formed by six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) (2Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). The signal of the voltage-sensing machinery, consisting of multiple charged amino acids (located in segments S4 and adjacent structures of each domain), is transmitted to the pore region (3Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in pore lining S6 and adjacent segments finally lead to pore openings (activation) and closures (inactivation). Our understanding of how CaV1.2 channels open and close is largely based on extrapolations of structural information from potassium channels. The crystal structures of the closed conformation of two bacterial potassium channels (KcsA and MlotiK) (4Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R.

Del Camino D. Dekker J.P. Yellen G. Nature. 2004; 428: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism proposed for MthK channels involves helix bending at a highly conserved glycine at position 83 (see Ref. 9Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, “glycine gating hinge” hypothesis). Compared with potassium channels, the pore of CaV is asymmetric, and none of the four S6 segments has a putative helix-bending PXP motif. Furthermore, the conserved glycine (corresponding to position 83 in MthK, see Ref. 10Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) is only present in segments IS6 and IIS6 (for review see Ref. 11Hering S. Beyl S. Stary A. Kudrnac M. Hohaus A. Guy H.R. Timin E. Channels. 2008; 2: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have shown that substituting proline for this glycine in IIS6 of CaV1.2 does not significantly affect gating (12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R.

The accessibility of cysteines was changed by opening and closing the channel, consistent with the gate being on the intracellular side. The general picture of a channel gate close to the inner channel mouth of CaV1.2 was recently supported by pharmacological studies (14Beyl S. Timin E.N. Hohaus A. Stary A. Kudrnac M. Guy R.H.

Substitution of hydrophilic residues in the lower third of segment IIS6 of CaV1.2 (LAIA motif, 779–784, see Ref. 12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R.

Interestingly, these changes in channel gating resemble the effects of proline substitution of Gly-219 in the bacterial sodium channel from Bacillus halodurans (“Gly-219 gating hinge,” see Ref. 15Zhao Y. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 859-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The strongest shifts of the activation curve reported so far were observed for proline substitutions (12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R. Maw M.A. Hering S. J. Biol.

Sansom M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these mutants were causing a kink in helix IIS6 similar to a bend that would normally occur flexibly during the activation process (12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R. Maw M.A. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38471-38477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we extend our previous study by systematically substituting residues in segment IS6 of CaV1.2 by proline or the small and polar threonine. Several functional IS6 mutants with shifted activation and inactivation characteristics were identified (S435P, L429T, and L434T), and the interdependence of IS6 and IIS6 mutations was analyzed. Mutant cycle analysis revealed both mutually independent and energetically coupled contributions of IS6 and IIS6 residues on activation gating. Mutagenesis—The CaV1.2 α1-subunit coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number X15539) in-frame 3′ to the coding region of a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) 3The abbreviation used is: GFP, green fluorescent protein. was kindly donated by Dr. M. Grabner (17Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Substitutions in segment IS6 of the CaV1.2 α1-subunit were introduced by the “gene SOEing” technique (18Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological studies, we used the plasmid lacking the GFP tag. Proline mutations were introduced in segment IS6 in positions G422P to F424P and N428P to S439P. The mutated fragments were cloned into an SaII-AgeI cassette. The mutated fragment of L779T was cloned into an AgeI-AfIII cassette. The AgeI restriction site was introduced as a silent mutation. This cassette was used to create G422P, S423P, F424P, N428P, L429T/L429P, V430P/V430T, L431P/L431T, G432P/G432T, V433P/V433T, L434T, S435P, E437P, F438P, and S439P. The mutated fragment of L779T was cloned into a AgeI-AfIII cassette. This cassette was used to create L779T, L429T/L779T, L429T/I781T, L434T/L779T, L434T/I781T by two double mutants S435P/I781P and S435P/I781T. Mutants that did not conduct barium currents were recloned into the GFP-tagged vector (17Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) to analyze whether the channels were expressed in the membrane. All constructs were checked by restriction site mapping and sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells were grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were split via trypsin EDTA and plated on 35-mm Petri dishes (Falcon) at 30–50% confluence ∼16 h before transfection. Subsequently tsA-201 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant CaV1.2 α1-subunits with auxiliary β1a (19Ruth P. Rohrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) as well as α2-δ1 subunits (20Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The transfection of tsA-201 cells was performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following standard protocols. tsA-201 cells were used until passage number 15. No variation channel gating related to different cell passage numbers was observed. Ionic Current Recordings and Data Acquisition—Barium currents (IBa) through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were recorded at 22–25 °C using the patch clamp technique (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15065) Google Scholar) by means of an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) 36–48 h after transfection. The extracellular bath solution contained (in mm) the following: BaCl2 5, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, choline-Cl 140, titrated to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Patch pipettes with resistances of 1 to 4 megohms were made from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments, UK) and filled with pipette solution containing (in mm) the following: CsCl 145, MgCl2 3, HEPES 10, EGTA 10, titrated to pH 7.25 with CsOH. All data were digitized using a DIGIDATA 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City), smoothed by means of a four-pole Bessel filter and saved to a disk. 100-ms current traces were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz; for the steady-state inactivation protocol, currents were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered at 0.5 kHz; and tail currents were sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. Leak currents were subtracted digitally using average values of scaled leakage currents elicited by a 10-mV hyperpolarizing pulse or electronically by means of an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Series resistance and offset voltage were routinely compensated. The pClamp software package (version 7.0, Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and preliminary analysis. Microcal Origin 5.0 was used for analysis and curve fitting. To analyze the voltage dependence of activation, we estimated the fractions of open (activated) channels at different potentials at the current peak when channel opening reached a saturating level, and inactivation was still small. Current-voltage (I-V) curves were fitted according to the following modified Boltzmann equation: I = Gmax(V - Vrev)/(1 + exp((V0.5,act - V)/kact)), where Vrev is extrapolated reversal potential; V is membrane potential; I is peak current; Gmax is maximum membrane conductance; V0.5, act is voltage for half-maximal activation; and kact is slope factor. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from I-V curves and fitted to m∞ = 1/(1 + exp((V0.5,act - V)/kact)). The time course of current activation was fitted to a monoexponential function as follows: I(t) = A(exp(-t/τ)) + C, where I(t) is current at time t; A is the amplitude coefficient; τ is time constant; and C is steady state current. The voltage dependence of IBa inactivation (inactivation curve) was measured using a multistep protocol to account for run down (22Hemara-Wahanui A. Berjukow S. Hope C.I. Dearden P.K. Wu S.B. Wilson-Wheeler J. Sharp D.M. Lundon-Treweek P. Clover G.M. Hoda J.C. Striessnig J. Marksteiner R. Hering S. Maw M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7553-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The pulse sequence was applied every 40 s from a holding potential of -100 mV. Inactivation curves were drawn according to a Boltzmann equation as follows: IBa, inact = Iss + (1 - Iss)/(1 + exp((V - V0.5,inact)/k)), where V is membrane potential; V0.5, inact is midpoint voltage; k is slope factor; and Iss is fraction of noninactivating current. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed with analysis of variance and post hoc test. Student's unpaired t test was used to analyze significance of differences from 0 (ΔΔG). Confocal Imaging—Images were obtained ∼30 h after transfection. The images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser scanning module, using a 63× (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective. Fluorescence from GFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1-subunits was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser, and emitted light was recorded with a 505–530 nm bandpass filter. The plasma membrane was stained with 2 μm FM4-64 (an amphiphilic styryl dye, Molecular Probes). The dye was detected with a helium-neon laser (excitation, 543 nm) in combination with a 650 nm long pass filter. The instrument was operated in the multitracking mode to minimize channel cross-talk. Pinholes were adjusted to obtain optical slices of 1-μm thickness for each channel. Homology Modeling—Models of the pore-forming α1-subunit of the closed CaV1.2 channel (accession number P15381) are based on the crystal structures of MlotiK (5Clayton G.M. Altieri S. Heginbotham L.

Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities between CaV1.2 S6 segments and MlotiK/KcsA M2 helices are in the range of 22–40%.

Proline Scan of IS6 Reveals Large Shift of Activation and Inactivation Curves for Mutant S435P—Amino acids of segment IS6 (most residues between positions 422 and 439) of the CaV1.2 α1-subunit were substituted by prolines and barium (Ba2+) currents measured with patch clamp after co-expression of the α1-subunits with auxiliary β1a and α2-δ1 subunits in tsA-201 cells. Only 1 out of the tested 14 proline mutants (S435P) conducted ionic currents. A family of inward Ba2+ currents and the corresponding current-voltage (I-V) curve of mutant S435P and the voltage dependences of steady-state inactivation are shown in Fig. 1. The current reversed at about 50 mV, indicating that the mutation did not affect ion selectivity (Fig. 1B, similar observations were made for mutants L429T and L434T, data not shown). The midpoint voltage of steady state activation changed from -9.9 ± 1.1 mV in the wild-type channel to -35.8 ± 0.6 mV in S435P mutant (Fig. 1). The mutation also shifted the midpoint voltage of the inactivation curve from -38.7 ± 1.0 mV in wild-type channels to -65.7 ± 0.7 mV (Fig. 1C) and substantially slowed channel inactivation. Wild-type channels were inactivated by 65 ± 4%, whereas mutation S435P was inactivated by 5 ± 4% during a 300-ms pulse at the peak of the I-V curve (see Table 1). In Fig. 1, E and G, the corresponding changes in current activation and deactivation kinetics are illustrated. The activation time constant of S435P ranged between 10.4 ms (-50 mV) and 3.1 ms (10 mV) (Fig. 1E), and at -30 mV the mutant displayed a 1.5-fold slower activation time course than wild type.TABLE 1Influence of pore mutations on voltage-dependent gating of CaV1.2 Midpoints and slope factors of the activation curves, midpoints of the inactivation curves, and amount of channel inactivation during a 300-ms pulse (r300) to the peak potentials of the I-V curve are shown.

Wild-type and mutant GFP-tagged CaV1.2 α1-subunits were co-transfected with β1a and α2-δ1 subunits in tsA-201 cells, and the plasma membrane was visualized by staining with FM4-64. Consistent with our previous report (12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R. Maw M.A. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38471-38477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), GFP-tagged nonfunctional proline mutants localized predominantly at the plasma membrane (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the lack of current observed for these constructs is unlikely to be caused by a failure of the α1-subunits to reach the plasma membrane. Threonine Mutations Shift the Voltage Dependence of CaV1.2 Gating—More than 90% of the proline mutants in segment IS6 did not conduct barium currents (Table 1). This distinguishes this segment from IIS6, where 8 of 14 (almost 60%) proline substitutions resulted in functional channels (12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R. Maw M.A. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38471-38477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that gradual changes in hydrophobicity in selected positions of transmembrane segment IIS6 gradually shift the activation and inactivation curves of CaV1.2 (see Ref. 11Hering S. Beyl S. Stary A. Kudrnac M. Hohaus A. Guy H.R. Timin E. Channels. 2008; 2: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To elucidate a potential role of hydrophobic interactions in segment IS6, we systematically substituted the putative bundle crossing region (residues 429–434) by the small and polar threonine. Constructs L429T and L434T conducted barium currents, whereas other threonine mutations did not result in functional channels (Fig. 2 and Table 1). L429T and L434T shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation in the hyperpolarizing direction and slightly slowed activation and deactivation kinetics. The largest shift in channel activation and the correspondingly slowest kinetics of current activation and deactivation were observed, however, for L434T suggesting a potentially important role of this residue in CaV1.2 gating. In line with our previous observations in segment IIS6, the changes in the voltage dependences of activation and inactivation occurred in parallel, which can be seen in Fig. 8 where midpoint voltages of activation curves are plotted versus midpoint voltages of inactivation curves. However, such a correlation is not observed for all CaV channel constructs (e.g. Spaetgens and Zamponi (30Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Stotz and Zamponi (31Stotz S.C. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol.

Paired Mutations in Segments IS6 and IIS6 Inducing Additive Shifts of the Activation Curve—After identification of “gating sensitive” residues in segments IS6, we made use of previously characterized mutants in segment IIS6 to study if these structural changes contribute to channel gating independently or in a coupled fashion. First we analyzed the combined impact of the IIS6 mutations L779T (-9-mV shift) and I781T (-28-mV shift, see Ref. 12Hohaus A. Beyl S. Kudrnac M. Berjukow S. Timin E.N. Marksteiner R. Maw M.A. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38471-38477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the newly identified residues in segment IS6 L429T and L434T (causing shifts of about -7 and -12 mV, see Table 1). According to our homology model of the closed conformation, all four residues are located in close proximity (Fig. 9), where residues Leu-434 (IS6) and residue Leu-779 (IIS6) interact directly with each other and residues Ser-435 and Ile-781 interact with residues from neighboring S6 helices. It was therefore interesting to elucidate if the mutations in these regions of IS6 and IIS6 would have additive (independent) or nonadditive effects on the channel activation and inactivation curves. As shown in Fig. 3, the impact of all four mutations in segments IS6 and IIS6 on the activation curves was additive. The voltage of half-maximal channel activation of construct L434T/I781T was shifted by -40 mV (-12 to 28 mV) and of construct L429T/I781T by -34 mV (-7 to 28 mV). Less prominent shifts were observed for L429T/L779T (≈-12 mV) and L434T/L779T (≈-22 mV) constructs. Double mutants L429T/I781T and L434T/I781T displayed slow activation at hyperpolarized potentials (Fig. 4). The large shift of the activation curve of L434T/I781T was associated with a slower activation (τact"
https://openalex.org/W1993315460,"In this study, we attempted to understand the mechanism of regulation of the activity and allosteric behavior of the pyruvate kinase M(2) enzyme and two of its missense mutations, H391Y and K422R, found in cells from Bloom syndrome patients, prone to develop cancer. Results show that despite the presence of mutations in the intersubunit contact domain, the K422R and H391Y mutant proteins maintained their homotetrameric structure, similar to the wild-type protein, but showed a loss of activity of 75 and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, H391Y showed a 6-fold increase in affinity for its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and behaved like a non-allosteric protein with compromised cooperative binding. However, the affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate was lost significantly in K422R. Unlike K422R, H391Y showed enhanced thermal stability, stability over a range of pH values, a lesser effect of the allosteric inhibitor Phe, and resistance toward structural alteration upon binding of the activator (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) and inhibitor (Phe). Both mutants showed a slight shift in the pH optimum from 7.4 to 7.0. Although this study signifies the importance of conserved amino acid residues in long-range communications between the subunits of multimeric proteins, the altered behavior of mutants is suggestive of their probable role in tumor-promoting growth and metabolism in Bloom syndrome patients with defective pyruvate kinase M(2)."

To identify possible effectors or regulators of TrkA signaling, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the intracellular domain of TrkA as bait. We identified muc18-1-interacting protein 2 (Mint2) as a novel TrkA-binding protein and found that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Mint2 interacted with TrkA in a phosphorylation- and ligand-independent fashion. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that endogenous TrkA interacted with Mint2 in rat tissue homogenates, and immunohistochemical evidence revealed that Mint2 and TrkA colocalized in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. Furthermore, Mint2 overexpression inhibited NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in both PC12 and cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, whereas inhibition of Mint2 expression by RNA interference facilitated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, Mint2 was found to promote the retention of TrkA in the Golgi apparatus and inhibit its surface sorting. Taken together, our data provide evidence that Mint2 is a novel TrkA-regulating protein that affects NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, possibly through a mechanism involving retention of TrkA in the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2038961159,"Bestrophins are a recently discovered family of Cl(-) channels, for which no structural information is available. Some family members are activated by increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Bestrophins feature a well conserved Asp-rich tract in their COOH terminus (Asp-rich domain), which is homologous to Ca2+-binding motifs in human thrombospondins and in human big-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ channels (BK(Ca)). Consequently, the Asp-rich domain is also a candidate for Ca2+ binding in bestrophins. Based on these considerations, we constructed homology models of human bestrophin-1 (Best1) Asp-rich domain using human thrombospondin-1 X-ray structure as a template. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify Asp and Glu residues binding Ca2+ and to predict the effects of their mutations to alanine. We then proceeded to test selected mutations in the Asp-rich domain of the highly homologous mouse bestrophin-2. The mutants expressed in HEK-293 cells were investigated by electrophysiological experiments using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Based on our molecular modeling results, we predicted that Asp-rich domain has two defined binding sites and that D301A and D304A mutations may impact the binding of the metal ions. The experiments confirmed that these mutations do actually affect the function of the protein causing a large decrease in the Ca2+-activated Cl(-) current, fully consistent with our predictions. In addition, other studied mutations (E306A, D312A) did not decrease Ca2+-activated Cl(-) current in agreement with modeling results."
https://openalex.org/W2051095569,"Although there was growing evidence in the potential use of Bisphosphonates (BPs) in cancer therapy, their strong osseous affinities that contrast their poor soft tissue uptake limited their use. Here, we developed a new strategy to overcome BPs hydrophilicity by masking the phosphonic acid through organic protecting groups and introducing hydrophobic functions in the side chain.We synthesized non-nitrogen BPs (non N-BPs) containing bromobenzyl group (BP7033Br) in their side chain that were symmetrically esterified with hydrophobic 4-methoxphenyl (BP7033BrALK) and assessed their effects on breast cancer estrogen-responsive cells (T47D, MCF-7) as well as on non responsive ones (SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and its highly metastatic derived D3H2LN subclone). BP7033Br ALK was more efficient in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival when compared to BP7033Br. Although both compounds inhibited tumor growth without side effects, only BP7033Br ALK abrogated tumor angiogenesis and D3H2LN cells-induced metastases formation.Taken together these data suggest the potential therapeutic use of this new class of esterified Bisphosphonates (BPs) in the treatment of tumor progression and metastasis without toxic adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W2087216201,"The relationship between amyloid and toxic species is a central problem since the discovery of amyloid structures in different diseases. Despite intensive efforts in the field, the deleterious species remains unknown at the molecular level. This may reflect the lack of any structure-toxicity study based on a genetic approach. Here we show that a structure-toxicity study without any biochemical prerequisite can be successfully achieved in yeast. A PCR mutagenesis of the amyloid domain of HET-s leads to the identification of a mutant that might impair cellular viability. Cellular and biochemical analyses demonstrate that this toxic mutant forms GFP-amyloid aggregates that differ from the wild-type aggregates in their shape, size and molecular organization. The chaperone Hsp104 that helps to disassemble protein aggregates is strictly required for the cellular toxicity. Our structure-toxicity study suggests that the smallest aggregates are the most toxic, and opens a new way to analyze the relationship between structure and toxicity of amyloid species."
https://openalex.org/W2031346523,"WRN belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases and it plays a role in recombination, replication, telomere maintenance and long-patch base excision repair. Here, we demonstrate that WRN efficiently unwinds DNA substrates containing a 1-nucleotide gap in the translocating DNA strand, but when the gap size is increased to 3-nucleotides unwinding activity significantly declines. In contrast, E. coli UvrD (3′→5′ helicase), which recognizes nicks in DNA to initiate unwinding, does not unwind past a 1-nucleotide gap. This unique ability of WRN to bypass gaps supports its involvement in DNA replication and LP-BER where such gaps can be produced by glycosylases and the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). Furthermore, we tested telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2), both variants 1 and 2 of protector of telomeres 1 (POT1v1 and POT1v2) and RPA on telomeric DNA substrates containing much bigger gaps than 3-nucleotides in order to determine whether unwinding could be facilitated through WRN-protein interaction. Interestingly, POT1v1 and RPA are capable of stimulating WRN helicase on gapped DNA and 5′-overhang substrates, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1991346963,"Background The SMC proteins are involved in DNA repair, chromosome condensation, and sister chromatid cohesion throughout Eukaryota. Long, anti-parallel coiled coils are a prominent feature of SMC proteins, and are thought to serve as spacer rods to provide an elongated structure and to separate domains. We reported recently that the coiled coils of mammalian condensin (SMC2/4) showed moderate sequence divergence (≈10–15%) consistent with their functioning as spacer rods. The coiled coils of mammalian cohesins (SMC1/3), however, were very highly constrained, with amino acid sequence divergence typically <0.5%. These coiled coils are among the most highly conserved mammalian proteins, suggesting that they make extensive contacts over their entire surface. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we broaden our initial analysis of condensin and cohesin to include additional vertebrate and invertebrate organisms and multiple species of yeast. We found that the coiled coils of SMC1/3 are highly constrained in Drosophila and other insects, and more generally across all animal species. However, in yeast they are no more constrained than the coils of SMC2/4 and Ndc80/Nuf2p, suggesting that they are serving primarily as spacer rods. Conclusions/Significance SMC1/3 functions for sister chromatid cohesion in all species. Since its coiled coils apparently serve only as spacer rods in yeast, it is likely that this is sufficient for sister chromatid cohesion in all species. This suggests an additional function in animals that constrains the sequence of the coiled coils. Several recent studies have demonstrated that cohesin has a role in gene expression in post-mitotic neurons of Drosophila, and other animal cells. Some variants of human Cornelia de Lange Syndrome involve mutations in human SMC1/3. We suggest that the role of cohesin in gene expression may involve intimate contact of the coiled coils of SMC1/3, and impose the constraint on sequence divergence."
