https://openalex.org/W2066261076,"The origin of mutations is central to understanding evolution and of key relevance to health. Variation occurs non-randomly across the genome, and mechanisms for this remain to be defined. Here we report that the 5′ ends of Okazaki fragments have significantly increased levels of nucleotide substitution, indicating a replicative origin for such mutations. Using a novel method, emRiboSeq, we map the genome-wide contribution of polymerases, and show that despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-α (Pol-α) is retained in vivo, comprising approximately 1.5% of the mature genome. We propose that DNA-binding proteins that rapidly re-associate post-replication act as partial barriers to Pol-δ-mediated displacement of Pol-α-synthesized DNA, resulting in incorporation of such Pol-α tracts and increased mutation rates at specific sites. We observe a mutational cost to chromatin and regulatory protein binding, resulting in mutation hotspots at regulatory elements, with signatures of this process detectable in both yeast and humans. The emRiboSeq sequencing method is used to track polymerase activity genome-wide in vivo; despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-α (Pol-α) is retained in vivo and comprises ∼1.5% of the genome, establishing Pol-α as an important source of genomic variability and providing a mechanism for site-specific variation in nucleotide substitution rates. The mechanisms that underpin non-random distribution of mutations across the genome remain to be defined. Here Andrew Jackson and colleagues report that the 5′ ends of Okazaki fragments — short fragments of DNA synthesized on the lagging strand of DNA during replication — have increased levels of nucleotide substitution. With the help of a newly developed method tracking polymerase activity known as emRiboSeq, they show that despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-α (Pol-α) is retained in vivo, and comprises about 1.5% of the genome. These findings establish establishing Pol-α as an important source of genomic variability, and provide a mechanism for site-specific variation in nucleotide substitution rates. Mutation hotspots at regulatory elements are therefore a mutational cost of chromatin and regulatory protein binding."
https://openalex.org/W1964028898,"Thirst is the basic instinct to drink water. Previously, it was shown that neurons in several circumventricular organs of the hypothalamus are activated by thirst-inducing conditions. Here we identify two distinct, genetically separable neural populations in the subfornical organ that trigger or suppress thirst. We show that optogenetic activation of subfornical organ excitatory neurons, marked by the expression of the transcription factor ETV-1, evokes intense drinking behaviour, and does so even in fully water-satiated animals. The light-induced response is highly specific for water, immediate and strictly locked to the laser stimulus. In contrast, activation of a second population of subfornical organ neurons, marked by expression of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, drastically suppresses drinking, even in water-craving thirsty animals. These results reveal an innate brain circuit that can turn an animal's water-drinking behaviour on and off, and probably functions as a centre for thirst control in the mammalian brain."

https://openalex.org/W2043717533,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are giant enzymes composed of modules that house repeated sets of functional domains, which select, activate and couple amino acids drawn from a pool of nearly 500 potential building blocks. The structurally and stereochemically diverse peptides generated in this manner underlie the biosynthesis of a large sector of natural products. Many of their derived metabolites are bioactive such as the antibiotics vancomycin, bacitracin, daptomycin and the β-lactam-containing penicillins, cephalosporins and nocardicins. Penicillins and cephalosporins are synthesized from a classically derived non-ribosomal peptide synthetase tripeptide (from δ-(L-α-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase). Here we report an unprecedented non-ribosomal peptide synthetase activity that both assembles a serine-containing peptide and mediates its cyclization to the critical β-lactam ring of the nocardicin family of antibiotics. A histidine-rich condensation domain, which typically performs peptide bond formation during product assembly, also synthesizes the embedded four-membered ring. We propose a mechanism, and describe supporting experiments, that is distinct from the pathways that have evolved to the three other β-lactam antibiotic families: penicillin/cephalosporins, clavams and carbapenems. These findings raise the possibility that β-lactam rings can be regio- and stereospecifically integrated into engineered peptides for application as, for example, targeted protease inactivators."
https://openalex.org/W2119679496,"Infectious agents develop intricate mechanisms to interact with host cell pathways and hijack their genetic and epigenetic machinery to change host cell phenotypic states. Among the Apicomplexa phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only genus that transforms its mammalian host cells. Theileria infection of bovine leukocytes induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with activated signalling pathways, notably JNK and AP-1 (ref. 2). The transformed phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the theilericidal drug buparvaquone. We used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PIN1 in T. annulata (TaPIN1) that is secreted into the host cell and modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPIN1 is a bona fide prolyl isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7, leading to its degradation and subsequent stabilization of c-JUN, which promotes transformation. We performed in vitro and in silico analysis and in vivo zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPIN1 is directly inhibited by the anti-parasite drug buparvaquone (and other known PIN1 inhibitors) and is mutated in a drug-resistant strain. Prolyl isomerization is thus a conserved mechanism that is important in cancer and is used by Theileria parasites to manipulate host oncogenic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1988503609,"Background Despite a recent decline, Zimbabwe still has the fifth highest adult HIV prevalence in the world at 14.7%; 56% of the population are currently living in extreme poverty. Design Cross-sectional population-based survey of 18–22 year olds, conducted in 30 communities in south-eastern Zimbabwe in 2007. Objective To examine whether the risk of HIV infection among young rural Zimbabwean women is associated with socio-economic position and whether different socio-economic domains, including food sufficiency, might be associated with HIV risk in different ways. Methods Eligible participants completed a structured questionnaire and provided a finger-prick blood sample tested for antibodies to HIV and HSV-2. The relationship between poverty and HIV was explored for three socio-economic domains: ability to afford essential items; asset wealth; food sufficiency. Analyses were performed to examine whether these domains were associated with HIV infection or risk factors for infection among young women, and to explore which factors might mediate the relationship between poverty and HIV. Results 2593 eligible females participated in the survey and were included in the analyses. Overall HIV prevalence among these young females was 7.7% (95% CI: 6.7–8.7); HSV-2 prevalence was 11.2% (95% CI: 9.9–12.4). Lower socio-economic position was associated with lower educational attainment, earlier marriage, increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders and increased reporting of higher risk sexual behaviours such as earlier sexual debut, more and older sexual partners and transactional sex. Young women reporting insufficient food were at increased risk of HIV infection and HSV-2. Conclusions This study provides evidence from Zimbabwe that among young poor women, economic need and food insufficiency are associated with the adoption of unsafe behaviours. Targeted structural interventions that aim to tackle social and economic constraints including insufficient food should be developed and evaluated alongside behaviour and biomedical interventions, as a component of HIV prevention programming and policy."
https://openalex.org/W1988665049,"Myofibroblasts have increased expression of contractile proteins and display augmented contractility. It is not known if the augmented contractile gene expression characterizing the myofibroblast phenotype impacts its intrinsic ability to assemble fibronectin (FN) and extracellular matrix. In this study we investigated whether myofibroblasts displayed increased rates of FN fibril assembly when compared with their undifferentiated counterparts. Freshly plated myofibroblasts assemble exogenous FN (488-FN) into a fibrillar matrix more rapidly than fibroblasts that have not undergone myofibroblast differentiation. The augmented rate of FN matrix formation by myofibroblasts was dependent on intact Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) and myosin signals inasmuch as treatment with Y27632 or blebbistatin attenuated 488-FN assembly. Inhibiting contractile gene expression by pharmacologic disruption of the transcription factors megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1)/serum response factor (SRF) during myofibroblast differentiation resulted in decreased contractile force generation and attenuated 488-FN incorporation although not FN expression. Furthermore, disruption of the MKL1/SRF target gene, smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) via siRNA knockdown resulted in attenuation of 488-FN assembly. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a linkage between increased contractile gene expression, most importantly α-SMA, and the intrinsic capacity of myofibroblasts to assemble exogenous FN into fibrillar extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2025350591,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway that plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. We previously showed that the inhibition of autophagy causes pancreatic β-cell apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy is a protective mechanism for the survival of pancreatic β-cells. The current study demonstrates that treatment with inhibitors and knockdown of the lysosomal cysteine proteases such as cathepsins B and L impair autophagy, enhancing the caspase-dependent apoptosis of INS-1 cells and islets upon exposure to high concentration of glucose. Interestingly, treatment with cathepsin B and L inhibitors prevented the proteolytic processing of cathepsins B, D and L, as evidenced by gradual accumulation of the respective pro-forms. Of note, inhibition of aspartic cathepsins had no effect on autophagy and cell viability, suggesting the selective role of cathepsins B and L in the regulation of β-cell autophagy and apoptosis. Lysosomal localization of accumulated pro-cathepsins in the presence of cathepsin B and L inhibitors was verified via immunocytochemistry and lysosomal fractionation. Lysotracker staining indicated that cathepsin B and L inhibitors led to the formation of severely enlarged lysosomes in a time-dependent manner. The abnormal accumulation of pro-cathepsins following treatment with inhibitors of cathepsins B and L suppressed normal lysosomal degradation and the processing of lysosomal enzymes, leading to lysosomal dysfunction. Collectively, our findings suggest that cathepsin defects following the inhibition of cathepsin B and L result in lysosomal dysfunction and consequent cell death in pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038706245,"Background Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH’s) are used to prevent and treat thrombosis. Tests for monitoring LMWH’s include anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin generation. Anti-FXa is the current gold standard despite LMWH’s varying affinities for FXa and thrombin. Aim To examine the effects of two different LMWH’s on the results of 4 different aPTT-tests, anti-FXa activity and thrombin generation and to assess the tests’ concordance. Method Enoxaparin and tinzaparin were added ex-vivo in concentrations of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 anti-FXa international units (IU)/mL, to blood from 10 volunteers. aPTT was measured using two whole blood methods (Free oscillation rheometry (FOR) and Hemochron Jr (HCJ)) and an optical plasma method using two different reagents (ActinFSL and PTT-Automat). Anti-FXa activity was quantified using a chromogenic assay. Thrombin generation (Endogenous Thrombin Potential, ETP) was measured on a Ceveron Alpha instrument using the TGA RB and more tissue-factor rich TGA RC reagents. Results Methods’ mean aPTT at 1.0 IU/mL LMWH varied between 54s (SD 11) and 69s (SD 14) for enoxaparin and between 101s (SD 21) and 140s (SD 28) for tinzaparin. ActinFSL gave significantly shorter aPTT results. aPTT and anti-FXa generally correlated well. ETP as measured with the TGA RC reagent but not the TGA RB reagent showed an inverse exponential relationship to the concentration of LMWH. The HCJ-aPTT results had the weakest correlation to anti-FXa and thrombin generation (Rs0.62–0.87), whereas the other aPTT methods had similar correlation coefficients (Rs0.80–0.92). Conclusions aPTT displays a linear dose-respone to LMWH. There is variation between aPTT assays. Tinzaparin increases aPTT and decreases thrombin generation more than enoxaparin at any given level of anti-FXa activity, casting doubt on anti-FXa’s present gold standard status. Thrombin generation with tissue factor-rich activator is a promising method for monitoring LMWH’s."
https://openalex.org/W2009002103,"Water tables are dropping by approximately one meter annually throughout the North China Plain mainly due to water withdrawals for irrigating winter wheat year after year. In order to examine whether the drawdown can be reduced we calculate the net water use for an 11 year field experiment from 2003 to 2013 where six irrigated crops (winter wheat, summer maize, cotton, peanuts, sweet potato, ryegrass) were grown in different crop rotations in the North China Plain. As part of this experiment moisture contents were measured each at 20 cm intervals in the top 1.8 m. Recharge and net water use were calculated based on these moisture measurement. Results showed that winter wheat and ryegrass had the least recharge with an average of 27 mm/year and 39 mm/year, respectively; cotton had the most recharge with an average of 211 mm/year) followed by peanuts with 118 mm/year, sweet potato with 76 mm/year, and summer maize with 44 mm/year. Recharge depended on the amount of irrigation water pumped from the aquifer and was therefore a poor indicator of future groundwater decline. Instead net water use (recharge minus irrigation) was found to be a good indicator for the decline of the water table. The smallest amount of net (ground water) used was cotton with an average of 14 mm/year, followed by peanut with 32 mm/year, summer maize with 71 mm/year, sweet potato with 74 mm/year. Winter wheat and ryegrass had the greatest net water use with the average of 198 mm/year and 111 mm/year, respectively. Our calculations showed that any single crop would use less water than the prevalent winter wheat summer maize rotation. This growing one crop instead of two will reduce the decline of groundwater and in some rain rich years increase the ground water level, but will result in less income for the farmers."
https://openalex.org/W1985114305,"Cigarette butts (CBs) are the most common type of litter on earth, with an estimated 4.5 trillion discarded annually. Apart from being unsightly, CBs pose a serious threat to living organisms and ecosystem health when discarded in the environment because they are toxic to microbes, insects, fish and mammals. In spite of the CB toxic hazard, no studies have addressed the effects of environmental conditions on CB decomposition rate. In this study we investigate the interactive effects of substrate fertility and N transfer dynamics on CB decomposition rate and carbon quality changes. We carried out an experiment using smoked CBs and wood sticks, used as a slow decomposing standard organic substrate, incubated in both laboratory and field conditions for two years. CB carbon quality changes during decomposition was assessed by 13C CPMAS NMR. Our experiment confirmed the low degradation rate of CBs which, on average, lost only 37.8% of their initial mass after two years of decomposition. Although a net N transfer occurred from soil to CBs, contrary to our hypothesis, mass loss in the medium-term (two years) was unaffected by N availability in the surrounding substrate. The opposite held for wood sticks, in agreement with the model that N-rich substrates promote the decomposition of other N-poor natural organic materials with a high C/N ratio. As regards CB chemical quality, after two years of decomposition 13C NMR spectroscopy highlighted very small changes in C quality that are likely to reflect a limited microbial attack."
https://openalex.org/W2090522555,"Purpose To investigate the distribution of posterior corneal astigmatism in eyes with with-the-rule (WTR) and against-the-rule (ATR) anterior corneal astigmatism. Methods We retrospectively examined six hundred eight eyes of 608 healthy subjects (275 men and 333 women; mean age ± standard deviation, 55.3 ± 20.2 years). The magnitude and axis orientation of anterior and posterior corneal astigmatism were determined with a rotating Scheimpflug system (Pentacam HR, Oculus) when we divided the subjects into WTR and ATR anterior corneal astigmatism groups. Results The mean magnitudes of anterior and posterior corneal astigmatism were 1.14 ± 0.76 diopters (D), and 0.37 ± 0.19 D, respectively. We found a significant correlation between the magnitudes of anterior and posterior corneal astigmatism (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.4739, P<0.001). In the WTR anterior astigmatism group, we found ATR astigmatism of the posterior corneal surface in 402 eyes (96.6%). In the ATR anterior astigmatism group, we found ATR posterior corneal astigmatism in 82 eyes (73.9%). Especially in eyes with ATR anterior corneal astigmatism of 1 D or more and 1.5 D or more, ATR posterior corneal astigmatism was found in 28 eyes (59.6%) and 9 eyes (42.9%), respectively. Conclusions WTR anterior astigmatism and ATR posterior astigmatism were found in approximately 68% and 91% of eyes, respectively. The magnitude and the axis orientation of posterior corneal astigmatism were not constant, especially in eyes having high ATR anterior corneal astigmatism, as is often the case in patients who have undergone toric IOL implantation."

In the present study, we identified Tudor-SN as a novel regulator in cell cycle. Tudor-SN was abundant in proliferating cells whereas barely expressed in terminally differentiated cells. Functional analysis indicated that ectopic overexpression of Tudor-SN promoted the G1/S transition, whereas knockdown of Tudor-SN caused G1 arrest. Moreover, the live-cell time-lapse experiment demonstrated that the cell cycle of MEF−/− (knock-out of Tudor-SN in mouse embryonic fibroblasts) was prolonged compared with wild-type MEF+/+. We noticed that Tudor-SN was constantly expressed in every cell cycle phase, but was highly phosphorylated in the G1/S border. Further study revealed that Tudor-SN was a potential substrate of Cdk2/4/6, supportively, we found the physical interaction of endogenous Tudor-SN with Cdk4/6 in G1 and the G1/S border, and with Cdk2 in the G1/S border and S phase. In addition, roscovitine (Cdk1/2/5 inhibitor) or CINK4 (Cdk4/6 inhibitor) could inhibit the phosphorylation of Tudor-SN, whereas ectopic overexpression of Cdk2/4/6 increased the Tudor-SN phosphorylation. The underlying molecular mechanisms indicated that Tudor-SN could physically interact with E2F-1 in vivo, and could enhance the physical association of E2F-1 with GCN5 (a cofactor of E2F-1, which possesses histone acetyltransferase activity), and promote the binding ability of E2F-1 to the promoter region of its target genes CYCLIN A and E2F-1, and as a result, facilitate the gene transcriptional activation. Taken together, Tudor-SN is identified as a novel co-activator of E2F-1, which could facilitate E2F-1-mediated gene transcriptional activation of target genes, which play essential roles in G1/S transition.

Different from the Watson-Crick base-pairing found in duplex DNA, G4s are formed via Hoogsteen base pairing and are very stable and compact DNA structures. Failure of untangling them in the cell impedes DNA-based transactions and leads to genome instability. Cells have evolved highly specific helicases to resolve G4 structures. We used a recombinant nuclear form of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 to characterize Pif1-mediated DNA unwinding with a substrate mimicking an ongoing lagging strand synthesis stalled by G4s, which resembles a replication origin and a G4-structured flap in Okazaki fragment maturation. We find that the presence of G4 may greatly stimulate the Pif1 helicase to unwind duplex DNA. Further studies reveal that this stimulation results from G4-enhanced Pif1 dimerization, which is required for duplex DNA unwinding. This finding provides new insights into the properties and functions of G4s.

An interesting concept put forward in recent years is that G4s may determine the precise position and efficiency of the replication start sites.

A further study has shown that it is a G4 structure, but not the poly(G) sequence, that contributes to the directionality of replication forks (36.Valton A.L. Hassan-Zadeh V. Lema I. Boggetto N. Alberti P. Saintomé C. Riou J.F. Prioleau M.N. G4 motifs affect origin positioning and efficiency in two vertebrate replicators.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 732-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that G4s are structural elements determining or activating replication origins. However, how G4s act to influence origin usage remains completely unknown. Here, we report that G4s can significantly stimulate helicase-catalyzed duplex DNA unwinding when they are present at a stalled replication fork, upstream of a replication origin, and in a flap in the Okazaki fragment. This finding may broaden our understanding of the properties and functions of G4s. The phenomenon that G4 DNA activates Pif1 helicase and enhances its duplex unwinding may thus be biologically meaningful. The activation mechanism by G4 could be used to rapidly rescue the stalled leading strand, helping the replicator recognize and activate the replication origin, as well as to quickly remove a G4-structured flap in the Okazaki fragment that is immune to cleavage by nucleases FEN1/Dna2. All chemicals were reagent grade, and all buffers were prepared in high quality deionized water from a Milli-Q ultrapure water purification system (Millipore) having resistivity greater than 18.2 megohms/cm. All chemicals were from Sigma, except for TMPyP4 which was purchased from Merck. The DNA substrates used in the unwinding, binding, and dynamic light scattering were purchased from Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Their structures and sequences are shown in TABLE 1, TABLE 2. The protein trap used for single-turnover kinetic experiments was 56-nt poly(dT) (dT56). All synthetic oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE before storage in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA at −20 °C. Concentrations of single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically based on extinction coefficients calculated by the nearest neighbor method.TABLE 1DNA substrates used in DNA binding assayDNA nameStructure and sequence (5′ to 3′)G4FaF is fluorescein.-TGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG4-control (21-nucleotide ssDNA)F-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCATGGGa F is fluorescein.

A 2 μm working stock solution of G4-containing DNA or G4/duplex DNA was prepared by mixing equal concentrations of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) containing 100 mm KCl, followed by heating to 95 °C. After equilibrating for 5 min, annealing was allowed by slow cooling to room temperature. The quality of the resulting DNA substrates was inspected by native-PAGE and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. DNA concentration was further determined by absorbance of 260 nm light using a Smart Spec 3000 UV spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). The DNA substrates were stored at −20 °C. The nuclear form of yeast Pif1 (amino acids 40–859) expression vector was a generous gift from V. Zakian and was expressed according to Boule and Zakian (37.Boulé J.B. Zakian V.A. The yeast Pif1p DNA helicase preferentially unwinds RNA DNA substrates.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5809-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly, a pET28 vector (Novagen) was transformed into the BL21 Rosetta Escherichia coli strain, and cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of ∼0.6 and then incubated overnight with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol). The cells were sonicated and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Prior to loading on the Ni2+-charged IMAC column (GE Healthcare), the samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The protein was eluted from the Ni2+ affinity column by running a gradient from 20 to 500 mm imidazole in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The eluted protein was dialyzed against SP buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% glycerol) and was loaded on a Source SP column (GE Healthcare), The protein was eluted with a 5-column volume gradient (SP buffer containing 1 m NaCl) and was further purified by gel filtration with Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. The final purified protein is 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and was stored at −80 °C. The purified Pif1 exhibits equivalent unwinding rate and amplitude as the studies reported previously (37.Boulé J.B. Zakian V.A.

To produce the ATPase activity-deficient mutant, the conserved glutamic acid at position 303 in the ATP hydrolysis motif II (DEIS) was mutated to alanine and resulting mutant of Pif1E303A. The point mutation was constructed using recombinant PCR, with the desired mutations introduced in the internal mutagenic primers (forward E303A, 5′-ttggttgtcgatgcaatatcaatgt, and reverse E303A, 5′-acattgatattgcatcgacaaccaa). To ensure that only the desired mutation was introduced, the PCR portions were sequenced with the dideoxy-DNA sequencing method. The procedure of the expression and purification of the mutant Pif1E303A are essentially the same as wild-type protein. The stopped-flow assays were carried out using a Bio-Logic SFM-400 mixer with a 1.5 × 1.5-mm cell (FC-15, Bio-Logic), and the Bio-Logic MOS450/AF-CD optical system was equipped with a 150-watt mercury-xenon lamp (39.Zhang X.D.

Fluorescein was excited at 492 nm (2-nm slit width), and its emission was monitored at 525 nm using a high pass filter with a 20-nm bandwidth (D525/20; Chroma Technology Co.). Unwinding kinetics were measured in a two-syringe mode, where Pif1 helicase and DNA substrates were preincubated at 25 °C in syringe 1 for 5 min, and ATP with or without protein trap were in syringe 4. Each syringe contained unwinding reaction buffer, and the unwinding reaction was initiated by rapid mixing. All concentrations listed are after mixing unless noted otherwise. For converting the output data from volts to percentage unwinding, a calibration experiment was performed in a four-syringe mode, where helicase in syringe 1, hexachlorofluorescein-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides in syringe 2, and fluorescein-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides in syringe 3 were incubated in unwinding reaction buffer, and the solution in syringe 4 was the same as in the above unwinding experiment. The fluorescent signal of the mixed solution from the four syringes corresponded to 100% unwinding. All of the solutions were filtered and extensively degassed immediately before they were used. The stopped-flow temperature was controlled by means of an external thermostated water bath (Ministat 125; Huber) and a high flux pump to circulate the water between the bath and the stopped-flow apparatus. The standard reaction was usually performed with 2 nm DNA substrates and 80 nm Pif1 in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) at 25 °C. All stopped-flow kinetic traces were an average of over 10 individual traces. The kinetic traces were analyzed using Bio-Kine (version 4.26; Bio-Logic). To determine the step size with the n-step sequential model (40.Lucius A.L. Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M.

B. 2007; 111: 13600-13610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the single-turnover unwinding data curves are fit with Equation 1, A(t)=A(1−∑r=0nkobsr−1tr−1(r−1)!e−kobst)(Eq. 1) where A(t) represents the unwinding amplitude as a function of time; A is the total unwinding amplitude, and kobs is the unwinding rate constant. Pif1-mediated single-turnover DNA unwinding with excess of enzyme over DNA substrate was analyzed according to Reaction 1, H+DNAs⇄k−1k1H⋅DNAs→kcat2ssDNA where H and ssDNA designate helicase and unwound single-stranded DNA, respectively. The conservation relationship for DNA substrate can be written as shown in Equation 2, [DNA]tot=[DNA]+[H⋅DNA]+[ssDNA](Eq. 2) where [DNA]tot represents the total concentration of DNA. We use a steady-state fluorescence anisotropy binding assay to determine Pif1 binding activity (60.Dou S.X. Wang P.Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. The DNA binding properties of the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding processes were analyzed according to Reaction 2, [Pif1]+[DNA]⇄konkoff[Pif1−DNA]complex when the binding reaction has achieved equilibrium, the equilibrium dissociation constant is shown in Equation 3, Kd=koffkon(Eq. 3) The determined isothermal binding curves were fit by a fractional saturation function shown in Equation 4, y~=ΔγΔγmax(Eq. 4) where γ represents measured binding signal (γ is anisotropy signal in this study); Δγ = γcomplex − γDNA, free designs the binding capacity at a different concentration of protein; Δγmax = γcomplex, saturation − γDNA, free designs the maximum binding capacity. Then the binding fraction function is shown in Equation 5, y~=ΔγΔγmax=[Pif1]Kd+[Pif1](Eq. 5) If the binding curve is in sigmoidal shape, the curve can be fit by Hill Equation 6: y~=ΔγΔγmax=[Pif1]nKd+[Pif1]n(Eq. 6) where n is Hill coefficient, describing cooperativity. If n > 1, it indicates that more than one DNA can bind to the enzyme. The isothermal binding curves were determined by fluorescence polarization assay using Infinite F200 (TECAN). Fluorescein-labeled DNA substrates were used in this study. Varying amounts of protein were added to a 150-μl aliquot of binding buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT) containing 5 nm labeled DNA. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate in solution for 5 min, after which fluorescence polarization was measured. A second reading was taken after 10 min, to ensure that the mixture was well equilibrated. Less than 5% change was observed between the 5- and 10-min measurements, indicating that equilibrium was reached in 5 min. The equilibrium dissociation constant was determined by fitting the data to the saturation fraction Equation 5 or the Hill Equation 6 using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Experiments were performed according to Kozlov and Lohman (42.Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Stopped-flow studies of the kinetics of single-stranded DNA binding and wrapping around the Escherichia coli SSB tetramer.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with some modifications by the same stopped-flow equipment as mentioned above. The fluorescence emission from FAM was monitored using a 525 nm interference filter (Oriel). All slit widths were 2 mm. The binding solutions (buffer A) were put on ice and then incubated in the reservoir syringes of the stopped-flow instrument at 25 °C for at least 5 min prior to mixing. Longer equilibration times had no effect on the results. For the reversible protein-DNA binding kinetic, we analyze the kinetics time course according to Reaction 3, P+D→k1PD+P→k2DP2 All kinetic traces used in the fluorescence represent an average of 10 individual traces. Where applicable, the fluorescence time courses were fit to either single or two exponentials using Origin8.0 software according to Equation 7, F(t)=F∞+∑i=1nAiexp(−kobs,it)(Eq. 7) where F(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t; F∞ is the fluorescence intensity at infinite time; Ai is the amplitude of the ith binding process; kobs, i is the observed rate characterizing the ith binding process, and n = 1 or 2. Single cysteine mutant (A197C) phosphate-binding protein (PBP) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (43.Okoh M.P. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

It was then conjugated to the fluorophore N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)-ethyl]-7-diethylamino) coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC) in the presence of a coupled enzymatic phosphate mop composed of 0.2 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase with 200 μm 7-methylguanosine and purified as described previously (43.Okoh M.P.

The labeled protein (PBP-MDCC) after purification had a 280:430 nm absorbance ratio of 1.6, indicating the majority of the PBP was labeled. PBP-MDCC displayed a 6-fold increase in fluorescence emission at 465 nm upon binding inorganic phosphate (Pi). Stopped-flow kinetic measurements of ATP hydrolysis were performed according to Fischer et al. (44.Fischer C.J. Saha A. Cairns B.R.

https://openalex.org/W3125281424,"Cooperation is central to human existence, forming the bedrock of everyday social relationships and larger societal structures. Thus, understanding the psychological underpinnings of cooperation is of both scientific and practical importance. Recent work using a dual-process framework suggests that intuitive processing can promote cooperation while deliberative processing can undermine it. Here we add to this line of research by more specifically identifying deliberative and intuitive processes that affect cooperation. To do so, we applied automated text analysis using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to investigate the association between behavior in one-shot anonymous economic cooperation games and the presence inhibition (a deliberative process) and positive emotion (an intuitive process) in free-response narratives written after (Study 1, N = 4,218) or during (Study 2, N = 236) the decision-making process. Consistent with previous results, across both studies inhibition predicted reduced cooperation while positive emotion predicted increased cooperation (even when controlling for negative emotion). Importantly, there was a significant interaction between positive emotion and inhibition, such that the most cooperative individuals had high positive emotion and low inhibition. This suggests that inhibition (i.e., reflective or deliberative processing) may undermine cooperative behavior by suppressing the prosocial effects of positive emotion."
https://openalex.org/W2091822691,"This work has studied for the first time the structure and diversity of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) infesting olive orchard soils in a wide-region in Spain that included 92 locations. It aims at determining which agronomical or environmental factors associated to the olive orchards are the main drivers of the PPNs community structure and diversity. Classical morphological and morphometric identification methods were used to determine the frequency and densities of PPNs. Thirteen families, 34 genera and 77 species of PPNs were identified. The highest diversity was found in Helicotylenchus genus, with six species previously reported in Spain and with H. oleae being a first report. Neodolichorhynchus microphasmis and Diptenchus sp., Diphtherophora sp., and Discotylenchus sp., usually considered fungal feeders, were also reported for the first time associated to olive rhizosphere. PPNs abundance ranged from 66 to 16,288 individuals/500-cm3 of soil with Helicotylenchus digonicus being the most prevalent species, followed by Filenchus sp., Merlinius brevidens and Xiphinema pachtaicum. Nematode abundance and diversity indexes were influenced by olive cultivar, and orchard and soil management practices; while olive variety and soil texture were the main factors driving PPN community composition. Soil physicochemical properties and climatic characteristics most strongly associated to the PPN community composition included pH, sand content and exchangeable K, and maximum and minimum average temperature of the sampled locations. Our data suggests that there is a high diversity of PPNs associated to olive in Southern Spain that can exert different damage to olive roots depending on the olive variety and their abundance. Further analysis to determine the resistance levels of most common olive varieties to the prevalent PPNs in Spain will help to choose the most appropriate ones for the establishment of new plantations. This choice will take into consideration the specific soils and environments where those olive varieties will be established."

Oral gavage with glucose or injection with insulin decreased Rdh1 and Rdh10 mRNA 50% or greater in mouse liver. Removing serum from the medium of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 increased Rdh10 and Rdh16 (human Rdh1 ortholog) mRNA expression 2–3-fold by 4 h, by increasing transcription and stabilizing mRNA. Insulin decreased Rdh10 and Rdh16 mRNA in HepG2 cells incubated in serum-free medium by inhibiting transcription and destabilizing mRNA. Insulin action required PI3K and Akt, which suppress FoxO1. Serum removal increased atRA biosynthesis 4-fold from retinol in HepG2 cells, whereas dominant-negative FoxO1 prevented the increase.

https://openalex.org/W2127982600,"Objective In China, policy and social taboo prevent unmarried adolescents from accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. Research is needed to determine the SRH needs of highly disadvantaged groups, such as adolescent female sex workers (FSWs). This study describes SRH knowledge, contraception use, pregnancy, and factors associated with unmet need for modern contraception among adolescent FSWs in Kunming, China. Methods A cross-sectional study using a one-stage cluster sampling method was employed to recruit adolescents aged 15 to 20 years, and who self-reported having received money or gifts in exchange for sex in the past 6 months. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered by trained peer educators or health workers. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine correlates of low knowledge and unmet need for modern contraception. Results SRH knowledge was poor among the 310 adolescents surveyed; only 39% had heard of any long-acting reversible contraception (implant, injection or IUD). Despite 98% reporting not wanting to get pregnant, just 43% reported consistent condom use and 28% currently used another form of modern contraception. Unmet need for modern contraception was found in 35% of adolescents, and was associated with having a current non-paying partner, regular alcohol use, and having poorer SRH knowledge. Past abortion was common (136, 44%). In the past year, 76% had reported a contraception consultation but only 27% reported ever receiving SRH information from a health service. Conclusions This study demonstrated a low level of SRH knowledge, a high unmet need for modern contraception and a high prevalence of unintended pregnancy among adolescent FSWs in Kunming. Most girls relied on condoms, emergency contraception, or traditional methods, putting them at risk of unwanted pregnancy.

K14-HPV16 transgenic mice expressing the HPV16 early genes in squamous epithelial cells provide a suitable experimental model for studying these diseases. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in regulating gene expression and have been suggested to play an important role in cancer development. The role of miR-155 in cancer remains controversial and there is limited evidence linking this miRNA to HPV- associated diseases. We hypothesized that miR-155 expression modulates each tissue's susceptibility to develop HPV-associated carcinogenesis. In this study, we analyzed miR-155 expression in ear and chest skin samples from 22-26 weeks old, female K14-HPV16 transgenic (HPV16+/-) and wild-type (HPV-/-) mice. Among wild-type mice the expression of miR-155 was lower in ear skin compared with chest skin (p = 0.028). In transgenic animals, in situ carcinoma was present in all ear samples whereas chest tissues only showed epidermal hyperplasia. Furthermore, in hyperplastic chest skin samples, miR-155 expression was lower than in normal chest skin (p = 0,026). These results suggest that miR-155 expression may modulate the microenvironmental susceptibility to cancer development and that high miR155 levels may be protective against the carcinogenesis induced by HPV16."
https://openalex.org/W2031277936,"Thermospermine acts in negative regulation of xylem differentiation and its deficient mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, acaulis5 (acl5), shows excessive xylem formation and severe dwarfism. Studies of two dominant suppressors of acl5, sac51-d and sac52-d, have revealed that SAC51 and SAC52 encode a transcription factor and a ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10), respectively, and these mutations enhance translation of the SAC51 mRNA, which contains conserved upstream open reading frames in the 5’ leader. Here we report identification of SAC53 and SAC56 responsible for additional suppressors of acl5. sac53-d is a semi-dominant allele of the gene encoding a receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) homolog, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. sac56-d represents a semi-dominant allele of the gene for RPL4. We show that the GUS reporter activity driven by the CaMV 35S promoter plus the SAC51 5’ leader is reduced in acl5 and restored by sac52-d, sac53-d, and sac56-d as well as thermospermine. Furthermore, the SAC51 mRNA, which may be a target of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, was found to be stabilized in these ribosomal mutants and by thermospermine. These ribosomal proteins are suggested to act in the control of uORF-mediated translation repression of SAC51, which is derepressed by thermospermine."
https://openalex.org/W2094260855,"Acting on the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), glucocorticoids are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases. However, glucocorticoid resistance often leads to suboptimal asthma control. Since glucocorticoid-induced gene expression contributes to glucocorticoid activity, the aim of this study was to use a 2×glucocorticoid response element (GRE) reporter and glucocorticoid-induced gene expression to investigate approaches to combat cytokine-induced glucocorticoid resistance. Pre-treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) or interleukin-1β inhibited dexamethasone-induced mRNA expression of the putative anti-inflammatory genes RGS2 and TSC22D3, or just TSC22D3, in primary human airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells, respectively. Dexamethasone-induced DUSP1 mRNA was unaffected. In human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, dexamethasone-induced TSC22D3 and CDKN1C expression (at 6 h) was reduced by TNF pre-treatment, whereas DUSP1 and RGS2 mRNAs were unaffected. TNF pre-treatment also reduced dexamethasone-dependent 2×GRE reporter activation. This was partially reversed by PS-1145 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor VIII, inhibitors of IKK2 and JNK, respectively. However, neither inhibitor affected TNF-dependent loss of dexamethasone-induced CDKN1C or TSC22D3 mRNA. Similarly, inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, phosphoinositide 3-kinase or protein kinase C pathways failed to attenuate TNF-dependent repression of the 2×GRE reporter. Fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate and budesonide were full agonists relative to dexamethasone, while GSK9027, RU24858, des-ciclesonide and GW870086X were partial agonists on the 2×GRE reporter. TNF reduced reporter activity in proportion with agonist efficacy. Full and partial agonists showed various degrees of agonism on RGS2 and TSC22D3 expression, but were equally effective at inducing CDKN1C and DUSP1, and did not affect the repression of CDKN1C or TSC22D3 expression by TNF. Finally, formoterol-enhanced 2×GRE reporter activity was also proportional to agonist efficacy and functionally reversed repression by TNF. As similar effects were apparent on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression, the most effective strategy to overcome glucocorticoid resistance in this model was addition of formoterol to high efficacy NR3C1 agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1966157183,"Kandinsky proposed a correspondence theory that suggests associations between specific colors and shapes (i.e., circle-blue, square-red, triangle-yellow). Makin and Wuerger tested the theory using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and did not find clear evidence for Kandinsky's color-shape associations among British participants. In the present study, we first replicated the previous study among Japanese participants and found similar results to those of Makin and Wuerger, showing little support for Kandinsky's theory. In the subsequent experiment, we tested another set of color-shape associations that had been revealed by using an explicit matching method (circle-red, square-blue, triangle-yellow) in Japanese participants. The IAT tests showed that response times were significantly faster when circle-red, square-blue, and triangle-yellow combinations were mapped onto the same response key, rather than different key combinations, indicating that these color-shape combinations were encoded. These results provide the first empirical evidence that color-shape associations can be measured by indirect behavioral methods, and in particular, Japanese people's color-shape associations (circle-red, square-blue, triangle-yellow) can be observed by both direct and indirect experimental methods."
https://openalex.org/W1985280014,"Type 1A diabetes (T1D) is believed to be caused by immune-mediated destruction of β-cells, but the immunological basis for T1D remains controversial. Microbial diversity promotes the maturation and activation of certain immune subsets, including CD161bright CD8+ mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and alterations in gut mucosal responses have been reported in type 1 diabetics (T1Ds). We analyzed T cell populations in peripheral blood leukocytes from juvenile T1Ds and healthy controls. We found that proportion and absolute number of MAIT cells were similar between T1Ds and controls. Furthermore, while MAIT cell proportions increased with age among healthy controls, this trend was not observed among long-standing T1Ds. Additionally, the CD27- MAIT cell subset is significantly increased in T1Ds and positively correlated with HbA1c levels. However, after T1Ds are stratified by age, the younger group has significantly increased proportions of CD27- MAIT cells compared to age-matched controls, and this proportional increase appears to be independent of HbA1c levels. Finally, we analyzed function of the CD27- MAIT cells and observed that IL-17A production is increased in CD27- compared to CD27+ MAIT cells. Overall, our data reveal disparate MAIT cell dynamics between T1Ds and controls, as well as signs of increased MAIT cell activation in T1Ds. These changes may be linked to hyperglycemia and increased mucosal challenge among T1Ds."
https://openalex.org/W2068383765,"Cyclic nucleotide-sensitive ion channels are molecular pores that open in response to cAMP or cGMP, which are universal second messengers. Binding of a cyclic nucleotide to the carboxyterminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) of these channels is thought to cause a conformational change that promotes channel opening. The C-linker domain, which connects the channel pore to this CNBD, plays an important role in coupling ligand binding to channel opening. Current structural insight into this mechanism mainly derives from X-ray crystal structures of the C-linker/CNBD from hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels. However, these structures reveal little to no conformational changes upon comparison of the ligand-bound and unbound form. In this study, we take advantage of a recently identified prokaryote ion channel, SthK, which has functional properties that strongly resemble cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and is activated by cAMP, but not by cGMP. We determined X-ray crystal structures of the C-linker/CNBD of SthK in the presence of cAMP or cGMP. We observe that the structure in complex with cGMP, which is an antagonist, is similar to previously determined HCN channel structures. In contrast, the structure in complex with cAMP, which is an agonist, is in a more open conformation. We observe that the CNBD makes an outward swinging movement, which is accompanied by an opening of the C-linker. This conformation mirrors the open gate structures of the Kv1.2 channel or MthK channel, which suggests that the cAMP-bound C-linker/CNBD from SthK represents an activated conformation. These results provide a structural framework for better understanding cyclic nucleotide modulation of ion channels, including HCN and CNG channels."

In addition to the conventional global transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300) that binds to the HIF-α transactivation domain, a new group of transcription coactivators called the coiled-coil coactivators (CCCs) interact directly with the second PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domain of ARNT (ARNT PAS-B). These less studied transcription coactivators play essential roles in the HIF-dependent hypoxia response, and CCC misregulation is associated with several forms of cancer.

Under normal situations, these coactivators play an essential role in the hypoxia response by directly interacting with the ARNT subunit in a promoter-specific way. However, misregulation by overexpression or activating fusions caused by chromosomal translocations (e.g. FGF receptor-TACC3) is sufficient for transformation and is associated with the development of glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and other cancers (11.Singh D.

To investigate the molecular details of the HIF·CCC complex, we first characterized the structure of minimal interacting fragments of ARNT·TACC3 using x-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy. We previously reported that ARNT PAS-B utilizes its Fα-helix as the main interface to directly bind to the C terminus of TACC3 in vitro (6.Partch C.L. Gardner K.H. Coactivators necessary for transcriptional output of the hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF, are directly recruited by ARNT PAS-B.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7739-7744Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, crystal structures solved in this study directly demonstrate that the β-sheet of ARNT PAS-B serves as the TACC3-binding site. Subsequent solution NMR measurements reveal that the HIF-2α PAS-B β-sheet also binds to the TACC3 C terminus. Based on these observations, we generated a ternary complex model of ARNT PAS-B·TACC3·HIF-2α PAS-B that is supported by several lines of experimental data. The cooperative formation of a ternary complex among TACC3, ARNT PAS-B, and HIF-2α PAS-B described here could shed light on the general mechanism of the CCC protein recruitment in HIF signaling and provide a structural framework to inform future anti-cancer therapies. For bacterial expression, human ARNT PAS-B domain (356–470) and mutants were cloned into the pHis-parallel (12.Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z.

Human HIF-2α PAS-B domain (240–350) and mutants were cloned into pHis-parallel vector and pGST-parallel vector. Mouse TACC3(585–631) was cloned into pGST-parallel vector. GCN4-TACC3-CT was made by fusing Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4 residues 264–281 (14.Greenfield N.J. Montelione G.T. Farid R.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E.

GCN4-TACC3-CT was cloned into the pHisGβ1-parallel vector. Proteins were expressed from BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs) grown in LB or M9 minimal media (supplemented with 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 37 °C and induced with 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.7. After overnight growth at 20 °C, cells were harvested by spinning at 4 °C, 4700 × g for 40 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer and stored at −80 °C. Purification was conducted using affinity chromatography (nickel-Sepharose high performance or glutathione-Sepharose 4B, GE Healthcare). Affinity tags (GST, His, or HisGβ1) were cleaved by His6-tobacco etch virus protease overnight at 4 °C, followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare). NMR experiments were performed in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 17 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% D2O. For pulldown experiments, 5 μm purified His-ARNT PAS-B and 8–15 μm TACC3 were incubated with 15 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with buffer before elution. Eluted protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue stain. Single crystals of ARNT PAS-B·GCN4-TACC3-CT D622A/E629A were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 1.0 m succinic acid (pH 6.5), in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 17 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer. Drops containing 2 μl of 2.5 mg/ml ARNT PAS-B·GCN4-TACC3-CT D622A/E629A (molar ratio = 1:2) were mixed with 0.7 μl 1.0 m succinic acid (pH 6.5) (reservoir solution) and 0.3 μl 30% sorbitol (additive). Crystals were observed within 2 days and reached maximum size within 1 week at 20 °C. The crystals exhibited C2 space group symmetry with cell dimensions of a = 116.85 Å, b = 59.82 Å, c = 73.51 Å, and β = 97.85°, contained two molecules of ARNT PAS-B and one molecule of GCN4-TACC3-CT D622A/E629A per asymmetric unit, and diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing (dmin) of 3.15 Å when exposed to synchrotron radiation. The ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3-CT·HIF-2α PAS-B R247E structure was obtained under a different condition. The ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3 heterodimer protein complex was formed by mixing equal volumes of 300 μm ARNT PAS-B E362R with 300 μm of the TACC3 disulfide Cys-621–Cys-621 cross-linked dimer. The ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3 heterodimer and HIF-2α PAS-B R247E protein were further purified separately by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 17 mm NaCl. The final ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3·HIF-2α PAS-B R247E sample was formed by mixing equimolar amounts of all proteins and concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration device (Millipore) to 8 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystals of ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3-CT·HIF-2α PAS-B R247E were grown using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method from drops containing 0.2 μl of protein (8 mg/ml) and 0.2 μl of reservoir solution (1.6 m MgSO4, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5)) and equilibrated over reservoir solution at 20 °C. Cryoprotection was performed by transferring the crystals to a final solution of 1.6 m MgSO4, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 20% ethylene glycol, and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The crystals exhibited P41212 space group symmetry with cell dimensions of a = 96.14 Å, c = 182.84 Å, contained two molecules of ARNT PAS-B E362R, two molecules of TACC3 S-S-linked dimer, and one molecule of HIF-2α PAS-B R247E per asymmetric unit, and diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing (dmin) of 3.20 Å when exposed to synchrotron radiation.

Two copies of ARNT PAS-B were located in the asymmetric unit, and inspection of the electron density maps revealed density corresponding to the coiled-coil domain, which was initially modeled as a pair of idealized polyalanine helices. Identification of the inter-helical disulfide bond allowed accurate assignment of GCN4-TACC3 density for residues 595–626. Refinement was performed to a resolution of 3.15 Å with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints using the program Phenix (18.Afonine P.V. Mustyakimov M. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Moriarty N.W. Langan P. Adams P.D. Joint x-ray and neutron refinement with phenix.refine.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The final refinement included two ARNT PAS-B monomers (excluding extended loop residues 447–454) and one TACC3 homodimer (modeling residues 595–625 of monomer C and residues 596–626 of monomer D). The Rwork is 0.247 and the Rfree is 0.272. A Ramachandran plot generated with MolProbity (19.Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S.

Phases for ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3-CT·HIF-2α PAS-B R247E crystals were also obtained via molecular replacement with Phaser. PAS domain search models were constructed from the previously determined ARNT PAS-B E362R·HIF-2α PAS-B R247E heterodimer coordinates (PDB code 3F1O (20.Scheuermann T.H. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Guo Y. Bruick R.K. Gardner K.H. Artificial ligand binding within the HIF2α PAS-B domain of the HIF2 transcription factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)) by removal of N- and C-terminal residues 356–361 and 448–453 from ARNT PAS-B E362R, and residues 236–242 and 345–349 from HIF-2α PAS-B R247E. The search model for the TACC3 domain was derived from residues 595 to 609 of the ARNT PAS-B·GCN4-TACC3-CT D622A/E629A structure, with all residues converted to alanine. Two copies of ARNT PAS-B E362R and two copies of the TACC3-CT homodimer were located in the unit cell. Inspection of these initial electron density maps revealed density corresponding to additional helical density at both the N and C termini of the TACC3-CT. Phases were further improved by density modification with 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging in the program Parrot (21.Cowtan K. Recent developments in classical density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) resulting in a figure-of-merit of 0.745. A model containing 92.7% of all residues in the two TACC3 domains was automatically generated in the program Buccaneer (22.Cowtan K. The Buccaneer software for automated model building. 1. Tracing protein chains.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1002-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). The inter-helical disulfide bond used to confirm the register of the helices was observed in one TACC3 homodimer (chains E and F) but was reduced in the second homodimer (chains B and C). Inspection of electron density maps after rigid body refinement of the ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3 heterodimer using Phenix revealed unmodeled density suggestive of another PAS domain. Identification of this as the HIF-2α PAS-B R247E domain (and not the ARNT PAS-B E364R) was confirmed via the statistics from molecular replacement in Phaser and inspection of kicked omit maps following refinement in Phenix. Additional residues for ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3·HIF-2α PAS-B R247E were manually modeled in the programs O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Improved methods for building protein models in electron density maps and the location of errors in these models.Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) and Coot (24.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17064) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed to a resolution of 3.20 Å using the program Phenix with a random 10% of all data set aside for an Rfree calculation. Noncrystallographic symmetry averaging and reference model restraints were used in initial rounds of refinement but were removed once the Rfree dropped below 0.30, and the geometry was stabilized. Because of the low resolution of the data, grouped isotropic as well as TLS atomic displacement parameters were refined. Mean atomic displacement parameters were 43.1–56.4 Å2 for the domains of the ARNT PAS-B E362R·TACC3 heterodimer and 83.3 Å2 for the HIF-2α PAS-B R247E domain. The current model contains two ARNT PAS-B E362R monomers (excluding extended loop residues 449–451 for monomer A and residue 450 of monomer D); two TACC3 homodimers, including residues 582–631 of monomers B, E, and F, and residues 582–629 of monomer C; one monomer of HIF-2α PAS-B R247E, including residues 239–344; and two sulfate anions. The final Rwork and Rfree values are 0.231 and 0.270. A Ramachandran plot generated with Molprobity indicated that 97.5% of all protein residues are in the most favored regions, and 0.2% (one residue) in the disallowed regions. A complete summary of phasing and model refinement statistics for both complexes are provided in Table 1. MST experiments were conducted using a Monolith NT.115 (NanoTemper). ARNT PAS-B E362R was labeled with the blue fluorescent dye NT-495-NHS using a vendor-supplied kit (NanoTemper) and buffer exchanged to the assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 17 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Titrations were conducted with a constant 500 nm fluorophore-labeled ARNT PAS-B (ARNT PAS-B E362R-fluor) against up to 500 μm titrant in standard coated capillaries. Each data point was measured in triplicate. Single-site fitting was done by NanoTemper data analysis software. For bimodal MST data, a fitting model for the formation of ABB complexes was constructed in a Python script. The script uses a numerical method to determine the concentrations of all possible (macroscopic) species as follows: free A, free B, AB, and ABB. The overall thermophoretic signal (f) was considered to be a linear combination of the signals of the detectable species, f(B), f(AB), and f(ABB) (21.Cowtan K. Recent developments in classical density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The two B-binding sites were constrained to have identical microscopic binding affinities, meaning that the macroscopic binding constant of the formation of the ABB complex was 4-fold higher than that for the formation of the AB complex. NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Varian 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shift assignments of ARNT PAS-B and HIF-2α PAS-B were used as established previously (25.Erbel P.J.

All NMR data were processed with NMRpipe/NMRDraw (27.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11527) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRViewJ (Version 9.0.0, One Moon Scientific). Heat maps of peak broadening and PRE effects on the ARNT PAS-B and HIF-2α PAS-B crystal structures were generated by PyMOL (Version 1.5.0.3, Schrödinger, LLC). PRE was measured by comparing the backbone amide proton transverse (1HN T2) relaxation rates under paramagnetic and diamagnetic conditions. These relaxation rates were determined using a modified 15N/1H TROSY-HSQC experiment with delay times of 6.5, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 26 ms. Rates were calculated using NMRViewJ (Version 9.0.0, One Moon Scientific). Paramagnetic labeling with (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) or (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-yl) carbamidoethyl methanethiosulfonate (CMTSL) (Toronto Research Chemicals) at a specific cysteine site of target protein was conducted by incubating protein and spin label at a 1:2 molar ratio under a nonreducing condition and rotating overnight at room temperature. Labeled protein was purified by gel filtration through a Superdex 75 column. A diamagnetic control was generated by adding 10-fold sodium dithionite to the labeled protein and purging with N2(g) for 30 min to quench the spin label. A TACC3 C-terminal peptide (residues 585–631) was modeled using Rosetta (28.de Vries S.J. van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. The HADDOCK web server for data-driven biomolecular docking.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) as a parallel coiled-coil dimer based on the GCN4-TACC3-CT crystal structure (determined above).

Docking and refining were done following the default parameters, including semiflexible simulated annealing of all proteins in the 200 lowest intermolecular energy solutions and refinement in explicit water.

Long range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing are usually used for genotyping CYP2D6 duplication/multiplications and identification, but are labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. Methods We developed a simple allele quantification-based Pyrosequencing genotyping method that facilitates CYP2D6 copy number variation (CNV) genotyping while also identifying allele-specific CYP2D6 CNV in heterozygous samples. Most routine assays do not identify the allele containing a CNV. A total of 237 clinical and Coriell DNA samples with different known CYP2D6 gene copy numbers were genotyped for CYP2D6 *2, *3, *4, *6, *10, *17, *41 polymorphisms and CNV determination. Results The CYP2D6 gene allele quantification/identification were determined simultaneously with CYP2D6*2, *3, *4, *6, *10, *17, *41 genotyping. We determined the exact CYP2D6 gene copy number, identified which allele had the duplication or multiplication, and assigned the correct phenotype and activity score for all samples. Conclusions Our method can efficiently identify the duplicated CYP2D6 allele in heterozygous samples, determine its copy number in a fraction of time compared to conventional methods and prevent incorrect ultrarapid phenotype calls. It also greatly reduces the cost, effort and time associated with CYP2D6 CNV genotyping."

In this study, we examined the cardiac expression of the CCK gene in adult mammals and its expression at the protein level. Using quantitative PCR, a library of sequence-specific pro-CCK assays, peptide purification, and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the mammalian heart expresses pro-CCK in amounts comparable to natriuretic prohormones and processes it to a unique, triple-sulfated, and N-terminally truncated product distinct from intestinal and cerebral CCK peptides. Isoprenaline rapidly stimulated cardiac CCK gene expression in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that the cardiac-specific truncated pro-CCK may have pathophysiological relevance as a new marker of heart failure.

Mutagenesis of apoM glutamine 22 to alanine (apoMQ22A) introduces a functional signal peptidase cleavage site. Expression of apoMQ22A in ABCA1-expressing HEK293 cells resulted in the formation of smaller nascent HDL particles compared with wild type apoM (apoMWT). When apoMQ22A was expressed in vivo, using recombinant adenoviruses, smaller plasma HDL particles and decreased plasma S1P and apoM were observed relative to expression of apoMWT. Hepatocytes isolated from both apoMWT- and apoMQ22A-expressing mice displayed an equivalent increase in cellular levels of S1P, relative to LacZ controls; however, relative to apoMWT, apoMQ22A hepatocytes displayed more rapid apoM and S1P secretion but minimal apoMQ22A bound to nascent lipoproteins. Pharmacologic inhibition of ceramide synthesis increased cellular sphingosine and S1P but not medium S1P in both apoMWT and apoMQ22A hepatocytes. We conclude that apoM secretion is rate-limiting for hepatocyte S1P secretion and that its uncleaved signal peptide delays apoM trafficking out of the cell, promoting formation of larger nascent apoM- and S1P-enriched HDL particles that are probably precursors of larger apoM/S1P-enriched plasma HDL.

https://openalex.org/W2083753436,"In this report, we describe a strategy for the optimized selection of protein targets suitable for drug development against neoplastic diseases taking the particular case of breast cancer as an example. We combined human interactome and transcriptome data from malignant and control cell lines because highly connected proteins that are up-regulated in malignant cell lines are expected to be suitable protein targets for chemotherapy with a lower rate of undesirable side effects. We normalized transcriptome data and applied a statistic treatment to objectively extract the sub-networks of down- and up-regulated genes whose proteins effectively interact. We chose the most connected ones that act as protein hubs, most being in the signaling network. We show that the protein targets effectively identified by the combination of protein connectivity and differential expression are known as suitable targets for the successful chemotherapy of breast cancer. Interestingly, we found additional proteins, not generally targeted by drug treatments, which might justify the extension of existing formulation by addition of inhibitors designed against these proteins with the consequence of improving therapeutic outcomes. The molecular alterations observed in breast cancer cell lines represent either driver events and/or driver pathways that are necessary for breast cancer development or progression. However, it is clear that signaling mechanisms of the luminal A, B and triple negative subtypes are different. Furthermore, the up- and down-regulated networks predicted subtype-specific drug targets and possible compensation circuits between up- and down-regulated genes. We believe these results may have significant clinical implications in the personalized treatment of cancer patients allowing an objective approach to the recycling of the arsenal of available drugs to the specific case of each breast cancer given their distinct qualitative and quantitative molecular traits."
https://openalex.org/W1983061944,"Objective In this prospective, longitudinal study of young children, we examined whether a history of preschool generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and/or social phobia is associated with amygdala-prefrontal dysregulation at school-age. As an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether distinct anxiety disorders differ in the patterns of this amygdala-prefrontal dysregulation. Methods Participants were children taking part in a 5-year study of early childhood brain development and anxiety disorders. Preschool symptoms of generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and social phobia were assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) in the first wave of the study when the children were between 2 and 5 years old. The PAPA was repeated at age 6. We conducted functional MRIs when the children were 5.5 to 9.5 year old to assess neural responses to viewing of angry and fearful faces. Results A history of preschool social phobia predicted less school-age functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral prefrontal cortices to angry faces. Preschool generalized anxiety predicted less functional connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal prefrontal cortices in response to fearful faces. Finally, a history of preschool separation anxiety predicted less school-age functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral prefrontal cortices to angry faces and greater school-age functional connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal prefrontal cortices to angry faces. Conclusions Our results suggest that there are enduring neurobiological effects associated with a history of preschool anxiety, which occur over-and-above the effect of subsequent emotional symptoms. Our results also provide preliminary evidence for the neurobiological differentiation of specific preschool anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1963976166,"Age-related hearing loss (AHL), or presbycusis, is the most common sensory disorder among the elderly. We used C57BL/6J mice as an AHL model to determine a possible association between AHL and a high-fat diet (HFD).Forty C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a control or HFD group. Each group was divided into the following subgroups: 1-, 3-, 5- and 12-month groups (HFD, n = 5/subgroup; control, n = 5/subgroup). Nine CBA/N-slc mice were also used as a 12-month control (n = 5) or 12-month HFD (n = 4) group. The mice were fed a HFD or normal (control) diet throughout this study. Hearing function was evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 12 months using auditory evoked brainstem responses (ABRs). Spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) were also counted.The elevation of ABR thresholds (at 4 and 32 kHz) at 3 and 5 months was significantly suppressed in the HFD group compared with the control groups for C57BL/6J mice. After 12 months, the elevation of ABR thresholds was significantly suppressed in the HFD group at all frequencies for C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, CBA/N-slc mice displayed opposite outcomes, as ABR thresholds at all frequencies at 12 months were significantly elevated in the HFD group compared with the control group. For the C57BL/6J mice at 12 months, SGC numbers significantly decreased in all parts of the cochleae in the control group compared with the HFD groups. In contrast, for the CBA/N-slc mice, SGC numbers significantly decreased, particularly in the upper parts of the cochleae in the HFD group compared with the control groups.The elevation in ABR thresholds and SGC loss associated with aging in the HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice were significantly suppressed compared with those in the normal diet-fed mice. These results suggest that HFD delays AHL progression in the C57B/6J mice."
https://openalex.org/W2115108897,"The European Union and other states are moving towards Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management to balance food production and security with wider ecosystem concerns. Fishing is only one of several sectors operating within the ocean environment, competing for renewable and non-renewable resources that overlap in a limited space. Other sectors include marine mining, energy generation, recreation, transport and conservation. Trade-offs of these competing sectors are already part of the process but attempts to detail how the seas are being utilised have been primarily based on compilations of data on human activity at large spatial scales. Advances including satellite and shipping automatic tracking enable investigation of factors influencing fishers’ choice of fishing grounds at spatial scales relevant to decision-making, including the presence or avoidance of activities by other sectors. We analyse the determinants of English and Welsh scallop-dredging fleet behaviour, including competing sectors, operating in the eastern English Channel. Results indicate aggregate mining activity, maritime traffic, increased fishing costs, and the English inshore 6 and French 12 nautical mile limits negatively impact fishers’ likelihood of fishing in otherwise suitable areas. Past success, net-benefits and fishing within the 12 NM predispose fishers to use areas. Systematic conservation planning has yet to be widely applied in marine systems, and the dynamics of spatial overlap of fishing with other activities have not been studied at scales relevant to fisher decision-making. This study demonstrates fisher decision-making is indeed affected by the real-time presence of other sectors in an area, and therefore trade-offs which need to be accounted for in marine planning. As marine resource extraction demands intensify, governments will need to take a more proactive approach to resolving these trade-offs, and studies such as this will be required as the evidential foundation for future seascape planning."

Functional studies have revealed that the NH2-terminal region is involved in the activation and termination of Ca2+ release. The three-dimensional structure of the NH2-terminal region has recently been solved. It is composed of three domains (A, B, and C). However, the roles of these individual domains in Ca2+ release activation and termination are largely unknown. To understand the functional significance of each of these NH2-terminal domains, we systematically deleted these domains and assessed their impact on caffeine- or Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) in HEK293 cells. We found that all deletion mutants were capable of forming caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive functional channels, indicating that the NH2-terminal region is not essential for channel gating. Ca2+ release measurements revealed that deleting domain A markedly reduced the threshold for SOICR termination but had no effect on caffeine or Ca2+ activation or the threshold for SOICR activation, whereas deleting domain B substantially enhanced caffeine and Ca2+ activation and lowered the threshold for SOICR activation and termination. Conversely, deleting domain C suppressed caffeine activation, abolished Ca2+ activation and SOICR, and diminished protein expression. These results suggest that domain A is involved in channel termination, domain B is involved in channel suppression, and domain C is critical for channel activation and expression.

Results The median overall survival was 21.88 months in D3P arm and 13.67 months in M3P arm (P = 0.0011, hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.86). Subgroup analysis was consistent with the results of overall analysis. Events progression-free survival (pain, PSA, tumor and disease) were significantly improved in D3P arm compared with M3P arm. PSA response rate was 35.11% for patients treated by D3P arm and 19.39% for M3P arm (P = 0.0155). Pain response rate was higher in D3P arm (61.11%, P = 0.0011) than in M3P (23.08%) arm. No statistical differences were found between D3P arm and M3P arm for QoL, tumor response rate and response duration of PSA and pain. The tolerability and overall safety of D3P arm were generally comparable to that of M3P arm. Conclusions Compared with M3P arm, D3P arm significantly prolonged overall survival for the Chinese patients with mCRPC and improved the response rate for PSA and pain.

https://openalex.org/W2126005470,"We propose and mathematically examine a theory of calcium profile formation in unwounded mammalian epidermis based on: changes in keratinocyte proliferation, fluid and calcium exchange with the extracellular fluid during these cells’ passage through the epidermal sublayers, and the barrier functions of both the stratum corneum and tight junctions localised in the stratum granulosum. Using this theory, we develop a mathematical model that predicts epidermal sublayer transit times, partitioning of the epidermal calcium gradient between intracellular and extracellular domains, and the permeability of the tight junction barrier to calcium ions. Comparison of our model’s predictions of epidermal transit times with experimental data indicates that keratinocytes lose at least 87% of their volume during their disintegration to become corneocytes. Intracellular calcium is suggested as the main contributor to the epidermal calcium gradient, with its distribution actively regulated by a phenotypic switch in calcium exchange between keratinocytes and extracellular fluid present at the boundary between the stratum spinosum and the stratum granulosum. Formation of the extracellular calcium distribution, which rises in concentration through the stratum granulosum towards the skin surface, is attributed to a tight junction barrier in this sublayer possessing permeability to calcium ions that is less than 15 nm s−1 in human epidermis and less than 37 nm s−1 in murine epidermis. Future experimental work may refine the presented theory and reduce the mathematical uncertainty present in the model predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2055741819,"Cryptococcus neoformans is the commonest cause of fungal meningitis, with a substantial mortality despite appropriate therapy. Quantitative culture of cryptococci in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during antifungal therapy is of prognostic value and has therapeutic implications, but is slow and not practicable in many resource-poor countries.We piloted two rapid techniques for quantifying viable cryptococci using mixtures of live and heat-killed cryptococci cultured in vitro: (i) quantitative microscopy with exclusion staining using trypan blue dye, and (ii) flow cytometry, using the fluorescent dye 2'-7'-Bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM). Results were compared with standard quantitative cryptococcal cultures. Quantitative microscopy was also performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.Both microscopy and flow cytometry distinguished between viable and non-viable cryptococci. Cell counting (on log scale) by microscopy and by quantitative culture were significantly linearly associated (p<0.0001) and Bland-Altman analysis showed a high level of agreement. Proportions of viable cells (on logit scale), as detected by flow cytometry were significantly linearly associated with proportions detected by microscopy (p<0.0001) and Bland-Altman analysis showed a high level of agreement.Direct microscopic examination of trypan blue-stained cryptococci and flow-cytometric assessment of BCECF-AM-stained cryptococci were in good agreement with quantitative cultures. These are promising strategies for rapid determination of the viability of cryptococci, and should be investigated in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2091307037,"With the exception of ApoE4, genome-wide association studies have failed to identify strong genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, despite strong evidence of heritability, suggesting that many low penetrance genes may be involved. Additionally, the nature of the identified genetic risk factors and their relation to disease pathology is also largely obscure. Previous studies have found that a cancer-associated variant of the cell cycle inhibitor gene p21cip1 is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this study was to confirm this association and to elucidate the effects of the variant on protein function and Alzheimer-type pathology. We examined the association of the p21cip1 variant with Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease with dementia. The genotyping studies were performed on 719 participants of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing, 225 participants of a Parkinson’s disease DNA bank, and 477 participants of the Human Random Control collection available from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. The post mortem studies were carried out on 190 participants. In the in-vitro study, human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with either the common or rare p21cip1 variant; and cytometry was used to assess cell cycle kinetics, p21cip1 protein expression and sub-cellular localisation. The variant was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease with dementia, relative to age matched controls. Furthermore, the variant was associated with an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer’s disease, and a more severe phenotype, with a primary influence on the accumulation of tangle pathology. In the in-vitro study, we found that the SNPs reduced the cell cycle inhibitory and anti-apoptotic activity of p21cip1. The results suggest that the cancer-associated variant of p21cip1 may contribute to the loss of cell cycle control in neurons that may lead to Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration."

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrums proved that Ac- had intercalated into LDH structure. X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed that the intercalation spacing and platelet thickness of Mg and Al layered double hydroxide containing Ac- anions (Mg/Al-Ac- LDH) had been enlarged due to substitution of divalent CO32- anions by a larger quantity of monovalent Ac– anions. Differential scanning calorimetry tests testified that the insoluble Mg2/Al-Ac- LDH evidently decreased the freeze point (FP) of water to -10.68°C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed that the Ac- were strongly confined by the metal layers of LDHs. FP test of asphalt mixtures confirmed that Mg/Al-Ac- LDHs reduced FP to -5.5°C. Immersion test results indicated that Mg/Al-Ac- LDH had a good deicing durability and Ac- did not released from asphalt mixture. Snow melting observation was conducted further testified that Mg/Al-Ac- LDH melted snow or ice sustainably."
https://openalex.org/W2007411198,"Background Despite being a major public health problem, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains underdiagnosed, and only 2.4% COPD patients are aware of their disease in Korea. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COPD detected by spirometry performed as a preoperative screening test and to determine the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) group distribution and self-awareness of COPD. Methods We reviewed the medical records of adults (age, ≥40 years) who had undergone spirometry during preoperative screening between April and August 2013 at a tertiary hospital in Korea. COPD was defined as a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio of <0.7. We analyzed self-administered COPD questionnaires for the assessment of the frequency of acute exacerbation over the previous year and dyspnea severity using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and COPD assessment test. Results Among 3029 patients aged >40 years who had undergone spirometry as a preoperative screening test, 474 (15.6%; 404 men; median age, 70 years; range, 44–93 years) were diagnosed with COPD. Only 26 (5.5%) patients reported previous diagnosis of COPD (2.1%), emphysema (0.8%), or chronic bronchitis (2.5%). The GOLD group distribution was as follows: 63.3% in group A, 31.2% in group B, 1.7% in group C, and 3.8% in group D. Conclusions The prevalence of COPD diagnosed by preoperative spirometry was 15.6%, and only 5.5% patients were aware of their disease. Approximately one-third of the COPD patients belonged to GOLD groups B, C, and D, which require regular treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2082131880,"Recent in vivo experiments suggest that in the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, the cue for the localization of the small sporulation protein, SpoVM, an essential factor in spore coat formation, is curvature of the bacterial plasma membrane. In vitro measurements of SpoVM adsorption to vesicles of varying sizes also find high sensitivity of adsorption to vesicle radius. This curvature-dependent adsorption is puzzling given the orders of magnitude difference in length scale between an individual protein and the radius of curvature of the cell or vesicle, suggesting protein clustering on the membrane. Here we develop a minimal model to study the relationship between curvature-dependent membrane adsorption and clustering of SpoVM. Based on our analysis, we hypothesize that the radius dependence of SpoVM adsorption observed in vitro is governed primarily by membrane tension, while for in-vivo localization of SpoVM, we propose a highly sensitive mechanism for curvature sensing based on the formation of macroscopic protein clusters on the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2133692751,"We showed previously that active PKC-α maintains F0F1-ATPase activity, whereas inactive PKC-α mutant (dnPKC-α) blocks recovery of F0F1-ATPase activity after injury in renal proximal tubules (RPTC). This study tested whether mitochondrial PKC-α interacts with and phosphorylates F0F1-ATPase. Wild-type PKC-α (wtPKC-α) and dnPKC-α were overexpressed in RPTC to increase their mitochondrial levels, and RPTC were exposed to oxidant or hypoxia. Mitochondrial levels of the γ-subunit, but not the α- and β-subunits, were decreased by injury, an event associated with 54% inhibition of F0F1-ATPase activity. Overexpressing wtPKC-α blocked decreases in γ-subunit levels, maintained F0F1-ATPase activity, and improved ATP levels after injury. Deletion of PKC-α decreased levels of α-, β-, and γ-subunits, decreased F0F1-ATPase activity, and hindered the recovery of ATP content after RPTC injury. Mitochondrial PKC-α co-immunoprecipitated with α-, β-, and γ-subunits of F0F1-ATPase. The association of PKC-α with these subunits decreased in injured RPTC overexpressing dnPKC-α. Immunocapture of F0F1-ATPase and immunoblotting with phospho(Ser) PKC substrate antibody identified phosphorylation of serine in the PKC consensus site on the α- or β- and γ-subunits. Overexpressing wtPKC-α increased phosphorylation and protein levels, whereas deletion of PKC-α decreased protein levels of α-, β-, and γ-subunits of F0F1-ATPase in RPTC. Phosphoproteomics revealed phosphorylation of Ser146 on the γ subunit in response to wtPKC-α overexpression. We concluded that active PKC-α 1) prevents injury-induced decreases in levels of γ subunit of F0F1-ATPase, 2) interacts with α-, β-, and γ-subunits leading to increases in their phosphorylation, and 3) promotes the recovery of F0F1-ATPase activity and ATP content after injury in RPTC.

https://openalex.org/W2074089419,"Purpose To evaluate the effect of trabecular thickness and trabecular separation on modulating the trabecular architecture of the mandibular bone in ovariectomized rats. Materials and Methods Fourteen 12-week-old adult female Wistar rats were divided into an ovariectomy group (OVX) and a sham-ovariectomy group (sham). Five months after the surgery, the mandibles from 14 rats (seven OVX and seven sham) were analyzed by micro-CT. Images of inter-radicular alveolar bone of the mandibular first molars underwent three-dimensional reconstruction and were analyzed. Results Compared to the sham group, trabecular thickness in OVX alveolar bone decreased by 27% (P = 0.012), but trabecular separation in OVX alveolar bone increased by 59% (P = 0.005). A thickness and separation map showed that trabeculae of less than 100μm increased by 46%, whereas trabeculae of more than 200μm decreased by more than 40% in the OVX group compared to those in the sham group. Furthermore, the OVX separation of those trabecular of more than 200μm was 65% higher compared to the sham group. Bone mineral density (P = 0.028) and bone volume fraction (p = 0.001) were also significantly decreased in the OVX group compared to the sham group. Conclusions Ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mandibular bone may be related to the distributional variations in trabecular thickness and separation which profoundly impact the modulation of the trabecular architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2079077232,"Hippocampal atrophy is observed with ageing and age-related neurodegenerative disease. Identification of the genetic correlates of hippocampal volume (HV) and atrophy may assist in elucidating the mechanisms of ageing and age-related neurodegeneration. Using two community cohorts of older Caucasians we estimated the heritability of HV and examined associations of HV with previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition we undertook genome-association studies (GWAS) examining HV and HV atrophy. Participants were community-dwelling non-demented older adults from the longitudinal Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS) (N = 498) and the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) (N = 351) aged 65 and over. HV was measured using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Heritability of HV was estimated in OATS. Genome-wide genotyping was imputed using the 1K Genomes reference set. Associations with HV-candidate and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related SNPs were investigated. A GWAS examining HV (in both cohorts) and an exploratory GWAS of HV atrophy over two years (in Sydney MAS only) were also undertaken. HV heritability was estimated at 62–65%. The previously identified GWAS HV SNP (rs6581612) and the candidate BDNF SNP (rs6265) were nominally significant (p = 0.047 and p = 0.041 respectively). No AD-related SNPs, including the APOE ε4 polymorphism, were significant. No significant results were observed for either of the GWAS undertaken. Despite our estimate of a high heritability of HV, our results are consistent with a highly polygenic model suggesting that SNPs identified from prior studies, including GWAS meta-analyses, can be difficult to replicate in smaller samples of older adults."
https://openalex.org/W1974324385,"Background Bipolar disorder types I (BD I) and II (BD II) behave differently in clinical manifestations, normal personality traits, responses to pharmacotherapies, biochemical backgrounds and neuroimaging activations. How the varied emotional states of BD I and II are related to the comorbid personality disorders remains to be settled. Methods We therefore administered the Plutchick – van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), the Hypomanic Checklist-32 (HCL-32), and the Parker Personality Measure (PERM) in 37 patients with BD I, 34 BD II, and in 76 healthy volunteers. Results Compared to the healthy volunteers, patients with BD I and II scored higher on some PERM styles, PVP, MDQ and HCL-32 scales. In BD I, the PERM Borderline style predicted the PVP scale; and Antisocial predicted HCL-32. In BD II, Borderline, Dependant, Paranoid (-) and Schizoid (-) predicted PVP; Borderline predicted MDQ; Passive-Aggressive and Schizoid (-) predicted HCL-32. In controls, Borderline and Narcissistic (-) predicted PVP; Borderline and Dependant (-) predicted MDQ. Conclusion Besides confirming the different predictability of the 11 functioning styles of personality disorder to BD I and II, we found that the prediction was more common in BD II, which might underlie its higher risk of suicide and poorer treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2064499525,"The main objective of this paper is to decompose the productivity growth of Egyptian cotton production. We employ the stochastic frontier approach and decompose the changes in total factor productivity (CTFP) growth into four components: technical progress (TP), changes in scale component (CSC), changes in allocative efficiency (CAE), and changes in technical efficiency (CTE). Considering a situation of scarce statistical information, we propose four alternative empirical models, with the purpose of looking for convergence in the results. The results provide evidence that in this production system total productivity does not increase, which is mainly due to the negative average contributions of CAE and TP. Policy implications are offered in light of the results."
https://openalex.org/W2023460495,"Epistasis describes the phenomenon that mutations at different loci do not have independent effects with regard to certain phenotypes. Understanding the global epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories. Current knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited by the technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic relations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis to simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations. Specifically, we looked at gene-gene epistatic interactions, where the mutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis tends to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting conditions, indicating that selection might be less effective in removing deleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of epistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many epistatic interactions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable epistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas genes with condition-specific epistasis form a scale-free network. Furthermore, genes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas this co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific epistasis. Our findings provide a novel genome-wide picture about epistatic dynamics under environmental perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2003264997,"We propose the use of the Kramers-Moyal expansion in the analysis of third-order noise. In particular, we show how the approach can be applied in the theoretical study of option valuation. Despite Pawula’s theorem, which states that a truncated model may exhibit poor statistical properties, we show that for a third-order Kramers-Moyal truncation model of an option’s and its underlier’s price, important properties emerge: (i) the option price can be written in a closed analytical form that involves the Airy function, (ii) the price is a positive function for positive skewness in the distribution, (iii) for negative skewness, the price becomes negative only for price values that are close to zero. Moreover, using third-order noise in option valuation reveals additional properties: (iv) the inconsistencies between two popular option pricing approaches (using a “delta-hedged” portfolio and using an option replicating portfolio) that are otherwise equivalent up to the second moment, (v) the ability to develop a measure R of how accurately an option can be replicated by a mixture of the underlying stocks and cash, (vi) further limitations of second-order models revealed by introducing third-order noise."
https://openalex.org/W2091605758,"While spatially local interactions are ubiquitous between coevolving species sharing recourses (e.g., plant-insect interactions), their effects on such coevolution processes of strategies involving the share of a resource are still not clearly understood. We construct a two-dimensional spatial model of the coevolution of the proposer and responder species in the ultimatum game (UG), in which a pair of proposer and responder individuals at each site plays the UG. We investigate the effects of the locality of interactions and the intensity of selection on the emergence of fairness between these species. We show that the lower intensity of selection favors fair strategies in general, and there are no significant differences in the evolution of fairness between the cases with local and global interactions when the intensity of selection is low. However, as the intensity of selection becomes higher, the spatially local interactions contribute to the evolution of fairer strategies more than the global interactions, even though fair strategies become more difficult to evolve. This positive effect of spatial interactions is expected to be due to the mutual benefit of fairness for both proposer and responder species in future generations, which brings about a dynamic evolution process of fairness."
https://openalex.org/W1965254444,"Ever since the case of the missing heritability was highlighted some years ago, scientists have been investigating various possible explanations for the issue. However, none of these explanations include non-chromosomal genetic information. Here we describe explicitly how chromosomal and non-chromosomal modifiers collectively influence the heritability of a trait, in this case, the growth rate of yeast. Our results show that the non-chromosomal contribution can be large, adding another dimension to the estimation of heritability. We also discovered, combining the strength of LASSO with model selection, that the interaction of chromosomal and non-chromosomal information is essential in describing phenotypes."
