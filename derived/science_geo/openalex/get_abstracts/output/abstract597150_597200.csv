https://openalex.org/W2727917467,"While problems with cell line misidentification have been known for decades, an unknown number of published papers remains in circulation reporting on the wrong cells without warning or correction. Here we attempt to make a conservative estimate of this 'contaminated' literature. We found 32,755 articles reporting on research with misidentified cells, in turn cited by an estimated half a million other papers. The contamination of the literature is not decreasing over time and is anything but restricted to countries in the periphery of global science. The decades-old and often contentious attempts to stop misidentification of cell lines have proven to be insufficient. The contamination of the literature calls for a fair and reasonable notification system, warning users and readers to interpret these papers with appropriate care."
https://openalex.org/W2761880778,"UNAIDS has recently proposed a set of three ambitious targets that, if achieved, are predicted to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. The targets, known as 90-90-90, call for 90% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) to know their status, 90% of PLHIV to receive antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of those on antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression by the year 2020. We examine the first of these targets, focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, the region of the world most affected by HIV, to measure the proportion of PLHIV estimated to know their HIV status, and to identify background and behavioral characteristics significantly associated with gaps in ever testing among PLHIV.We analyze cross-sectional population-based data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS) fielded since 2010 in 16 sub-Saharan African countries where voluntary serological testing was recently conducted: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Survey response rates averaged 95.0% (range 89.3-99.5%), while consent to serotesting averaged 94.9% (range 88.7-99.6%). This study, which includes more than 14,000 respondents living with HIV, finds that 69% of PLHIV in the average study country have ever been tested for HIV (range 34-95%). Based on timing of the last test and on ART coverage, we estimate that 54% of PLHIV in the average country are aware of their status (range 26-84%). Adjusted logistic regression finds that men (median adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.38), adults with less than primary education (median AOR = 0.31), and adolescents (median AOR = 0.32) are consistently less likely to have ever been tested for HIV than women, adults with secondary and above education, and adults age 30-39, respectively. In most countries unadjusted logistic regression also finds significant gaps in testing among the poorest groups and those reporting never having had sex.The fact that an average of 54% of PLHIV in these 16 countries are estimated to know their status reflects encouraging progress. However, not only is this average far short of the 90% target set by UNAIDS for 2020, but it also implies that in the average study country nearly one-half of PLHIV are unable to access lifesaving care and treatment because they are unaware that they are HIV-positive. Several gaps in HIV testing coverage exist, particularly among adolescents, the least educated, and men. While the need to target demographic groups at greatest risk of HIV continues, additional interventions focused on reaching men and on reaching socially vulnerable populations such as adolescents, the poorest, and the least educated are essential."
https://openalex.org/W2761771810,"In terms of public health, childhood vaccination programs have benefits that far outweigh risks. However, some parents decide not to vaccinate their children. This paper explores the ways in which such parents talked about the perceived risks and benefits incurred by vaccinating (or not vaccinating) their children. Between 2013–2016 we undertook 29 in-depth interviews with non-vaccinating and/or ‘vaccine hesitant’ parents in Australia. Interviews were conducted in an open and non-judgmental manner, akin to empathic neutrality. Interviews focused on parents talking about the factors that shaped their decisions not to (or partially) vaccinate their children. All interviews were transcribed and analysed using both inductive and deductive processes. The main themes focus on parental perceptions of: 1. their capacity to reason; 2. their rejection of Western medical epistemology; and 3. their participation in labour intensive parenting practices (which we term salutogenic parenting). Parents engaged in an ongoing search for information about how best to parent their children (capacity to reason), which for many led to questioning/distrust of traditional scientific knowledge (rejection of Western medical epistemology). Salutogenic parenting spontaneously arose in interviews, whereby parents practised health promoting activities which they saw as boosting the natural immunity of their children and protecting them from illness (reducing or negating the perceived need for vaccinations). Salutogenic parenting practices included breastfeeding, eating organic and/or home-grown food, cooking from scratch to reduce preservative consumption and reducing exposure to toxins. We interpret our data as a ‘logic of care’, which is seen by parents as internally consistent, logically inter-related and inter-dependent. Whilst not necessarily sharing the parents’ reasoning, we argue that an understanding of their attitudes towards health and well-being is imperative for any efforts to engage with their vaccine refusal at a policy level."
https://openalex.org/W2762150897,"The prevalence of pathogenic bacteria acquiring multidrug antibiotic resistance is a global health threat to mankind. This has motivated a renewed interest in developing alternatives to conventional antibiotics including bacteriophages (viruses) as therapeutic agents. The bacterium Clostridium difficile causes colon infection and is particularly difficult to treat with existing antibiotics; phage therapy may offer a viable alternative. The punitive environment within the gastrointestinal tract can inactivate orally delivered phages. C. difficile specific bacteriophage, myovirus CDKM9 was encapsulated in a pH responsive polymer (Eudragit® S100 with and without alginate) using a flow focussing glass microcapillary device. Highly monodispersed core-shell microparticles containing phages trapped within the particle core were produced by in situ polymer curing using 4-aminobenzoic acid dissolved in the oil phase. The size of the generated microparticles could be precisely controlled in the range 80 μm to 160 μm through design of the microfluidic device geometry and by varying flow rates of the dispersed and continuous phase. In contrast to free ‘naked’ phages, those encapsulated within the microparticles could withstand a 3 h exposure to simulated gastric fluid at pH 2 and then underwent a subsequent pH triggered burst release at pH 7. The significance of our research is in demonstrating that C. difficile specific phage can be formulated and encapsulated in highly uniform pH responsive microparticles using a microfluidic system. The microparticles were shown to afford significant protection to the encapsulated phage upon prolonged exposure to an acid solution mimicking the human stomach environment. Phage encapsulation and subsequent release kinetics revealed that the microparticles prepared using Eudragit® S100 formulations possess pH responsive characteristics with phage release triggered in an intestinal pH range suitable for therapeutic purposes. The results reported here provide proof-of-concept data supporting the suitability of our approach for colon targeted delivery of phages for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2763917678,"Background Gallstones and kidney stones are known complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Risk factors have been insufficiently studied and explanatory studies date back up to 30 years. It remains unclear, whether improved treatment options also influenced risk factors for these complications. Objectives Identifying risk factors for gallstones and kidney stones in IBD patients. Methods Using data from the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study we assessed associations of diseases characteristics with gallstones and kidney stones in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Out of 2323 IBD patients, 104 (7.8%) Crohn’s disease (CD) and 38 (3.8%) ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed with gallstones. Significant risk factors for gallstones were diagnosis of CD, age at diagnosis, disease activity and duration, NSAID intake, extra-intestinal manifestations and intestinal surgery. Kidney stones were described in 61 (4.6%) CD and 30 (3.0%) UC patients. Male gender, disease activity, intestinal surgery, NSAID usage and reduced physical activity were significant risk factors. Hospitalization was associated with gallstones and kidney stones. The presence of gallstones increased the risk for kidney stones (OR 4.87, p<0.001). Conclusion The diagnosis of CD, intestinal surgery, prolonged NSAID use, disease activity and duration and bowel stenosis were significantly associated with cholecystonephrolithiasis in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2763166094,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors towards prostate cancer and its prevention. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of 625 fathers of students attending eight public schools. The self-administered questionnaire included questions on: socio-demographic characteristics, personal and familiar medical history of prostate cancer, knowledge about prostate cancer and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, perception of risk towards prostate cancer, perception of the benefits of having a PSA-test, willingness to receive the PSA-test and sources of and needs of information regarding prostate cancer and the PSA-test. Results 72.7% of respondents had heard about the PSA-test and 51.1% of those had heard about it through their physicians. This knowledge was higher: in men with older age, in those that had a higher level of education, in those who had a relative with prostrate problems or prostate cancer and in those with prostate problems. Perceived personal risk of contracting prostate cancer was associated with a higher level of education, in those who had received information about prostate cancer from a physician and in those with prostate problems. Only 29.6% of men had undergone a PSA-test and 59.4% were willing to do so in the future. The significant predictors of the willingness to receive a PSA-test were the belief that the PSA-test was useful, the perception of not very good personal health status, and need of additional information about the PSA-test. Conclusion Respondents have a moderate knowledge about prostate cancer and a good propensity to undergo the PSA-test. Therefore, it would be necessary to increase information on the risks of prostate cancer and the benefits of prostate cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2761156356,"Objectives Among different factors, diet patterns seem to be related to depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the consumption of fruits and/or vegetables and depressive symptoms. Methodology/Principal findings A secondary data analysis was conducted using information from a population-based survey from 25 regions from Peru. The outcome was the presence of depressive symptoms according to the Patient Health Questionnaire (cutoff ≥15 to define major depressive syndrome); whereas the exposure was the self-reported consumption of fruits and/or vegetables (in tertiles and using WHO recommendation ≥5 servings/day). The association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models controlling for the complex-sample survey design and potential confounders. Data from 25,901 participants were analyzed, mean age 44.2 (SD: 17.7) and 13,944 (54.0%) women. Only 910 (3.8%; 95%CI: 3.5%–4.2%) individuals reported consuming ≥5 servings of fruits and/or vegetables/day; whereas 819 (2.8%; 95%CI: 2.5%–3.1%) had depressive symptoms. Those in the lowest tertile of fruits and/or vegetables consumption had greater prevalence of depressive symptoms (PR = 1.88; 95%CI: 1.39–2.55) than those in the highest tertile. This association was stronger with fruits (PR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.46–2.53) than vegetables (PR = 1.42; 95%CI: 1.05–1.93) alone. Conclusions An inverse relationship between consumption of fruits and/or vegetables and depressive symptoms is reported. Less than 5% of subjects reported consuming the amount of fruits and vegetables recommended by the WHO. There is a need to implement strategies to promote better diet patterns with potential impact on mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2762383420,"In a world where millions of people are dependent on batteries to provide them with convenient and portable energy, battery recycling is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we developed a new method to sort 18650 Lithium-ion batteries in large quantities and in real time for harvesting used cells with enough capacity for battery reuse. Internal resistance and capacity tests were conducted as a basis for comparison with a novel degradation-based method based on X-ray radiographic scanning and digital image contrast computation. The test results indicate that the sorting accuracy of the test cells is about 79% and the execution time of our algorithm is at a level of 200 milliseconds, making our method a potential real-time solution for reusing the remaining capacity in good used cells."
https://openalex.org/W2761748022,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant enterococci (MDRE) and particularly vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is considered a serious health problem worldwide, causing the need for new antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to discover and characterize bacteriocin against clinical isolates of MDRE and VRE. Over 10,000 bacterial isolates from water, environment and clinical samples were screened. E. faecalis strain 478 isolated from human feces produced the highest antibacterial activity against several MDRE and VRE strains. The optimum condition for bacteriocin production was cultivation in MRS broth at 37°C, pH 5–6 for 16 hours. The bacteriocin-like substance produced from E. faecalis strain EF478 was stable at 60°C for at least 1 hour and retained its antimicrobial activity after storage at -20°C for 1 year, at 4°C for 6 months, and at 25°C for 2 months. A nano-HPLC electrospray ionization multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis showed that the amino acid sequences of the bacteriocin-like substance was similar to serine protease of E. faecalis, gi|488296663 (NCBI database), which has never been reported as a bacteriocin. This study reported a novel bacteriocin with high antibacterial activity against VRE and MDRE."
https://openalex.org/W2761402900,"Aim of the study was the development and validation of the psychometric properties of a six-item bi-factorial instrument for the assessment of social support (emotional and tangible support) with a population-based sample. A cross-sectional data set of N = 15,010 participants enrolled in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) in 2007-2012 was divided in two sub-samples. The GHS is a population-based, prospective, observational single-center cohort study in the Rhein-Main-Region in western Mid-Germany. The first sub-sample was used for scale development by performing an exploratory factor analysis. In order to test construct validity, confirmatory factor analyses were run to compare the extracted bi-factorial model with the one-factor solution. Reliability of the scales was indicated by calculating internal consistency. External validity was tested by investigating demographic characteristics health behavior, and distress using analysis of variance, Spearman and Pearson correlation analysis, and logistic regression analysis. Based on an exploratory factor analysis, a set of six items was extracted representing two independent factors. The two-factor structure of the Brief Social Support Scale (BS6) was confirmed by the results of the confirmatory factor analyses. Fit indices of the bi-factorial model were good and better compared to the one-factor solution. External validity was demonstrated for the BS6. The BS6 is a reliable and valid short scale that can be applied in social surveys due to its brevity to assess emotional and practical dimensions of social support."
https://openalex.org/W2762006445,"Conventionally, robot morphologies are developed through simulations and calculations, and different control methods are applied afterwards. Assuming that simulations and predictions are simplified representations of our reality, how sure can roboticists be that the chosen morphology is the most adequate for the possible control choices in the real-world? Here we study the influence of the design parameters in the creation of a robot with a Bayesian morphology-control (MC) co-optimization process. A robot autonomously creates child robots from a set of possible design parameters and uses Bayesian Optimization (BO) to infer the best locomotion behavior from real world experiments. Then, we systematically change from an MC co-optimization to a control-only (C) optimization, which better represents the traditional way that robots are developed, to explore the trade-off between these two methods. We show that although C processes can greatly improve the behavior of poor morphologies, such agents are still outperformed by MC co-optimization results with as few as 25 iterations. Our findings, on one hand, suggest that BO should be used in the design process of robots for both morphological and control parameters to reach optimal performance, and on the other hand, point to the downfall of current design methods in face of new search techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2763393332,"Although several computational modelling studies have investigated the conformational behaviour of inherently disordered protein (IDP) amylin, discrepancies in identifying its preferred solution conformations still exist between various forcefields and sampling methods used. Human islet amyloid polypeptide has long been a subject of research, both experimentally and theoretically, as the aggregation of this protein is believed to be the lead cause of type-II diabetes. In this work, we present a systematic forcefield assessment using one of the most advanced non-biased sampling techniques, Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST2), by comparing the secondary structure preferences of monomeric amylin in solution. This study also aims to determine the ability of common forcefields to sample a transition of the protein from a helical membrane bound conformation into the disordered solution state of amylin. Our results demonstrated that the CHARMM22* forcefield showed the best ability to sample multiple conformational states inherent for amylin. It is revealed that REST2 yielded results qualitatively consistent with experiments and in quantitative agreement with other sampling methods, however far more computationally efficiently and without any bias. Therefore, combining an unbiased sampling technique such as REST2 with a vigorous forcefield testing could be suggested as an important step in developing an efficient and robust strategy for simulating IDPs."
https://openalex.org/W2763697633,"The loss of unimproved grassland has led to species decline in a wide range of taxonomic groups. Agricultural intensification has resulted in fragmented patches of remnant grassland habitat both across Europe and internationally. The monitoring of remnant patches of this habitat is critically important, however, traditional surveying of large, remote landscapes is a notoriously costly and difficult task. The emergence of small-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) equipped with low-cost multi-spectral cameras offer an alternative to traditional grassland survey methods, and have the potential to progress and innovate the monitoring and future conservation of this habitat globally. The aim of this article is to investigate the potential of sUAS for rapid detection of threatened unimproved grassland and to test the use of an Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI). A sUAS aerial survey is undertaken at a site nationally recognised as an important location for fragmented unimproved mesotrophic grassland, within the south east of England, UK. A multispectral camera is used to capture imagery in the visible and near-infrared spectrums, and the ENDVI calculated and its discrimination performance compared to a range of more traditional vegetation indices. In order to validate the results of analysis, ground quadrat surveys were carried out to determine the grassland communities present. Quadrat surveys identified three community types within the site; unimproved grassland, improved grassland and rush pasture. All six vegetation indices tested were able to distinguish between the broad habitat types of grassland and rush pasture; whilst only three could differentiate vegetation at a community level. The Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI) was the most effective index when differentiating grasslands at the community level. The mechanisms behind the improved performance of the ENDVI are discussed and recommendations are made for areas of future research and study."
https://openalex.org/W2761980122,"Caries-associated biofilms induce loss of calcium from tooth surfaces in the presence of dietary carbohydrates. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) provide a matrix scaffold and an abundance of primary binding sites within biofilms. The role of EPS in binding calcium in cariogenic biofilms is only partially understood. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the calcium dissolution rates and calcium tolerance of caries-associated bacteria and yeast as well as to examine the properties of EPS to quantify its binding affinity for dissolved calcium. Calcium dissolution was measured by dissolution zones on Pikovskaya’s agar. Calcium tolerance was assessed by isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) by adding CaCl2 to the bacterial cultures. Acid-base titration and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to identify possible functional groups responsible for calcium binding, which was assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Lactobacillus spp. and mutans streptococci demonstrated calcium dissolution in the presence of different carbohydrates. All strains that demonstrated high dissolution rates also revealed higher rates of calcium tolerance by IMC. In addition, acidic functional groups were predominantly identified as possible binding sites for calcium ions by acid-base titration and FTIR. Finally, ITC revealed EPS to have a higher binding affinity for calcium compared, for example, to lactic acid. In conclusion, this study illustrates the role of EPS in terms of the calcium tolerance of cariogenic microbiota by determining the ability of EPS to control free calcium concentrations within the biofilms as a self-regulating mode of action in the pathogenesis of dental caries."
https://openalex.org/W2763620365,"Background Climate change is arguably a major threat to biodiversity conservation and there are several methods to assess its impacts on species potential distribution. Yet the extent to which different approaches on species distribution modeling affect species richness patterns at biogeographical scale is however unaddressed in literature. In this paper, we verified if the expected responses to climate change in biogeographical scale—patterns of species richness and species vulnerability to climate change—are affected by the inputs used to model and project species distribution. Methods We modeled the distribution of 288 vertebrate species (amphibians, birds and mammals), all endemic to the Amazon basin, using different combinations of the following inputs known to affect the outcome of species distribution models (SDMs): 1) biological data type, 2) modeling methods, 3) greenhouse gas emission scenarios and 4) climate forecasts. We calculated uncertainty with a hierarchical ANOVA in which those different inputs were considered factors. Results The greatest source of variation was the modeling method. Model performance interacted with data type and modeling method. Absolute values of variation on suitable climate area were not equal among predictions, but some biological patterns were still consistent. All models predicted losses on the area that is climatically suitable for species, especially for amphibians and primates. All models also indicated a current East-western gradient on endemic species richness, from the Andes foot downstream the Amazon river. Again, all models predicted future movements of species upwards the Andes mountains and overall species richness losses. Conclusions From a methodological perspective, our work highlights that SDMs are a useful tool for assessing impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Uncertainty exists but biological patterns are still evident at large spatial scales. As modeling methods are the greatest source of variation, choosing the appropriate statistics according to the study objective is also essential for estimating the impacts of climate change on species distribution. Yet from a conservation perspective, we show that Amazon endemic fauna is potentially vulnerable to climate change, due to expected reductions on suitable climate area. Climate-driven faunal movements are predicted towards the Andes mountains, which might work as climate refugia for migrating species."
https://openalex.org/W2760860036,"In the present study, we investigated the fumigant potential of five edible essential oils (EOs) against Sitophilus oryzae and their phytochemical residues in treated grains. Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil proved significantly effective (P ≤ 0.05) on S.oryzae at 400 μl/L air concentration, inducing 83 and 100% mortalities in with-food and without-food conditions respectively over 72 h exposure. In addition, it was also observed that the binary mixtures of peppermint + lemon oil (1:1 ratio) produced an equivalent effect to that of peppermint oil alone treatments. The phytochemical residue analysis by GC-MS revealed the presence of six compounds upon 72 h exposure to EOs. Further, the analysis of physico-chemical properties of the compounds indicated a positive correlation between polar surface area (PSA) and its residual nature. The residue levels of eugenol were significantly elevated corresponding to its high PSA value (29) in clove and cinnamon oils. On the other hand, the compounds with zero PSA value imparted very less or no (D-Limonene, caryophyllene, pinene and terpinolene) residues in treated grains. With respect to the most active peppermint oil, L-menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were at 67, 41 and 23% levels respectively. The outcome of the present study indicate the peppermint oil as a potent fumigant against S. oryzae, and although the residues of phytochemicals in treated grains is higher; they belong to the generally recognised as safe (GRAS) status leaving no harmful effect."
https://openalex.org/W2761538876,"The Late Cenozoic East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) enhancement has been attributed to several factors, such as uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, retreat of the Paratethys Sea, and global cooling related to polar ice volume increment. However, the fundamental forcing factors remain enigmatic due to the absence of long and continuous climate records and sensitive indicators. Here we reanalyzed the published grain-size record of Sikouzi fine sediments in the western Chinese Loess Plateau through end-member (EM) modeling. The results indicate that EM 2 with grain-size peaks between 10–100 μm decreased in content from 20.1 to 17 Ma and stepwise increased from 17 to 0.07 Ma during the following six stages (17–15 Ma, 15–12 Ma, 12–8 Ma, 8–6 Ma, 6–4 Ma and 4–0 Ma). Such varying trends can be successively correlated in seven stages with the integrated benthic δ18O record, implying that global warming weakened the EAWM from 20.1 to 17 Ma and global cooling has stepwise strengthened the EAWM since 17 Ma. Therefore, we conclude that global temperature change played a major role on the evolution of EAWM during the Neogene period. By contrast, Late Cenozoic palaeogeographic reorganization caused by uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and retreat of the Paratethys Sea contributed less to the evolutionary evolution of EAWM. Spectral analysis of the EM 2 data first provided direct evidence of orbitally influenced deposition in the study area and thus the EAWM variations during the Neogene period. The 100-kyr period became weak since ~10 Ma, possibly due to the decrease in sensitivity of a more stable, continental-scale ice sheet in Antarctica to local insolation forcing, deserving further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2763181681,"Djungarian hamsters are able to use spontaneous daily torpor (SDT) during the winter season as well as fasting-induced torpor (FIT) at any time of the year to cope with energetically challenging environmental conditions. Torpor is a state of severely reduced metabolism with a pronounced decrease in body temperature, which enables animals to decrease their individual energy requirements. Despite sharing common characteristics, such as reduced body mass before first torpor expression and depressed metabolism and body temperature during the torpid state, FIT and SDT differ in several physiological properties including torpor bout duration, minimal body temperature, fuel utilization and circadian organization. It remains unclear, whether SDT and FIT reflect the same phenomenon or two different physiological states. The hypothalamus has been suggested to play a key role in regulating energy balance and torpor. To uncover differences in molecular control mechanisms of torpor expression, we set out to investigate hypothalamic gene expression profiles of genes related to orexigenic (Agrp/Npy), circadian clock (Bmal1/Per1) and thyroid hormone (Dio2/Mct8) systems of animals undergoing SDT and FIT during different torpor stages. Orexigenic genes were mainly regulated during FIT and remained largely unaffected by SDT. Expression patterns of clock genes showed disturbed circadian clock rhythmicity in animals undergoing FIT, but not in animals undergoing SDT. During both, SDT and FIT, decreased Dio2 expression was detected, indicating reduced hypothalamic T3 availability in both types of torpor. Taken together, our results provide evidence that SDT and FIT also differ in certain central control mechanisms and support the observation that animals undergoing SDT are in energetical balance, whereas animals undergoing FIT display a negative energy balance. This should be carefully taken into account when interpreting data in torpor research, especially from animal models of fasting-induced hypometabolism such as mice."
https://openalex.org/W2761879531,"The gastrointestinal (GI) habitat of ruminant and non-ruminant animals sustains a vast ensemble of microbes that are capable of utilizing lignocellulosic plant biomass. In this study, an indigenous swine (Zovawk) and a domesticated goat (Black Bengal) were investigated to isolate bacteria having plant biomass degrading enzymes. After screening and enzymatic quantification of eighty-one obtained bacterial isolates, Serratia rubidaea strain DBT4 and Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus strain DBT87 were revealed as the most potent strains, showing both cellulase and xylanase production. A biomass utilization study showed that submerged fermentation (SmF) of D2 (alkaline pretreated pulpy biomass) using strain DBT4 resulted in the most efficient biomass deconstruction with maximum xylanase (11.98 U/mL) and FPase (0.5 U/mL) activities (55°C, pH 8). The present study demonstrated that bacterial strains residing in the gastrointestinal region of non-ruminant swine are a promising source for lignocellulose degrading microorganisms that could be used for biomass conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2763289491,"Objectives To determine the proportion of people with gout who self-report triggers of acute attacks; identify the commonly reported triggers, and examine the disease and demographic features associated with self-reporting any trigger(s) of acute attacks of gout. Methods Individuals with gout were asked to fill a questionnaire enquiring about triggers that precipitated their acute gout attacks. Binary logistic regression was used to compute odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to examine the association between having ≥1 self-reported trigger of acute gout and disease and demographic risk factors and to adjust for covariates. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA. Results 550 participants returned completed questionnaires. 206 (37.5%) reported at least one trigger of acute attacks, and less than 5% reported >2 triggers. Only 28.73% participants reported that their most recent gout attack was triggered by dietary or lifestyle risk factors. The most frequently self-reported triggers were alcohol intake (14.18%), red-meat or sea-food consumption (6%), dehydration (4.91%), injury or excess activity (4.91%), and excessively warm or cold weather (4.36% and 5.45%). Patients who had onset of gout before the age of 50 years were significantly more likely to identify a trigger for precipitating their acute gout attacks (aOR (95%CI) 1.73 (1.12–2.68) after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion Most people with gout do not identify any triggers for acute attacks, and identifiable triggers are more common in those with young onset gout. Less than 20% people self-reported acute gout attacks from conventionally accepted triggers of gout e.g. alcohol, red-meat intake, while c.5% reported novel triggers such as dehydration, injury or physical activity, and weather extremes."
https://openalex.org/W2762535262,"The aim of the study was to compare the effects of home visits with physical training and nutritional support on inflammatory parameters to home visits with social support alone within a randomized controlled trial. Prefrail and frail persons received home visits from lay volunteers twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants in the physical training and nutritional intervention group (PTN, n = 35) conducted two sets of six strength exercises and received nutritional support. The social support group (SoSu, n = 23) received visits only. TNF-α, IL-6, CRP, and total leukocyte count were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Changes over time within groups were analyzed with paired t-tests; differences between groups were analyzed with ANCOVA for repeated measurements. In the PTN group, IL-6 and CRP remained stable, whereas in the SoSu group, IL-6 increased significantly from a median value of 2.6 pg/l (min-max = 2.0-10.2) to 3.0 pg/l (min-max = 2.0-20.8), and CRP rose from 0.2 mg/dl (min-max = 0.1-0.9) to 0.3 mg/dl (min-max = 0.1-3.0) after 12 weeks. In CRP, a significant difference between groups was found. TNF-α and total leukocyte count did not change in either the PTN group or the SoSu group. Persons showing an increase in physical performance (OR 4.54; 95% CI = 1.33-15.45) were more likely to have constant or decreased IL-6 values than persons who showed no improvement. In conclusion, in non-robust older adults, a physical training and nutritional support program provided by lay volunteers can delay a further increase in some inflammatory parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2761143799,"Purpose The role of radiotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer is controversial. A benefit of additional radiotherapy is supported by some observations. A dose-effect relationship was recently found by dose escalation employing image guided and intensity modulated radiotherapy. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 28 consecutive patients, all with history of extensive prior therapies for unresectable locally advanced/ recurrent pancreatic cancer (LAPC/LRPC). Treatment was delivered by helical tomotherapy after daily position verification with computed tomography. Dose to the planned target volume (PTV) was 51 Gy, while the dose to the macroscopic tumor was escalated by a simultaneous integrated boost to a median cumulative dose of 66 Gy (60–66 Gy). Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mainly of capecitabine (n = 23). Results 10 of 28 patients presented acute toxicities > grade 2, one patient succumbed to gastrointestinal bleeding after treatment. No correlations of toxicities and dose volume histograms (DVH) of retrospectively delineated small bowel loops were observed, although average small bowel volume receiving ≥ 20 Gy was 374 ml. DVH analyses revealed a correlation of splenic parameters and acute toxicity: Vomiting, anorexia, dehydration, hematologic toxicity, fatigue, combined gastro-intestinal toxicity wit R-values between 0.392 and 0.561 (all p-values > 0.05). Only one patient developed late toxicities > grade 2. With an average follow-up time in surviving patients of 14 months median overall survival time was 19 months and median time to local recurrence 13 months. In 8 patients with available imaging of local recurrence: 5 in field recurrences, 2 marginal recurrences and one lymph node recurrence outside the high dose radiation field were observed. In univariate analysis only ΔCA-19-9 during radiotherapy was associated with local control (p = 0.029) and overall survival (p = 0.049). Conclusion Dose escalated normo-fractionated radiotherapy for LAPC/LRPC seems feasible and suitable to prolong local control and in consequence long-term survival. However, in-field local progression is still frequently observed and possibilities to increase the local effectiveness should be evaluated. Exposure of the spleen was predictive for acute toxicity and should be further investigated."

Programs are being put in place around the world to improve child development by providing healthy and stimulating environments for children. However, these programs often have limited reach and little is known about the prevalence of developmental delay in under-developed communities. The current study set-out to better understand the prevalence of developmental delay in rural communities in the Amazon region of Peru. Also, it explores social determinants that are associated with any delay. Cross-sectional study by evaluating developmental delay in children under 4 years utilizing Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Additionally, conducting a social determinants questionnaire answered by caretakers to identify social drivers for developmental delay. The data was analyzed with multi-variant analysis to measure association. The prevalence of developmental delay in the Amazonian communities was 26.7% (19.3% in communication, 11.4% in gross motor skills, 8% in both) (N = 596). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between developmental delay and; level of education (OR 0.64, p = 0.009), age of mother during child’s birth (OR 0.96, p = 0.002), visits by community health agents (OR 0.73, p = 0.013), and river as primary water source (OR 2.39, p = 0.001). The social determinants questionnaire revealed that 39% of the mothers had their first child before the age of 17, nearly half stopped going to school before the age of 12 (52%), 29% gave birth at home, 13% breast fed for less than 7 months, and 50% of the children had diarrhea in the last month. There is still a great need to improve the conditions for child development in the Amazon region of Peru. One-fourth of the children suffer from developmental delay, which will likely impede their potentials for life unless something is done. The impact of education, age of mother at birth of the child, community health agents, and access to clean drinking water were important findings. Improvements can be made in these areas to create a large, cost-effective impact on the well-being of the communities."
https://openalex.org/W2762297139,"To evaluate the incidence and associated risk factors of massive subretinal hemorrhage (SRH) in patients with retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP).A total of 187 eyes of 135 treatment-naıve patients diagnosed with RAP were evaluated retrospectively. Clinical records including the time between the initial visit, last anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, last stable examination, and the date of massive SRH were reviewed. Imaging findings including indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were analyzed.Massive SRH developed in 18 eyes (9.6%) a median of 20 months after the initial presentation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the incidence (2.8, 5.8, 13.1, and 21.0% after 1,2,5 and 10 years, respectively) continuously increased. Among 14 eyes with discernable vascular anastomosis on baseline ICGA, 13 (92.8%) showed retinal arteriole involvement. On spectral-domain OCT imaging of the last visit prior to the massive SRH, a layered lamellar tissue complex was noted under the retinal pigment epithelium in 9 of 13 eyes, which was significantly associated with massive SRH[hazard ratio(HR),5.883;P = .010]. The average time between the last stable examination/last injection and the massive SRH was 2 and 5 months, respectively. The patients were treated with anti-VEGF, gas and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator injection; however, all except one eye had visual acuity worse than 20/1000 at the final visit.Massive SRH can occur in RAP in the course of anti-VEGF treatment, resulting in severe vision loss. A proactive dosing regimen may be more appropriate for these RAP eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2760976608,"Flexor tendinopathy is a common problem affecting humans and animals. Tendon healing is poorly understood and the outcomes of conservative and surgical management are often suboptimal. While often considered a localized injury, recent evidence indicates that in the short term, tendinopathic changes are distributed widely throughout the tendon, remote from the lesion itself. Whether these changes persist throughout healing is unknown. The aim of this study was to document gene expression, histopathological and biomechanical changes that occur throughout the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) up to 16 weeks post-injury, using an ovine surgical model of tendinopathy. Partial tendon transection was associated with decreased gene expression for aggrecan, decorin, fibromodulin, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPS 1, 2 and 3), collagen I and collagen II. Gene expression for collagen III, lumican and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) increased locally around the lesion site. Expression of collagen III and MMP13 decreased with time, but compared to controls, collagen III, MMP13 and lumican expression remained regionally high throughout the study. An increase in TIMP3 was observed over time. Histologically, operated tendons had higher pathology scores than controls, especially around the injured region. A chondroid phenotype was observed with increased cellular rounding and marked proteoglycan accumulation which only partially improved with time. Biomechanically, partial tendon transection resulted in a localized decrease in elastic modulus (in compression) but only at 8 weeks postoperatively. This study improves our understanding of tendon healing, demonstrating an early ‘peak’ in pathology characterized by altered gene expression and notable histopathological changes. Many of these pathological changes become more localized to the region of injury during healing. Collagen III and MMP13 expression levels remained high close to the lesion throughout the study and may reflect the production of tendon tissue with suboptimal biomechanical properties. Further studies evaluating the long-term response of tendon to injury (6–12 months) are warranted to provide additional information on tendon healing and provide further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathology observed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2761836094,"The effects of warm machine perfusion preservation of liver grafts donated after cardiac death on the intracellular three-dimensional ultrastructure of the organelles in hepatocytes remain unclear. Here we analyzed comparatively the ultrastructure of the endomembrane systems in porcine hepatocytes under warm ischemia and successive hypothermic and midthermic machine perfusion preservation, a type of the warm machine perfusion. Porcine liver grafts which had a warm ischemia time of 60 minutes were perfused for 4 hours with modified University of Wisconsin gluconate solution. Group A grafts were preserved with hypothermic machine perfusion preservation at 8°C constantly for 4 hours. Group B grafts were preserved with rewarming up to 22°C by warm machine perfusion preservation for 4 hours. An analysis of hepatocytes after 60 minutes of warm ischemia by scanning electron microscope revealed the appearance of abnormal vacuoles and invagination of mitochondria. In the hepatocytes preserved by subsequent hypothermic machine perfusion preservation, strongly swollen mitochondria were observed. In contrast, the warm machine perfusion preservation could preserve the functional appearance of mitochondria in hepatocytes. Furthermore, abundant vacuoles and membranous structures sequestrating cellular organelles like autophagic vacuoles were frequently observed in hepatocytes after warm machine perfusion preservation. In conclusion, the ultrastructure of the endomembrane systems in the hepatocytes of liver grafts changed in accordance with the temperature conditions of machine perfusion preservation. In addition, temperature condition of the machine perfusion preservation may also affect the condition of the hepatic graft attributed to autophagy systems, and consequently alleviate the damage of the hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2762604828,"This study compared the effects of a carbohydrate–electrolyte–protein solution (CEPS, 2% protein plus 4% carbohydrate), carbohydrate–electrolyte solution (CES, 6% carbohydrate), and noncaloric sweetened placebo (PLA) on both 21-km running performance and cognitive function. Eleven female recreational endurance runners performed a 21-km time-trial running on three occasions, separated by at least 28 days. In a randomized cross-over design, they ingested CEPS, CES, or PLA at a rate of 150 mL every 2.5 km with no time feedback. A cognitive function test was performed before and after the run. Participants ingested approximately 24 g/h carbohydrate plus 12 g/h protein in CEPS trial, and 36 g/h carbohydrate in CES trial during each 21-km trial. Time to complete the time-trial was slightly shorter (P < 0.05) during CES (129.6 ± 8.8 min) than PLA (134.6 ± 11.5 min), with no differences between CEPS and the other two trials. The CEPS trial showed higher composite of visual motor speed than the PLA trial (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CES feedings might improve 21-km time-trial performance in female recreational runners compared with a PLA. However, adding protein to the CES provided no additional time-trial performance benefit. CEPS feeding during prolonged exercise could benefit visual motor speed compared to PLA alone, but no differences in the performance of the other cognitive function tests were found."
https://openalex.org/W2761389362,"Interleukin (IL) 1-ra is a potent endogenous competitive inhibitor of IL-α and β and has an anti-inflammatory role. Study objectives were: 1) to assess the associations of IL-1RN genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs419598) with generalized chronic periodontitis (GCP), generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP), and absence of periodontitis and 2) to assess its association with the load of five periodontopathogenic bacteria and periodontal clinical variables. A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted in 123 patients with GCP, 60 patients with GAgP, and 20 controls. Reverse hybridization PCR was used for genotyping analysis to detect SNPs in IL-1A (rs1800587), IL-1B (rs1143634), and IL-1RN (rs419598) genes and for determination of the load of five periodontopathogenic bacteria. The severity and extension of periodontitis were assessed. Multinomial logistic regression and mediated regression analyses were performed. Considering results for GCP and GAgP patients together, the presence of polymorphism in IL-1A and/or IL-1B gene was associated with a higher likelihood of periodontitis, (OR = 8.11; 95%CI [1.85-35.48]), but this likelihood was reduced when IL-1RN polymorphism was also present, (OR = 5.91; 95%CI [1.08-32.27]). IL-1RN polymorphism was significantly associated with lower counts of red complex bacteria, specifically Porphyromona gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia, which were associated with improved clinical outcomes. The polymorphic expression of IL-1RN (rs419598) gene may be associated with a reduced susceptibility to GAgP and GCP in populations of European descent. This effect may be mediated by a decreased load of Porphyromona gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia."

Factors that may affect the success rate of eye drop instillation were also evaluated. Design A prospective, observational study. Participants Seventy-eight glaucoma patients and 85 non-glaucoma volunteers were recruited in this study. Methods Open angle glaucoma patients with visual field defect as well as non-glaucoma volunteers were asked to video record their procedures of eye drop instillation using a 5-mL plastic bottle of artificial tear solution. Success of eye drop instillation was judged on video based on the first one drop of solution successfully applied on the cornea, by two investigators. Main outcome measures Success rate of eye drop instillation in glaucoma patients and non-glaucoma volunteers. Factors related to success rate of eye drop instillation, such as visual field defect and clinical characteristics, were also analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results No significant deference in mean age was observed between two groups (glaucoma: 64.5 ± 14.4 years, non-glaucoma: 60.9 ± 14.1 years, P = 0.1156). Success rate of eye drop instillation was significantly lower (P = 0.0215) in glaucoma patients (30/78; 38.5%) than in non-glaucoma volunteers (48/85; 56.5%). The most frequent reason of instillation failure in glaucoma patients was touching the bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, eyelid or eyelashes with the tip of the bottle (29.5%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified lower corrected visual acuity (VA) (≤ 1.0; odds ratio [OR] = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–0.93, P = 0.0411), lower mean deviation (MD) (< -12 dB; OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05–0.86, P = 0.0307) and visual field defect (VFD) in the inferior hemifield (OR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.02–0.34, P < 0.001) to be significantly related to instillation failure in glaucoma patients. Conclusions Success rate of eye drop instillation was significantly lower in glaucoma patients than in non-glaucoma volunteers. Corrected VA ≤ 1.0, MD < -12 dB and/or VFD in the inferior hemifield may be related to failure of eye drop instillation."
https://openalex.org/W2761247835,"Background The clinical ladder system categorizes the degree of nursing professionalism and rewards and is an important human resource tool for managing nursing. Aim We developed a model to evaluate nursing professionalism, which determines the clinical ladder system levels, and verified its validity. Methods Data were collected using a clinical competence tool developed in this study, and existing methods such as the nursing professionalism evaluation tool, peer reviews, and face-to-face interviews to evaluate promotions and verify the presented content in a medical institution. Reliability and convergent and discriminant validity of the clinical competence evaluation tool were verified using SmartPLS software. The validity of the model for evaluating overall nursing professionalism was also analyzed. Results Clinical competence was determined by five dimensions of nursing practice: scientific, technical, ethical, aesthetic, and existential. The structural model explained 66% of the variance. Clinical competence scales, peer reviews, and face-to-face interviews directly determined nursing professionalism levels. Conclusions The evaluation system can be used for evaluating nurses’ professionalism in actual medical institutions from a nursing practice perspective. Implications for nursing management A conceptual framework for establishing a human resources management system for nurses and a tool for evaluating nursing professionalism at medical institutions is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2760904880,"The nuclear landscape plays an important role in the regulation of tissue and positional specific genes in embryonic and developing cells. Changes in this landscape can be dynamic, and are associated with the differentiation of cells during embryogenesis, and the de-differentiation of cells during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) formation and in many cancers. However, tools to quantitatively characterize these changes are limited, especially in the in vivo context, where numerous tissue types are present and cells are arranged in multiple layers. Previous tools have been optimized for the monolayer nature of cultured cells. Therefore, we present a new algorithm to quantify the condensation of chromatin in two in vivo systems. We first developed this algorithm to quantify changes in chromatin compaction and validated it in differentiating spermatids in zebrafish testes. Our algorithm successfully detected the typical increase in chromatin compaction as these cells differentiate. We then employed the algorithm to quantify the changes that occur in amphibian limb cells as they participate in a regenerative response. We observed that the chromatin in the limb cells de-compacts as they contribute to the regenerating organ. We present this new tool as an open sourced software that can be readily accessed and optimized to quantify chromatin compaction in complex multi-layered samples."
https://openalex.org/W2761335027,"Transcription factors PAX9 and MSX1 play crucial roles in the development of permanent teeth at the bud stage, and their loss-of-function variants have been associated with congenital tooth agenesis. We sequenced the coding regions of the PAX9 and MSX1 genes from nine patients with non-syndromic tooth agenesis, and identified a missense mutation, P20L, of PAX9 in a single familial case involving three patients in two generations. Identical mutation was previously reported by other authors, but has not been characterized in detail. The mutation was located in a highly conserved N-terminal subdomain of the paired domain and co-segregated as a heterozygote with tooth agenesis. The patients showed defects primarily in the first and second molars, which is typical for cases attributable to PAX9 mutation. Luciferase reporter assay using the 2.3-kb promoter region of BMP4 and electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the CD19-2(A-ins) sequence revealed that P20L substitution eliminated most of the transactivation activity and specific DNA binding activity of PAX9 under the experimental conditions we employed, while some residual activity of the mutant was evident in the former assay. The hypomorphic nature of the variant may explain the relatively mild phenotype in this case, as compared with other PAX9 pathogenic variants such as R26W."
https://openalex.org/W2764335818,"There is a need to develop better methods for epitope mapping and/or identification of antibody-recognizing motifs. Here, we describe improved biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method using a newly developed plasmid pXXGST-3 as vector, which has a viral E7 gene in the cloning sites of pXXGST-1. It is crucial to employ pXXGST-3 instead of pXXGST-1, since it makes use of the BSP method simpler and easier to perform, and more cost-effective for epitope mapping. These merits are embodied in two aspects: i) convenient recovery of double enzyme-digested product due to the existence of 315 bp inserted between BamH I and Sal I sites, and thus greatly reducing the production of self-ligation clones, and ii) no longer requiring control protein when screening recombinant (r-) clones expressing 8/18mer peptides by running polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protocol involves the following core steps: (i) design of plus and minus strands of DNA fragments encoding overlapping 8/18mer peptides; (ii) chemical synthesis of the designed DNA fragments; (iii) development of r-clones using pXXGST-3 vector expressing each 8/18mer peptide fused with truncated GST188 protein; (iv) screening r-clones by running the cell pellets from each induced clone on SDS-PAGE gel followed by sequencing of inserted DNA fragments for each verified r-clone; and (v) Western blotting with either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies. This improved GST188-BSP method provides a powerful alternative tool for epitope mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2762062930,"The purpose of this work was to quantify the variation of subcanopy spatiotemporal light dynamics over the course of a year and to link it to the physiological ecology of the understory shrub, Lindera benzoin L. Blume (northern spicebush). Covering all seven phenoseasons of a deciduous forest, this work utilized a line quantum sensor to measure the variation in subcanopy light levels under all sky conditions at different times of the day. A total of 4,592 individual subcanopy measurements of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, μmol m-2 s-1) were taken as 15-second spatially-integrated one-meter linear averages to better understand the dynamism of light exposure to L. benzoin. Both open (n = 2, one continuous and one instantaneous) and subcanopy location (n = 25) measurements of PPFD were taken on each sampling date in and near the forested plot (Maryland, USA). In addition, we explored the effect of four photointensity-photoperiod combinations on the growth of L. benzoin under controlled conditions to compare to field conditions. On average, understory PPFD was less than 2% of open PPFD during the leafed months and an average of 38.8% of open PPFD during leafless winter months, indicating that: (1) often overlooked woody surfaces intercept large amounts of light; and (2) spicebush within the plot receive limited light even in early spring before canopy leaf-out. Statistical results suggested phenoseason accounted for nearly three-quarters of the variation in incident radiation between the three plant canopy heights. Spicebush under controlled conditions exhibited the highest fitness levels at an intensity of 164.5 μmol m-2 s-1 for 12-hour duration. Similarly, spicebush growth in the field occurred at subcanopy locations receiving higher incidence of PPFD (i.e., >128 μmol m-2 s-1). Results suggest that the ecological niche for these plants is very specific in terms of light intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2762454901,"Bilirubin acts as a potent endogenous antioxidant, with higher concentrations associated with lower rates of CVD; the antiretroviral drug atazanavir (ATV) increases bilirubin levels but may also increase von Willebrand factor levels. We tested the hypothesis that increasing endogenous bilirubin using ATV would improve cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular function in older patients with HIV. Ninety participants were enrolled in two study protocols. In protocol 1, we evaluated markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and conduit artery endothelial function in subjects on non-ATV containing regimens. Participants were randomly assigned to continue baseline treatment or switch to an ATV-based regimen. Measurements were made at baseline and 28 days. In the protocol 2, we enrolled 30 subjects who received atazanavir for more than one year and were compared to the aim 1 protocol subjects at baseline. 60 subjects were enrolled in the first protocol (mean age 53, +/- 6 years), with 31 randomized to ATV and 29 continuing baseline treatment. Atazanavir significantly increased serum total bilirubin levels (p<0.001) and acutely but not chronically plasma total antioxidant capacity (p<0.001). An increase in von Willebrand Factor (p<0.001) and reduction in hs-CRP (p = 0.034) were noted. No changes were seen in either flow-mediated endothelium-dependent or vasodilation. In cross-sectional analysis (second protocol), similar findings were seen in the baseline attributes of non-atazanavir-based and long-term atazanavir users. Increasing serum bilirubin levels with atazanavir in subjects with HIV reduces hs-CRP, temporarily reduces oxidative stress, but increases von Willebrand Factor. Atazanavir does not improve endothelial function of conduit arteries.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03019783."
https://openalex.org/W2763399118,"Emotions are commonly recognized by combining auditory and visual signals (i.e., vocal and facial expressions). Yet it is unknown whether the ability to link emotional signals across modalities depends on early experience with audio-visual stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the role of auditory experience at different stages of development for auditory, visual, and multisensory emotion recognition abilities in three groups of adolescent and adult cochlear implant (CI) users. CI users had a different deafness onset and were compared to three groups of age- and gender-matched hearing control participants. We hypothesized that congenitally deaf (CD) but not early deaf (ED) and late deaf (LD) CI users would show reduced multisensory interactions and a higher visual dominance in emotion perception than their hearing controls. The CD (n = 7), ED (deafness onset: <3 years of age; n = 7), and LD (deafness onset: >3 years; n = 13) CI users and the control participants performed an emotion recognition task with auditory, visual, and audio-visual emotionally congruent and incongruent nonsense speech stimuli. In different blocks, participants judged either the vocal (Voice task) or the facial expressions (Face task). In the Voice task, all three CI groups performed overall less efficiently than their respective controls and experienced higher interference from incongruent facial information. Furthermore, the ED CI users benefitted more than their controls from congruent faces and the CD CI users showed an analogous trend. In the Face task, recognition efficiency of the CI users and controls did not differ. Our results suggest that CI users acquire multisensory interactions to some degree, even after congenital deafness. When judging affective prosody they appear impaired and more strongly biased by concurrent facial information than typically hearing individuals. We speculate that limitations inherent to the CI contribute to these group differences."
https://openalex.org/W2763702801,"The direction of the force of the quadriceps muscle group is expressed by the value of the quadriceps angle, between the long axis of the muscle rectus femoris and the patellar ligament. This value is often modified in dogs with patellar luxation, a common orthopaedic disease of the stifle joint in both small and large dogs. The aims of the present study were to give a reference value for the quadriceps angle in healthy small and medium-large breed dogs. The medical records of healthy dogs and their pelvic limb radiographs (2014–2016) were reviewed. The radiographs were then divided into two groups: Group A (small dogs <15 kg body weight) and Group B (medium-large dogs >15 kg). The quadriceps angle of each pelvic limb was assessed using a digital software program in order to compare values between the two groups. The radiographs of 160 dogs, 80 per group were studied along with the assessment of the 320 pelvic limbs. The median quadriceps angle values obtained were in contrast with the literature: in Group A, it was 18.3° and, in Group B, it was 8.7°; moreover, the quadriceps angle value for Group A was statistically higher than for Group B (p<0.0001). No significant difference was present between males and females, or between right and left hindlimbs. In Group B, the Labrador Retriever breed influenced the quadriceps angle (p = 0.0005). The outcome of this survey provides an objective parameter, or additional information, to explain the different quadriceps mechanisms of small and medium-large dogs. In future studies the QA range values assessed in the two size groups may be useful in defining the magnitude of the malalignment of the extensor mechanism in both healthy dogs and ones with patellar luxation."
https://openalex.org/W2764332462,"Many RNA-binding proteins possess domains with a biased amino acid content. A common property of these low complexity domains (LCDs) is that they assemble into an ordered amyloid form, juxtaposing RNA recognition motifs in a subcellular compartment in which RNA metabolism is focused. Yeast Nab3 is one such protein that contains RNA-binding domains and a low complexity, glutamine/proline-rich, prion-like domain that can self-assemble. Nab3 also contains a region of structural homology to human hnRNP-C that resembles a leucine zipper which can oligomerize. Here we show that the LCD and the human hnRNP-C homology domains of Nab3 were experimentally separable, as cells were viable with either segment, but not when both were missing. In exploiting the lethality of deleting these regions of Nab3, we were able to test if heterologous prion-like domains known to assemble into amyloid, could substitute for the native sequence. Those from the hnRNP-like protein Hrp1, the canonical prion Sup35, or the epsin-related protein Ent2, could rescue viability and enable the new Nab3 chimeric protein to support transcription termination. Other low complexity domains from RNA-binding, termination-related proteins or a yeast prion, could not. As well, an unbiased genetic selection revealed a new protein sequence that could rescue the loss of Nab3’s essential domain via multimerization. This new sequence and Sup35’s prion domain could also rescue the lethal loss of Hrp1’s prion-like domain when substituted for it. This suggests there are different cross-functional classes of amyloid-forming LCDs and that appending merely any assembly-competent LCD to Nab3 does not restore function or rescue viability. The analysis has revealed the functional complexity of LCDs and provides a means by which the differing classes of LCD can be dissected and understood."

In this study, we aimed to identify environmental factors associated with RA and gingival disease and to investigate factors that protect the gingival tissue in RA patients. This retrospective study analyzed 754 RA patients with gingival disease selected from the NHANES database who completed the mobile examination center interview/examination between 1999 and 2004. Data collected included demographics, lifestyle, dietary intake, and biomarkers. The study included 173 RA patients with gingival disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of gingival disease were significantly increased with male gender. However, the odds of gingival disease was significantly decreased with increased vitamin C intake (OR = 0.996, p = 0.041), and higher serum vitamin D levels (OR = 0.979, p = 0.011). Given the significant association between the prevalence of gingival disease and RA, identification of risk factors of gingival disease will be useful as a screening tool in national health surveys to improve the management of periodontal disease in patients with RA."
https://openalex.org/W2762487389,"Ecology has become a data intensive science over the last decades which often relies on the reuse of data in cross-experimental analyses. However, finding data which qualifies for the reuse in a specific context can be challenging. It requires good quality metadata and annotations as well as efficient search strategies. To date, full text search (often on the metadata only) is the most widely used search strategy although it is known to be inaccurate. Faceted navigation is providing a filter mechanism which is based on fine granular metadata, categorizing search objects along numeric and categorical parameters relevant for their discovery. Selecting from these parameters during a full text search creates a system of filters which allows to refine and improve the results towards more relevance. We developed a framework for the efficient annotation and faceted navigation in ecology. It consists of an XML schema for storing the annotation of search objects and is accompanied by a vocabulary focused on ecology to support the annotation process. The framework consolidates ideas which originate from widely accepted metadata standards, textbooks, scientific literature, and vocabularies as well as from expert knowledge contributed by researchers from ecology and adjacent disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W2763540686,"Upon recognition of peptide displayed on MHC molecules, Th1 and Th2 cells form distinct immunological synapse structures. Th1 cells have a bull’s eye synapse structure with TCR/ MHC-peptide interactions occurring central to a ring of adhesion molecules, while Th2 cells have a multifocal synapse with small clusters of TCR/MHC interactions throughout the area of T cell/antigen-presenting cell interaction. In this study, we investigated whether this structural difference in the immunological synapse affects delivery of T cell help. The immunological synapse is thought to ensure antigen-specific delivery of cytolytic granules and killing of target cells by NK cells and cytolytic T cells. In helper T cells, it has been proposed that the immunological synapse may direct delivery of other effector molecules including cytokines. CD40 ligand (CD40L) is a membrane-bound cytokine essential for antigen-specific T cell help for B cells in the antibody response. We incubated Th1 and Th2 cells overnight with a mixture of antigen-presenting and bystander B cells, and the delivery of CD40L to B cells and subsequent B cell responses were compared. Despite distinct immunological synapse structures, Th1 and Th2 cell do not differ in their ability to deliver CD40L and T cell help in an antigen-specific fashion, or in their susceptibility to inhibition of help by a blocking anti-CD40L antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2764065286,"In swimming propelling efficiency is partly determined by intra-cyclic velocity fluctuations. The higher these fluctuations are at a given average swimming velocity, the less efficient is the propulsion. This study explored whether the leg-arm coordination (i.e. phase relation ϕ) within the breaststroke cycle can be influenced with acoustic pacing, and whether the so induced changes are accompanied by changes in intra-cyclic velocity fluctuations. Twenty-six participants were asked to couple their propulsive leg and arm movements to a double-tone metronome beat and to keep their average swimming velocity constant over trials. The metronome imposed five different phase relations ϕi (90, 135, 180, 225 and 270°) of leg-arm coordination. Swimmers adjusted their technique under the influence of the metronome, but failed to comply to the velocity requirement for ϕ = 90 and 135°. For imposed ϕ = 180, 225 and 270°, the intra-cyclic velocity fluctuations increased with increasing ϕ, while average swimming velocity did not differ. This suggests that acoustic pacing may be used to adjust ϕ and thereby performance of breaststroke swimming given the dependence of propelling efficiency on ϕ."
https://openalex.org/W2764155007,"Cognition is very important in our daily life. However, amblyopia has abnormal visual cognition. Physiological changes of the brain during processes of cognition could be reflected with ERPs. So the purpose of this study was to investigate the speed and the capacity of resource allocation in visual cognitive processing in orientation discrimination task during monocular and binocular viewing conditions of amblyopia and normal control as well as the corresponding eyes of the two groups with ERPs. We also sought to investigate whether the speed and the capacity of resource allocation in visual cognitive processing vary with target stimuli at different spatial frequencies (3, 6 and 9 cpd) in amblyopia and normal control as well as between the corresponding eyes of the two groups. Fifteen mild to moderate anisometropic amblyopes and ten normal controls were recruited. Three-stimulus oddball paradigms of three different spatial frequency orientation discrimination tasks were used in monocular and binocular conditions in amblyopes and normal controls to elicit event-related potentials (ERPs). Accuracy (ACC), reaction time (RT), the latency of novelty P300 and P3b, and the amplitude of novelty P300 and P3b were measured. Results showed that RT was longer in the amblyopic eye than in both eyes of amblyopia and non-dominant eye in control. Novelty P300 amplitude was largest in the amblyopic eye, followed by the fellow eye, and smallest in both eyes of amblyopia. Novelty P300 amplitude was larger in the amblyopic eye than non-dominant eye and was larger in fellow eye than dominant eye. P3b latency was longer in the amblyopic eye than in the fellow eye, both eyes of amblyopia and non-dominant eye of control. P3b latency was not associated with RT in amblyopia. Neural responses of the amblyopic eye are abnormal at the middle and late stages of cognitive processing, indicating that the amblyopic eye needs to spend more time or integrate more resources to process the same visual task. Fellow eye and both eyes in amblyopia are slightly different from the dominant eye and both eyes in normal control at the middle and late stages of cognitive processing. Meanwhile, abnormal extents of amblyopic eye do not vary with three different spatial frequencies used in our study."
https://openalex.org/W2763653477,"Introduction Biological particles deposit on air handling system filters as they process air. This study reports and interprets abundance and diversity information regarding biomass accumulation on ordinarily used filters acquired from several locations in a university environment. Methods DNA-based analysis was applied both to quantify (via DNA fluorometry and qPCR) and to characterize (via high-throughput sequencing) the microbial material on filters, which mainly processed recirculated indoor air. Results were interpreted in relation to building occupancy and ventilation system operational parameters. Results Based on accumulated biomass, average DNA concentrations per AHU filter surface area across nine indoor locations after twelve weeks of filter use were in the respective ranges 1.1 to 41 ng per cm2 for total DNA, 0.02 to 3.3 ng per cm2 for bacterial DNA and 0.2 to 2.0 ng DNA per cm2 for fungal DNA. The most abundant genera detected on the AHU filter samples were Clostridium, Streptophyta, Bacillus, Acinetobacter and Ktedonobacter for bacteria and Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Nigrospora, Rigidoporus and Lentinus for fungi. Conditional indoor airborne DNA concentrations (median (range)) were estimated to be 13 (2.6–107) pg/m3 for total DNA, 0.4 (0.05–8.4) pg/m3 for bacterial DNA and 2.3 (1.0–5.1) pg/m3 for fungal DNA. Conclusion Conditional airborne concentrations and the relative abundances of selected groups of genera correlate well with occupancy level. Bacterial DNA was found to be more responsive than fungal DNA to differences in occupancy level and indoor environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2764269354,"Administration of high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is widely used in the clinic to treat autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We assessed the impact of IVIg on immune cell populations using an in vivo ovalbumin (Ova)-immunization mouse model. High dose IVIg significantly reduced the Ova-specific antibody response. Intriguingly, the results obtained indicate an immediate and massive immune reaction against IVIg, as shown by the activation and expansion of B cells and CD4+ T cells in the spleen and draining lymph nodes and the production of IVIg-specific antibodies. We propose that IVIg competes at the T-cell level with the response against Ova to explain the immunomodulatory properties of IVIg. Two monoclonal antibodies did not succeeded in reproducing the effects of IVIg. This suggests that in addition to the mouse response against human constant domains, the enormous sequence diversity of IVIg may significantly contribute to this massive immune response against IVIg. While correlation of these findings to IVIg-treated patients remains to be explored, our data demonstrate for the first time that IVIg re-directs the immune response towards IVIg and away from a specific antigen response."
https://openalex.org/W2760971851,"Small molecule screens are widely used to prioritize pharmaceutical development. However, determining the pathways targeted by these molecules is challenging, since the compounds are often promiscuous. We present a network strategy that takes into account the polypharmacology of small molecules in order to generate hypotheses for their broader mode of action. We report a screen for kinase inhibitors that increase the efficacy of gemcitabine, the first-line chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Eight kinase inhibitors emerge that are known to affect 201 kinases, of which only three kinases have been previously identified as modifiers of gemcitabine toxicity. In this work, we use the SAMNet algorithm to identify pathways linking these kinases and genetic modifiers of gemcitabine toxicity with transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by gemcitabine that we measure using DNaseI-seq and RNA-seq. SAMNet uses a constrained optimization algorithm to connect genes from these complementary datasets through a small set of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The resulting network recapitulates known pathways including DNA repair, cell proliferation and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We use the network to predict genes with important roles in the gemcitabine response, including six that have already been shown to modify gemcitabine efficacy in pancreatic cancer and ten novel candidates. Our work reveals the important role of polypharmacology in the activity of these chemosensitizing agents."
https://openalex.org/W2761609211,"The all-female Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) is the result of a hybridization of the Atlantic molly (P. mexicana) and the sailfin molly (P. latipinna) approximately 120,000 years ago. As a gynogenetic species, P. formosa needs to copulate with heterospecific males including males from one of its bisexual ancestral species. However, the sperm only triggers embryogenesis of the diploid eggs. The genetic information of the sperm donor typically will not contribute to the next generation of P. formosa. Hence, P. formosa possesses generally one allele from each of its ancestral species at any genetic locus. This raises the question whether both ancestral alleles are equally expressed in P. formosa. Allele-specific expression (ASE) has been previously assessed in various organisms, e.g., human and fish, and ASE was found to be important in the context of phenotypic variability and disease. In this study, we utilized Real-Time PCR techniques to estimate ASE of the androgen receptor alpha (arα) gene in several distinct tissues of Amazon mollies. We found an allelic bias favoring the maternal ancestor (P. mexicana) allele in ovarian tissue. This allelic bias was not observed in the gill or the brain tissue. Sequencing of the promoter regions of both alleles revealed an association between an Indel in a known CpG island and differential expression. Future studies may reveal whether our observed cis-regulatory divergence is caused by an ovary-specific trans-regulatory element, preferentially activating the allele of the maternal ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2762861261,"Several attempts have been made to model chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a xenograft setting but expansion of human myeloid cells in immunodeficient mice has proven difficult to achieve. Lack of cross-reacting cytokines in the microenvironment of the mice has been proposed as a potential reason. In this study we have used NOD/SCID IL2-receptor gamma deficient mice expressing human SCF, IL-3 and GM-CSF (NSGS mice), that should be superior in supporting human, and particularly, myeloid cell engraftment, to expand BCR-ABL1 expressing human cells in order to model CML. NSGS mice transplanted with BCR-ABL1 expressing cells became anemic and had to be sacrificed due to illness, however, this was not accompanied by an expansion of human myeloid cells but rather we observed a massive expansion of human T-cells and macrophages/histiocytes. Importantly, control human cells without BCR-ABL1 expression elicited a similar reaction, although with a slight delay of disease induction, suggesting that while BCR-ABL1 contributes to the inflammatory reaction, the presence of normal human hematopoietic cells is detrimental for NSGS mice."
https://openalex.org/W2762782059,"One of the most challenging problems in recent antenna engineering fields is to achieve highly reliable beamforming capabilities in an extremely restricted space of small handheld devices. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on single-radiator multiple-port (SRMP) antenna to alter the traditional approach of multiple-antenna arrays for improving beamforming performances with reduced aperture sizes. The major contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the beamforming capability of the SRMP antenna for use as an extremely miniaturized front-end component in more sophisticated beamforming applications. To examine the beamforming capability, the radiation properties and the array factor of the SRMP antenna are theoretically formulated for electromagnetic characterization and are used as complex weights to form adaptive array patterns. Then, its fundamental performance limits are rigorously explored through enumerative studies by varying the dielectric constant of the substrate, and field tests are conducted using a beamforming hardware to confirm the feasibility. The results demonstrate that the new perspective of the SRMP antenna allows for improved beamforming performances with the ability of maintaining consistently smaller aperture sizes compared to the traditional multiple-antenna arrays."
https://openalex.org/W2763819424,"Density-dependence is a term used in ecology to describe processes such as birth and death rates that are regulated by the number of individuals in a population. Evolutionary biologists have borrowed the term to describe decreasing rates of species accumulation, suggesting that speciation and extinction rates depend on the total number of species in a clade. If this analogy with ecological density-dependence holds, diversification of clades is restricted because species compete for limited resources. We hypothesize that such competition should not only affect numbers of species, but also prevent species from being phenotypically similar. Here, we present a method to detect whether competitive interactions between species have ordered phenotypic traits on a phylogeny, assuming that competition prevents related species from having identical trait values. We use the method to analyze clades of birds and mammals, with body size as the phenotypic trait. We find no sign that competition has prevented species from having the same body size. Thus, since body size is a key ecological trait and competition does not seem to be responsible for differences in body size between species, we conclude that the diversification slowdown that is prevalent in these clades is unlikely due to the ecological interference implied by the term density dependence."
