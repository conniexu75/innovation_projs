https://openalex.org/W2059277971,"Hsp104 is a stress tolerance factor that promotes the reactivation of heat-damaged proteins in yeast by an unknown mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate that Hsp104 functions in this process directly. Unlike other chaperones, Hsp104 does not prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins. However, in concert with Hsp40 and Hsp70, Hsp104 can reactivate proteins that have been denatured and allowed to aggregate, substrates refractory to the action of other chaperones. Hsp104 cooperates with the chaperones present in reticulocyte lysates but not with DnaK of E. coli. We conclude that Hsp104 has a protein remodeling activity that acts on trapped, aggregated proteins and requires specific interactions with conventional chaperones to promote refolding of the intermediates it produces."
https://openalex.org/W2040617029,"We have isolated three alleles of a novel Drosophila clock gene, double-time (dbt). Short- (dbtS) and long-period (dbtL) mutants alter both behavioral rhythmicity and molecular oscillations from previously identified clock genes, period and timeless. A third allele, dbtP, causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling of per and tim gene products in larvae. In dbtP mutants, PER proteins constitutively accumulate, remain hypophosphorylated, and no longer depend on TIM proteins for their accumulation. We propose that the normal function of DOUBLETIME protein is to reduce the stability and thus the level of accumulation of monomeric PER proteins. This would promote a delay between per/tim transcription and PER/TIM complex function, which is essential for molecular rhythmicity."
https://openalex.org/W1967046460,"A number of transcriptional coactivator proteins have been identified as histone acetyltransferase (HAT) proteins, providing a direct molecular basis for the coupling of histone acetylation and transcriptional activation. The yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex requires the coactivator protein Gcn5 for HAT activity. Identification of protein subunits by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting revealed that the TATA binding protein-associated factors (TAF(II)s) TAF(II)90, -68/61, -60, -25/23, and -20/17 are integral components of this complex. In addition, TAF(II)68 was required for both SAGA-dependent nucleosomal HAT activity and transcriptional activation from chromatin templates in vitro. These results illustrate a role for certain TAF(II) proteins in the regulation of gene expression at the level of chromatin modification that is distinct from the TFIID complex and TAF(II)145."
https://openalex.org/W2139316119,"The beta subunit of DNA polymerase III is essential for negative regulation of the initiator protein, DnaA. DnaA inactivation occurs through accelerated hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaA; the resulting ADP-DnaA fails to initiate replication. The ability of beta subunit to promote DnaA inactivation depends on its assembly as a sliding clamp on DNA and must be accompanied by a partially purified factor, IdaB protein. DnaA inactivation in the presence of IdaB and DNA polymerase III is further stimulated by DNA synthesis, indicating close linkage between initiator inactivation and replication. In vivo, DnaA predominantly takes on the ADP form in a beta subunit-dependent manner. Thus, the initiator is negatively regulated by action of the replicase, a mechanism that may be key to effective control of the replication cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2044385397,"The human SWI/SNF complex remodels nucleosome structure in an ATP-dependent manner, although the nature of this change has not been determined. Here we show that hSWI/SNF and ATP generate an altered nucleosomal structure that is stable in the absence of SWI/SNF. This product has an altered sensitivity to digestion by DNAse, restriction enzymes, and micrococcal nuclease, and an increased affinity for GAL4. It has the same protein composition but is approximately twice the size of a normal nucleosome. Incubation of the altered nucleosome with hSWI/SNF converts this structure back to a standard nucleosome in an ATP-dependent process. These results suggest that hSWI/ SNF acts by facilitating an exchange between normal and altered, more accessible, nucleosome conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2059528721,"RSC, an abundant, essential chromatin-remodeling complex, related to SWI/SNF complex, binds nucleosomes and naked DNA with comparable affinities, as shown by gel shift analysis. The RSCâ€“nucleosome complex is converted in the presence of ATP to a slower migrating form. This activated complex exhibits greatly increased susceptibility to endo- and exonucleases but retains a full complement of histones. Activation persists in the absence of ATP, and on removal of RSC, the nucleosome is released in an altered form, with a diminished electrophoretic mobility, greater sedimentation rate, and marked instability at elevated ionic strength. The reaction is reversible in the presence of RSC and ATP, with conversion of the altered form back to the nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W2031491298,"Constitutive activation of the RON gene, known to code for the tyrosine-kinase receptor for Macrophage Stimulating Protein (also known as Scatter Factor 2), has been shown to induce invasive-metastatic phenotype in vitro. As yet, nothing is known about the expression of this novel member of the MET-oncogene family in spontaneously occurring human cancers. Here we report that Ron is expressed at abnormally high levels in about 50% primary breast carcinomas (35/74 patients). Among these, the expression is increased more than 20-fold in 12 cases and the overexpressed protein is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Notably, Ron is only barely detectable in epithelial cells of the mammary gland, and its expression remains unchanged in benign breast lesions (including adenomas and papillomas). Overexpression was observed in different histotypic variants of carcinomas; it is associated with the disease at any stage and correlates with the post-menopausal status. In breast carcinoma cells grown in vitro, activation of the Ron receptor resulted in proliferation, migration and invasion through reconstituted basement membranes. Altogether, these data suggest a role for the RON gene in progression of human breast carcinomas to the invasive-metastatic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1989488194,"A new tumor suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC1 was recently isolated at chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by point mutation or homozygous deletion in glioma, prostate and breast cancer. PTEN/MMAC1 was also identified as the gene predisposing to Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome associated with an increased risk of breast, skin and thyroid tumors and occasional cases of other cancers including bladder and renal cell carcinoma. We screened 345 urinary tract cancers by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q to be deleted in 65 of 285 (23%) bladder and 15 of 60 (25%) renal cell cancers. We then screened the entire PTEN/MMAC1 coding region for mutation in 25 bladder and 15 renal cell primary tumors with deletion of chromosome 10q. Two somatic point mutations, a frameshift and a splicing variant, were found in the panel of bladder tumors while no mutation was observed in the renal cell carcinomas. To screen for homozygous deletion, we isolated two polymorphic microsatellite repeats from genomic BAC clones containing the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. Using these new informative markers, we identified apparent retention at the gene locus indicative of homozygous deletion of PTEN/MMAC1 in four of 65 bladder and 0 of 15 renal cell tumors with LOH through chromosome 10q. Identification of the second inactivation event in six bladder tumors with LOH of 10q implies that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene is occasionally involved in bladder tumorigenesis. However, the low frequency of biallelic inactivation suggests that either PTEN/MMAC1 is inactivated by other mechanisms or it is not the only target of chromosome 10q deletion in primary bladder and renal cell cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2051241476,"The Ras/Raf/MAP kinase (ERK) pathway is a major signaling pathway induced by growth factors in mammalian cells. Two other types of mammalian MAP kinases, JNK (SAPK) and p38 (RK, CSBP), are induced by environmental stress. Although the immediate-early gene, egr-1, is induced by growth factors, cytokines, differentiation signals and DNA damaging agents, less is known about its induction by environmental stress and the mechanism involved. Here we report that in NIH3T3 cells, egr-1 is induced by various stress treatments such as heat shock, sodium arsenite, ultraviolet (U.V.) radiation, and anisomycin. p38 and JNK1, but not ERK2, were activated by these stress treatments. Induction of egr-1 by anisomycin is inhibited by a specific inhibitor of p38, SB 203580. We also show that p38 and JNK1 activated by their upstream kinases induce egr-1 promoter activity through activation of the ternary complex factor, Elk-1. The stress treatments also lead to an increase in Egr-1 protein phosphorylation and its DNA binding activity. Together, our data suggest that induction of egr-1 gene by growth factors and stress are mediated through different subgroups of MAP kinases which may also differentially affect egr-1 function on its target genes."

https://openalex.org/W2060515359,"Chromosome 3p abnormalities and allele loss are frequent in lung and breast cancers, and several lung cancer cell lines exhibit homozygous deletions of 3p indicating potential sites of tumor suppressor genes at regions 3p21.3, 3p14.2 and 3p12. We have identified and characterized a new 3p21.3 homozygous deletion in a breast cancer cell line and the primary tumor that overlaps those previously described in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This homozygous deletion is approximately 220 kb in length and represents a somatically acquired change in the primary breast cancer. Cloning and sequencing of the breakpoint demonstrated that this resulted from an interstitial deletion and precisely pinpoints this deletion within the three SCLC homozygous deletions previously reported. This deletion significantly narrows the minimum common deleted region to 120 kb and is distinct from the previously reported region that suppresses tumor formation of the murine A9 fibrosarcoma cells. These findings suggest that a common homozygous deletion region on 3p21.3 is important in both lung and breast cancers. It is likely that this very well characterized region either contains one tumor suppressor gene common to both tumor types or two closely linked tumor suppressor genes specific for each tumor."
https://openalex.org/W194875141,"The capsid shells of bacteriophage HK97 and several other phages contain polypeptides that are covalently linked into complexes so large that they do not enter polyacrylamide gels after denaturation. The enormous apparent size of these protein complexes in HK97 derives from a novel protein topology. HK97 subunits cross-link via isopeptide bonds into oligomers that are closed rings of five or six members. However, polypeptides from neighboring pentamer and hexamer rings intertwine before the covalent cross-links form. As a result, adjacent protein rings catenate into a network similar to chainmail armor. In vitro linking and unlinking experiments provide strong support for the chainmail model, which explains the unusual properties of these bacteriophages and may apply to other macromolecular structures."

https://openalex.org/W1987193189,"Homology PCR has been used to identify receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) expressed during activation of rat hepatic stellate cells, the key fibrogenic mesenchymal element in the liver. Partial cDNAs encoding several RTKs were cloned from stellate cells activated in vivo, including those of Flt-1, Flk-1, c-met, PDGFR, and Tyro10/DDR2. RNAse protection from cells activated in vivo demonstrated biphasic induction of flt-1 and flk-1 mRNAs, receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Culture-activation of stellate cells was associated with increased [125I]VEGF binding and Flt-1 and Flk-1 receptor protein. Induction of VEGF binding sites correlated with an 2.5-fold increase in DNA synthesis in response to VEGF, but only if cells were activated by growth on collagen I, whereas cells maintained in a quiescent state on a basement membrane-like substratum (EHS matrix) were nonproliferative. In both stellate and endothelial cells VEGF-induced mitogenesis was augmented by co-incubation with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a cytokine with known synergy with VEGF. These findings suggest that the cellular targets of VEGF in liver may not be confined to sinusoidal endothelial cells, and that VEGF responses reflect combined effects on both hepatic stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2062025417,"The role of Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) in carcinogenesis is complex. There are reports on both tumor inhibition and tumor promotion by TGF-Î². To elucidate the complex role of TGF-Î² in epithelial carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative type II TGF-Î² receptor in the basal cell compartment and in follicular cells of the skin. Despite the reduced responsiveness of transgenic keratinocytes to TGF-Î², both proliferation and differentiation were normal in non-irritated epidermis of these transgenic mice. Thus, interruption of signaling of all three isoforms of TGF-Î² in basal and follicular cells does not disturb tissue homeostasis. However, during tumor promotion transgenic mice showed an elevated level of proliferation in the epidermis. This hyperproliferation correlated with a very early onset of carcinoma development and a malignant conversion frequency of 30% from benign papillomas to carcinomas. By comparison, the conversion frequency in wild-type mice of this strain has previously been reported as 5.5%. Even without induction of hyperproliferation by tumor promoters, transgenic mice developed far more carcinomas as controls when treated with a carcinogen. This result indicates that there is a synergistic effect between loss of TGF-Î² responsiveness and mutations caused by initiation with a carcinogen leading to an endogeneous tumor promotion in initiated cells only."
https://openalex.org/W2036417861,"Absence of expression of the p16IKN4a gene product is commonly observed in mesothelioma tumors and cell lines, while wild-type pRB expression is maintained. We have examined the biologic and potential therapeutic role of re-expressing p16INK4a gene product in mesothelioma cells and tumors. Following transduction with a p16INK4a expressing adenovirus (Adp16), over-expression of p16INK4a in mesothelioma cells resulted in cell cycle arrest, inhibition of pRB phosphorylation, diminished cell growth, and eventual death of the transduced cells. Expression of p16INK4a protein was accompanied by decreased expression of pRB as detected by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Experiments in mesothelioma xenografts demonstrated inhibition of tumor formation, tumor growth arrest and diminished tumor size and spread. p16INK4a gene product expression was also demonstrated in intraperitoneal xenografts of human mesothelioma cells. These results demonstrate that p16INK4a gene transfer may play a therapeutic role in the treatment of mesothelioma."
https://openalex.org/W2040123299,"We have previously shown that emodin suppresses tyrosine kinase activity of HER-2/neu-encoded p185neu receptor tyrosine kinase. In this study, we examine the relationship between the chemical structure and the activity of emodin and nine derivatives, and identified that one methyl, one hydroxy, and one carbonyl functional groups are critical for the biological activities of emodin. We also found that one of the derivatives 10-(4-acetamidobenzylidene)-9-anthrone (DK-V-47) is more effective than emodin in repressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of p185neu and in inhibiting the proliferation and transformation of HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cells. Using mutation-activated HER-2/neu transformed 3T3 cells, we also investigated whether emodin and DK-V-47 can inhibit malignant transformation induced solely by the HER-2/neu oncogene. We found that DK-V-47 is more potent than emodin in suppressing transformation phenotypes of activated HER-2/neu transformed 3T3 cells including anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, metastasis-associated properties. These results clearly indicate that the inhibition of p185neu tyrosine kinase by both emodin and DK-V-47 is capable of suppressing the HER-2/neu associated transformed phenotypes including the ability to induce metastatic potential. Our results also support the chemotherapeutic implications of the use of either emodin or DK-V-47 to target HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2088002901,"The pattern of HTLV-1 replication was assessed through PCR amplification of the 3' proviral integration sites in patients with TSP/HAM at different times. Integration sites were sequenced and oligonucleotides specific for the flanking sequences were synthesized. Together with HTLV-1 LTR specific primers, clonotypic nested PCR was performed on peripheral blood from two patients. The frequencies of five clones studied ranged from 1/300 to 1/1500 PBMCs while four clones persisted for more than 1-5 years. It would seem that Tax driven expansion of T cells may persist for considerable periods of time in TSP/HAM despite strong cellular immunity. This may provide a background for the accumulation of subsequent mutations leading to malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W2324524545,"Caspases are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that play a pivotal role in drug-induced cell death. We designed RT-PCR assays to analyse the expression of CASP-3, CASP-4, CASP-6 and the long and short isoforms of CASP-2 genes in human cells. These genes heterogeneously coexpress in leukemic cell lines and bone marrow samples from patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia at diagnosis. Treatment of U937 and HL60 leukemic cells and HT29 colon carcinoma cells with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide upregulates CASP-2 and CASP-3 genes in these cells before inducing their apoptosis. This effect of etoposide is not observed in K562 cells and bcl-2-transfected U937 cells which are less sensitive to drug-induced apoptosis. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that etoposide increases CASP gene transcription in U937 cells, an effect that is prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression. Upregulation of CASP genes is associated with an enhanced synthesis of related procaspases that precedes the appearance of apoptosis markers including caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that the ability of tumor cells to upregulate CASP-2 and CASP-3 genes in response to cytotoxic drugs could be predictive of their sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2089628383,"The G1 cyclins, cyclin D1 and E, are rate limiting for progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle in breast epithelial cells and are oncogenic when expressed in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice. These genes are frequently overexpressed in clinical breast cancer where overexpression appears to be associated with specific disease phenotypes, altered responsiveness to therapeutic intervention and patient survival. In order to investigate the functional correlates of cyclin D1 and cyclin E overexpression we employed a panel of normal, immortalized and neoplastic breast epithelial cell lines to examine the relationships between cyclin gene expression, cyclin-CDK complex formation and CDK activity. In agreement with earlier studies cyclin D1 and E expression varied over an approximately tenfold range among the 18 cell lines studied. There was no apparent relationship, however, between cyclin D1 expression and the in vitro activity of its major kinase partner, Cdk4, although MDA-MB-134 cells displayed the highest level of both cyclin D1 expression and Cdk4 activity. Similarly, there was no significant relationship between cyclin E expression and cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. Fractionation of whole cell lysates by gel filtration chromatography revealed that approximately 90% of the cyclin E protein was present in inactive complexes containing the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27. Much of the small fraction of active cyclin E protein was of very high apparent molecular mass, >400 kDa, suggesting that formation of these complexes is a more important determinant of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity than cyclin E abundance. These data suggest that properties of cyclins D1 and E in addition to their ability to activate Cdk4 and Cdk2 may contribute to the effects of overexpression on the breast cancer phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1975223632,"Methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands appears to be a potential way by which tumor suppressor genes are inactivated in cancer. Using Southern blot analysis, we have studied the methylation of several genes in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), trying to determine their contribution to tumorigenesis. Genes studied included the estrogen receptor (ER), N33, the candidate tumor-suppressors P15, P16 and HIC1 and a control gene, c-abl. Hypermethylation of N33, ER, HIC1, P16, P15 and c-abl were found in 61%, 59%, 60%, 5%, 2% and 0% of GBM respectively. HIC1 methylation was detected in normal brain as well, but appeared to be more extensive in tumors. ER and N33 methylation were significantly more frequent in tumors from individuals over the age of 40 (70% and 88% vs 36% and 14%). In addition, there was a strong association between ER and N33 methylation, which were concordant in 81% of the cases (P<0.01). ER and N33 methylation in GBM may therefore appear as a result of shared etiologic factors, which may relate in part to aging cell populations in the brain."

There is significant sequence homology between the dimerization domain of PML and the Fos family of proteins, which imply that PML may be involved in AP-1 activity. Here we show that PML can cooperate with Fos to stimulate its AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity. Cotransfection of PML with GAL4/Fos strongly induced Fos-mediated activation of GAL4-responsive reporters, indicating a functional interaction between Fos and PML in vivo. Deletion analysis of Fos and PML demonstrated that the intact C-terminal domain of Fos (containing the dimerization domain), and the RING-finger, B1 box and nuclear localization domains of PML are involved in the cooperative activity of Fos and PML. Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PML is associated with the AP-1 complex. PMLRARÎ± was also found to enhance the transcriptional activity of GAL4/Fos. The addition of retinoic acid abrogated the PMLRARÎ±, but not PML-induced stimulation of GAL4/Fos activity in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that PML is involved in the AP-1 complex and can modulate Fos-mediated transcriptional activity, which may contribute to its growth suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W1967724297,"Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous serine-threonine kinase in which a catalytic alpha subunit often associates with a beta subunit. CK2alpha is required for cell survival in yeast and has been proposed to be involved in cell growth control; however, its regulation in cells remains unclear. Here we present evidence that CK2alpha may be an associated substrate for the normal and oncogenic forms of the Abl tyrosine kinase. By probing CK2alpha with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we found that CK2alpha can be phosphorylated on tyrosine in quiescent cells. In vitro phosphorylation of CK2alpha-containing immunoprecipitates showed that CK2alpha is substrate of an associated tyrosine kinase activity. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CK2alpha is associated with normal c-Abl in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and with the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in K562 human myeloid leukemia cells. Coexpression of Bcr-Abl and CK2alpha in NIH3T3 cells also leads to the formation of a Bcr-Abl/CK2alpha complex and to the inhibition of CK2alpha activity. Bcr-Abl-induced inhibition of CK2alpha could be reverted by incubating CK2alpha with a tyrosine phosphatase. These observations clearly support the idea that a signal transduction pathway contributes to CK2 regulation and point to CK2alpha as a possible mediator of Bcr-Abl effects."
https://openalex.org/W2327398056,"The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is a transforming oncogene in NIH3T3 cells. In order to define structural requirements of the Axl receptor necessary for transformation we passaged recombinant retroviruses carrying the axl cDNA in NIH3T3 cells, generating randomly mutated axl variants. Using this strategy, we have isolated three axl viral strains (1B1, SV8, and FFa4) that show augmented 3T3 cell transforming capacity associated with elevated p140Axl. Upon sequencing, the 1B1 and SV8 proviruses possessed only silent mutations, making p140Axl overexpression the most likely explanation for their increased transformation activity. However, the characterization of FFa4 revealed a deletion of sequences encoding the carboxy-terminal 45 amino acids leading to the generation of a chimeric transcript comprised of a truncated Axl receptor with a segment of the 3' UTR region. Mutational analysis revealed that the transforming activity of FFa4 was specific to the formation of the chimeric receptor rather than to the carboxyl-terminal truncation. Intriguingly, none of the viral strains were able to transform the murine cell lines NR-6 and 32D despite equivalent expression of surface p140Axl protein. Further analysis showed that Axl's transforming potential is dependent on the host cell type, the presence of a putative pp190 as a facilitator for transformation, and the level of p140Axl expression. Taken together, these results underscore the complexity of Axl biology which is dependent on receptor stoichiometry and the cellular background."

https://openalex.org/W1982238136,"Our previous data demonstrated that Ras activation is necessary and sufficient for transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-mediated Erk1 activation, and is partially required for the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activity, cyclin A expression and DNA synthesis by TGFbeta (KM Mulder and SL Morris, J. Biol. Chem., 267: 5029-5031, 1992; MT Hartsough and KM Mulder, J. Biol. Chem., 270: 7117-7124, 1995; and MT Hartsough et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271: 22368-22375, 1996). Here, we examined the kinetics and role of Ras in TGFbeta3-mediated effects on specific G1 cell cycle components in TGFbeta-sensitive (4-1) and TGFbeta-resistant (4-6) intestinal epithelial cells (IEC's). Our results indicate that inactivation of Ras by stable, inducible expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) completely abrogated the ability of TGFbeta3 to up-regulate both CKI's. In contrast, the ability of TGFbeta3 to up-regulate p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 was maintained in ZnCl2-treated control cells. Inactivation of Ras also completely blocked the rapid TGFbeta-mediated increase in new synthesis of p27Kip1 protein. Moreover, up-regulation of p21Cip1 protein levels and new synthesis of p27Kip1, as well as the association of these CKI's with Cdk2, preceded the decrease in Cdk2 activity by TGFbeta. Collectively, our results suggest that p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are upstream effectors of the TGFbeta-mediated inhibition of Cdk2 activity in IEC 4-1 cells, and demonstrate that Ras activation is obligatory for TGFbeta-mediated up-regulation of these CKIs in untransformed epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2317181993,Pretreatment of cells with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite (but not other activators of stress-activated MAP kinase cascades) prevents the activation of p21Ras and strongly suppresses the activation of c-Raf and the MAP kinase cascade by a variety of growth factors. Arsenite appears to exert its effect by preventing the guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSos from converting Ras to its active GTP-bound state. Exposure to arsenite may be a simple way of assessing whether Ras plays an essential role in mediating activation of the MAP kinase cascade by extracellular signals.
https://openalex.org/W2036740994,"Autophosphorylation of type I receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) comprises one step in the signaling events mediated by erbB receptors such as p185neu and EGFR. Previous analysis of p185neu has indicated that there are at least five tyrosine autophosphorylation sites, Y882, Y1028, Y1143, Y1226/7 and Y1253, of which Y882 might be important because of its location in the kinase activity domain. We have specifically analysed the effect of a Y882F (phenylalanine substituted for tyrosine at position 882) mutation in the enzymatic active domain. We also deleted the carboxyl terminal 122 amino acids which contained three other autophosphorylation sites (TAPstop) and combined mutants of that deletion with Y882F (Y882F/APstop). Both in vitro and in vivo transformation assays showed that substitution of tyrosine882 by phenylalanine significantly decreased the transforming potential of activated, oncogenic p185neu, although no significant difference in the total phosphotyrosine levels of the mutant proteins were observed. To analyse mitogenic signaling in response to ligand, the intracellular domains of p185neu and Y882F were fused with the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor. The proliferation of cells expressing these chimeric receptors was EGF-dependent, and cells expressing EGFR/Y882F chimeric receptors were less responsive to EGF stimulation than those expressing EGFR/neu receptors. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that abolishing the autophosphorylation site Y882 diminished the enzymatic tyrosine kinase activity of p185neu. These studies, taken together with the phenotypic inhibition observed with cells expressing Y882F, suggest that the tyrosine882 residue may be important for p185neu-mediated transformation by affecting the enzymatic kinase function of the p185neu receptor."

From a first generation of putative Jun targets four clones were selected for study; they are upregulated in jun-transformed cells. Three of these clones showed homology to known genes: glutaredoxin, growth associated protein (GAP)-43/neuromodulin, and phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P450. The expression of these genes was analysed in fibroblasts transformed by various oncogenes. Expression of the glutaredoxin mRNA could be induced by a Jun-estrogen receptor chimaera in the absence of de novo protein biosynthesis. Based on this observation we conclude that glutaredoxin is a direct target of v-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W2321395255,"Recent studies have demonstrated that Cbl, the 120 kDa protein product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to stimulation of growth factor receptors and upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion. As a result, Cbl forms complexes with SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins, pointing to its role in signal transduction. The cellular form of Cbl can be rendered into transforming by naturally occurring or engineered mutations to its amino acid sequence. To gain insight into the mechanisms how oncogenic forms of Cbl render cells tumorigenic and what the function of the cellular Cbl might be, we have undertaken an analysis of NIH3T3 cells transfected with wild-type and oncogenic forms of Cbl. We demonstrate that unlike cellular Cbl, the mutant forms of Cbl are tyrosine phosphorylated in an adhesion-independent manner and interact with and activate SH2-containing signaling molecules in both suspended and adherent cells. Our data further show that oncogenic forms of Cbl induce anchorage-independent but serum-dependent growth. These results support the view that transformation by oncogenic forms of Cbl results from constitutive activation of integrin-dependent, rather than growth factor-dependent signaling events and, as a corollary, suggest that cellular Cbl might be a functionally important mediator of integrin signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2320305333,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein can adopt both latent, non-DNA binding and active, DNA binding forms, and p53 activity is thought to be regulated in cells, at least in part, through a conformational shift which leads to sequence specific DNA binding. In vitro, this allosteric regulation of DNA binding by p53 has been shown to be mediated through the C-terminus of the protein. We show here that although deletion of the C-terminal 16 amino acids of p53 did not activate DNA binding, deletion of a further eight amino acids resulted in constitutive activation of DNA binding activity. Simultaneous mutation of the three lysine residues within these eight amino acids also resulted in constitutive DNA binding activity, although this was reduced when only two of these lysines were altered. The deletion or point mutants of p53 showing constitutive DNA binding activity did not display clear evidence of DNA binding site specificity, although some binding site preference was seen with the point mutants. Each of the constitutively active p53 mutants retained transcriptional activity and induced both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in transiently transfected cells at rates comparable with the wild type protein."
https://openalex.org/W2325651372,"In this report, we characterize the biological and biochemical properties of a conditional protein containing chicken c-Rel fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. This chimeric c-RelER protein causes estrogen-dependent, but otherwise c-Rel-specific, transformation of avian fibroblasts in vitro. Our results demonstrate that c-RelER heterodimerizes with wild-type c-Rel and forms specific complexes with IÎºB-Î±. Estrogen causes translocation of c-RelER to the nucleus and stabilizes its binding to DNA. Hormone-activated c-RelER induces transcription of at least four cellular genes that are constitutively active in wild-type c-Rel-transformed fibroblasts. Two distinct cell populations were examined that differed with respect to their growth phenotypes. The growth of fibroblasts with moderate expression levels of c-RelER was stimulated by estrogen. In contrast, the addition of estrogen to cells with high c-RelER expression levels resulted in inhibition of cytokinesis and the arrest of growth. The carboxy terminal transactivation domain of c-Rel was required for the induction of these effects since neither v-Rel nor c-Rel deletion mutants were able to induce similar changes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that high levels of c-Rel expression can affect cell cycle control and/or cytokinesis. Furthermore, they also indicate that the biological properties of c-Rel in cell growth and differentiation will potentially differ depending on the level of expression."
