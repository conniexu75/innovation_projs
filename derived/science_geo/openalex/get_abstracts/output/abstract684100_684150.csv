https://openalex.org/W3213449025,"Overweight and obesity impose a significant health burden in Australia, predominantly the middle-aged and older adults. Studies of the association between obesity and chronic diseases are primarily based on cross-sectional data, which is insufficient to deduce a temporal relationship. Using nationally representative panel data, this study aims to investigate whether obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, asthma, arthritis, and depression in Australian middle-aged and older adults.Longitudinal data comprising three waves (waves 9, 13 and 17) of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey were used in this study. This study fitted longitudinal random-effect logistic regression models to estimate the between-person differences in the association between obesity and chronic diseases.The findings indicated that obesity was associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases among Australian middle-aged and older adults. Obese adults (Body Mass Index [BMI] ≥ 30) were at 12.76, 2.05, 1.97, 2.25, and 1.96, times of higher risks of having type 2 diabetes (OR: 12.76, CI 95%: 8.88-18.36), heart disease (OR: 2.05, CI 95%: 1.54-2.74), asthma (OR: 1.97, CI 95%: 1.49-2.62), arthritis (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.90-2.68) and depression (OR: 1.96, CI 95%: 1.56-2.48), respectively, compared with healthy weight counterparts. However, the study did not find any evidence of a statistically significant association between obesity and cancer. Besides, gender stratified regression results showed that obesity is associated with a higher likelihood of asthma (OR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.84-3.80) among female adults, but not in the case of male adults.Excessive weight is strongly associated with a higher incidence of chronic disease in Australian middle-aged and older adults. This finding has clear public health implications. Health promotion programs and strategies would be helpful to meet the challenge of excessive weight gain and thus contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3213273989,"Although tobacco smoking is a risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the mechanisms by which tobacco smoking induces LUAD development remain elusive. Histone methylation levels in human bronchial epithelial cells have been reported to increase after exposure to cigarettes. In this study, we explored the mechanisms regulating histone methylation in LUAD in response to smoking. We found that the histone H3K9 methylation reader CBX3 was upregulated in current smokers with LUAD, and that CBX3 overexpression promoted LUAD progression. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that CBX3 regulated the activation of Rho GTPases in LUAD. We also found that by forming a complex with TRIM28, TRIM24, and RBBP4, CBX3 repressed the expression of ARHGAP24 and increased the amount of active Rac1 in LUAD cells. Collectively, these results suggest that smoking associated upregulation of CBX3 promotes LUAD progression by activating the ARHGAP24/Rac1 pathway. Hence, the CBX3/ARHGAP24/Rac1 axis may represent a promising therapeutic target in smoking-induced LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W3214208767,"As the early COVID-19 outbreak sparked xenophobia against people of Asian and Chinese background, we collected data from Chinese migrants worldwide to test how discrimination at a macro-level was perceived by the Chinese during COVID-19 globally. Specifically, we examined (1) whether/how the Chinese migrants were aware of discrimination against their co-nationals during COVID; (2) if so, whether anger was a predominant reaction of these Chinese towards certain exposure to relevant information; (3) how responses of anger transcend across the group of Chinese migrants. Integrating the ecological approach to media and cultural psychology, as well as the intergroup perspective of social psychology, we conducted a study that explored the impact of traditional media exposure to discrimination on collective anger-a process mediated by national identity among the Chinese migrants. Findings provide some evidence that geographically dispersed mono-cultural groups may share or identify with collective emotions when facing xenophobic threats in a macro context. Further examination of cultural distance (between China and the host country) among the Chinese migrants also revealed a particular interaction between host newspaper coverage and cultural distance on national identity. These findings suggest further research to examine the emotional norms of similar cultures bonded via strong collective identities in times of intergroup threat and the theoretical possibility for diasporic identity processes."
https://openalex.org/W3213451896,"N-myc-downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1) has potent anticancer effects and inhibits cell growth, survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Previous studies suggested that NDRG1 is linked to the androgen signaling network, but this mechanistic relationship is unclear. Considering the crucial role of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, here we examined for the first time the effect of NDRG1 on AR expression, activation, and downstream signaling in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and C4-2B PCa cell types. We demonstrate that NDRG1 effectively promotes interaction of AR with the chaperone HSP90, which in turn stabilizes the AR while decreasing its androgen-mediated activation. The expression of NDRG1 suppressed: (1) AR activation, as measured by p-ARSer213 and p-ARSer81; (2) expression of a major AR transcriptional target, prostate-specific antigen (PSA); and (3) AR transcriptional activity, probably via inhibiting the c-Jun-AR interaction by reducing c-Jun phosphorylation (p-c-JunSer63). NDRG1 was also demonstrated to inhibit multiple key molecules involved in androgen-dependent and -independent signaling (namely EGFR, HER2, HER3, PI3K, STAT3, and NF-κB), which promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also identified the cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1 (CAP) domain of NDRG1 as vital for inhibition of AR activity. Examining NDRG1 and p-NDRG1 in PCa patient specimens revealed a significant negative correlation between NDRG1 and PSA levels in prostatectomy patients that went on to develop metastasis. These results highlight a vital role for NDRG1 in androgen signaling and its potential as a key therapeutic target and biomarker in PCa."
https://openalex.org/W3214208990,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and by November 14, 2020 there were 53.3M confirmed cases and 1.3M reported deaths in the world. In the same period, Ethiopia reported 102K cases and 1.5K deaths. Effective public health preparedness and response to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, Ethiopia under the COVAX facility has begun vaccinating high risk populations but due to vaccine supply shortages and the absence of an effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, still remain the most effective methods of controlling the pandemic as recommended by WHO. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the implementation of NPIs at different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results indicated that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations. Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In conclusion, the models indicate that the projected number of hospital cases during the peak time is higher than the Ethiopian health system capacity. To contain symptomatic and ICU cases within the health system capacity, the government should pay attention to the strict implementation of the existing NPIs or impose additional public health measures."
https://openalex.org/W3214675630,"microRNAs (miRNA) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been investigated as potential biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, a mixed population of EVs is often obtained using conventional exosome isolation methods for biomarker development. EVs are derived from different cellular processes and present in various sizes, therefore miRNA expression among them is undoubtedly different. We developed a simple protocol utilizing sequential filtration and ultracentrifugation to separate PDAC EVs into three groups, one with an average diameter of more than 220 nm, named operational 3 (OP3); one with average diameters between 100-220 nm, named operational 2 (OP2); and another with average diameters around 100 nm, named operational 1 (OP1)). EVs were isolated from conditioned cell culture media and plasma of human PDAC xenograft mice and early stage PDAC patients, and verified by nanoparticle tracking, western blot, and electronic microscopy. We demonstrate that exosome specific markers are only enriched in the OP1 group. qRT-PCR analysis of miRNA expression in EVs from PDAC cells revealed that expression of miR-196a and miR-1246, two previously identified miRNAs highly enriched in PDAC cell-derived exosomes, is significantly elevated in the OP1 group relative to the other EV groups. This was confirmed using plasma EVs from PDAC xenograft mice and patients with localized PDAC. Our results indicate that OP1 can be utilized for the identification of circulating EV miRNA signatures as potential biomarkers for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W3211717296,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents an unprecedented situation in the most recent history. It has had a number of negative consequences for individuals and for whole societies. Individual effects of the pandemic include not only loss of life and of physical health, but also deteriorated quality of life.This study examines the effect of core self-evaluations (CSE), social support and fear of COVID-19 on the well-being of university students in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic.We conducted an online survey on a nationwide group of 1,000 students of Polish universities. The survey was carried out between 1 and 15 March 2021. The respondents filled out the following set of tools: World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale, Core Self-Evaluations Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale.The findings showed that core self-evaluations (CSE) were significantly positively associated with well-being in each of the four domains studied: physical health (r = 0.519), psychological (r = 0.763), social relationships (r = 0.465) and environment (r = 0.496). Similarly, social support correlated positively with physical health (r = 0.277), psychological health (r = 0.306), social relationships (r = 0.552) and environment (r = 0.496). Fear of COVID-19 correlated negatively with well-being in the domain of physical health (r = 0.188), in social relationships (r = 0.042) and with regard to the environment (r = 0.071), the correlations were weak. However, the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and well-being in the psychological domain was not confirmed.The findings point to the significant role of CSE and the role of social support in the perceived quality of life of young people during the pandemic. They provide valuable data concerning individuals who are particularly vulnerable to the adverse psychological effects at the time of the pandemic. They also prove that research conducted to explore other factors protecting individual well-being in difficult situations, including that of the pandemic, should be continued."
https://openalex.org/W3213363894,"Vitamin A deficiency has been shown to exacerbate allergic asthma. Previous studies have postulated that retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A and high-affinity ligand for RA receptor (RAR), is reduced in airway inflammatory condition and contributes to multiple features of asthma including airway hyperresponsiveness and excessive accumulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. In this study, we directly quantified RA and examined the molecular basis for reduced RA levels and RA-mediated signaling in lungs and ASM cells obtained from asthmatic donors and in lungs from allergen-challenged mice. Levels of RA and retinol were significantly lower in lung tissues from asthmatic donors and house dust mite (HDM)-challenged mice compared to non-asthmatic human lungs and PBS-challenged mice, respectively. Quantification of mRNA and protein expression revealed dysregulation in the first step of RA biosynthesis consistent with reduced RA including decreased protein expression of retinol dehydrogenase (RDH)-10 and increased protein expression of RDH11 and dehydrogenase/reductase (DHRS)-4 in asthmatic lung. Proteomic profiling of non-asthmatic and asthmatic lungs also showed significant changes in the protein expression of AP-1 targets consistent with increased AP-1 activity. Further, basal RA levels and RA biosynthetic capabilities were decreased in asthmatic human ASM cells. Treatment of human ASM cells with all-trans RA (ATRA) or the RARγ-specific agonist (CD1530) resulted in the inhibition of mitogen-induced cell proliferation and AP-1-dependent transcription. These data suggest that RA metabolism is decreased in asthmatic lung and that enhancing RAR signaling using ATRA or RARγ agonists may mitigate airway remodeling associated with asthma."

https://openalex.org/W3213793092,"As the p53 tumor suppressor is rarely mutated in conjunctival melanoma (CM), we investigated its activation as a potential therapeutic strategy. Preventing p53/Mdm2 interaction by Nutlin-3, the prototypical Mdm2 antagonist, or via direct siRNA Mdm2 depletion, increased p53 and inhibited viability in CM cell lines. The sensitivity to Nutlin-3 p53 reactivation with concomitant Mdm2 stabilization was higher than that achieved by siRNA, indicative of effects on alternative Mdm2 targets, identified as the cancer-protective IGF-1R. Nutlin-3 treatment increased the association between IGF-1R and β-arrestin1, the adaptor protein that brings Mdm2 to the IGF-1R, initiating receptor degradation in a ligand-dependent manner. Controlled expression of β-arrestin1 augmented inhibitory Nutlin-3 effects on CM survival through enhanced IGF-1R degradation. Yet, the effect of IGF-1R downregulation on cell proliferation is balanced by β-arrestin1-induced p53 inhibition. As mitomycin (MMC) is a well-established adjuvant treatment for CM, and it triggers p53 activation through genotoxic stress, we evaluated how these alternative p53-targeting strategies alter the cancer-relevant bioactivities of CM. In 2D and 3D in vitro models, Nutlin-3 or MMC alone, or in combination, reduces the overall cell tumor growth ~30%, with double treatment inhibition rate only marginally higher than single-drug regimens. However, histopathological evaluation of the 3D models revealed that Nutlin-3 was the most effective, causing necrotic areas inside spheroids and complete loss of nuclear staining for the proliferative marker Ki67. These findings were further validated in vivo; zebrafish xenografts demonstrate that Nutlin-3 alone has higher efficacy in restraining CM tumor cell growth and preventing metastasis. Combined, these results reveal that β-arrestin1 directs Mdm2 toward different substrates, thus balancing IGF-1R pro-tumorigenic and p53-tumor suppressive signals. This study defines a potent dual-hit strategy: simultaneous control of a tumor-promoter (IGF-1R) and tumor-suppressor (p53), which ultimately mitigates recurrent and metastatic potential, thus opening up targeted therapy to CM."
https://openalex.org/W2911796160,"The aim of this study is to investigate the association between financial literacy and age as well as gender differences in financial literacy.We analyse a sample of 25,000 individuals from 'The Financial Literacy Survey 2016' conducted by the Central Council for Financial Services Information (Bank of Japan). The analysis focuses on the relationship of age and financial literacy as well as that of age and self-rated financial knowledge. To consider factors accounting for gender differences in financial literacy, we use the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method. To further our understanding of financial literacy, we conduct additional analyses on financial behaviour and attitude.Although age is associated with increased financial literacy (Men, β: 0.249, standard error [SE]: 0.030; Women, 0.354, SE: 0.026), the growth rate decreases among the older respondents (Men, β: -0.002, SE: 0.000; Women, -0.003, SE: 0.000). However, the association between age and self-rated financial knowledge among men moves in the opposite direction (Age, β: -0.021, SE: 0.009, Age2, β: 0.000, SE: 0.000). Furthermore, female respondents are likely to be less financially literate than their male counterparts (β: -0.586, SE: 0.095) due to gender differences in the distribution of the factors that affect financial literacy (specifically education), their responses to financial literacy, and the interactions of these effects. In contrast to knowledge-based financial literacy, financial behaviour and attitudes among women are more preferable to those among men, namely, more premeditated.Financial literacy increases until about one's early 60s, after which it declines, while confidence in financial literacy reflects the inverse trend, especially among men. Additionally, men are more financially literate than women; however, these differences could be mitigated through education. Meanwhile, financial behaviour and attitudes among men are less premeditated. Thus, policies are needed that can help older adults with their financial decision-making, enhance women's financial literacy, and improve men's financial behaviours and attitudes."

https://openalex.org/W3214508536,"Pluripotent stem cells are known to shift their mitochondrial metabolism upon differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying such metabolic rewiring are not fully understood. We hypothesized that during differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), mitochondria undergo mitophagy and are then replenished by the biogenesis of new mitochondria adapted to the metabolic needs of the differentiated cell. To evaluate mitophagy during iPSC differentiation, we performed live cell imaging of mitochondria and lysosomes in hiPSCs differentiating into vascular endothelial cells using confocal microscopy. We observed a burst of mitophagy during the initial phases of hiPSC differentiation into the endothelial lineage, followed by subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis as assessed by the mitochondrial biogenesis biosensor MitoTimer. Furthermore, hiPSCs undergoing differentiation showed greater mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and an increase in ATP levels as assessed by an ATP biosensor. We also found that during mitophagy, the mitochondrial phosphatase PGAM5 is cleaved in hiPSC-derived endothelial progenitor cells and in turn activates β-catenin-mediated transcription of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis. These data suggest that mitophagy itself initiates the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism through transcriptional changes during endothelial cell differentiation. In summary, these findings reveal a mitophagy-mediated mechanism for metabolic rewiring and maturation of differentiating cells via the β-catenin signaling pathway. We propose that such mitochondrial-nuclear cross talk during hiPSC differentiation could be leveraged to enhance the metabolic maturation of differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W3211636283,"Objective To examine trends and variations of caesarean section by economic status and type of healthcare facility in Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Methods Secondary data analysis of nationally representative household surveys conducted between 2008–2020 across nine Arab countries in the MENA region. The study population was women aged 15–49 years with a live birth in the two years preceding the survey. Temporal changes in the proportion of deliveries by caesarean section in each country were calculated using generalised linear models and presented as risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Caesarean section was disaggregated by household wealth index and type of healthcare facility. Results Use of caesarean section ranged from 57.3% (95%CI:55.6–59.1%) in Egypt to 5.7% of births (95%CI:4.9–6.6%) in Yemen. Overall, the use of caesarean section has increased across the MENA region, except in Jordan, where there was no evidence of change (RD -2.3 (95%CI: -6.0 ‒1.4)). Across most countries, caesarean section use was highest in the richest quintile compared to the poorest quintile, for example, 42.8% (95%CI:38.0–47.6%) vs. 22.6% (95%CI:19.6–25.9%) in Iraq, respectively. Proportion of caesarean section was higher in private sector facilities compared to public sector: 21.8% (95%CI:18.2–25.9%) vs. 15.7% (95%CI:13.3–18.4%) in Yemen, respectively. Conclusion Variations in caesarean section exist within and between Arab countries, and it was more commonly used amongst the richest quintiles and in private healthcare facilities. The private sector has a prominent role in observed trends. Urgent policies and interventions are required to address non-medically indicated intervention."

In this study we evaluated the efficacy of administering a live Salmonella vaccine followed by a killed Salmonella chitosan nanoparticle (CNP) vaccine booster on the cellular and humoral immunity of broilers. The CNP vaccine was synthesized with Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) outer-membrane-proteins (OMPs) and flagellin-proteins. At d1-of-age, one-hundred-sixty-eight chicks were allocated into treatments: 1) No vaccine, 2) Live vaccine (Poulvac®ST), 3) CNP vaccine, 4) Live+CNP vaccine. At d1-of-age, birds were orally vaccinated with PBS, Live vaccine, or CNP. At d7-of-age, the No vaccine, Live vaccine and CNP vaccine groups were boosted with PBS and the Live+CNP vaccine group was boosted with CNP. At d14-of-age, birds were challenged with 1×109 CFU/bird S. Enteritidis. There were no significant differences in body-weight-gain (BWG) or feed-conversion-ratio (FCR). At 8h-post-challenge, CNP and Live+CNP-vaccinated birds had 17% and 24% greater levels (P<0.05) of anti-Salmonella OMPs IgA in bile, respectively, compared to control. At d28-of-age, CNP, Live, and Live+CNP-vaccinated birds had 33%, 18%, and 24% greater levels (P<0.05) of anti-Salmonella OMPs IgA in bile, respectively, compared to control. At d14-of-age, Live+CNP-vaccinated birds had 46% greater levels (P<0.05) of anti-Salmonella OMPs IgY in serum, compared to control. At d21-of-age, splenocytes from CNP and Live-vaccinated birds had increased (P<0.05) T-lymphocyte proliferation at 0.02 mg/mL OMPs stimulation compared to the control. At d28-of-age, CNP and Live+CNP-vaccinated birds had 0.9 Log10 CFU/g and 1 Log10 CFU/g decreased S. Enteritidis cecal loads (P<0.05), respectively, compared to control. The CNP vaccine does not have adverse effects on bird's BWG and FCR or IL-1β, IL-10, IFN-γ, or iNOS mRNA expression levels. It can be concluded that the CNP vaccine, as a first dose or as a booster vaccination, is an alternative vaccine candidate against S. Enteritidis in broilers."

The results of the random-effects regression analyses fitted on a sample of respondents aged 16 years and older (N = 897) proved that there was a substantial and statistically significant short-term deterioration in mental health (from 78,5 to 67,9; β = -10.5, p < .001; Cohen's d -.445), as measured by a composite index derived from the mental component of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). The findings also showed heterogeneity in the COVID-related effects. On the one hand, evidence has emerged that the pandemic acted as a great leveller of pre-existing differences in mental health across people of different ages: the decrease was most pronounced among those aged 16-34 (from 84,2 to 66,5; β = -17.7, p < .001; Cohen's d -.744); however, the magnitude of change reduced as age increased and turned to be non-significant among individuals aged 70 and over. On the other hand, the COVID-19 emergency widened the mental health gender gap and created new inequalities, based on the age of the youngest child being taken care of within the household."
https://openalex.org/W3213426695,"The Behavior Change Wheel is the most comprehensive and practically useful methodology available for developing behavior change interventions. The current article demonstrates how it can be applied to optimize pro-environmental behaviors and, in so doing, give interventionists access to a rigorous set of theories and techniques for systematically developing pro-environmental interventions. Section 1 describes the development of an intervention to increase people’s intentions to post anti-littering messages on social media. Study 2 describes the development and evaluation of an intervention to increase people’s actual anti-littering posts. Both evaluations are randomized controlled trials that compare the effectiveness of the developed intervention with interventions less informed by the Wheel. We found interventions completely informed by the Wheel to be more effective than interventions less (or not at all) informed by the Wheel. The discussion explores how the Behavior Change Wheel methodology can be used to design future pro-environment interventions."

E. 431 carrying mcr-2.1 and mcr-3.1 belonged to serotype O142:H31 with ST29 sequence type. ECP.81 and ECP.82 from sick pigs harboring mcr-1.1 and mcr-3.1 were serotype O9:H9 with ST10. Two mcr-1.1 gene cassettes from ECP.81 and ECP.82 were located on IncI2 plasmid with 98% identity to plasmid pHNSHP45. The mcr-2.1-carrying contig in E. 431 showed 100% identity to plasmid pKP37-BE with the upstream flanking sequence of IS1595. All three mcr-3.1-carrying contigs contained the ΔTnAs2-mcr-3.1-dgkA core segment and had high nucleotide similarity (85-100%) to mcr-3.1-carrying plasmid, pWJ1. The mobile elements i.e. IS4321, ΔTnAs2, ISKpn40 and IS3 were identified in the flanking regions of mcr-3. Several genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(3)-IIa, aadA1, aadA2b, aph(3'')-Ib, aph(3')-IIa and aph(6)-Id), macrolides (mdf(A)), phenicols (cmlA1), sulphonamide (sul3) and tetracycline (tet(A) and tet(M)) were located on plasmids, of which their presence was well corresponded to the host's resistance phenotype. Amino acid substitutions S83L and D87G in GyrA and S80I and E62K in ParC were observed. The blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-55 genes were identified among these isolates additionally harbored blaTEM-1B. Co-transfer of mcr-1.1/blaTEM-1B and mcr-3.1/blaCTX-M-55 was observed in ECP.81 and ECP.82 but not located on the same plasmid. The results highlighted that application of advanced innovation technology of WGS in AMR monitoring and surveillance provide comprehensive information of AMR genotype that could yield invaluable benefits to development of control and prevention strategic actions plan for AMR."
https://openalex.org/W3211732073,"Prolonged driving under real conditions can entail discomfort linked to driving posture, seat design features, and road properties like whole-body vibrations (WBV). This study evaluated the effect of three different seats (S 1 = soft; S 2 = firm; S 3 = soft with suspension system) on driver’s sitting behavior and perceived discomfort on different road types in real driving conditions. Twenty-one participants drove the same 195 km itinerary alternating highway, city, country, and mountain segments. Throughout the driving sessions, Contact Pressure (CP), Contact Surface (CS), Seat Pressure Distribution Percentage (SPD%) and Repositioning Movements (RM) were recorded via two pressure mats installed on seat cushion and backrest. Moreover every 20 minutes, participants rated their whole-body and local discomfort. While the same increase in whole-body discomfort with driving time was observed for all three seats, S 3 limited local perceived discomfort, especially in buttocks, thighs, neck, and upper back. The pressure profiles of the three seats were similar for CP, CS and RM on the backrest but differed on the seat cushion. The soft seats (S 1 &amp; S 3 ) showed better pressure distribution, with lower SPD% than the firm seat (S 2 ). All three showed highest CP and CS under the thighs. Road type also affected both CP and CS of all three seats, with significant differences appearing between early city, highway and country segments. In the light of these results, automotive manufacturers could enhance seat design for reduced driver discomfort by combining a soft seat cushion to reduce pressure peaks, a firm backrest to support the trunk, and a suspension system to minimize vibrations."
https://openalex.org/W3212649428,"Wild varieties in nature are known to be better adapted to climate change and more resistant to arid conditions common in some regions of the world. Oil samples of two cultivated varieties, Chemlal and Lemli, and one sylvestris variety were collected at four different harvesting periods in the semi-arid region of Bouira, Algeria. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the genetic and maturity factors on the quality indices (acidity, peroxides value, and the parameters K232, K270), fatty acids profile, phenolic composition, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal olive oils. The study showed that early harvest dates of the fruits produced oils richer in pigments and phenolic compounds, with high antioxidant activity registered in both wild and cultivated varieties. Moreover, all oil samples showed high values of secoiridoids exceeding 60–90% of total biophenols, with higher values found in oleaster oils, which are correlated with high resistance to oxidation attacks. UHPLC-DAD and UHPLC-HRMS analyses showed that the secoiridoids composition is dominated by a profile rich in several isomers of oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, which in turn represent more than 60% of the total secoiridoids in olive and Oleaster oils. Furthermore, chemometric analysis on the data allowed a better appreciation of the sensitivity of the virgin olive oil composition to the changes in genetic and ripening factors. According to the principal component analysis, phenolic and fatty acid profiles were the most important components contributing to the discrimination between olive oil samples."
https://openalex.org/W3213455863,"Cryopreservation is a key step for the effective delivery of many cell therapies and for the maintenance of biological materials for research. The preservation process must be carefully controlled to ensure maximum, post-thaw recovery using cooling rates slow enough to allow time for cells to cryodehydrate sufficiently to avoid lethal intracellular ice. This study focuses on determining the temperature necessary at the end of controlled slow cooling before transfer to cryogenic storage which ensures optimal recovery of the processed cell samples. Using nucleated, mammalian cell lines derived from liver (HepG2), ovary (CHO) and bone tissue (MG63) this study has shown that cooling must be controlled to -40°C before transfer to long term storage to ensure optimal cell recovery. No further advantage was seen by controlling cooling to lower temperatures. These results are consistent with collected differential scanning calorimetry data, that indicated the cells underwent an intracellular, colloidal glass transition between -49 and -59°C (Tg'i) in the presence of the cryoprotective agent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The glass forms at the point of maximum cryodehydration and no further cellular dehydration is possible. At this point the risk of lethal intracellular ice forming on transfer to ultra-low temperature storage is eliminated. In practice it may not be necessary to continue slow cooling to below this temperature as optimal recovery at -40°C indicates that the cells have become sufficiently dehydrated to avoid further, significant damage when transferred into ultra-low temperature storage."

N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40 (NAA40) is a highly specific epigenetic enzyme catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl moiety at the N-terminal end of histones H4 and H2A. Recent studies have illustrated the essential oncogenic role of NAA40 in various cancer types but its role in chemoresistance remains unclear. Here, using transcriptomic followed by metabolomic analysis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, we demonstrate that NAA40 controls key one-carbon metabolic genes and corresponding metabolites. In particular, through its acetyltransferase activity NAA40 regulates the methionine cycle thereby affecting global histone methylation and CRC cell survival. Importantly, NAA40-mediated metabolic rewiring promotes resistance of CRC cells to antimetabolite chemotherapy in vitro and in xenograft models. Specifically, NAA40 stimulates transcription of the one-carbon metabolic gene thymidylate synthase (TYMS), whose product is targeted by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and accordingly in primary CRC tumours NAA40 expression associates with TYMS levels and poorer 5-FU response. Mechanistically, NAA40 activates TYMS by preventing enrichment of repressive H2A/H4S1ph at the nuclear periphery. Overall, these findings define a novel regulatory link between epigenetics and cellular metabolism mediated by NAA40, which is harnessed by cancer cells to evade chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3211694766,"First in human studies suggest that endovascular baroreflex amplification (EVBA) lowers blood pressure (BP). To explore potential mechanisms for BP reduction, this study examines the effects of EVBA on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS).In a single-center sub-study of the CALM-DIEM study (Controlling And Lowering blood pressure with the MobiusHD-Defining Efficacy Markers), 14 patients with resistant hypertension were treated with EVBA. Microneurography and non-invasive continuous BP measurements were performed at baseline and three months after MobiusHD implantation. The primary outcome was change in MSNA. Secondary outcomes were change in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), cardiovascular responses to a sympathetic stimulus, BP, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV).The primary endpoint was obtained in 10 of 14 patients enrolled in the sub-study. MSNA burst frequency and burst incidence decreased in 6 of 10 patients: mean change -4.1 bursts/min (95% confidence interval -12.2 to 4.0) and -3.8 bursts/100 heartbeats (-15.2 to 7.7). MSNA spike frequency and spike count decreased in 8 of 10 patients: mean change -2.8 spikes/sec (-7.3 to 1.8) and -3.0 spikes/heartbeat (-6.1 to 0.1). Change in MSNA and BP were not correlated. Office BP decreased by -14/-6 mmHg (-27 to -2/-15 to 3). We observed a trend towards decreased HR (-5 bpm, -10 to 1) and increased total power HRV (623 msec2, 78 to 1168). In contrast, BRS and cardiovascular responses remained unchanged after EVBA.In this proof-of-principle study, EVBA did not significantly decrease MSNA in patients with resistant hypertension. EVBA did not impair baroreflex function.Clinical trial registration at NCT02827032."
https://openalex.org/W3211946998,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative agent of tuberculosis remains a global health concern, further compounded by the high rates of HIV-TB co-infection and emergence of multi- and extensive drug resistant TB, all of which have hampered efforts to eradicate this disease. As a result, novel anti-tubercular interventions are urgently required, with the peptidoglycan component of the M . tuberculosis cell wall emerging as an attractive drug target. Peptidoglycan M23 endopeptidases can function as active cell wall hydrolases or degenerate activators of hydrolases in a variety of bacteria, contributing to important processes such as bacterial growth, division and virulence. Herein, we investigate the function of the Rv0950-encoded putative M23 endopeptidase in M . tuberculosis . In silico analysis revealed that this protein is conserved in mycobacteria, with a zinc-binding catalytic site predictive of hydrolytic activity. Transcript analysis indicated that expression of Rv0950c was elevated during lag and log phases of growth and reduced in stationary phase. Deletion of Rv0950c yielded no defects in growth, colony morphology, antibiotic susceptibility or intracellular survival but caused a reduction in cell length. Staining with a monopeptide-derived fluorescent D-amino acid, which spatially reports on sites of active PG biosynthesis or repair, revealed an overall reduction in uptake of the probe in ΔRv0950c. When stained with a dipeptide probe in the presence of cell wall damaging agents, the ΔRv0950c mutant displayed reduced sidewall labelling. As bacterial peptidoglycan metabolism is important for survival and pathogenesis, the role of Rv0950c and other putative M23 endopeptidases in M . tuberculosis should be explored further."
https://openalex.org/W3212110096,"In real life, humans are exposed to whole pollen grains at the air epithelial barrier. We developed a system for in vitro dosing of whole pollen grains at the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) and studied their effect on the immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Pollen are sticky and large particles. Dosing pollen needs resuspension of single particles rather than clusters, and subsequent transportation to the cells with little loss to the walls of the instrumentation i.e. in a straight line. To avoid high speed impacting insults to cells we chose sedimentation by gravity as a delivery step. Pollen was resuspended into single particles by pressured air. A pollen dispersion unit including PTFE coating of the walls and reduced air pressure limited impaction loss to the walls. The loss of pollen to the system was still about 40%. A linear dose effect curve resulted in 327-2834 pollen/cm 2 (± 6.1%), the latter concentration being calculated as the amount deposited on epithelial cells on high pollen days. After whole pollen exposure, the largest differential gene expression at the transcriptomic level was late, about 7 hours after exposure. Inflammatory and response to stimulus related genes were up-regulated. We developed a whole pollen exposure air-liquid interface system (Pollen-ALI), in which cells can be gently and reliably dosed."
https://openalex.org/W3212840032,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with stroke, blood clots, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and/or death. Multiple methods have been proposed for AFib detection, with varying performances, but no single approach appears to be optimal. We hypothesized that each state-of-the-art algorithm is appropriate for different subsets of patients and provides some independent information. Therefore, a set of suitably chosen algorithms, combined in a weighted voting framework, will provide a superior performance to any single algorithm.We investigate and modify 38 state-of-the-art AFib classification algorithms for a single-lead ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device. All algorithms are ranked using a random forest classifier and an expert-labeled training dataset of 2,532 recordings. The seven top-ranked algorithms are combined by using an optimized weighting approach.The proposed fusion algorithm, when validated on a separate test dataset consisting of 4,644 recordings, resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.99. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive-value (PPV), negative-predictive-value (NPV), and F1-score of the proposed algorithm were 0.93, 0.97, 0.87, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively, which were all superior to any single algorithm or any previously published.This study demonstrates how a set of well-chosen independent algorithms and a voting mechanism to fuse the outputs of the algorithms, outperforms any single state-of-the-art algorithm for AFib detection. The proposed framework is a case study for the general notion of crowdsourcing between open-source algorithms in healthcare applications. The extension of this framework to similar applications may significantly save time, effort, and resources, by combining readily existing algorithms. It is also a step toward the democratization of artificial intelligence and its application in healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3213250607,"SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis relies on the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs. Alternative sample sites have been assessed but the heterogeneity of the studies have made comparing different sites difficult.Our aim was to compare the performance of four different sampling sites for SARS-CoV-2 samples with nasopharynx being the benchmark.COVID-19 positive patients were recruited prospectively, and samples were collected and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR from all four anatomical sites in 43 patients, who provided written informed consent.All anterior nasal and saliva samples were positive, while two oropharyngeal samples were negative. There was no significant difference in the cycle threshold values of nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal samples while saliva and oropharynx had higher cycle threshold values.Anterior nasal swab performs as good as nasopharynx swab with saliva also finding all the positives but with higher cycle threshold values. Thus, we can conclude that anterior nasal swabs can be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection instead of nasopharyngeal swabs if the situation would require so."
https://openalex.org/W3213294111,"Cathepsin K is highly expressed in various types of cancers. However, the effect of cathepsin K inhibition in cancer cells is not well characterized. Here, cathepsin K inhibitor (odanacatib; ODN) and knockdown of cathepsin K (siRNA) enhanced oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in multiple cancer cells through Bax upregulation. Bax knockdown significantly inhibited the combined ODN and oxaliplatin treatment-induced apoptotic cell death. Stabilization of p53 by ODN played a critical role in upregulating Bax expression at the transcriptional level. Casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent phosphorylation of OTUB1 at Ser16 played a critical role in ODN- and cathepsin K siRNA-mediated p53 stabilization. Interestingly, ODN-induced p53 and Bax upregulation were modulated by the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial ROS scavengers prevented OTUB1-mediated p53 stabilization and Bax upregulation by ODN. These in vitro results were confirmed by in mouse xenograft model, combined treatment with ODN and oxaliplatin significantly reduced tumor size and induced Bax upregulation. Furthermore, human renal clear carcinoma (RCC) tissues revealed a strong correlation between phosphorylation of OTUB1(Ser16) and p53/Bax expression. Our results demonstrate that cathepsin K inhibition enhances oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis by increasing OTUB1 phosphorylation via CK2 activation, thereby promoting p53 stabilization, and hence upregulating Bax."
https://openalex.org/W3214233492,"Skid-steered vehicles (SSV) are gaining huge importance in the market due to their applications like construction, agricultural work, material handling etc. The accuracy of performing such tasks require a robust control algorithm. The design of such controller is very challenging task due to external disturbances caused by wheel-ground interaction and aerodynamic effects. This paper proposes robust fractional and integral order fuzzy sliding mode controllers (FSMC, FFSMC) for a skid-steered vehicles with varying coefficient of friction and a displaced center of gravity (CG). FFSMC controller reduces the outcome of forces generated as a result of ground tire interaction during skidding and friction variations. The proposed controllers are implemented for a four-wheel SSV under high-speed turning motion. A simulation environment is constructed by implementing the SSV dynamics with wheel-road model and the performance of the proposed algorithms is tested. The simulation test is conducted for a Pioneer-3AT (P-3AT) robot SSV vehicle with displaced CG and variable coefficient of tires friction. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed FFSMC algorithm in term of reduced state errors and minimum chattering. The proposed controller compensates the effect of different responses of the wheels generated as a result of variable CG. The chattering phenomenon generated by conventional SMCs is also minimized by fuzzy tuning approach."
https://openalex.org/W3212149038,"Diagnosis and surveillance of pathogenic Leptospira is difficult as organisms may be intermittently shed and in small numbers. Therefore, serologic testing by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the primary screening method for leptospirosis. While a MAT titer ≥1:100 is considered to be a positive result, interpretation is complicated by the use of commercial vaccines in pigs. Most guidelines for interpretation of MAT titers in pigs were published in the 1970’s and 1980’s, prior to the development of the current multivalent vaccines. We evaluated MAT titers in routinely vaccinated healthy research pigs compared to their unvaccinated cohorts. Our study confirmed previous reports that the Pomona serovar elicits minimal antibody response even after a second booster 6 months after initial vaccination. However, MAT titers of ≥1:3,200 were detected as early as 4 weeks post initial vaccination for serovars Bratislava and Icterohaemorrhagiae and remained as high as ≥1:1,600 prior to booster at 24 weeks post vaccination. Our study determined that high levels of MAT titers can occur from vaccination alone and high titers are not necessarily indicative of infection. Therefore, the interpretation of MAT titers as indicators of Leptospira infection should be readdressed."
https://openalex.org/W3212507184,"Introduction The current study aimed to understand the links between social media use and alcohol consumption during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Data were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N = 5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationships of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use frequency, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use frequency and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. Two alcohol use change variables were also assessed as outcomes–increased and decreased alcohol use between waves. We considered the effect of work status changes (working/studying from home and job loss) as potential moderators. Results Twitter and Instagram users and users of multiple social media platforms, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3. The results were similar when assessing relationships between social media use and increased alcohol use between waves. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to drinking frequency at wave 1. Additionally, working/studying from home at wave 3 and employment (rather than job loss) were associated with greater consumption. The interaction effect between Twitter use and working/studying from home was statistically significant in association with alcohol use frequency at wave 3, as was the interaction effect between using multiple platforms and working/studying from home in association with decreased alcohol use between waves. Discussion Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may have contributed to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted."

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a recently proposed therapy for CUD.We conducted a single-center, randomised, sham-controlled, blinded, parallel-group research with patients randomly allocated to rTMS (15 Hz) or Sham group (1:1) using a computerised block randomisation process. We enrolled 62 of 81 CUD patients in two years. Patients were followed for eight weeks after receiving 15 15 Hz rTMS/sham sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the first three weeks of the study. We targeted the DLFPC following the 5 cm method. Cocaine lapses in twice a week urine tests were the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were craving severity, cocaine use pattern, and psychometric assessments.We randomly allocated patients to either an active rTMS group (32 subjects) or a sham treatment group (30 subjects). Thirteen (42%) and twelve (43.3%) of the subjects in rTMS and sham groups, respectively, completed the full trial regimen, displaying a high dropout rate. Ten/30 (33%) of rTMS-treated patients tested negative for cocaine in urine, in contrast to 4/27 of placebo controls (p = 0.18, odd ratio 2.88, CI 0.9-10). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve did not state a significant change between the treated and sham groups in the time of cocaine urine negativisation (p = 0.20). However, the severity of cocaine-related cues mediated craving (VAS peak) was substantially decreased in the rTMS treated group (p<0.03) after treatment at T1, corresponding to the end of rTMS treatment. Furthermore, in the rTMS and sham groups, self-reported days of cocaine use decreased significantly (p<0.03). Finally, psychometric impulsivity parameters improved in rTMS-treated patients, while depression scales improved in both groups.In CUD, rTMS could be a useful tool for lowering cocaine craving and consumption.The study number on clinicalTrials.gov is NCT03607591."

Their benefits must be thoroughly evaluated given the risk of exclusion and stigma. The aim of this study is to present an initial programme theory that follows the principles of realist methodology. The theory development was guided by the question of the mechanisms at play in the context of dementia special care units to produce or influence outcomes of interest in people with dementia.The initial programme theory is based on qualitative interviews with dementia special care stakeholders in Germany and a realist review of complex interventions in dementia special care units. The interviews were analysed using content analysis techniques. For the realist review, a systematic literature search was conducted in four scientific databases; studies were appraised for quality and relevance. All data were analysed independently by two researchers. A realist informed logic model was developed, and context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were described.We reviewed 16 empirical studies and interviewed 16 stakeholders. In the interviews, contextual factors at the system, organisation and individual levels that influence the provision of care in dementia special care units were discussed. The interviewees described the following four interventions typical of dementia special care units: adaptation to the environment, family and public involvement, provision of activities and behaviour management. With exception of family and public involvement, these interventions were the focus of the reviewed studies. The outcomes of interest of stakeholders include responsive behaviour and quality of life, which were also investigated in the empirical studies. By combining data from interviews and a realist review, we framed three CMO configurations relevant to environment, activity, and behaviour management.As important contextual factors of dementia special care units, we discuss the transparency of policies to regulate dementia care, segregation and admission policies, purposeful recruitment and education of staff and a good fit between residents and their environment."
https://openalex.org/W3212870950,"While shifts to high-intensity land cover have caused overwhelming biodiversity loss, it remains unclear how important natural land cover is to the occurrence, and thus the conservation, of different species groups. We used over 4 million plant species' observations to evaluate the conservation importance of natural land cover by its association with the occurrence probability of 1 122 native and 403 exotic plant species at 1 km resolution by species distribution models. We found that 74.9% of native species, 83.9% of the threatened species and 77.1% rare species preferred landscapes with over 50% natural land cover, while these landscapes only accounted for 15.6% of all grids. Most species preferred natural areas with a mixture of forest and open areas rather than areas with completely open or forested nature. Compared to native species, exotic species preferred areas with lower natural land cover and the cover of natural open area, but they both preferred extremely high and low cover of natural forest area. Threatened and rare species preferred higher natural land cover, either cover of natural forest area or cover of natural open area than not threatened and common species, but rare species were also more likely to occur in landscapes with 0-25% cover of natural open area. Although more natural land cover in a landscape will not automatically result in more native species, because there is often a non-linear increase in species occurrence probability when going from 0% to 100% natural land cover, for conserving purposes, over 80% natural land cover should be kept in landscapes for conserving threatened and very rare species, and 60% natural land cover is the best for conserving common native species. Our results stress the importance of natural areas for plant species' conservation. It also informs improvements to species conservation by increasing habitat diversity."

Although the Weight Efficacy Life-Style questionnaire (WEL) is one of the most widely used eating self-efficacy tools, its French validation is lacking. The objective of this research was to validate a French version of the WEL in a general and a clinical sample, and to explore the links between eating self-efficacy and psychosocial variables. In study 1, the general population sample included 432 adults (93% of women, mean age = 43.18 ± 11.93 years). In study 2, the clinical sample included 2010 adults with overweight and obesity (87% of women, mean age = 44.44 ± 11.25 years). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. Two distinct versions of the WEL were retained: a 12-item questionnaire intended for use in the general population, named WEL-Fr-G, and an 11-item questionnaire for clinical samples, named WEL-Fr-C. The two French versions of the WEL presented strong reliability and sensibility. In addition, study 2 provided support for the measurement invariance of the WEL-Fr-C across sex and Body Mass Index. The two versions are therefore psychometrically sound instruments for assessing eating self-efficacy in the general population (WEL-Fr-G) and clinical samples (WEL-Fr-C)."
https://openalex.org/W3213309266,"This study investigates if and under which conditions humans are able to identify and follow the most advantageous leader who will them provide with the most resources. In an iterated economic game with the aim of earning monetary reward, 150 participants were asked to repeatedly choose one out of four leaders. Unbeknownst to participants, the leaders were computer-controlled and programmed to yield different expected payout values that participants had to infer from repeated interaction over 30 rounds. Additionally, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: single, independent, or cohesion. The conditions were designed to investigate the ideal circumstances that lead to identifying the most advantageous leader: when participants are alone (single condition), in a group that lets individuals sample information about leaders independently (independent condition), or in a group that is rewarded for cohesive behavior (cohesion condition). Our results show that participants are generally able to identify the most advantageous leader. However, participants who were incentivized to act cohesively in a group were more likely to settle on a less advantageous leader. This suggests that cohesion might have a detrimental effect on group decision making. To test the validity of this finding, we explore possible explanations for this pattern, such as the length of exploration and exploitation phases, and present techniques to check for confounding factors in group experiments in order to identify or exclude them as alternative explanations. Finally, we show that the chosen reward structure of the game strongly affects the observed following behavior in the group and possibly occludes other effects. We conclude with a recommendation to carefully choose reward structures and evaluate possible alternative explanations in experimental group research that should further pursue the study of exploration/exploitation phases and the influence of group cohesion on group decision making as promising topics for further research."

Dieback and basal stem necrosis have been observed in the plants since 2016, and its recent spread has significantly affected plant growth and nut production. Therefore, a survey was conducted to evaluate the disease incidence at five sites in Linan County, China. The highest incidence was recorded at the Tuankou site at up to 11.39% in 2019. The oomycete, Phytophthora cinnamomi, was isolated from symptomatic plant tissue and plantation soil using baiting and selective media-based detection methods and identified. Artificial infection with the representative P. cinnamomi ST402 isolate produced vertically elongated discolorations in the outer xylem and necrotic symptoms in C. cathayensis seedlings in a greenhouse trial. Molecular detections based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) specific to P. cinnamomi ST402 were conducted. Result indicated that LAMP detection showed a high coherence level with the baiting assays for P. cinnamomi detection in the field. This study provides the evidence of existence of high-pathogenic P. cinnamomi in the C. cathayensis plantation soil in China and the insights into a convenient tool developed for conducting field monitoring of this aggressive pathogen."

Utilizing our HNSCC mouse model, we analyzed oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) induced by the active metabolite of a common smoke constituent, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene diol-epoxide (DBPDE). Analyzing protein expression by either immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, we identified biologic processes that are dysregulated in premalignant and invasive cancer lesions induced by DBPDE. Interestingly, p120ctn expression is downregulated in both stages of the disease. In addition to decreased p120ctn expression, there was also increased proliferation (as measured by Ki67), inflammation (as measured by NFkB (p65) expression), neovascularization (as measured by CD31) and recruitment of Ly6G-positive immune cells as well as strong EGFR expression. We also examined the effect of the chemopreventive agent black raspberry (BRB) on p120ctn and EGFR protein expression in DBPDE treated mice. p120ctn, but not EGFR, protein expression increased in mice treated with BRB. Our results suggest that modulation of p120ctn may, in part, account for the mechanism by which BRB inhibits DBPDE induced OSCC in mice."

Antioxidants are promising protectants against oxidative stress that could be applied in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food and feed industries. In this study, a thermostable and acidophilic superoxide dismutase (AaSOD) was used to develop an antioxidant product that can potentially protect organisms from oxidative stress related damages. The enzyme was successfully expressed as an extracelluar protein in Bacillus subtilis with a high yield. To obtain a feasible protocol for industrial production of AaSOD, the fermentation mediums that are commonly used for culturing B. subtilis were screened, the feasibility of expressing AaSOD without antibiotic as selection pressure was confirmed, and the effect of using lactose as an inducer instead of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was investigated. Batch fermentation was conducted to validate the optimized conditions for AaSOD production, and 6530 U mL-1 of SOD activity was obtained in the fermentation broth. The dry powder product of AaSOD with an activity of 22202 U g-1 was prepared by spray-drying and was administrated on zebrafish to test its function as a protectant against DON, and thus gained a significant redress of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by DON.

For the past decade, social media has indicated a positive role in communicating before, during, and after disasters. One important question that remained un-investigated is that whether social media efficiently connect affected individuals to disaster relief agencies, and if not, how AI models can use historical data from previous disasters to facilitate information exchange between the two groups. In this study, the BERT model is first fine-tuned using historical data and then it is used to classify the tweets associated with hurricanes Dorian and Harvey based on the type of information provided; and alongside, the network between users is constructed based on the retweets and replies on Twitter. Afterwards, some network metrics are used to measure the diffusion rate of each type of disaster-motivated information. The results show that the messages by disaster eyewitnesses get the least spread while the posts by governments and media have the highest diffusion rates through the network. Additionally, the ""cautions and advice"" messages get the most spread among other information types while ""infrastructure and utilities"" and ""affected individuals"" messages get the least diffusion even compared with ""sympathy and support"". The analysis suggests that facilitating the propagation of information provided by affected individuals, using AI models, will be a valuable strategy to pursue in order to accelerate communication between affected individuals and survival groups during the disaster and aftermath."
https://openalex.org/W3212866839,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the pathogenic bacterium Leptospira. The Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) is widely used as the gold standard for diagnosis of leptospirosis. In this method, diluted patient serum is mixed with serotype-determined Leptospires, and the presence or absence of aggregation is determined under a dark-field microscope to calculate the antibody titer. Problems of the current MAT method are 1) a requirement of examining many specimens per sample, and 2) a need of distinguishing contaminants from true aggregates to accurately identify positivity. Therefore, increasing efficiency and accuracy are the key to refine MAT. It is possible to achieve efficiency and standardize accuracy at the same time by automating the decision-making process. In this study, we built an automatic identification algorithm of MAT using a machine learning method to determine agglutination within microscopic images. The machine learned the features from 316 positive and 230 negative MAT images created with sera of Leptospira-infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) hamsters, respectively. In addition to the acquired original images, wavelet-transformed images were also considered as features. We utilized a support vector machine (SVM) as a proposed decision method. We validated the trained SVMs with 210 positive and 154 negative images. When the features were obtained from original or wavelet-transformed images, all negative images were misjudged as positive, and the classification performance was very low with sensitivity of 1 and specificity of 0. In contrast, when the histograms of wavelet coefficients were used as features, the performance was greatly improved with sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.99. We confirmed that the current algorithm judges the positive or negative of agglutinations in MAT images and gives the further possibility of automatizing MAT procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3213304079,"Code recommendation is an important feature of modern software development tools to improve the productivity of programmers. The current advanced techniques in code recommendation mostly focus on the crowd-based approach. The basic idea is to collect a large pool of available source code, extract the common code patterns, and utilize the patterns for recommendations. However, programmers are different in multiple aspects including coding preferences, styles, levels of experience, and knowledge about libraries and frameworks. These differences lead to various usages of code elements. When the code of multiple programmers is combined and mined, such differences are disappeared, which could limit the accuracy of the code recommendation tool for a specific programmer. In the paper, we develop a code recommendation technique that focuses on the personal coding patterns of programmers. We propose Persona, a personalized code recommendation model. It learns personalized code patterns for each programmer based on their coding history, while also combines with project-specific and common code patterns. Persona supports recommending code elements including variable names, class names, methods, and parameters. The empirical evaluation suggests that our recommendation tool based on Persona is highly effective. It recommends the next identifier with top-1 accuracy of 60-65% and outperforms the baseline approaches."

In prior work with our model, astrocytic HIV-1 Nef expression exhibits neurotoxic effects leading to neurological damage, learning impairment, and immune upregulation that induces inflammation in the lungs and small intestine (SI). In this follow-up study, we focus on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as the important branch for peripheral inflammation resulting from astrocytic Nef expression. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were infused with transfected astrocytes to produce Nef. The rats were divided in four groups: Nef, Nef + propranolol, propranolol and naïve. The beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, was administered for 3 consecutive days, starting one day prior to surgery. Two days after the surgery, the rats were sacrificed, and then blood, brain, small intestine (SI), and lung tissues were collected. Levels of IL-1β were higher in both male and female rats, and treatment with propranolol restored IL-1β to basal levels. We observed that Nef expression decreased staining of the tight junction protein claudin-5 in brain tissue while animals co-treated with propranolol restored claudin-5 expression. Lungs and SI of rats in the Nef group showed histological signs of damage including larger Peyer's Patches, increased tissue thickness, and infiltration of immune cells; these findings were abrogated by propranolol co-treatment. Results suggest that interruption of the beta adrenergic signaling reduces the peripheral organ inflammation caused after Nef expression in astrocytes of the brain."

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of these vaccinations in this population.Multimorbid patients aged ≥70 years with polypharmacy were enrolled in 4 European centers in Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Ireland. Data on vaccinations, demographics, health care contacts, and comorbidities were obtained from self-report, general practitioners and medical records. The association of comorbidities or medical contacts with vaccination status was assessed using multivariable adjusted log-binomial regression models.Among 1956 participants with available influenza vaccination data (median age 79 years, 45% women), 1314 (67%) received an influenza vaccination within the last year. Of 1400 patients with available pneumococcal vaccination data (median age 79 years, 46% women), prevalence of pneumococcal vaccination was 21% (n = 291). The prevalence of vaccination remained low in high-risk populations with chronic respiratory disease (34%) or diabetes (24%), but increased with an increasing number of outpatient medical contacts. Chronic respiratory disease was independently associated with the receipt of both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.16; and PR 2.03, 95%CI 1.22-3.40, respectively), as was diabetes (PR 1.06, 95%CI 1.03-1.08; PR 1.24, 95%CI 1.16-1.34, respectively). An independent association was found between number of general practitioner visits and higher prevalence of pneumococcal vaccination (p for linear trend <0.001).Uptake of influenza and particularly of pneumococcal vaccination in this population of European multimorbid older inpatients remains insufficient and is determined by comorbidities and number and type of health care contacts, especially outpatient medical visits. Hospitalization may be an opportunity to promote vaccination, particularly targeting patients with few outpatient physician contacts."
https://openalex.org/W3211781334,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common superficial candidiasis; however, a host's immunological mechanism against vaginal Candida infection remains unknown.In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of iNKT cell activation on vulvovaginal candidiasis.Using a vulvovaginal candidiasis model with estrogenized mice, we evaluated the fungal burden and number of leukocyte infiltrations in the vaginal lavage of wild-type C57BL/6J mice after Candida albicans inoculation. One day before C. albicans inoculation, α-galactosylceramide (the α-GalCer group) or sterile phosphate-buffered saline (the sham group) was intraperitoneally injected into the mice. We also evaluated the level of antimicrobial peptide S100A8 in the vaginal lavage and analyzed the correlation between S100A8 concentration and the number of vaginal leukocyte infiltrations. Moreover, the number of uterine and vaginal immune cells were evaluated using flow cytometry.The number of vaginal leukocyte infiltrations was significantly higher in the α-GalCer group than in the sham group 3 days after C. albicans inoculation. In addition, the fungal burden was significantly lower in the α-GalCer group than the sham group at 7 days after inoculation. In the analysis of S100A8 concentration of vaginal lavage, there were no significant differences between these two groups, although S100A8 concentration and the number of vaginal leukocyte infiltrations were positively correlated in the α-GalCer group. Moreover, the number of vaginal iNKT cells, NK cells and CD8+ T-cells was significantly higher in the α-GalCer group 3 days after inoculation.α-GalCer-stimulated iNKT cells likely play a protective role against vulvovaginal candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W3211792356,"This paper presents the design of a Built-in-self-Test (BIST) implemented Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptoprocessor Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). AES has been proved as the strongest symmetric encryption algorithm declared by USA Govt. and it outperforms all other existing cryptographic algorithms. Its hardware implementation offers much higher speed and physical security than that of its software implementation. Due to this reason, a number of AES cryptoprocessor ASIC have been presented in the literature, but the problem of testability in the complex AES chip is not addressed yet. This research introduces a solution to the problem for the AES cryptoprocessor ASIC implementing mixed-mode BIST technique, a hybrid of pseudo-random and deterministic techniques. The BIST implemented ASIC is designed using IEEE industry standard Hardware Description Language(HDL). It has been simulated using Electronic Design Automation (EDA)tools for verification and validation using the input-output data from the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) of the USA Govt. The simulation results show that the design is working as per desired functionalities in different modes of operation of the ASIC. The current research is compared with those of other researchers, and it shows that it is unique in terms of BIST implementation into the ASIC chip."
https://openalex.org/W3212231116,"Current clinical strategies to assess benefits from hearing aids (HAs) are based on self-reported questionnaires and speech-in-noise (SIN) tests; which require behavioural cooperation. Instead, objective measures based on Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) to speech stimuli would not require the individuals' cooperation. Here, we re-analysed an existing dataset to predict behavioural measures with speech-ABRs using regression trees. Ninety-two HA users completed a self-reported questionnaire (SSQ-Speech) and performed two aided SIN tests: sentences in noise (BKB-SIN) and vowel-consonant-vowels (VCV) in noise. Speech-ABRs were evoked by a 40 ms [da] and recorded in 2x2 conditions: aided vs. unaided and quiet vs. background noise. For each recording condition, two sets of features were extracted: 1) amplitudes and latencies of speech-ABR peaks, 2) amplitudes and latencies of speech-ABR F0 encoding. Two regression trees were fitted for each of the three behavioural measures with either feature set and age, digit-span forward and backward, and pure tone average (PTA) as possible predictors. The PTA was the only predictor in the SSQ-Speech trees. In the BKB-SIN trees, performance was predicted by the aided latency of peak F in quiet for participants with PTAs between 43 and 61 dB HL. In the VCV trees, performance was predicted by the aided F0 encoding latency and the aided amplitude of peak VA in quiet for participants with PTAs ≤ 47 dB HL. These findings indicate that PTA was more informative than any speech-ABR measure, as these were relevant only for a subset of the participants. Therefore, speech-ABRs evoked by a 40 ms [da] are not a clinical predictor of behavioural measures in HA users."

Understanding BRMS1 functionality will provide insights into both mechanism of action and will enhance potential therapeutic development. In this study, we confirmed that the C-terminus of BRMS1 is critical for metastasis suppression and hypothesized that critical protein interactions in this region would explain its function. Phosphorylation status at S237 regulates BRMS1 protein interactions related to a variety of biological processes, phenotypes [cell cycle (e.g., CDKN2A), DNA repair (e.g., BRCA1)], and metastasis [(e.g., TCF2 and POLE2)]. Presence of S237 also directly decreased MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma migration in vitro and metastases in vivo. The results add significantly to our understanding of how BRMS1 interactions with Sin3/HDAC complexes regulate metastasis and expand insights into BRMS1's molecular role, as they demonstrate BRMS1 C-terminus involvement in distinct protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3214134415,"This study aims to explore the relation between conflict in the project team and user resistance to change in software projects. Following a cross-sectional research design, a survey was conducted among 1,000 largest companies in Slovenia (N = 114). The results of PLS-SEM analysis indicate that task and process conflicts in the project team are associated with user resistance. This study is among the first to associate conflict within the project team and user resistance in the implementing organization. It is also one of the first studies to investigate the relations between different types of conflict and user resistance. Project managers may invest resources into adequately managing conflicts within the project team related to tasks in which the project team interacts with users of developed software to lower user resistance. Project with poorly defined roles (e.g., agile and information security projects) may be more prone to user resistance than projects with clearly defined roles."
https://openalex.org/W3214376439,"Information on the level of knowledge about cystic fibrosis (CF) among affected people and their families is still scarce.This study aimed to translate, cross-culturally adapt and analyze the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of Cystic Fibrosis Knowledge Scale (CFKS).The translation and cross-cultural adaptation involved the stages of translation, synthesis of translations, reverse translation, synthesis of reverse translations, review by a multi-professional committee of experts and pre-testing. The reliability, viability, construct, predictive, concurrent and discriminant validity were investigated.The sample consisted of 40 individuals with cystic CF, 47 individuals with asthma, 242 healthcare workers and 81 students from the health area. The Brazilian version of the CFKS presented high internal consistency (α = 0.91), moderate floor and ceiling effects, without differences in the test-retest scores. An analysis of factorial exploration identified three dimensions. Confirmatory factor analysis led to an acceptable data-model fit. There was good predictive validity, with a difference in the scores among all the evaluated groups (p <0.001), as well as good discriminant validity since individuals with asthma had greater knowledge of asthma compared to CF (r = 0.401, p = 0.005; r2 = 0.162). However, there was no difference between the diagnosis time and knowledge about CF (r = -0.25, p = 0.11; r2 = 0.06), either between treatment adherence and knowledge about CF (r = -0.04, p = 0.77; r2 = 0.002).The Brazilian version of the CFKS indicated that the scale is able to provide valid, reliable and reproducible measures for evaluating the knowledge about CF."
