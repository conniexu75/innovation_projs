https://openalex.org/W2062853648,"We report here that BID, a BH3 domain–containing proapoptotic Bcl2 family member, is a specific proximal substrate of Casp8 in the Fas apoptotic signaling pathway. While full-length BID is localized in cytosol, truncated BID (tBID) translocates to mitochondria and thus transduces apoptotic signals from cytoplasmic membrane to mitochondria. tBID induces first the clustering of mitochondria around the nuclei and release of cytochrome c independent of caspase activity, and then the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell shrinkage, and nuclear condensation in a caspase-dependent fashion. Coexpression of BclxL inhibits all the apoptotic changes induced by tBID. Our results indicate that BID is a mediator of mitochondrial damage induced by Casp8."
https://openalex.org/W2012173926,"We report here the purification of a cytosolic protein that induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria in response to caspase-8, the apical caspase activated by cell surface death receptors such as Fas and TNF. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified this protein as Bid, a BH3 domain–containing protein known to interact with both Bcl2 and Bax. Caspase-8 cleaves Bid, and the COOH-terminal part translocates to mitochondria where it triggers cytochrome c release. Immunodepletion of Bid from cell extracts eliminated the cytochrome c releasing activity. The cytochrome c releasing activity of Bid was antagonized by Bcl2. A mutation at the BH3 domain diminished its cytochrome c releasing activity. Bid, therefore, relays an apoptotic signal from the cell surface to mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2059524588,"Heat shock and other proteotoxic stresses cause accumulation of nonnative proteins that trigger activation of heat shock protein (Hsp) genes. A chaperone/Hsp functioning as repressor of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) could make activation of hsp genes dependent on protein unfolding. In a novel in vitro system, in which human HSF1 can be activated by nonnative protein, heat, and geldanamycin, addition of Hsp90 inhibits activation. Reduction of the level of Hsp90 but not of Hsp/c70, Hop, Hip, p23, CyP40, or Hsp40 dramatically activates HSF1. In vivo, geldanamycin activates HSF1 under conditions in which it is an Hsp90-specific reagent. Hsp90-containing HSF1 complex is present in the unstressed cell and dissociates during stress. We conclude that Hsp90, by itself and/or associated with multichaperone complexes, is a major repressor of HSF1."
https://openalex.org/W2108116605,"The mechanism by which 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression is unknown. To determine whether changes in isoprenoid synthesis affects eNOS expression, human endothelial cells were treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevastatin (1–10 μm), in the presence ofl-mevalonate (200 μm), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP, 1–10 μm), farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP, 5–10 μm), or low density lipoprotein (LDL, 1 mg/ml). Mevastatin increased eNOS mRNA and protein levels by 305 ± 15% and 180 ± 11%, respectively. Co-treatment with l-mevalonate or GGPP, but not FPP or LDL, reversed mevastatin's effects. Because Rho GTPases undergo geranylgeranyl modification, we investigated whether Rho regulates eNOS expression. Immunoblot analyses and [35S]GTPγS-binding assays revealed that mevastatin inhibited Rho membrane translocation and GTP binding activity by 60 ± 5% and 78 ± 6%, both of which were reversed by co-treatment with GGPP but not FPP. Furthermore, inhibition of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (50 μg/ml) or by overexpression of a dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant increased eNOS expression. In contrast, activation of Rho byEscherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (200 ng/ml) decreased eNOS expression. These findings indicate that Rho negatively regulates eNOS expression and that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors up-regulate eNOS expression by blocking Rho geranylgeranylation, which is necessary for its membrane-associated activity.

Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)1-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease the incidence of ischemic strokes and myocardial infarctions in atherosclerotic and hypercholesterolemic individuals (1Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group Lancet. 1994; 344: 1383-1389Abstract PubMed Scopus (11310) Google Scholar,2Shepherd J.

Although the beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are primarily attributed to their lipid-lowering effects, subgroup analyses of the data from these trials suggest that there may be beneficial effects of these agents that are independent of serum cholesterol levels (3Packard C.J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). For example, the restoration of endothelial function is one of the earliest recognizable benefits after treatment with these agents, sometimes occurring before significant reduction in serum cholesterol levels (4Treasure C.B. Klein J.L. Weintraub W.S. Talley J.D. Stillabower M.E. Kosinski A.S. Zhang J. Boccuzzi S.J. Cedarholm J.C. Alexander R.W. N. Engl. J.

Indeed, we have previously shown that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and lovastatin, reverse the down-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression by hypoxia and oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) under cholesterol-clamped conditions (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Although hypercholesterolemia impairs endothelial function and plasma LDL apheresis improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation (9Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 10Liao J.K. Clark S.L. J. Clin.

Circulation. 1997; 95: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), there is growing evidence that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may have additional effects on eNOS activity beyond that of cholesterol reduction. By inhibiting l-mevalonate synthesis, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also prevent the synthesis of other important isoprenoid intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, such as farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) (12Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). The isoprenoids are important lipid attachments for the post-translational modification of variety of proteins, including the γ subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, heme a, nuclear lamins, Ras, and Ras-like proteins, such as Rho, Rab, Rac, Ral, or Rap (13Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 14Gebbink M. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These isoprenoid intermediates permit the covalent attachment, subcellular localization, and intracellular trafficking of membrane-associated proteins. The role that isoprenoids play in regulating eNOS expression, however, is not known. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to identify the isoprenoid intermediate(s) and the post-translationally modified protein(s) which regulate eNOS expression. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Mevastatin, farnesylpyrophosphate, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, l-mevalonate, and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) were purchased from Sigma. Mevastatin (compactin) was chemically activated by alkaline hydrolysis prior to use as described previously (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). FPT inhibitor I and α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid were purchased from Calbiochem. [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) were supplied by NEN Life Science Products. The antibody detection kit (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) and the nylon nucleic acid (Hybond) and protein (polyvinylidene difluoride) transfer membranes were purchased from Amersham Corp. The Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). Recombinant Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF)-1, RhoA mutants, and [−1.6 kb] eNOS-luciferase promoter construct were kindly provided by K. Aktories (University of Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany), W. Moolenaar (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and W. Sessa (Yale University, New Haven, CT), respectively. Human endothelial cells were harvested using Type II collagenase (Worthington) and cultured in Medium 199, 20 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth serum (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate, 5 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml)/Fungizone (1.25 μg/ml) as described previously (7Laufs U.

For transfection studies, bovine aortic endothelial cells of less than three passages were cultured in a growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), 5 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal calf serum. Cellular viability was determined by cell count, morphology, and trypan blue exclusion. The LDL was prepared by discontinuous ultracentrifugation of freshly isolated plasma according to the method of Chung et al. (15Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Krauss R.M. Beaudrie K. Cone J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 128: 181-209Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The purity of the LDL samples was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide and cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis. Protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride content were determined as described previously (8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 9Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol.

For comparison, commercially available LDL (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were similarly characterized and used in selected experiments. The extent of LDL oxidation was estimated by assaying for thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and expressed as nanomoles of malondialdehyde per mg of LDL protein (16Yagi K. Biochem. Med. 1976; 15: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). Only freshly isolated LDL with thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values of less than 0.5 nmol/mg was used in this study. Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg) were separated by 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and radiolabeling of human full-length eNOS cDNA was performed as described (9Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Conditions for hybridization and washing were performed as described (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K.

RNA loading was determined by ethidium bromide staining of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA on the nylon membranes. Proteins were prepared and separated on SDS-PAGE as described (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K.

Immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal antibodies to eNOS (1:400 dilution, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), to RhoA and RhoB (1:250 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and to c-myc tag (9E10, 1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Immunodetection was accomplished using a sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000 dilution) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Corp.). Autoradiography was performed at 23 °C, and the appropriate exposures were quantitated by densitometry. The Rho GTP binding activity was determined by immunoprecipitation of [35S]GTPγS-labeled Rho. Briefly, membrane and cytosolic proteins were isolated as described previously (10Liao J.K. Clark S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed as described (10Liao J.K. Clark S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples were then resuspended in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%), SDS (0.1%), NaCl (150 mm), EDTA (5 mm), Tris-HCl (25 mm, pH 7.4), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). The RhoA or RhoB antisera were added to the mixture at a final dilution of 1:75. The samples were allowed to incubate for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The antibody-G protein complexes were then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Preliminary studies using Western analysis of the supernatant indicated that both RhoA and RhoB were completely immunoprecipitated under these conditions. The pellets were washed four times in a buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.4), NaF (100 μm), sodium phosphate (50 mm), NaCl (100 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), and SDS (0.1%). The final pellet containing the immunoprecipitated [35S]GTPγS-labeled Rho proteins was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 1800, Beckman Instruments). Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled GTPγS (100 μm). For transfection studies, bovine rather than human endothelial cells were used because of their higher transfection efficiency by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Bovine endothelial cells (60–70% confluent) were transfected with 15 μg of the indicated cDNAs: the insertless vector (pcDNA3), pcDNA3-c-myc-wtRhoA (wild type RhoA), pcDNA3-c-myc-N19RhoA (dominant-negative RhoA mutant), or a [−1.6 kb] eNOS promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (18Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As an internal control for transfection efficiency, pCMV.β-Gal plasmid (5 μg) was co-transfected. Preliminary results using β-galactosidase staining indicate that cellular transfection efficiency was approximately 14%. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested for immunoblot analyses of eNOS expression. The eNOS protein levels were then standardized to the corresponding levels of transfected RhoA expression as determined by antisera to the corresponding c-myc tag. For luciferase activity, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were determined by a chemiluminescence assay (Dual-Light, Tropix, Bedford, MA) using a Berthold L9501 luminometer. The eNOS promoter activity was expressed as the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity. The eNOS activity was determined by a modified nitrite assay using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene as described previously (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of 1-(H)-naphthotriazole was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 450 nm, respectively. Standard curves were constructed with known amounts of sodium nitrite. Nonspecific fluorescence was determined in the presence of LNMA (3 mm). Relatively pure (>98%) human saphenous vein and aortic endothelial cell cultures were confirmed by their morphological features (i.e. cuboidal, cobblestone, contact-inhibited) using phase-contrast microscopy and immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to Factor VIII (data not shown). There were no observable adverse effects of mevastatin, FPP, GGPP, C3 transferase, and CNF-1 on cellular viability. However, higher concentrations of mevastatin (>50 μm) or CNF-1 (>5 μg/ml) did produce cytotoxicity and therefore were not used. Cellular confluency and viability as determined by light microscopy and trypan blue exclusion were maintained for all treatment conditions described. We previously reported that inhibition of endothelial HMG-CoA reductase by lovastatin or simvastatin up-regulates eNOS expression and activity (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment with mevastatin (10 μm) increased eNOS protein levels by 180 ± 11% after 24 h (p < 0.05, n = 4) (Fig. 1). To determine which downstream isoprenoid intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway regulates eNOS expression, endothelial cells were treated with mevastatin (10 μm) in the presence of isoprenoid intermediates, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), or LDL-cholesterol. Co-treatment with FPP (10 μm) or LDL (1 mg/ml) did not significantly reverse the effects of mevastatin on eNOS protein levels. Furthermore, inhibition of protein farnesyltransferase with the FTase inhibitor I (0.5–50 μm) or α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid (2–20 μm) did not affect eNOS protein levels (data not shown). In contrast, co-treatment with GGPP at a concentration of 10 μm, but not 1 μm, completely reversed the up-regulation of eNOS protein levels by mevastatin (Fig. 1). These findings indicate that eNOS expression is negatively regulated by geranylgeranyl synthesis. Similar effects were observed in aortic endothelial cells and with the more lipophilic isoprenoid derivatives, geranylgeraniol and farnesiol (data not shown). Treatment of endothelial cells with mevastatin (10 μm) increased eNOS steady-state mRNA levels by 305 ± 15% after 24 h (Fig. 2 A). On a molar basis, we find that mevastatin is equally potent compared with lovastatin but approximately four times less potent compared with simvastatin (data not shown). This is consistent with their relative IC50values for HMG-CoA reductase inhibition (19Blum C.B. Am. J. Cardiol. 1994; 73: 3D-11DAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Co-treatment with FPP (10 μm) minimally affected eNOS mRNA levels compared with mevastatin alone. However, co-treatment with GGPP (10 μm) completely reversed the up-regulation of eNOS mRNA levels by mevastatin. In a concentration-dependent manner, GGPP reversed the effects of mevastatin (10 μm) with complete reversal occurring at a GGPP concentration of 5 μm (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, treatment with GGPP (10 μm) alone did not significantly affect basal eNOS mRNA levels. Previous nuclear run-on studies did not reveal any significant effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on eNOS gene transcription (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Using the RNA polymerase inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB), we find that the half-life of eNOS mRNA under basal tissue culture conditions was 14 ± 2 h (Fig. 2 C). Treatment with mevastatin increased eNOS mRNA half-life to 27 ± 3 h (p < 0.05), which was completely reversed in the presence of GGPP (16 ± 3 h). Thus, the prolongation of eNOS mRNA half-life by mevastatin as determined by DRB correlates with the increase in steady-state eNOS mRNA levels. The geranylgeranylation of the small GTPases, RhoA and RhoB, are essential for their membrane translocation from the cytosol (20Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Under basal culture conditions, both RhoA and RhoB are present in the membranes and cytosol (Fig. 3). Treatment with mevastatin decreased membrane localization of RhoA and RhoB by 60 ± 5% and 78 ± 6% with reciprocal concomitant increases in RhoA and RhoB in the cytosol by 65 ± 4% and 87 ± 7% (p < 0.05 compared with basal condition for all values). Co-treatment with GGPP (5 μm), but not FPP (10 μm), reversed the effects of mevastatin and completely restored the amount of cytosolic and membrane-associated RhoA and RhoB to basal levels. Mevastatin also decreased membrane-associated Ras by 55 ± 7% with concomitant appearance of a higher molecular weight Ras in the cytosolic extracts (Fig. 3). Previous studies have shown that farnesylated Ras migrates slightly faster on SDS-PAGE than unmodified Ras (21Hohl R.J. Lewis K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17508-17512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to RhoA and RhoB, membrane-associated Ras was completely restored in the presence of FPP, but not GGPP. These findings suggest that inhibition of Rho geranylgeranylation by mevastatin specifically prevents RhoA and RhoB from translocating to and associating with the cellular membrane. To determine whether geranylgeranylation of RhoA and RhoB affects their activity (i.e. GTP-bound state), we immunoprecipitated [35S]GTPγS-labeled RhoA and RhoB from the membrane and cytosol of endothelial cells treated with mevastatin (10 μm) in the presence of GGPP (5 μm) or FPP (10 μm) (Fig. 4). Under basal conditions, endothelial cells have membrane-associated RhoA and RhoB activity of 4.4 ± 0.1 fmol/mg/min and 3.8 ± 0.4 fmol/mg/min, respectively. Treatment with mevastatin decreased membrane-associated RhoA and RhoB GTP binding activity by 52% (2.1 ± 0.4 fmol/mg/min; p < 0.01,n = 3) and 37% (2.4 ± 0.6 fmol/mg/min;p < 0.05, n = 3), respectively. Co-treatment with FPP (10 μm) produced no significant effects on RhoA and RhoB GTP binding activity compared with mevastatin alone (2.6 ± 0.9 fmol/mg/min and 2.7 ± 0.5 fmol/mg/min, respectively, p > 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 5). However, co-treatment with GGPP (10 μm) completely reversed the inhibitory effects of mevastatin on RhoA and RhoB GTP binding activity (4.1 ± 0.3 fmol/mg/min and 3.6 ± 0.5 fmol/mg/min, respectively,p < 0.05, n = 3). Cytosolic RhoA and RhoB are relatively inactive in the GDP-bound state, and therefore, their GTP binding activities (i.e. <1 fmol/mg/min) were not significantly affected by treatment with mevastatin alone or in combination with GGPP or FPP (p > 0.05). To determine whether the inhibition of Rho mediates the effects of mevastatin on eNOS expression, endothelial cells were treated with mevastatin in the presence and absence of C. botulinum C3 transferase (5–50 μg/ml), an exoenzyme which inactivates Rho by ADP-ribosylation (22Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar). Treatment of endothelial cells with mevastatin (10 μm) or C3 transferase (50 μg/ml) for 48 h augmented eNOS protein levels by 260 ± 9% and 250 ± 10%, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 5 A). Lower concentrations of C3 transferase (i.e.<50 μg/ml) produced correspondingly smaller increases in eNOS expression (data not shown). In contrast to the effect of mevastatin, the stimulatory effect of C3 transferase on eNOS expression, however, was not reversed in the presence of l-mevalonate (200 μm). Overexpression of wtRhoA slightly decreased basal eNOS protein expression by 20% suggesting that endogenous RhoA activity exerts near-maximal inhibition on eNOS expression under basal conditions (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, endothelial cells overexpressing N19RhoA mutant to comparable levels as wtRhoA as assessed by the amount of c-myc tag exhibited a 150 ± 5% increase in eNOS protein levels (p < 0.05, n = 3). Immunostaining for β-galactosidase activity demonstrates comparable transfection efficiency among the RhoA constructs and between treatment conditions. These findings are consistent with our earlier findings that inhibition of Rho GTPase activity by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or C3 transferase leads to an increase in eNOS expression. Previous nuclear run-on assays and eNOS promoter studies did not show any effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on eNOS gene transcription (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rho affects eNOS promoter activity, endothelial cells were transfected with a functional [−1.6 kb] eNOS promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (18Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Laminar flow, which is known to increase eNOS gene transcription, served as a positive control and was produced in a parallel chamber as described (23Lin M.C. Almus F. Chen H.H. Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. Shyy J.Y.J. Chien S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Exposure of transfected endothelial cells to laminar flow (12 dynes/cm2) produced an 8-fold increase in eNOS promoter activity (p < 0.01 compared with no treatment) (Fig. 5 C). Co-transfection with wild type (wt) RhoA or with the RhoA dominant-negative mutant, N19Rho, had no effect on eNOS promoter activity (p > 0.05 compared with basal activity). Similarly, inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase also did not significantly affect eNOS promoter activity (p > 0.05 compared with basal activity). Treatment with mevastatin (10 μm) did not increase basal or laminar flow-induced eNOS promoter activity (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous nuclear run-on studies showing that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have no effects on eNOS gene transcription (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). The E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF)-1 is known to directly and specifically activate Rho by preventing Rho GTP hydrolysis via glutamine deamidation (22Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar, 24Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Treatment of endothelial cells with mevastatin (10 μm) increased eNOS mRNA levels by 290 ± 15% compared with basal levels (p < 0.01,n = 3) (Fig. 6). Co-treatment with CNF-1 (200 ng/ml) completely reversed the up-regulation of eNOS mRNA by mevastatin (p > 0.05 compared with basal levels, n = 3). Treatment with CNF-1 (200 ng/ml) alone, however, decreased eNOS steady-state mRNA levels to 48 ± 6% of basal levels at 24 h (p < 0.05, n = 3). These findings indicate that the direct activation of Rho leads to the down-regulation of eNOS expression. Endothelial NO production was assessed by measuring the LNMA-inhibitable nitrite accumulation in conditioned media of endothelial cells (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Basal NO production was 9.7 ± 1.4 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h (Fig. 7). Treatment of endothelial cells with mevastatin (10 μm) resulted in a 3-fold increase in NO production (32 ± 1.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p < 0.01). This increase in endothelial NO production by mevastatin was reversed by co-treatment with GGPP (5 μm), but not FPP (10 μm) (12 ± 0.8 and 27 ± 4.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, respectively). Furthermore, direct activation of Rho proteins by CNF-1 (200 ng/ml) reversed mevastatin-induced increase in endothelial NO production (32 ± 1.9 to 14 ± 2.1 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h,p < 0.05). In contrast, inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase (50 μg/ml) resulted in a 3-fold increase in NO production (31 ± 2.1 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, respectively,p < 0.05). In this study, we have identified the isoprenoid intermediate, geranylgeraniol, and its post-translationally modified protein, Rho, as important regulators of eNOS expression. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevastatin, decreases Rho geranylgeranylation, membrane translocation, and GTP binding activity and leads to the up-regulation of eNOS expression. All of these effects of mevastatin were reversed in the presence of GGPP, but not FPP or LDL cholesterol, indicating that geranylgeranyl modification of Rho negatively regulates eNOS expression. Interestingly, treatment with l-mevalonate or GGPP alone did not affect eNOS expression suggesting maximal Rho geranylgeranylation under basal tissue culture conditions. However, direct activation of Rho by CNF-1 resulted in a decrease in basal eNOS expression suggesting that further activation of membrane-associated Rho or perhaps activation of cytosolic Rho leads to decreases in eNOS expression below basal levels. The Rho GTPase family, which includes RhoA, RhoB, Rac, and Cdc42, are major substrates for post-translational modification by geranylgeranylation and that geranylgeranylation targets these Rho GTPases to the membrane (12Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar, 13Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 20Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The membrane translocation of inactive or GDP-bound Rho involves the release of its cytoplasmic inhibitor, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, and activation of Rho through GDP/GTP exchange in the presence of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (25Gosser Y.Q. Nomanbhoy T.K. Aghazadeh B. Manor D. Combs C. Cerione R.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because most of the cytoplasmic Rho proteins are inactive (GDP-bound state), their GTP binding activity remains invariably low even with statin treatment. Thus, inhibition of Rho geranylgeranylation and membrane translocation by mevastatin leads to a greater accumulation of inactive Rho in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with our finding that addition of GGPP, but not FPP, restores membrane expression and activity of Rho and results in the down-regulation of eNOS expression. The inhibitory effect of Rho on eNOS expression was further confirmed by studies showing that inhibition of Rho by C. botulinum C3 transferase also increases eNOS expression. The C3 transferase ADP-ribosylates asparagine 41 of RhoA and RhoB and renders them biologically inactive in the GDP-bound state (22Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar). Although under certain circumstances the C3 transferase may also ADP-ribosylate Rac-1 or Cdc42 (22Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 12: S11-S13Google Scholar, 24Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), our results showing that the overexpression of a dominant-negative RhoA mutant, N19RhoA, increases eNOS expression are consistent with the inhibitory effects of C3 transferase on Rho. In contrast, direct activation of Rho by E. coli CNF-1 leads to a decrease in eNOS expression (24Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These results, therefore, identify membrane-associated Rho as a negative regulator of eNOS expression and activity. Previous actinomycin D studies indicate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors prolong eNOS mRNA half-life from approximately 30 to 45 h (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). However, such relatively small increases in eNOS mRNA stability cannot entirely account for the 3-fold increase in steady-state eNOS mRNA levels after 24 h. Thus, it is possible that the actinomycin D used in our previous studies may not be the optimal reagent to assess eNOS mRNA stability because it may produce false prolongation of eNOS mRNA half-life by either interacting directly with eNOS mRNA or by preferentially inhibiting the transcription and subsequent translation of protein(s) which degrades eNOS mRNA. Because we have previously established that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have no effect on eNOS gene transcription (7Laufs U. La Fata V. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31725-31729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8Laufs U. La Fata V. Plutzky J. Liao J.K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar), our finding showing that mevastatin increased eNOS mRNA half-life from 14 to 27 h with another RNA polymerase inhibitor, DRB, is in closer agreement with the expected increase in steady-state eNOS mRNA levels after 24 h. The activation of Rho leads to actin stress-fiber formation, focal adhesion assembly, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (20Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar,27Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors up-regulate eNOS expression predominantly via stabilization of eNOS mRNA, it is likely from the findings of this study that Rho-mediated cytoskeletal changes affect eNOS mRNA stability. Recent studies demonstrate that cytoplasmatic filaments and microtubules are necessary to transport mRNAs within the cytoplasm and to anchor them at specific subcellular locations (28Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,29Bassell G. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The anchoring of mRNAs to the cytoskeleton and their co-localization with ribosomes and RNA-binding protein complexes are necessary for their translational expression and stability. Thus, Rho-controlled reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton may play a key role in the movement and compartmentalization of specific mRNAs. For example, the peripheral localization of β-actin mRNA is required for the assembly of contractile and motility apparatus at the leading edge of moving cells (29Bassell G. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Rho decreases eNOS mRNA translation and stability via effects on the cytoskeletal localization of eNOS mRNA. Endothelial dysfunction, which is often defined as a decrease in eNOS activity or NO bioavailability is one of the earliest manifestations of atherosclerosis, occurring even in the absence of angiographic evidence of disease (30Werns S.W. Walton J.A. Hsia H.H. Nabel E.G. Sanz M.L. Pitt B. Circulation. 1989; 79: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 31McLenachan J.M. Williams J.K. Fish R.D. Ganz P. Selwyn A.P.

Cardiol. 1994; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Atherogenic risk factors and decreased eNOS activity are strongly correlated, and improved endothelial function is an early clinical marker following atherogenic risk factor modification. For example, LDL, especially oxidized LDL, is a potent inhibitor of endothelial function (9Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 33Creager M.A. Cooke J.P. Mendelsohn M.E. Gallagher S.J. Coleman S.M. Loscalzo J. Dzau V.J. J. Clin.

Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), decreased receptor-mediated NO release (10Liao J.K. Clark S.L. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NO inactivation via increases in superoxide anion production (35Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Indeed, endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of hypercholesterolemia and rapidly improves with cholesterol reduction (4Treasure C.B. Klein J.L. Weintraub W.S. Talley J.D. Stillabower M.E.

Circulation. 1997; 95: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, some of the beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in terms of eNOS expression and restoration of endothelial function occur via mechanism(s) independent of serum cholesterol levels (3Packard C.J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 6O‘Driscoll G. Green D. Taylor R.R. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 7Laufs U.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the up-regulation of eNOS expression by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is mediated by inhibition of Rho GTPase. Because decreases in eNOS expression and activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension, therapeutic modalities used to selectively inhibit endothelial Rho activity may prove to be beneficial. We propose that some of the beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases are not related to their cholesterol-lowering effects but to their ability to inhibit Rho geranylgeranylation. The mechanism(s) by which Rho decreases the stability of eNOS mRNA, however, remains to be determined. We thank W. Moolenaar, K. Aktories, and W. Sessa for kindly providing RhoA mutant cDNAs, CNF-1, and the eNOS promoter-luciferase construct, respectively. We are grateful to J.

https://openalex.org/W2018237947,The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins are known to initiate V(D)J recombination by making a double-strand break between the recombination signal sequence (RSS) and the neighboring coding DNA. We show that these proteins can also drive the coupled insertion of cleaved recombination signals into new DNA sites in a transpositional reaction. This RAG-mediated DNA transfer provides strong evidence for the evolution of the V(D)J recombination system from an ancient mobile DNA element and suggests that repeated transposition may have promoted the expansion of the antigen receptor loci. The inappropriate diversion of V(D)J rearrangement to a transpositional pathway may also help to explain certain types of DNA translocation associated with lymphatic tumors.

Ras proteins operate as molecular switches in signal transduction pathways downstream of tyrosine kinases. An interesting yet unresolved issue is whether the Ras isoforms that are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells serve distinct functions. Several lines of evidence suggest that they may. First, recent studies have shown that Ki-Ras but not Ha- or N-Ras has an essential function in mouse development (1Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelman W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 2Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Pellicer A. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Secondly, specific Ras isoforms are mutated in different tumors: Ki-ras mutations occur in 50% of colon cancers and 90% of pancreatic cancers, whereas N- and Ha-ras mutations are extremely uncommon. Conversely, N-ras mutations occur in 25% of acute leukemias, whereas Ha-ras and Ki-ras mutations are much less common (3Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of these observations is that oncogenic activation of different Ras proteins has distinct biological consequences for the cell. The N-terminal 165 amino acids of Ras contain all of the critical domains for GTPase function. The N-terminal 85 residues of all Ras isoforms are identical and contain the two switch regions that undergo conformational changes on GTP binding; in addition the next 80 amino acids are 95% conserved. All Ras proteins in the activated GTP bound state interact with the same set of effectors: Raf kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K),1 RalGDS, and AF6 (4Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R.

Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Mutational and structural studies have demonstrated that the Ras effector domain (residues 32–40) is a critical binding site for all these Ras effectors. Moreover, where measured using recombinant proteins, no marked differences in binding affinities of Ha-, N-, and Ki-Ras for these various effector proteins are apparent (11Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, there are no differences in effector domains or flanking sequences that could account for distinct signaling outcomes downstream of each Ras isoform. The major differences between Ras proteins are confined to the hypervariable region (HVR) between residues 166 and 185. Here the Ras sequences diverge significantly with fewer than 15% conserved residues (12Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). C-terminal to the HVR all Ras proteins terminate in a conserved CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic amino acid;X, methionine or serine) that directs post-translational processing. In previous studies we have shown that one role of the HVR is to cooperate with the processed C-terminal CAAX motif and provide a second signal for Ras plasma membrane localization (13Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 14Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In Ki-Ras this second signal comprises a polylysine domain (lysine residues 175–180), whereas in Ha-Ras and N-Ras the second signal comprises palmitoylation sites at cysteines 181 and/or 184 (15Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Ras must be localized to the inner surface of the plasma membrane to be biologically active. In addition, Raf-1 and PI3-K are constitutively activated when targeted to the plasma membrane using Ras localization motifs (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F.

Taken together, these data suggested that the ability of Ras proteins to activate specific effectors may be influenced by their different mechanisms of attachment to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis we investigated whether Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras, which use markedly different plasma membrane localization signals, are equipotent activators of Raf-1 and PI-3K. COS cells were electroporated as described previously (19Huang D.C.S. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2420-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using 1–30 μg of EXV-Ki-RasG12V, EXV-Ha-RasG12V, or EXV-Ha-RasΔG12V expression plasmids. 72 h later, after an 18-h serum-free incubation, cells were washed, scraped on ice into 0.5 ml of Buffer A (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaF, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μm NaVO4), and homogenized in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g, the supernatants (S100) were removed, and the sedimented fractions (P100) were rinsed and sonicated for 5 min in 100 μl of ice-cold Buffer A. Protein content was measured by the Bradford reaction. Expression of Ras was determined by quantitative immunoblotting. 20 μg of each P100 fraction was resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoridepolyvinylidene difluoride membranes using semidry transfer. Aliquots of GST-Ras, ranging from 5–400 ng (containing therefore 2.1–171 ng of Ras protein) were also loaded onto gels and transferred onto the same polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as the P100 fractions. Westerns were probed with anti-Ras (Y13–259) and then anti-Rat horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) antibodies, developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) and quantitated by phosphorimaging with a CH screen (Bio-Rad). The signals from GST-Ras were used to construct a dose response curve from which the actual Ras content of each P100 fraction was determined. For co-transfections 10 μg of EXV-FLAGRaf plasmid (20Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was electroporated with 1–30 μg of Ras plasmid. The cells were harvested and Ras content in 20 μg of P100 was determined by immunoblotting as described. 20 μg of each S100 and P100 fraction were immunoblotted for FLAGRaf with M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal (Kodak) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). FLAG immunoblots were quantitated by phosphorimaging and the percentage of Raf-1 recruited to the P100 fraction calculated as P100·Raf/(P100·Raf + S100·Raf). This assay is discussed in detail elsewhere (20Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, P100 aliquots (20 μg) were adjusted to 20 μl with Buffer A. 2.2 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the membranes were sonicated in a sonicating waterbath for 2 min at 4 °C. A 10-μl aliquot of sonicated P100 fraction was incubated with 6 μl of Buffer A containing 0.25 μg of MEK, 1 μg of ERK, and 4 μl of 0.5 mm ATP/40 mm MgCl2and vortexed at 30 °C. A second 10-μl aliquot of sonicated P100 fraction was incubated with 6 μl of Buffer A containing 4 μl of 0.5 mm ATP/40 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of ERK (but no MEK), and the mix was vortexed at 30 °C (which is the control tube). After 20 min the samples were placed on ice, and a 10-μl aliquot was diluted into 40 μl of ice-cold Buffer C (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm NaVO4, and 1 mm DTT). 10 μl of these diluted samples were taken into a second incubation with 5 μl of MBP (16 μg) and 10 μl of an ATP mix containing 0.5 mm ATP, 50 mmMgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP (2,400 cpm/pmol). The MBP kinase reaction was performed in duplicate. After 10 min the reaction was stopped by adding 6 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the reaction products were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The radioactivity incorporated into MBP was measured by phosphorimaging after spotting the gels with a known amount of radioactive [γ-32P]ATP. Background counts due to any P100-associated MEK and ERK were estimated from the control tubes and subtracted from the assay counts (<5% total activity). To measure the specific activity of FLAGRaf, P100 fractions were normalized for FLAGRaf content, adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40, sonicated for 90 s at 4 °C, incubated on ice for 10 min, and microcentrifuged for 5 min, and the soluble membrane extract was diluted to 400 μl with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm NaVO4, 1%Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT). The samples were rotated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads (Kodak) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed six times in Buffer B. The immunoprecipitates were split into two aliquots and incubated with both MEK and ERK or with ERK alone, and the kinase assay was completed as described above. The beads were then collected, washed, and immunoblotted to verify the amount of Raf-1 present in the assay. BHK cells were cultured at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips at 60% confluence and 4 h later were transfected using lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 1.6 μg of EXV expression plasmid for Ha-RasG12V and Ha-RasΔG12V. After an overnight incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The cells were then incubated in undiluted Y13–238 hybridoma supernatant (anti-Ras). After extensive washing in PBS, cells were incubated in 30 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (Pierce). Coverslips were washed and mounted in moviol. Fluorescence images were taken in a Bio-Rad MRC-600 Zeiss microscope using a 63× magnification lens, a BHS filter, and blue light exciting at 488 ± 5 nm with correction for emissions 515 nm and longer. Kalman averaging of eight scans was used to produce the final images. COS cells transfected with increasing amounts of Ha-RasG12V, KrasG12V, and Ha-RasΔG12V were serum starved for 18 h, washed, and harvested in ice-cold PBS. PI3-K assays were performed as recently described (21Clark, S. F., Martin, S., Carozzi, A. J., Hill, M. M., and James, D. E. (1988) J. Cell Biol.1211–1225Google Scholar) and include recent modifications of established methods (22Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cleared lysates were normalized for protein content and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-p85 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice in 0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, twice with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and twice with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm Na4P2O7,0.2 mm NaVO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Kinase reactions were carried out for 20 min at 25 °C in a vortexing heating block. Kinase buffer contained 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, phosphatidylinositol (200 μg/ml sonicated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), 20 μm ATP, 200 μm adenosine, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 1n HCl and phospholipids extracted once with 200 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) and once with 160 μl of 1 nHCl:MeOH (1:1). The organic phase was dried under N2 and resuspended in 10 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) containing PIP standard (1 μg/μl). Phosphorylated products were resolved on oxalate impregnated Silica60 plates (Merck) using CHCl3:MeOH:4 m NH4OH (9:7:2) as solvent. Standards were visualized in iodine vapor, and radioactive products were visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging. To determine the amount of post-translationally processed, membrane localized Ras expressed, 10% of the harvested cells were lysed in 1% Triton X114. The detergent-partitioning protein fraction was isolated as described (25Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), concentrated by acetone precipitation, normalized for protein content, and quantitatively immunoblotted. We first investigated whether Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras are equipotent activators of Raf-1. These two Ras isoforms were chosen for study because of their very different membrane localization signals. COS cells were transiently transfected with varying amounts of Ha-RasG12V and Ki-RasG12V plasmids, and the cells were fractionated into cytosol (S100) and membranes (P100). The amount of Ras expressed in each membrane fraction (Fig. 1 A) was determined by quantitative immunoblotting against known amounts of recombinant Ras. The Raf-1 activity present in 20 μg of cell membrane was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK activation assay using MBP phosphorylation as readout (Fig. 1 A). The results from three such experiments are summarized in Fig. 1 B. The data show that Ki-Ras is a significantly more potent activator of Raf-1 than Ha-Ras because minimal overexpression of Ki-Ras to 5 ng/20 μg P100 (which equals 0.025% total membrane protein) resulted in a 5-fold greater activation of endogenous Raf-1 than the same minimal overexpression of Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B). The mechanism of Raf-1 activation is complex, but it is clear that one important role of Ras is to recruit Raf-1 to the plasma membrane (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We reasoned, therefore, that the more potent activation of Raf-1 by Ki-Ras could reflect differences in the relative ability of Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras to recruit Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, and/or differences in Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras catalyzed membrane activation events. To discriminate between these two possibilities COS cells were co-transfected with epitope-tagged FLAGRaf and varying amounts of Ha-RasG12V or Ki-RasG12V plasmids. S100 and P100 fractions were prepared from these transfectants and immunoblotted for Ras and FLAGRaf. The immunoblots were quantitated by phosphorimaging, and the data were used to calculate the fraction of FLAGRaf recruited to the membrane by increasing amounts of co-expressed Ras. The analysis in Fig. 2 A shows that Ki-Ras recruits Raf-1 more efficiently than Ha-Ras, because recruitment of 50% of FLAG-Raf to the plasma membrane required expression of 20 ng (per 20 μg of membrane) of Ki-Ras compared with 130 ng (per 20 μg of membrane) of Ha-Ras (Fig. 2 A). We next determined whether Raf-1 recruited to the membrane fraction by Ki- and Ha-Ras differed in specific activity. Membrane fractions from the COS cells coexpressing FLAGRaf and Ki- or Ha-Ras were normalized for FLAGRaf content and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-Sepharose. Raf-1 activity was then measured in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates. Significantly, Raf-1 recruited to the membrane by Ki-Ras was found to have a 4-fold higher specific activity than Raf-1 recruited to the membrane by Ha-Ras (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that Ki-Ras is a more potent in vivo activator of Raf-1 because Ki-Ras recruits Raf-1 to the plasma membrane more efficiently than Ha-Ras and also because Ki-Ras more efficiently catalyzes Raf-1 activation at the cell membrane. The polylysine domain of Ki-Ras (residues 175–180) interacts with negatively charged phospholipid head groups on the inner surface of the plasma membrane (15Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 47Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), residues C-terminal of residue 175 in Ki-Ras will therefore be tightly associated with the membrane. In contrast, the N-terminal limit of membrane tethering of Ha-Ras is the palmitoylation site at cysteine 181 (Fig. 3 A). In consequence, the N-terminal conserved domains of Ras (1–166) are likely positioned closer to the plasma membrane in Ki-Ras than in Ha-Ras, i.e.by 7 Ki-Ras HVR residues (167–174) versus 13 Ha-Ras HVR residues (167–180). We therefore examined whether shortening the HVR of Ha-Ras by 6 amino acids would improve the ability of Ha-Ras to recruit and activate Raf. Ha-RasΔ was constructed by deleting amino acids 167–173, leaving intact all of the sequences required for plasma membrane localization (Fig. 3 A). As expected, when expressed in BHK cells Ha-RasΔ was found to localize to the plasma membrane to the same extent as full-length Ha-Ras (Fig. 3 B). The ability of Ha-RasΔ to recruit and activate Raf-1 was then compared with Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras. COS cells were co-transfected with FLAGRaf and varying amounts of Ha-RasΔG12V plasmid. Fig. 2 A shows that shortening the HVR of Ha-Ras by 6 amino acids significantly improved its ability to recruit Raf-1 because the recruitment of 50% of expressed FLAGRaf required 35 ng (per 20 μg of membrane) of Ha-RasΔ compared with 135 ng (per 20 μg of membrane) of full-length Ha-Ras. The recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane by Ha-RasΔ therefore compares favorably with Ki-Ras (Fig. 2 A). However, the activation of membrane-recruited Raf-1 was not improved by shortening the Ha-Ras HVR because the specific activities of FLAGRaf recruited by Ha-Ras and Ha-RasΔ were not significantly different (Fig. 2 B). Finally, we compared the membrane recruitment of endogenous Raf-1 by Ha-RasΔ, Ha-Ras, and Ki-Ras. Fig. 3 Cshows that, as expected, low level of expression of Ki-Ras or Ha-RasΔ was sufficient to fully recruit all endogenous Raf-1 from the cytosol to the membrane, whereas a higher level of expression of Ha-Ras was required. Together these experiments show that the different mechanisms of membrane attachment and the structure of the Ras HVR critically affect the in vivo interactions of Ras with one of its major effectors, Raf-1. The simple spacing of the Ras N-terminal domains from the plasma membrane may account for the different abilities of Ha- and Ki-Ras to recruit Raf-1 to the membrane. But there are two alternative explanations for the more potent activation of membrane-recruited Raf-1 by Ki-Ras: either Ki-Ras specific sequences in the HVR or elsewhere are required for maximal Raf-1 activation or by virtue of their membrane targeting signals Ha- and Ki-Ras recruit Raf-1 to distinct subdomains within the plasma membrane that contain different concentrations of Raf-1 activators. We next examined the ability of Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras to activate a second Ras effector, PI3-K. Anti-p85 antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous PI3-K from COS cells expressing increasing amounts of Ki-RasG12V and Ha-RasG12V. PI3-K activity was then measured in an in vitro lipid kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol as substrate. Fig. 4 A shows the result of a representative experiment and Fig. 4 B shows data pooled from four independent experiments. These data clearly show that Ha-Ras is a considerably more potent activator of PI3-K than Ki-Ras. Fig. 4 also shows that shortening the Ha-Ras HVR does not significantly affect the ability of Ha-Ras to activate PI3-K, because the dose response curves of Ha-Ras and Ha-RasΔ are similar. The more potent activation of PI3-K by Ha-Ras can be explained in two ways: efficient activation may require Ha-Ras specific sequences, located in the HVR or elsewhere, or Ha-Ras may recruit PI-3K to a distinct subdomain of the plasma membrane where activation proceeds more efficiently than in the subdomain to which PI3-K is recruited by Ki-Ras. Although all Ras isoforms qualitatively activate the same effector pathways, we have shown here that in vivo there are marked quantitative differences in the activation of c-Raf-1 and PI3-K by Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras. It seems probable that quantitative differences will extend to the activation of other Ras effector pathways, and therefore, activation of each Ras isoform can have distinct biochemical consequences for the cell. These different effector activation profiles may also account for the selective activation of different Ras isoforms in specific human tumors. We propose that the selection pressure for which Ras isoform is activated is determined by the background level of activity in all signaling pathways and that given the nature of multistep oncogenesis, this background activity will vary between target cells. In which case, activation of Ha-Ras may be favored in tumor cells that already have increased MAPK activity but low levels of PI3-K activity, whereas in tumor cells with constitutively elevated PI3-K activity, activation of Ki-Ras may be favored because it will result in coincident robust activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway. A recent study of human colorectal tumors adds significant weight to this hypothesis. Some 86% of human colorectal tumors tested were found to have significantly higher levels of PI3-K activity than normal colonic mucosa sampled from the same patient (48Phillips, W., St. Clair, F., Munday, A. D., Thomas, R. J. S., and Mitchell, C. A. (1998) Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar). Moreover, the level of PI3-K activity in these tumors was not further elevated in the presence of a Ki-ras mutation (48Phillips, W., St. Clair, F., Munday, A. D., Thomas, R. J. S., and Mitchell, C. A. (1998) Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar). This study is consistent with our finding that Ki-Ras is not a potent in vivo activator of PI3-K and, importantly, when taken together with the data presented here, rationalizes the preferential activation of Ki-Ras in colon cancer. In summary, our study emphasizes the importance of the mechanisms of plasma membrane attachment and the significance of the RasHVR in influencing the interaction of Ras with its effector proteins in vivo. We thank Wayne Phillips and Christina Mitchell for discussing their results prior to publication, Sharon Clark for help with the PI3-K assays, and Robert McPherson for supplying recombinant MEK and ERK."

However, unlike other Cdks, the activity of Cdk5 is required in post-mitotic neurons. The neuronal-specific p35 protein, which shares no homology to cyclins, was identified by virtue of its association and activation of Cdk5. Gene targeting studies in mice have shown that the p35/Cdk5 kinase is required for the proper neuronal migration and development of the mammalian cortex. We have investigated the regulation of the p35/Cdk5 kinase. Here we show that p35, the activator of Cdk5, is a short-lived protein with a half-life (t 1/2) of 20 to 30 min. Specific proteasome inhibitors such as lactacystin greatly stabilize p35 in vivo. Ubiquitination of p35 can be readily demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Cdk5 activity by a specific Cdk inhibitor, roscovitine, or by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Cdk5 increases the stability of p35 by 2- to 3-fold. Furthermore, phosphorylation mutants of p35 also stabilize p35 2- to 3-fold. Together, these observations demonstrate that the p35/Cdk5 kinase can be subject to rapid turnover in vivo and suggest that phosphorylation of p35 upon Cdk5 kinase activation plays a autoregulatory role in p35 degradation mediated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.

Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains primarily post-mitotic neurons and glial cells. In addition, high levels of Cdk5 kinase activity are only present in brain lysates when compared with other tissues (3Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25922-25926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D-type cyclins have been shown to bind to Cdk5 in fibroblasts and other tissue culture cell lines (5Lee M.H. Nikolic M. Baptista C.A. Lai E. Tsai L.H. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3259-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). However, this association does not result in an active kinase. In an effort to identify the Cdk5 activator in brain, a 35-kilodalton protein species (p35) was found to associate with Cdk5 in cultured primary neurons of embryonic rat cortices whose abundance correlates with the level of Cdk5 kinase activity (7Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Purified Cdk5 kinase activity from brain lysates contains two protein entities, Cdk5 and a partial fragment of p35 (4Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25922-25926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Finally, recombinant p35 could activate Cdk5 kinase when mixed in vitro, formally establishing the regulatory role of p35 (7Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 8Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that p35 serves as a regulatory partner for Cdk5, it does not display any primary sequence homology to members of the cyclin family of proteins. However, the predicted tertiary structure of p35 is similar to cyclins (10Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T.

The substrate specificity of the p35/Cdk5 kinase is similar to that of the Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinases, phosphorylating the K(S/T)PX(K/R) consensus sequence motif (12Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J.

The neuronal-specific intermediate filaments neurofilaments and the microtubule-associated proteins τ and mitogen-activated protein 2 have been shown to be substrates of the p35/Cdk5 kinase (15Lee K.Y.

In addition to these structural proteins, proteins associated with neural transmitter release such as synapsin I and Munc18 have also been shown to be phosphorylated by the p35/Cdk5 kinase (16Matsubara M. Kusubata M. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21108-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Shuang R. Zhang L. Fletcher A.

The biological function of the p35/Cdk5 kinase has been addressedin vivo and in vitro. Indeed, when a dominant negative Cdk5 mutant (DNK5) or an antisense p35 construct was introduced into cultured primary cortical neurons, neurite outgrowth was severely inhibited (18Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We also created a mouse strain lacking p35 (19Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). These animals are viable and fertile but display seizures and sporadic lethality that is likely to be the result of terminal seizures. Histological examination reveals that the lamination pattern of the cerebral cortex is disrupted in p35-deficient animals, which results from an inverse packing order of post-mitotic cortical neurons (19Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 20Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 395: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cdk5-deficient animals die before or around birth with defects in the development of the cortex, cerebellum, and other compartments of the central nervous system (21Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The cortex of these Cdk5−/− mice display a lamination defect reminiscent of p35. 3E. Gilmore, personal communication. Together, these results underscore the integral role of the p35/Cdk5 kinase in the migratory behavior of post-mitotic neurons. Cdk5 activity has recently been shown to be required for muscle development in Xenopus. Homologues of Cdk5 and p35 have also been isolated in Xenopus. One of the p35 homologues in Xenopus, Xp35.1, is highly expressed in developing somites where Cdk5 is also expressed. Overexpression of Xp35.1 or DNK5 disrupts muscle organization, and expression of MyoD and MRF4 is suppressed in the presence of DNK5 (23Philpott A. Porro E.B. Kirschner M.W. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In light of the essential function of the p35/Cdk5 kinase during mouse corticogenesis, the regulatory mechanism of this kinase is clearly part of the circuitry that underlies the development of the central nervous system. In addition to cyclin binding, Cdks can be regulated by post-translational phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (24Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Cyclin degradation is also used as a unidirectional form of regulation. The fact that the Cdk5 kinase activity can be reconstituted in vitro using purified recombinant Cdk5 and p35 proteins suggests that binding to p35 is the rate-limiting step in kinase activation. Thus, the availability of p35 appears to be the primary determinant for Cdk5 activation. During neurogenesis, the expression of p35 is stringently regulated at the transcriptional level (25Delalle I. Bhide P.G. Caviness Jr., V.S. Tsai L.H. J. Neurocytol. 1997; 26: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Spatially, it is restricted to cells of the neuronal lineage. Temporally, p35 mRNA peaks around birth and quickly declines afterward (25Delalle I. Bhide P.G. Caviness Jr., V.S. Tsai L.H. J. Neurocytol. 1997; 26: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Matsushita M. Lew J. Tokuda M. Itano T. Konishi R. Wang J.H. Hatase O. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, p35 mRNA is not present in dividing neuroblasts but is expressed when the neuroblasts exit the cell cycle and migrate out of the germinal zone during development of the cerebral cortex (25Delalle I. Bhide P.G. Caviness Jr., V.S. Tsai L.H. J. Neurocytol. 1997; 26: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the adult, p35 is only present in certain areas of the forebrain including the hippocampal formation, the pyriform cortex, and layers 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the neocortex, structures that maintain high levels of plasticity (25Delalle I. Bhide P.G. Caviness Jr., V.S. Tsai L.H. J. Neurocytol. 1997; 26: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that p35 is regulated at the post-translational level based on the short half-life (t 1/2) of p35 protein. Our results indicate that the rapid turnover of p35 is mediated at least in part via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Ubiquitin is first activated in an ATP-dependent manner by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). It is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and then maybe transferred to a ubiquitin ligase (E3) involved in the recognition of substrate and transfer of ubiquitin molecule to the substrate. A multi-ubiquitinated protein can then be recognized by the proteasome, where it is hydrolyzed in a ATP-dependent fashion (27Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that important cell cycle regulators including the cyclins, Cdk inhibitors such as p21, p27, and p40SIC1, and p53 are all degraded via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (28Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 29Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 30Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar, 31Sheaff R.J. Roberts J.M. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 869-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is thought that periodic degradation of these proteins is essential for cell cycle progression. Our study thus demonstrates an involvement of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in the development of the nervous system. We further show that the active Cdk5 kinase stimulates the degradation of p35. These observations suggest that the active p35/Cdk5 kinase complex is subject to rapid inactivation mediated in part by its own activity leading to the autophosphorylation and degradation of the activator, p35, providing a negative feedback loop. All calpain, proteasome, and cysteine protease inhibitors were maintained in Me2SO and were diluted in media before applying to cell cultures. MG132 (10 mm stock) was purchased from Peptides International and used at a final concentration of 50 μm;N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (LLnL; 100 mm stock) was purchased from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 250 μm; lactacystin and E64 (10 mm stocks) were purchased from Calbiochem and at a final concentration of 12.5 and 50 μm, respectively; carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucine vinyl sulfone (Z-L3VS; 10 mm stock) was a gift from Hidde Ploegh and used at a final concentration of 50 μm. The Cdk inhibitor roscovitine (28 mm stock in Me2SO) was purchased from Calbiochem and added to cultures at a final concentration of 10 μm. Cyclohexamide (20 mg/ml stock) was purchased from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml in t 1/2 experiments. The following antibodies were used: p35 (pAb neu-cyc and mAb 5H8 and 4E3 were raised against whole protein (18Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar)); Cdk5 (mAb DC17, (3Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and pAb C8 (Santa Cruz); myc (mAb 9E10); ubiquitin (pAb; Sigma). Construction of CMV expression vectors for p35, Cdk5, and DNK5 was described previously (18Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The His6-myc-ubiquitin contructs, pCW7-wild type and pCW8-K48R (a gift from Ron R. Kopito) were previously described (32Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). p35 T138A was generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. 5′ and 3′ p35 primers were used in combination with the mutagenic primers CGTTTGGGCGCCCCTGCGGAGG and CCTCCGCAGGGGCGCCCAAACG, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of p35 T138A in pBSK for the production of p35 phosphorylation mutants (S8A,T138A; T138A,S170A; and T138A,T197A) was performed as described (33Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers used: S8A, GGTAGCTGGGGGCCAGGGACAG; S170A, GGGGTCCGTGGGGGCCAGGTGCTTCAG; T197A, CACGTTGGCCGGCGCGATGAAGCCC. p35 T138A,S170A,T197A mutant was made by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using p35 T138A,T197A as a template. 5′ and 3′ p35 primers were used in combination with the mutagenic primers GGGGTCCGTGGGGGCCAGGTGCTTCAG and its compliment, respectively. All mutants were cloned into CMV (pCDNA3) vectors. The p35 S8A,T138A,S170A,T197A (p35 Quad) construct was made by cloning the SfiI/XbaI fragment of the CMV p35 T138A,S170A,T197A mutant into the SfiI/XbaI site of CMV p35 S8A,T138A. Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing. E17-E19 pregnant rats (Long Evans strain) were purchased from Harland Sprague-Dawley. Embyros were surgically removed, and their cortices were dissected and cultured as described previously by (18Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). C33A and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. C33A and COS7 were transiently transfected with various plasmid constructs (See Constructs and mutagenesis section above) were performed as described previously (Graham and Van der Eb 1973). For t1/2experiments: primary cortical cultures were grown on 3.5 or 10 cm laminin and poly d-lysine treated plates. C33A and COS7 cells were grown on 3.5 or 10 cm plates and transfected with various combinations of CMV-p35, CMV-Cdk5, or CMV-DNK5. For [35S] pulse-chase experiments, cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated with methionine free media supplemented with [35S] methionine (110 μCi/ml) for one h. The cultures were then washed twice with PBS and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Samples were harvested at indicated time points. Cells were lysed in ELB lysis buffer plus inhibitors (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, 2 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm NaVO3, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were precleared with zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), immunoprecipitated with 4E3 or 5H8 p35 monoclonal or C8 (Santa Cruz) Cdk5 polyclonal antibodies, and then run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to film. Cyclohexamide treatment t 1/2 experiments of primary cortical cultures and transfected cells were done as follows. Cultures were treated with cyclohexamide (final concentration of 30 μg/ml) for the indicated time points. In some cases the cultures were treated with inhibitors (45–60 min for proteasome inhibitors or 4 h for roscovitine) prior to harvesting or the addition of cyclohexamide. Cells were lysed in ELB lysis buffer plus inhibitors and lysates were run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to nylon and then probed with rabbit anti-p35 antibodies. All35S t 1/2 and cyclohexamide experiments were repeated three or more times, and a representative result is presented in the figures. p35-ubiquitin conjugates were analyzed as follows. COS7 cells were transfected with CMV-driven His6-myc-ubiquitin contructs (pCW7-wild type and pCW8-K48R) and CMV-p35 at a 10:1 or 5:1 ration (Fig. 3 B). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 polyclonal antibodies. p35 polyclonal and myc (9E10) antibodies were used to detect His6-myc-ubiquitin p35 conjugates; a ubiquitin Western blot of p35 immunoprecipitates from E17-E19 rat brain lysates (embryonic brain tissue was dounced in ELB lysis buffer with inhibitors, and 17 mg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal p35 antibodies) was performed with polyclonal rabbit ubiquitin antibodies purchased from Sigma. In vitro transcribed (T7 promoter from pCDNA3-p35) and translated p35 was performed using Promega TNT/T7 rabbit reticulolysate kit with [35S]methionine for 90 min at 30 °C (50 μl total reaction). After a 90-min incubation, the translation reaction was stopped with cyclohexamide (20 μg/ml final concentration), and samples were split into two. In vitro transcribed and translatedlysate of NO DNA sample was used as a control. To each sample the following was added: 10 μl of 10× degradation buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), 5 μl of 20× regeneration system (150 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), 20 mm ATP, and 20 mm MgCl2), 0.5 μl of creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 15 μl of bacterially purified GST-ubiquitin (0.6 mg/ml) or 15 μl of distilled H2O, and 44.5 μl of E17 rat brain lysate (25 mg/ml). The samples were placed at 37 °C, and 20 μl was taken at 0, 60, and 120 min. 2× sample buffer was added, and the samples were run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to film. To assay for p35 and p35 phosphorylation mutant-associated kinase activity, 1–2 mg of protein (exact amount of protein used was determined after normalization for p35 and mutants expression by Western analysis and quantitative measurements of band intensities using NIH Image analysis software-Fig. 6) from lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 monoclonal antibodies, and histone H1 was added (in some cases histone H1 was not added to assay p35 autophosphorylation by Cdk5) as a substrate in the in vitrokinase assay performed as described previously (3Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the observation that association of p35 with Cdk5 is the rate-limiting step for kinase activation, we investigated the regulation of p35 at the protein level. We initially looked at its half-life (t 1/2) in dissociated primary rat cortical neurons. E17-E19 rat cortical neurons were cultured for 4 days and then pulse-chased with [35S]methionine (Fig. 1 A). Newly synthesized p35 in neurons was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to p35 (5H8) at different time points. A rapid drop of p35 protein levels was observed between 20 to 40 min after chase (Fig. 1 A). A similar turnover rate of p35 was shown by immunoprecipitation using a Cdk5 antibody that recognizes the p35·Cdk5 complexes (Fig. 1 B). When primary cortical neurons were treated with cyclohexamide, the total population of p35 in neurons was also shown to be rapidly turned over with more than half the protein gone after approximately 15 to 20 min. Cdk5 appeared to be a more stable protein whose abundance did not vary throughout the time points analyzed (Data not shown and Fig. 1 C). Thus by either method, p35 was found to be a short-lived protein. Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to stabilize proteins destined for degradation by the proteasome (27Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of proteasome inhibitors on p35 stability, C33A cells transfected with a p35 expression plasmid were treated with LLnL (250 μm). LLnL stabilized the p35 protein, and slower migrating bands were recognized with p35 antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Another proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H (MG132) (50 μm) produced similar results, as it slowed the p35 turnover rate as well as caused the accumulation of slower migrating species (Fig. 2 B). These higher molecular weight species are highly suggestive of ubiquitin modification of p35. We first determined if p35 could be covalently modified by ubiquitinin vitro. p35 was in vitro transcribed and translated with [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulolysate. Afterward the sample was split into two, and bacteria-purified GST-ubiquitin was either added or not. Aliquots were taken at time 0, 60, and 120 min after the addition of GST-ubiquitin. The in vitro translated protein is the only protein that incorporates [35S]methionine as shown in Fig. 3 A (no DNA compared with p35lanes). GST-ubiquitin is approximately 35 kDa, and so the appearance of a labeled band at approximately 70 kDa nicely corresponds to p35 covalently modified by one GST-ubiquitin (Fig. 3 A). A labeled band at this weight was not seen in the no DNA plus GST-ubiquitin and in vitro transcribed and translated p35 without GST-ubiquitin control lanes, further confirming that the appearance of the 70- kDa band in the 60-and 120-min time points are indeed GST-ubiquitin-modified p35. Interestingly, p35 is stable whenin vitro translated; therefore it is likely that certain components required for degradation are absent in this system, similarly seen for other proteins such as p53, where the in vitro ubiquitination of p53 is dependent on the E6-associated protein (34Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Since poly ubiquitinated proteins are quickly degraded by the proteasome, it is sometimes difficult to detect multi-ubiquitinated species in vivo. Ellison and Hochstrasser (35Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that addition of NH2-terminal-tagged ubiquitin inhibits degradation, although the epitope-tagged ubiquitin can still be efficiently conjugated to proteins to form multi-ubiquitinated chains. To examine whether the higher molecular weight forms of p35 are indeed p35-ubiquitin conjugates, p35 was co-transfected with NH2-terminal His6-myc-tagged ubiquitin constructs (Fig. 3 B). COS7 cells were transiently transfected with p35 alone (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 6) or co-transfected with p35 and His6-myc-ubiquitin (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4, 8, 9, and 11) or with p35 and His6-myc-ubiquitin containing a K48R mutation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 10 and 12), which prevents ubiquitin chain elongation through the Lys-48 residue on ubiquitin (36Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar,37Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with p35 antibodies and probed with 9E10 antibodies for myc-tagged ubiquitin or with p35-specific antibodies. A p35 ubiquitin ladder can be readily observed by antibodies when p35 was expressed in COS7 cells and conjugated to endogenous ubiquitin (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). When p35 was co-transfected with His6-myc-ubiquitin (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 8 and 9 and 11), a p35 ubiquitin ladder was also observed. There were also bands immunoprecipitated by p35 antibodies that were recognized by both 9E10 and p35 antibodies. These bands co-migrate precisely (Fig. 3 B, asterisks and labeled arrows), indicating that the higher molecular weight species are indeed p35-ubiquitin conjugates. There is no ubiquitin immunoreactivity detected by 9E10 antibodies when COS7 cells are transfected with vector control, p35, or His6-myc-ubiquitin alone (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). The K48R mutant His6-myc-ubiquitin prevented polyubiquitination of p35 when co-transfected (Fig. 3 B, lane10). Additional higher molecular weight p35 species with decreased electrophoretic mobility were observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 8, labeled arrows) due to the addition of His6-myc moiety to ubiquitin. Only these additional p35-derived species can be recognized by the anti-myc (9E10) antibody (lane 4, asterisks), further confirming that p35 is indeed ubiquitinated in vivo. To address the question of whether p35 is degraded by the proteasome in vivo, the turnover rate of p35 was measured in primary neuronal cultures treated with proteasome inhibitors. Dissociated rat embryonic (E17-E19) cortical neurons 4 days in culture were treated with either Me2SO, MG132, lactacystin, Z-L3VS, or E64. Lactacystin is a very specific inhibitor of the proteasome with trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like inhibitory activities, as well as weak peptidylglutamyl peptidase inhibitory activities (38Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). The aldehyde MG132 and the peptide vinyl sulfone, Z-L3VS (39Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), are potent inhibitors of the proteasome but are less specific than lactacystin. E64 is a general inhibitor of cysteine proteases found in organelles such as the lysosome (40Mehdi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 150-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The stability of p35 was drastically increased by MG132, lactacystin, and ZL3VS to various extents in vivo (Fig. 4). Although higher overall levels of p35 were observed when cultures were treated with E64, the turnover rate was not changed when compared with cultures treated with Me2SO alone. Together these results indicate that the proteasome plays a major role in the regulation of p35 stability. It has been shown previously that p35 can be autophosphorylated within the active kinase complex by Cdk5 (7Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E.

https://openalex.org/W2044143765,"To investigate the metabolic link between fatty acid de novo synthesis and polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) synthesis, we isolated mutants of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 deficient in this metabolic route. The gene phaG was cloned by phenotypic complementation of these mutants; it encoded a protein of 295 amino acids with a molecular mass of 33,876 Da, and the amino acid sequence exhibited 44% amino acid identity to the primary structure of the rhlA gene product, which is involved in the rhamnolipid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PG201. S1 nuclease protection assay identified the transcriptional start site 239 base pairs upstream of the putative translational start codon. Transcriptional induction of phaG was observed when gluconate was provided, and PHA synthesis occurred from this carbon source. No complementation of the rhlA mutant P. aeruginosa UO299-harboring plasmid pBHR81, expressingphaG gene under lac promoter control, was obtained. Heterologous expression of phaG in Pseudomonas oleovorans, which is not capable of PHA synthesis from gluconate, enabled PHA synthesis on gluconate as the carbon source. Native recombinant PhaG was purified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from P. oleovorans-harboring plasmid pBHR81. It catalyzes the transfer of the acyl moiety from in vitro synthesized 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA to acyl carrier protein, indicating that PhaG exhibits a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transferase activity.

Fluorescent pseudomonads belonging to the rRNA homology group I are able to synthesize and accumulate large amounts of polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHA)1 consisting of various saturated 3-hydroxy fatty acids with carbon chain length ranging from 6 to 14 carbon atoms as carbon and energy storage compound (1Steinbüchel A. Hustede E. Liebergesell M. Pieper U. Timm A. Valentin H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 103: 217-230Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). PHA isolated from these bacteria contained also constituents with double bonds or with functional groups such as branched, halogenated, aromatic, or nitrile side chains (2Steinbüchel A. Valentin H.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 219-228Crossref Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The composition of PHA depends on the PHA synthases, the carbon source, and the involved metabolic routes (2Steinbüchel A. Valentin H.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 219-228Crossref Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 3Anderson A.J. Dawes E.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 450-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Eggink G. de Waard P. Huijberts G.N.M.

Fritsche K. Dawes E.A. Novel Biodegradable Microbiol Polymers. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1990: 23-35Google Scholar). In Pseudomonas putida at least three different metabolic routes occur for the synthesis of 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A thioesters, which are the substrates of the PHA synthase (7Huijberts G.N.M. De Rijk T. De Waard P. Eggink G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (i) β-Oxidation is the main pathway when fatty acids are used as carbon source. (ii) Fatty acid de novo biosynthesis is the main route during growth on carbon sources that are metabolized to acetyl-CoA, like gluconate, acetate, or ethanol. (iii) Chain elongation reactions in which acetyl-CoA moieties are condensed to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA is involved in the PHA synthesis during growth on hexanoate. Recently, recombinant PHAMCL (MCL = medium chain length) synthesis was also obtained in a β-oxidation mutant of Escherichia coli LS1298 (fadB) expressing PHA synthase genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8Langenbach S. Rehm B.H.A. Steinbüchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Qi Q. Rehm B.H.A. Steinbüchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 155-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the β-oxidation pathway in E. coliprovides precursors for PHA synthesis (8Langenbach S. Rehm B.H.A. Steinbüchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). From extended homologies of the primary structures of PHAMCL synthases to PHASCL (SCL = short chain length) synthases (1Steinbüchel A. Hustede E. Liebergesell M. Pieper U. Timm A. Valentin H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 103: 217-230Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which occur in bacteria accumulating poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) such ase.g. Alcaligenes eutrophus, it seems also likely that the substrate of PHAMCL synthases is (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA in pseudomonads. The main constituent of PHA of P. putida KT2442 from unrelated substrates such as gluconate is (R)-3-hydroxydecanoate (7Huijberts G.N.M. De Rijk T. De Waard P. Eggink G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Timm A. Steinbüchel A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haywood G.W. Anderson A.J. Ewing D.F. Dawes E.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to serve as substrate for the PHA synthase, (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-ACP must be converted to the corresponding CoA derivative. This can be mediated in a one step reaction by an (R)-3-hydroxyacyl (ACP to CoA) transferase. Another possibility is the release of (R)-3-hydroxydecanoic acid by a thioesterase, and subsequent activation to the CoA derivative. Only few enzymes have been described catalyzing a similar reaction. Examples are the malonyl-CoA-ACP transferase, which catalyzes the transfer of the malonyl moeity from CoA to ACP (12Verwoert I.I. Verhagen E.F. van der Linden K.H. Verbree E.C. Nijkamp H.J. Stuitje A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP-dependent UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of hydroxydecanoyl moeity from ACP to UDP-GlcNAc (13Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Dotson G.D. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J.

In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of P. putida KT2440 mutants, which are defective in the PHA synthesis via fatty acid de novo biosynthesis, and we identified and characterized the gene locus, which phenotypically complements these mutants. The gene product of phaG was purified, and the catalyzed reaction was identified. Pseudomonads and Escherichia coli strains as well as the plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. E. coli was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.

Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared from crude lysates by the alkaline extraction procedure (18Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). Total genomic DNA was isolated according to Ausubel et al. (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Stuhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). All genetic procedures and manipulations of DNA were conducted as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) with single-stranded or with double-stranded alkali-denatured plasmid DNA but with 7-deazaguanosine 5′-triphosphate instead of dGTP (22Mizusawa S. Nishimura S. Seela F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and with α-35S-dATP using a T7 polymerase sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Synthetic oligonucleotides were used as primers, and the “primer-hopping strategy” (23Strauss E.C. Kobori J.A. Siu G. Hood L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was employed. Analysis was done in 8% (w/v) acrylamide gels in buffer, pH 8.3, containing 100 mm hydrochloride, 83 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, and 42% (w/v) urea in a S2-sequencing apparatus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nucleic acid sequence data and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the sequence analysis software package (version 6.2, June 1990) according to Devereux et al. (24Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and amino acid sequence data reported here have been submitted to GenBank™ under accession numberAF052507. Total RNA was isolated as described by Oelmüller et al. (25Oelmüller U. Krüger N. Steinbüchel A. Friedrich C.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 73-84Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The determination of the transcriptional start site was done by a S1 nuclease protection assay. The hybridization conditions for the S1 nuclease protection assays were done as described by Berk and Sharp (26Berk A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) and Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the S1 nuclease reactions were conducted as described by Aldea et al. (27Aldea M. Claverie-Martin F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Kushner S.R. Gene. 1988; 65: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA probes and dideoxynucleotide sequencing reactions for sizing the signals were performed with pBluescript SK−BH13 DNA as a template. In the annealing reaction, the oligonucleotide (5′-GGGTATTCGCGTCACCT-3′) complementary to positions 887 to 871 and the oligonucleotide 5′-CCGCATCCGCGCGATAG-3′ complementary to positions 986 to 970, respectively, were used for35S labeling. For all mapping experiments, 25 μg of RNA was mixed with the labeled DNA fragments (107 cpm/μg of DNA). Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed in 100-μl volumes according to Sambrooket al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in an Omnigene thermocycler (Hybaid Ltd., Teddington, U. K.) with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany). The following oligonucleotides were used as primers to amplify the coding region of phaG to construct plasmids pBHR-QG (derivative of pQE60 (Qiagen), insertion intoNcoI/BamHI sites) and pBHR81 (derivative of pBBR1MCS-2 (28Kovach M.E. Gene. 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), insertion intoEcoRI/BamHI sites), respectively: 5′-CATGCCATGGGAAGGCCAGAAATCGCTGTA-3′, 5′-CGCGGATCCGATGGCAAATGCATGCTGCCC-3′ (pBHR-QG); 5′-CGGAATTCAAGGAGTCGATGACATG-3′, 5′-CGCGGATCCCGGCGCCCCGTGGCC-3′ (pBHR81). Both plasmids possess artificial ribosome binding sites conserved for E. coli, and transcription is regulated by the lac promoter. Approximately 1 g (wet weight) of E. colicells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.4, 0.8% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, which was supplemented with 200 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride per ml) and disrupted by sonification for 1 min at an amplitude of 14 μm in a W 250 sonifier (Branson Schallkraft GmbH, Germany). Soluble cell fractions were obtained as supernatants from 30 min of centrifugation at 50,000 × g and 4 °C. SDS- and mercaptoethanol-denatured proteins were separated in 11.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mmglycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (30Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant PhaG-(His)6 tag (C-terminal fusion) was purified from E. coli JM109-harboring plasmid pBHR-QG. Crude extract was subjected to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and washed twice with 20 mm imidazole, and the PhaG-(His)6 tag was eluted with 250 mmimidazole. Purified PhaG-(His)6 tag was used to raise anti-PhaG antibodies. Native PhaG was purified from Pseudomonas oleovorans ATCC 29347-harboring plasmid pBHR81 by native preparative PAGE (14% (w/v) polyacrylamide) applying the PrepCell 491 (Bio-Rad). As a reference substance, (R,S)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA was synthesized using 10 milliunits of acyl-CoA synthetase (Sigma) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm coenzyme A, and 2 mm (R,S)-3-hydroxydecanoate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 volumes of Dole's reagent (80% (v/v), 20% (v/v) n-heptane, 0.02 nH2SO4), and remaining free fatty acid was extracted with n-heptane. (R,S)-3-Hydroxydecanoyl-ACP was synthesized as described by Rock and Cronan were used (31Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was conducted with a RP18 column (nucleosil C18, 7 μm, Knauer) and 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 5.3 as mobile phase. Thioesters were eluted with increasing acetonitrile gradient and detected with a diode array detector (DAD 540, Kontron) at a spectral range of 200 to 500 nm with a 0.8-nm spectral resolution. The transferase assay was conducted in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithioerythrol, 500 μm acyl carrier protein (Sigma), and 2 mm(R,S)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA with a 100-μg protein of crude extract or 50 μg of purified PhaG. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Dole's reagent, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. Mutants of P. putidaKT2440, which are only deficient in the metabolic route-linking fatty acid de novo synthesis, were generated with nitrosoguanidine according to Miller et al. (16Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 125-129Google Scholar). Five mutants (PhAGN) were identified, which accumulated PHA only up to 3% of the cellular dry weight (CDW) from gluconate but up to 85% PHA of CDW when cultivated on octanoate as the sole carbon source. The composition of the polymer was not affected. We constructed a library of EcoRI-digested P. putida KT2440 genomic DNA with the cosmid vector pVK100 (32Knauf V.C. Nester E.W. Plasmid. 1982; 8: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and the Gigapack II Gold Packaging Extract (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) in E. coli S17-1. Approximately 5,000 transductants were applied to minicomplementation experiments, with mutant PHAGN-21 as recipient. One of the hybrid cosmids (pVK100::K18) harbored three EcoRI-fragments (3, 6, and 9 kbp) and enabled PHAGN-21 to accumulate PHA from gluconate. Subcloning revealed that the 3-kbp EcoRI fragment (E3, pMPE3) complemented PHAGN-21 and any other PHAGN mutant exhibiting this phenotype. Complementation was not achieved by the hybrid cosmid pHP1016::PP2000 comprising the entire 7.3-kbp PHA synthase locus of P. aeruginosa PAO1 plus approximately 13 kbp of the upstream region or by the hybrid cosmid pHP1016::PP180 comprising the phaC2 gene of P. aeruginosa PAO1 plus approximately 16 kbp of the adjacent downstream region (10Timm A. Steinbüchel A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragment E3 was cloned into pBluescript SK, and the entire nucleotide sequence was determined (Fig. 1). It comprised 3,061 nucleotides with three ORFs (Fig. 1). The only ORF that was completely localized on this fragment was ORF2 with 885 nucleotides starting at position 911 and terminating at position 1795 (Fig. 1). ORF2 will be referred to asphaG. A putative S/D sequence was identified eight nucleotides upstream of the start codon. About 230 bp downstream of the translational stop codon a potential factor-independent transcription terminator was located (Fig. 1). ORF1 and ORF3 are localized only incompletely on E3 with ORF1 lacking the 5′-region and with ORF3 lacking the 3′-region. The amino acid sequence deduced from ORF1 revealed significant homologies to a hypothetical, not further characterized protein of Hemophilus influenzae (33Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J. Tomb J.F. Dougherty B.A. Merrick J.M. McKenney K. Sutton G. FitzHugh W. Fields C.A. Gocayne J.D. Scott J.D. Shirley R. Liu L.I. Glodek A.

In contrast, the amino acid sequence deduced from ORF3 did not reveal any significant homology to proteins available from EMBL data base. Several other smaller ORFs were detected. However, none of them did obey the rules of Bibb et al. (34Bibb M.J. Findlay P.R. Johnson M.W. Gene. 1984; 30: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) for a coding region or was preceded by a reliable ribosomal binding site. The codon usages in phaG, ORF1 and ORF3 agreed well with typicalP. putida codon preferences. The G + C content of 59.2 mol % for phaG was similar to the value of 60.7 to 62.5 mol % determined for total genomic DNA of P. putida (35Rothmel R.K. Chakrabaty A.M. Berry A. Darzins A.

Sequence alignments of the amino acid sequence deduced from phaG revealed a 44% overall identity to the rhlA gene product of P. aeruginosa PG201 (Fig. 2). RhlA also consists of 295 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 32.5 kDa. This gene represents the 5′-terminal gene of a gene cluster consisting of the genesrhlA, rhlB, and rhlR. The first two genes encode proteins involved in rhamnolipid biosynthesis. TherhlB gene product exhibited rhamnosyltransferase activity, whereas the function of RhlA is not yet characterized but is necessary for effective rhamnolipid biosynthesis. RhlR represents a transcriptional activator acting upon ς54-dependent promoters (36Ochsner U.A. Fiechter A. Reiser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19787-19795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of RhlA and PhaG revealed high homology to a gene region (qin) of P. aeruginosa encoding the so-called “quinolone-sensitivity protein” (GenEMBL data library, accession number L02105) amounting to 50.6 and 40.1% to PhaG or to RhlA, respectively, in 249 overlapping residues (Fig. 2). This region comprises 1503 nucleotides. The N terminus of the qin gene was not exactly determined, and the homology as depicted in the data base extents only from nucleotide 207 to 566 of this sequence (Fig. 2). However, translation of this sequence in all six reading frames and a subsequent tBLASTn search resulted in the identification of homologies also in the upstream region of the suggested qintranslational start codons but in different reading frames with the N-terminal region of PhaG and RhlA. 244 bp upstream of phaG, a putative ς70-dependent promoter structure TTGCGCN17 TTGAAT(where N is a nucleoside) was identified. The promoter was verified by complementation studies of mutant PHAGN-21 with subfragments of E3. The 2.2-kbp SalI-EcoRI subfragment (SE 22, pMPSE22) (Fig. 1, Table I), which lacked the above-mentioned promoter sequence, did not complement this mutant, whereas the 1.3-kbp BamHI-HindIII subfragment (BH13, pBHR75) (Fig. 1, Table I) of E3 conferred the ability to again synthesize PHA from simple carbon sources. In addition, the significance of this putative promoter structure was proved by S1 nuclease protection with total RNA isolated from gluconate-grown and octanoate-grown cells of P. putidaKT2440 harvested in the stationary growth phase. The transcriptional start site was identified 5 nucleotides downstream of the putative promoter consensus sequence at position 673 (Fig. 1, 3). For octanoate-grown cells only an extremely weak RNA signal was detected, whereas a strong signal occurred with RNA isolated from gluconate-grown cells (Fig. 3). This indicated a strong transcriptional induction of phaG under conditions of PHA synthesis via fatty acid de novo biosynthesis. A plasmid expressing a C-terminal His(6) tag fusion protein of PhaG was constructed. The resulting plasmid pBHR-QG enabled overexpression of phaG under lac promoter control in E. coli JM109 (Fig. 4). The fusion protein could only be purified under denaturing conditions by immobilized metal ion affinity (Fig. 5) and was used as antigen to raise antibodies.Figure 5a, heterologous expression of phaG-His tag in E. coli and purification.

Gene. 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar) containing the coding region of phaG in sites EcoRI/BamHI (Fig. 4, Table II). Additionally, transfer of pBHR81 into P. oleovorans ATCC 29347, which is not capable of PHA synthesis from simple carbon sources, resulted in PHA accumulation from gluconate contributing to about 55% of CDW (Table II). Thus only functional expression of phaG in P. oleovorans established a metabolic link between fatty acidde novo biosynthesis and PHA synthesis. Expression of phaG in P. aeruginosa PAO1 based on plasmid pBHR81 revealed an ∼40% increase in PHA accumulation (Table II). We also investigated functional expression of phaG in E. coli JM109-harboring plasmids pBHR81 and pBHR71 allowing functional expression of PHA synthase gene phaC1 (8Langenbach S. Rehm B.H.A. Steinbüchel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but no PHA accumulation was observed when cells were grown on glucose. Furthermore, transfer of pBHR81 into P. aeruginosa UO299 (rhlA) did not result in complemention of this mutant with respect to rhamnolipid synthesis (data not shown). Thus PhaG does not functionally replace RhlA. To evaluate whether PhaG exhibits PHA synthase activity, we cultivated the P. putida PHAGNmutants harboring pBHR81 under nonlimited nitrogen conditions, which resulted in decreased PHA synthase levels and decreased PHA accumulation (37Kraak M.N. Smits T.H. Kessler B. Witholt B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4985-4991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Although there is no direct measurement of the lunar farside gravity, LP partially resolves four mascons in the large farside basins of Hertzsprung, Coulomb-Sarton, Freundlich-Sharonov, and Mare Moscoviense. The center of each of these basins contains a gravity maximum relative to the surrounding basin. The improved normalized polar moment of inertia (0.3932 +/- 0.0002) is consistent with an iron core with a radius of 220 to 450 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W1992372943,"For regulated secretion, mast cells and several other cell types utilize compound exocytosis, a combination of granule–plasma membrane and granule–granule fusions. The molecular machinery that controls this massive export process has not been identified. We report that SNAP-23, a t-SNARE related to SNAP-25, relocates in response to stimulation from plasma membrane lamellipodia-like projections to granule membranes in permeabilized mast cells. While relocation is a prerequisite for secretion, it can occur without membrane fusion and will expedite a subsequent secretory response. After relocation, SNAP-23 is required for exocytosis, implying a crucial role in promoting membrane fusion. Thus, relocation of this SNARE regulates compound exocytosis and links granule–plasma membrane and granule–granule fusions."
https://openalex.org/W2079904068,"The magnetometer and electron reflectometer experiment on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft has obtained maps of lunar crustal magnetic fields and observed the interaction between the solar wind and regions of strong crustal magnetic fields at high selenographic latitude (30°S to 80°S) and low (∼100 kilometers) altitude. Electron reflection maps of the regions antipodal to the Imbrium and Serenitatis impact basins, extending to 80°S latitude, show that crustal magnetic fields fill most of the antipodal zones of those basins. This finding provides further evidence for the hypothesis that basin-forming impacts result in magnetization of the lunar crust at their antipodes. The crustal magnetic fields of the Imbrium antipode region are strong enough to deflect the solar wind and form a miniature (100 to several hundred kilometers across) magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and bow shock system."
https://openalex.org/W2010750399,"The mobile group II intron of Lactococcus lactis, Ll.LtrB, provides the opportunity to analyze the homing pathway in genetically tractable bacterial systems. Here, we show that Ll.LtrB mobility occurs by an RNA-based retrohoming mechanism in both Escherichia coli and L. lactis. Surprisingly, retrohoming occurs efficiently in the absence of RecA function, with a relaxed requirement for flanking exon homology and without coconversion of exon markers. These results lead to a model for bacterial retrohoming in which the intron integrates into recipient DNA by complete reverse splicing and serves as the template for cDNA synthesis. The retrohoming reaction is completed in unprecedented fashion by a DNA repair event that is independent of homologous recombination between the alleles. Thus, Ll.LtrB has many features of retrotransposons, with practical and evolutionary implications."

Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The first member of this family to be reported was mouse CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein) (1Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Upon binding of ligand to cytokine receptors, receptor-associated JAKs become activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the membrane distal portion of the receptor (10Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Signaling molecules which subsequently bind to these phosphotyrosine containing motifs on the receptor include members of the STAT family. STATs are phosphorylated by cytokine receptor-associated JAKs, form dimers, and travel to the nucleus where they activate transcription. CIS was isolated as a cytokine responsive immediate-early gene in mouse hematopoietic cells (1Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CIS mRNA encodes a polypeptide of 257 amino acids that contains an SH2 domain in the middle of the molecule. Expression of CIS in IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell lines reduced the growth rate of the transformants, suggesting a negative role of CIS in signal transduction. The CIS protein associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated erythropoietin (EPO) receptor and the tyrosine-phosphorylated β chain of the IL-3 receptor, presumably by binding of the CIS SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine containing motifs in the receptors. A mutant IL-2 receptor that failed to activate STAT5 could not induce CIS, suggesting that STAT5 was important for cytokine induction of CIS. Indeed, upstream of the transcription initiation site in the CIS promoter are four potential STAT5-binding sites. Expression of STAT5 and the EPO receptor in HEK293 cells conferred EPO-dependent activation of the CIS promoter. In these cells, EPO-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was suppressed when CIS was coexpressed. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a negative feedback loop in which CIS is induced by the cytokine and then binds to the cytokine receptor, preventing the activation of STAT by JAKs (1Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, three CIS-related proteins were described and these proteins have been designated as SSI (STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) or SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) proteins 1–3 (3Starr R.

Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Together with CIS, SSI/SOCS proteins share a common domain structure consisting of an NH2-terminal region of variable length, a central SH2 domain and a COOH-terminal motif, termed the SOCS box, of unknown function. In contrast to cytokine receptors which do not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity but utilize JAKs for receptor phosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules such as STATs, the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor is a member of the tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors (11Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The IGF-I receptor is important for cellular growth, differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis. Binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to the IGF-I receptor results in receptor autophosphorylation. Receptor autophosphorylation amplifies the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and creates binding motifs for downstream signaling molecules. The IGF-I receptor and the closely related insulin receptor utilize a family of large docking proteins (insulin receptor substrate, IRS) (13Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IRS proteins bind to phosphotyrosine motifs on the receptor and, in turn, are phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues, creating binding motifs for the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p85), the adapter proteins Grb-2 and Nck, and the tyrosine phosphatase, Syp. The adapter protein Shc also binds directly to the IGF-I receptor (14Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and insulin receptor (15Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), providing an alternative pathway for the activation of Ras via Grb-2 and SOS. Thus, the major signaling pathways utilized by the IGF-I receptor are those in which Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase play an important role. We now report that a member of the SOCS family (SOCS-2) also interacts with the IGF-I receptor. SOCS-2 was cloned by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain library using the IGF-I receptor as bait. GST-hSOCS-2 binds to the activated IGF-I receptor from mouse fibroblasts and hSOCS-2 associates with the activated IGF-I receptor in vivo after transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with IGF-I receptor and hSOCS-2 plasmids. These results raise the possibility that SOCS proteins may also play a regulatory role in IGF-I receptor signaling. The human fetal brain activation domain fusion cDNA library, yeast strain EGY48, and two-hybrid expression plasmids were obtained from Dr. Roger Brent and have been previously described (14Dey B.R.

Human transformed primary embryonal kidney cells (293) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The antibody to the IGF-IR (number 4803) used for immunoblotting has been previously described (14Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The FLAG fusion protein expression system and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Eastman Kodak. The LexA monoclonal antibody was purchased from CLONTECH. The HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor (αIR3) was purified from ascites fluid by protein G affinity chromatography and coupled to Reacti-Gel (Pierce). All oligonucleotides and primers were synthesized using an ABI DNA synthesizer. Other reagents were purchased from commercial sources as indicated in the text or figure legends. The LexA-IGF-IR and LexA-IGF-IR (KR) (kinase negative receptor) bait hybrid plasmid constructs used in these studies have been previously described (14Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All mutants derived from the LexA-IGF-IR fusion protein were generated either by truncation or site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. The sequences of the mutant PCR fragments were verified by manual dideoxy or automatic ABI prism DNA sequencing. The full-length SOCS-2 cDNA was constructed by PCR using the overlapping clones 63 and 7-10 as templates. The SOCS-1 cDNA was obtained by PCR using cosmid clone 356d7 (accession numberAC002286) as template. The GEX-hSOCS-2 plasmid was constructed by introducing the coding sequence for amino acids 29–198 of hSOCS-2 into the vector GEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The GST fusion protein was expressed in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA residues 29–198 of hSOCS-2 were also subcloned in the pFLAG-CMV-2 mammalian expression vector (Eastman Kodak) to generate FLAG-hSOCS-2. The full-length human IGF-IR cDNA (provided by Dr. Derek LeRoith) was subcloned into pcDNA mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) for the construct pcDNA-IGF-IR. Routine yeast culture, preparation of various yeast selection media, and yeast transformations were carried out as described (17Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). The two-hybrid library screen was performed as described (16Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the first step, 0.5 μg of the library was transformed into EGY48 yeast containing LexA-IGF-IR plasmid and two reporter genes, lacZ and LEU2. The transformants were selected for growth on media lacking tryptophan, uracil, and histidine, and containing glucose as the carbon source. In the second step, interactors were selected by plating approximately 107 primary transformants on the same medium containing galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside and lacking leucine. About 80–100 clones having galactose-dependent, lacZ+, LEU2+ phenotypes were sorted by PCR and restriction digestion. This analysis identified eight distinct cDNA inserts. One of those cDNA fragments (clone 7-10) encoded amino acids 29–198 of human SOCS-2. Subsequently, 5′-RACE PCR was used to clone the full-length hSOCS-2 cDNA from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Marathon ready,CLONTECH). Two gene specific primers, 5′-CCTTGCACATCTGAACATAGTAGTCGATCAG-3′ (hSOCS-2,-720/-689, accession number AF037989) and 5′-GATTTGACACATATGATAGACTCCAATCTG-3′ (hSOCS-2, -658/-629), designed from the complementary sequence of clone 7-10, were used in this amplification. The 5′ primers were provided byCLONTECH. Twelve RACE PCR fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The largest clone (number 63), contains the 5′ sequence of hSOCS-2 cDNA. Multiple tissue human poly(A) RNA blots were obtained from CLONTECH and hybridized to32P-labeled clone number 63 (nucleotides 1–658; accession number AF037989). The probe was labeled by random priming and separated from the free nucleotides by G-50 Sephadex chromatography. The blots were hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h after adding the labeled DNA probe at a concentration of 2 × 106 cpm/ml of hybridization buffer. Hybridization was followed by three to five high stringency washes and autoradiography. GST-hSOCS-2(29–198) or glutathione S-transferase (GST) in bacterial lysates was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and the washed beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with cell lysates derived from NWTc43 cells (NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human IGF-IR). Subconfluent monolayers of these cells were serum starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media and lysed prior to or after IGF-I (20 nm) stimulation. Lysates were prepared as described previously (16Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After incubation with the lysates at 4 °C overnight the beads were washed 4 times with cold lysis buffer, boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary and secondary antibodies described in the text and figure legends. Detection was with ECL (Amersham). The human SOCS-2 (amino acids 29–198) cDNA was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 mammalian expression vector (FLAG-hSOCS-2). 293 cells were transfected with the vector using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies). For co-transfection experiments pcDNA-IGF-IR (or the pcDNA empty vector) was included. After 48 h in growth medium the cells were serum starved for 32 h and were then lysed either prior to or after stimulation with IGF-I (20 nm) for 40 min. Lysis buffer consisted of 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 100 mm sodium fluoride or 1.0% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 100 mm sodium fluoride containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Immunoprecipitates (4 °C for 6 h) obtained with anti-FLAG (M2 affinity gel) or anti-IGF-IR (αIR3-agarose) were washed 4 times with cold lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies (given in text or figure legend) and visualized with the ECL detection system (Pierce). 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human IGF-IR (NWTc43) were maintained in similar medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate). We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-IR. A LexA DNA-binding vector containing the entire coding sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-IR was used as bait to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library fused to the B42 activation domain. Using this system we detected positive interactors by galactose-dependent activation of two reporter genes, lacZ and LEU2. Clone 7-10 was one of eight distinct cDNAs, which included Grb10 (14Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), 14-3-3β and ζ (16Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and p55γ (18Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley S.P. Gene (Amst .). 1998; 209: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sequencing of clone 7-10 showed that it contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 170 amino acids. A search of the data base at the time of initial cloning of 7-10 showed that it had weak homology to the SH2 domain of p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase but no good match was found. We therefore used 5′-RACE to identify the full-length protein. Using a human fetal brain cDNA as template, we obtained 12 overlapping clones. The nucleotide sequence of the longest clone (number 63) overlapped 258 base pairs of the 5′-end of clone 7-10 (Fig. 1 A). These overlapping clones (numbers 63 and 7-10) represent a 1947-base pair cDNA that contains an open reading frame spanning nucleotides 318 to 914 and encodes a protein of 198 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). The presumed initiation codon is similar, but not identical to, a Kozak consensus sequence (19Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Data base analysis done at that time indicated that this protein is identical to hSOCS-2 (6Minamoto S. Ikegame K. Ueno K. Narazaki M. Naka T. Yamamoto H. Matsumoto T. Saito H. Hosoe S. Kishimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The hSOCS-2 protein contains a 47-residue amino-terminal region, a central SH2 domain, and a COOH-terminal SOCS box (20Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to characterize the interaction of SOCS proteins with the IGF-IR. To determine if the full-length SOCS-2 protein interacts with the IGF-IR, the cDNA encoding the full-length protein was constructed using a primer overlapping a sequence common to clones numbers 63 and 7-10 and the product was inserted into the activation domain hybrid plasmid (AD-SOCS-2(FL)). Co-expression of this plasmid with the IGF-IR bait plasmid resulted in galactose-dependent activation of both the lacZ and LEU2 reporter genes to levels similar to or greater than those observed with the SOCS-2(29–198) fragment isolated in the library screen (i.e. 7-10) or with the AD-IRS-1(2-516) hybrid, a relatively strong indicator (14Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Table I). In contrast, neither reporter gene was activated when the AD-SOCS-2(FL)hybrid was coexpressed with a kinase negative receptor bait in which lysine 1003 is changed to arginine (Table I). These results indicate that the full-length SOCS-2 protein also interacts with the IGF-IR and that receptor activation is necessary for this interaction.Table IInteraction of the IGF-IR with SOCS proteins in the yeast two-hybrid systemBaitPreyLEU2lacZ (relative activity) mean ± S.D.GluGalWTSOCS-2(FL)0+41.00WTSOCS-2(29–198)0+40.63 ± 0.19KRSOCS-2(FL)000.00WTSOCS-1(FL)0+41.53 ± 0.11KRSOCS-1(FL)000.004FSOCS-2(FL)0+40.73 ± 0.091244YSOCS-2(FL)0+41.46 ± 0.11WTNone000.00WTIRS-1(2–516)0+40.23 ± 0.06IGF-IR lexA baits are given in the left column and various SOCS and IRS-1 preys are given in the second column.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with HA antibody indicated that all of the prey constructs were expressed at approximately equal levels. To determine if other members of the SOCS family interact with the IGF-IR, an activation domain hybrid containing the complete coding sequence of SOCS-1 was constructed (3Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). When this construct (AD-SOCS-1(FL)) was co-expressed with the wild-type IGF-IR bait, the reporter genes were expressed at high levels. Again, co-expression with the kinase negative bait did not result in reporter gene activation (Table I). We have previously shown that the yeast two-hybrid system can be used to map the sites of interaction of the IGF-IR with IRS-1, Shc, and 14-3-3 proteins (14Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To identify the site of interaction of the IGF-IR with SOCS-2, we coexpressed the full-length protein with a series of mutant receptor baits. These included mutants in which tyrosines 950, 1250, 1251, and 1316 were mutated to phenylalanine, either alone or in combination, and constructs in which the carboxyl-terminal portions of the receptor was deleted. Mutation of the tyrosine residues to phenylalanine, either alone (data not shown) or in combination (i.e. 4F), had little effect on binding of the receptor (Table I). Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 93 amino acids (i.e. 1244Y) increased binding slightly (Table I). These data indicate that tyrosine 950 and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor containing tyrosines 1250, 1251, and 1316 are not required for interaction with SOCS-2 and suggest that the interaction occurs through either the kinase domain or the juxtamembrane region of the receptor. We examined the tissue distribution of hSOCS-2 mRNAs by Northern blot analysis using human multiple tissue poly(A) RNA blots and probing with the 32P-labeled amino-terminal fragment number 63 (nucleotides 1–658; accession number AF037989) (Fig. 1 A). A 5.0-kb mRNA species was present in all fetal and adult tissues examined (Fig. 2, A-C). This mRNA was most abundant in fetal kidney and adult heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver. A prominent 5.0-kb band also seen in adult kidney, thymus, prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon. Interestingly, additional smaller mRNA species (the most prominent being 2.0 and 2.8 kb) were also observed in adult tissues but not in the fetal tissues examined. Thus hSOCS-2 mRNA expression appears to be under both developmental and tissue specific controls. We investigated the association of IGF-IR with hSOCS-2 in vitro using a GST-hSOCS-2 (amino acids 29–198) fusion protein and the IGF-IR derived from mouse fibroblasts overexpressing this receptor (NWTc43). Subconfluent monolayer cultures of NWTc43 cells were serum starved for 24 h and lysed prior to or after IGF-I stimulation for different times, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. Extracts were incubated with either GST-Sepharose beads or GST-hSOCS-2-Sepharose beads. Material remaining bound to the washed beads was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of the human IGF-IR (number 4803) (Fig. 3 A) or an antiserum to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3 B). GST-hSOCS-2 beads bound to IGF-IR from NWTc43 in an IGF-I dependent pattern. No binding was observed when the lysates were incubated with resin containing GST alone. These data show that hSOCS-2 binds the IGF-IR in an in vitro system and that the association is dependent on receptor activation. To demonstrate that the interaction of the IGF-IR and hSOCS-2 occursin vivo we utilized tr"

It has been in a polar orbit around the moon since 16 January 1998. Neutron flux data show that there is abundant H, and hence probably abundant water ice, in the lunar polar regions. Gamma-ray and neutron data reveal the distribution of Fe, Ti, and other major and trace elements on the moon. The data delineate the global distributions of a key trace element–rich component of lunar materials called KREEP and of the major rock types. Magnetic mapping shows that the lunar magnetic fields are strong antipodal to Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis and has discovered the smallest known magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and bow shock complex in the solar system. Gravity mapping has delineated seven new gravity anomalies and shown that the moon has a small Fe-rich core of about 300 km radius."

During the course of hematogenous metastasis, cancer cells escape from the primary tumor, enter the blood stream, arrest in the vasculature of a secondary organ, and extravasate to form new tumor colonies (reviewed in Ref. 1Fidler I.J. DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenbvery S.A. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. 5th Ed. Lipincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1997: 135-152Google Scholar). The fate of tumor cells in the blood circulation has been traced by injecting labeled cells via intravenous and intracardiac routes. These studies conclude that cancer cells initially arrest in the microvasculature of the first organ they enter. Most tumor cells die in this location (2Weiss L. Dimitrov D.S. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 121: 307-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and only a few succeed to form metastases or recirculate to colonize other organs in a tumor type-specific pattern (3Yeatman T.J. Nicolson G.L. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 1993; 9: 256-263PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical assessment supports these data indicating that some cancers favor select secondary locations for metastasis (4Sugarbaker E.V. Cancer Biol. Rev. 1981; 2: 235-278Google Scholar). For example, prostatic carcinomas and small cell carcinomas of the lungs preferentially colonize bones and the brain, respectively, while breast carcinomas most frequently metastasize to the lungs, but also to liver, bones, brain, and adrenals. There is mounting evidence that the initial selection of an organ for metastasis occurs at the time of attachment of blood-borne cancer cells to microvascular endothelia of that site. Vascular arrest appears to be mediated by “organotypic” molecules that are expressed on the endothelial cell surface of select vascular branches (i.e.postcapillary venules) (reviewed in Refs. 5Albelda S.M.

Lu-ECAM-1 selectively binds lung-metastatic melanoma cells, and its expression on endothelia of pulmonary venules correlates closely with the formation of melanoma metastases in these locations (11Zhu D. Pauli B.U. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Antiadhesive, anti-Lu-ECAM-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) inhibit colonization of the lungs by lung-metastatic murine B16 melanoma cells but have no effect on lung colonization by other types of lung-metastatic cancer cells tested thus far (9Zhu D. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In related work more recently, outside-out luminal membrane vesicles isolated from rat lung microvascular endothelia by in situperfusion with a low strength paraformaldehyde solution were shown to bind in significantly larger numbers to lung-metastatic than to nonmetastatic rat breast carcinoma cells (12Johnson R.C. Augustin-Voss H.G. Zhu D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 394-399PubMed Google Scholar, 13Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, vesicles prepared from the vasculature of a nonmetastasized organ showed no binding preference for either lung-metastatic or nonmetastatic mammary carcinoma cells. The mAb 6A3 generated against lung-derived endothelial cell membrane vesicles was shown to inhibit specific adhesion of lung endothelial vesicles to lung-metastatic breast cancer cells. The antibody identified a 110-kDa membrane glycoprotein of rat lung capillary endothelia, and N-terminal sequencing established identity with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV; also known as CD26 or gp110) (13Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two basic properties of DPP IV may account for the putative ability to serve as an adhesion molecule for cancer cells. First, consistent with its enzymatic function (reviewed in Ref. 14Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), DPP IV may use its substrate binding domain to form transient, adhesive bonds with substrates associated with the tumor cell surface. Such binding might be mediated by x-proline dipeptide sequences (e.g. RP, KP, and GP) of the putative DPP IV substrate. However, there is no direct evidence that such a mechanism may lead to cancer cell binding, although this mode of action has been proposed for human immunodeficiency virus adhesion to and entry into T lymphocytes (15Callebaut C. Krust B. Jacotot E. Hovanessian A.G. Science. 1993; 262: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ability of DPP IV to bind to fibronectin (FN) via a domain distinct from its substrate recognition site (16Piazza G.A. Callanan H.M. Mowery J. Hixson D.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the previously recognized association between cell surface expression of FN and lung metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (17Korach S. Poupon M.F. Du Villard J.A. Becker M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3624-3629PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether tumor cell surface-associated FN served as the ligand for DPP IV. Here, we confirm that DPP IV is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule for rat breast cancer cells and mediates lung metastasis by these tumor cells. The DPP IV ligand is identified as tumor cell surface-associated FN, and concomitantly, a correlation between the level of FN expression and the tumor cells' ability to bind to DPP IV and metastasize to the lungs is established. DPP IV/FN-mediated adhesion and metastasis are blocked when tumor cells are incubated with soluble DPP IV prior to conducting adhesion and lung colony assays. Adhesion is also blocked by anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3 and by anti-FN antiserum but is unaffected by soluble plasma FN (pFN) and thus may readily happen during hematogenous spread of cancer cells in vivo. The rat breast carcinoma cell lines R3230AC-MET and R3230AC-LR were obtained from Dr. J. A. Kellen (Sunnybrook Medical Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) (18Gardner H.A. Kellen J.A.

Detailed tissue typing of Dunning R3327 tumors suggest that these cancers are not, as originally thought, of prostatic origin but are likely derived from mammary epithelium (21Goebel H.W. Rausch U.

The metastatic potential of the four breast cancer cell lines was expressed as the median (range in parentheses) number of tumor colonies observed in the lungs 3 weeks after intravenous inoculation of 2 × 105 tumor cells into female Fischer 344 rats. R3230AC-MET produced 204 (176–237) lung colonies, R3320AC-LR 0 (0), MTF7 385 (312–397), and RPC-2 285 (78–327). Tumor cells were used for subsequent experiments within 10 passages following evaluation of their metastatic potential. They were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transformed human primary embryonal kidney cells (HEK293) were used in DPP IV transfection experiments. HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS.

The lysates were first precleared on a 1-ml column containing nonimmune mouse IgG immobilized on Protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the flow-through was directly applied onto a second 1-ml column of anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3 coupled to Protein G-agarose. Columns were washed and eluted as described in detail elsewhere (8Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.-C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The purity of the isolated DPP IV was monitored by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide) and visualized by silver or Coomassie Blue staining. Truncated DPP IV missing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains was isolated from acid extracts of rat lungs as described by Yamaguchiet al. (24Yamaguchi N. Plant C. Biancone L. Bachovchin W. McCluskey R. Andres G. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3. This truncation did not affect the enzymatic and adhesion qualities of DPP IV (data not shown). Truncated DPP IV was preferred over detergent-extracted, full-length DPP IV in antimetastasis assays, since it was soluble in physiological, detergent-free buffers and did not cause any adverse reactions in injected animals. Breast cancer cells in logarithmic growth phase were washed for 20 min at 37 °C in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium and then metabolically labeled overnight at 37 °C with 0.4 mCi of [35S]methionine in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 μm methionine and 10% dialyzed, FN-free FBS. To differentiate between labeled surface-associated and labeled cytoplasmic proteins, tumor cells were extracted in lysis buffer (30 min; 4 °C) either immediately or after treatment with α-chymotrypsin (10 μg/ml; 30 min; 37 °C) as suggested by Hynes (25Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3170-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and the DPP IV-tumor cell ligand was precipitated with DPP IV immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories). DPP IV-ligand complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE (5% polyacrylamide) under nonreducing and reducing (2% β-mercaptoethanol (BME)) conditions and visualized by autoradiography. The FN nature of the DPP IV precipitate obtained from metabolically labeled MTF7 breast cancer cell extracts was further analyzed by autoradiography and Western blotting. In brief, proteins precipitated with DPP IV and separated under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (5% polyacrylamide) were cut from the gel and extracted in 50 mm ammonium carbonate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% BME overnight at 37 °C. Extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant was supplemented with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid for 10 h at 4 °C. The trichloroacetic acid precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 100% cold ethanol, boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 1% BME (10 min), and then subjected again to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-FN antiserum (1:1000 in 5% skim milk) as described (10Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.-C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Data from Western blots were contrasted with data from autoradiographs obtained from the same membranes or from gels prepared identically to those used for Western analysis. The ability of breast cancer cells to incorporate pFN into their surface coat was tested under conditions that mimicked hematogenous spread. In brief, tumor cells (5 × 106cells) enzymatically released from their growth surface (0.25% trypsin in PBS; 5 min; 37 °C) were washed once in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FN-free FBS to stop the enzyme action and then incubated for various periods of time in rotating suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FN-free FBS, 10 μg/ml unlabeled rat pFN (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 μg/ml125I-pFN labeled by the IODO-BEAD™ method as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Cells were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C in either lysis buffer or 2% deoxycholate (DOC) in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 (26Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 537-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Extracts were precipitated with immobilized DPP IV as described above, and the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5% polyacrylamide) under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. The DOC-insoluble fraction was directly applied to SDS-PAGE. FN was visualized by autoradiography. All transfection studies were performed with rat kidney DPP IV cDNA obtained from Dr. D. Doyle (State University of New York, Buffalo, NY) (27Hong W. Doyle D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7962-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of kidney DPP IV cDNA was 100% identical to that of rat lung endothelial DPP IV cloned in our laboratory. 2H.-C. Cheng, M. Abdel-Ghany, R. C. Elble, and B. U. Pauli, manuscript in preparation. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with DPP IV cDNA cloned into pRcCMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Control HEK293 cells were transfected with the pRcCMV vector alone. A rosette assay was performed between DPP IV-transfected HEK293 cells and MTF7 breast cancer cells. MTF7 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded onto Lab-Tek® two-well chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) and grown overnight at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FN-free FBS. Cells were then labeled with the cytoplasmic dye Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described by El-Sabban and Pauli (28El-Sabban M.E. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A 100-fold excess of either DPP IV- or mock-transfected HEK293 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) previously labeled with SNARF-1-AM (Molecular Probes) was seeded onto the adherent MTF7 breast cancer cells in serum-free medium. MTF7 and HEK293 cells were co-cultured under a gentle rocking motion for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent HEK293 cells were removed by washing, and slides were examined under a fluorescent microscope (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 520–540 nm for Calcein and 550–650 nm for SNARF-1). Rosetting was indicated by the binding of six or more DPP IV-transfected HEK293 cells to MTF7 breast cancer cells. A total of 100 cells were counted in each of three experiments. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to quantify FN expression on breast cancer cell surfaces. Tumor cells released from their growth surface and recovered as described above were suspended in 10% donkey serum in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated with rabbit anti-rat pFN antiserum (diluted 1:100 in PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antiserum in PBS containing 10% donkey serum for 1 h at 4 °C and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. FACS analysis was performed on a Coulter Epics Profile (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Nonspecific fluorescence was accounted for by incubating tumor cells with nonimmune serum instead of primary antibody. A similar protocol was used to quantify the DPP IV expression on HEK293 cells transiently transfected with DPP IV cDNA, using anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3. Immulon® 4 Microtitration flat bottom plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with pFN (5 μg/ml in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Immunopurified DPP IV (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μg/ml) was added to the FN-coated wells in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml pFN and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound DPP IV was removed by washing, and bound DPP IV was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with anti-DPP IV antiserum CU31 (1:500 in PBS) (8Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Tumor cell adhesion assays were performed as described (9Zhu D. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The amount of DPP IV adsorbed per unit well surface area of Immulon® 4 Microtitration plates was determined from peptidase activity measurements relative to standard DPP IV enzyme activity curves (29Scharpé S. De Meester I. Vanhoof G. Hendriks D. van Sande M. Van Camp K. Yaron A. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted in the presence or absence of the following components in PBS: (a) mAbs 6A3 and 6D3 (both tested at 50 μg/ml); (b) DPP IV substrate GPA and control peptide GGA (Sigma) (20 mm); (c) serine proteinase inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) (Calbiochem) or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) (1–5 mm); (d) soluble DPP IV (wild-type DPP IV solubilized in 0.05% OG in PBS; truncated DPP IV in PBS alone) or glycophorin (50–1000 ng/ml); (e) soluble rat pFN (1–10 μg/ml); and (f) anti-FN antiserum (diluted 1:50 or 1:100). With the exception of soluble DPP IV and anti-FN antiserum, which were incubated with the tumor cells before addition to DPP IV-coated wells, these compounds were preincubated in DPP IV-coated wells for 1–2 h at room temperature and kept in the assay media throughout the tumor cell binding period unless indicated otherwise. Breast cancer cells (2 × 105 cells/0.3 ml of PBS/rat) were inoculated via the lateral tail vein of 6-week-old, female Fischer 344 rats (Charles River Laboratories) to determine their metastatic potential. Rats were sacrificed 3 weeks after tumor cell injection, and lung colonies were counted using a dissecting microscope. Median and range of the number of lung colonies were determined for each cell line. Metastasis inhibition experiments were conducted only with MTF7 cells. For this purpose, MTF7 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of purified, truncated DPP IV (80 μg/ml in PBS) prepared as described by Yamaguchi et al. (24Yamaguchi N. Plant C. Biancone L. Bachovchin W. McCluskey R. Andres G. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and then inoculated into rats as indicated above. Statistical comparisons between treatment groups were performed with Student's ttest for unpaired data. Lung-metastatic rat mammary carcinoma cells (MTF7; R3230AC-MET; RPC-2) adhered to DPP IV isolated and purified from rat lungs (capillary endothelia) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Adhesion of the three metastatic tumor cell lines plateaued at a coating concentration of 500 ng of DPP IV/50 μl of PBS/well (equal to 2.25 pmol of DPP IV bound per 1 mm2 of well bottom surface), yielding adhesion values of 60–70% for MTF7 carcinoma cells and 40–50% each for R3230AC-MET and RPC-2 carcinoma cells. By comparison, adhesion of nonmetastatic R3230AC-LR tumor cells reached only 8–12% at the same DPP IV coating concentration. The specific adhesion of these cancer cells to DPP IV was inhibited in a statistically significant manner (approximately 95%) upon incubation of the DPP IV-coated wells with monospecific anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3 (50 μg/ml) (Fig. 2). Control mAbs of the same immunoglobulin class had negligible effects on specific tumor cell binding. Participation of the peptidase substrate domain in the DPP IV binding to breast cancer cells was ruled out when neither the peptide substrate GPA nor the serine proteinase inhibitor AEBSF had any inhibitory effect on the adhesion of lung-metastatic breast cancer cells to DPP IV-coated dishes (Fig. 2). The observed DPP IV binding characteristics were not the result of a possible coprecipitation of adenosine deaminase, since rat lung DPP IV preparations were free of detectable adenosine deaminase (30Iwaki-Egawa S. Watanabe Y. Fujimoto Y. Cell Immunol. 1997; 178: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as determined by both enzyme assay and Western blotting, and since purified, commercially supplied adenosine deaminase (Sigma) did not support adhesion to lung-metastatic breast cancer cells (data not shown).Figure 2Adhesion of breast cancer cells to DPP IV is inhibited by anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3 but not by the DPP IV enzyme substrate GPA and the serine proteinase inhibitor AEBSF. Microtitration wells were coated with 500 ng of DPP IV, 50 μl of PBS, 0.25% OG/well (overnight at 4 °C); incubated with 50 μg/ml mAb (6A3 and 6D3), 20 mm GPA or GGA, or 5 mm AEBSF in PBS (30 min at 37 °C); and then seeded with 3 × 104 tumor cells and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Antibodies, GPA, and GGA were kept in the assay medium throughout the adhesion assay, while AEBSF was removed before tumor cells were added to the wells. Control adhesion assays were performed in PBS alone. Coating and adhesion assay was conducted as described in Ref. 9Zhu D. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Means and S.D. are shown from three experiments. •, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preincubation of lung-metastatic breast cancer cells with immunopurified, detergent-extracted DPP IV resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the specific adhesion of the breast cancer cells to DPP IV-coated dishes (Fig. 3). For example, at a DPP IV concentration of 200 μg/ml in the adhesion assay medium, the specific adhesion of MTF7 breast cancer cells to DPP IV-coated dishes was inhibited by more than 80%. The control membrane protein glycophorin dissolved at the same concentrations in the same buffer as DPP IV had no effect on breast cancer cell binding to DPP IV. Identical adhesion inhibition data were obtained when acid-extracted, truncated DPP IV was used instead of detergent-extracted, full-length DPP IV (data not shown). In accordance with these data, MTF7 breast cancer cells incubated with truncated DPP IV (80 μg/ml in PBS; 1 h; 37 °C) prior to intravenous inoculation into Fischer 344 rats were greatly impeded in their ability to colonize the lungs (Table I). At an inoculation dose of 2 × 105 tumor cells/rat, MTF7 cells incubated with buffer alone produced a median (range) of 385 (312–397) lung colonies, while DPP IV-decorated MTF7 cells generated only 79 (61–92) lung colonies, representing an 80% reduction in the number of lung metastases. DPP IV treatment of breast cancer cells had no effect on cell growth and viability. Similar metastasis inhibition studies were attempted with anti-DPP IV mAb 6A3. However, this antibody proved to be highly cytotoxic in Fischer 344 rats, causing severe pulmonary endothelial cell necrosis, edema, and hemorrhage, which often led to death of the rats within a few hours after intravenous inoculation of 100–500 μg of purified 6A3 antibody (24Yamaguchi N.

https://openalex.org/W1996328637,"Cholecystokinin (CCK) and other pancreatic secretagogues have recently been shown to activate signaling kinase cascades in pancreatic acinar cells, leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and Jun N-terminal kinases. We now show the presence of a third kinase cascade activating p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in isolated rat pancreatic acini. CCK and osmotic stress induced by sorbitol activated p38 MAP kinase within minutes; their effects were dose-dependent, with maximal activation of 2.8- and 4.4-fold, respectively. The effects of carbachol and bombesin on p38 MAP kinase activity were similar to those of CCK, whereas phorbol ester, epidermal growth factor, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide stimulated p38 MAP kinase by 2-fold or less. Both CCK and sorbitol also increased the tyrosyl phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Using the specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB 203580, we found that p38 MAP kinase activity was required for MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 activation in pancreatic acini. SB 203580 reduced the level of basal phosphorylation and blocked the increased phosphorylation of Hsp 27 after stimulation with either CCK or sorbitol. CCK treatment induced an initial rapid decrease in total F-actin content of acini, followed by an increase after 40 min. Preincubation with SB 203580 significantly inhibited these changes in F-actin content. Staining of the actin cytoskeleton with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and analysis by confocal fluorescence microscopy showed disruption of the actin cytoskeleton after 10 and 40 min of CCK stimulation. Pretreatment with SB 203580 reduced these changes. These findings demonstrate that the activation of p38 MAP kinase is involved not only in response to stress, but also in physiological signaling by gastrointestinal hormones such as CCK, where activation of Gq-coupled receptors stimulates a cascade in which p38 MAP kinase activates MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2, resulting in Hsp 27 phosphorylation. Activation of p38 MAP kinase, most likely through phosphorylation of Hsp 27, plays a role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in pancreatic acini.

CCK1 regulates a variety of pancreatic functions, including secretion of pancreatic enzymes (1Solomon T.E. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd. Ed. 2.

Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is thought that some of these nonsecretory effects are a result of the ability of CCK to regulate expression of transcriptional factors such as c-Myc, c-Jun, and c-Fos (5Lu L. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G327-G332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies with isolated rat pancreatic acini, we found that CCK activates ERKs and JNKs, as well as other upstream components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades such as MEK and Ras. CCK also stimulates downstream components such as MAPKAP kinase-1 (6Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar, 7Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L.

In mammalian cells, at least three parallel pathways are differentially regulated by a number of extracellular signals that act via different cell-surface receptor types. Central to these signaling pathways are the MAP kinases themselves: ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinase. The p38 MAP kinases (p38/CSBP/RK) are mammalian homologues of the HOG-1 MAP kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

In contrast to effects of hematopoietic growth factors, little is known about activation of p38 MAP kinase via Gq-coupled receptors. Here we demonstrate that CCK and other pancreatic secretagogues that activate secretion via the Gq-coupled CCK-A receptor can induce tyrosyl phosphorylation and activate p38 MAP kinase at physiological concentrations in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, this activation leads to the phosphorylation of Hsp 27. We also present data showing that CCK affects the actin cytoskeleton due to an activation of the p38 MAP kinase/Hsp 27 pathway.

(Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal anti-mouse Hsp 27 antibody was a gift from Dr. Michael Welsh (University of Michigan). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The preparation of pancreatic acini from Sprague-Dawley rats by means of collagenase digestion was according to Williams and co-workers (7Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bragado M.J. Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G401-G407PubMed Google Scholar,35Williams J.A. Korc M. Dormer R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 253: E517-E524Google Scholar). Acini were preincubated at 37 °C for 180 min, followed by stimulation with different agonists for the indicated times. When used, SB 203580 was included for the last 60 min of preincubation and in the incubation solution. Following stimulation, acini were pelleted; washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4 (pH 7.4); and sonicated for 5 s in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min, and the amount of protein in the cell extracts was assayed with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out as described earlier (7Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bragado M.J. Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G401-G407PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibody using the ECL detection system. To measure p38 MAP kinase activity, immunoprecipitated p38 MAP kinase was used to phosphorylate 5 μg of GST-ATF-2-(1–109) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (18 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. Reactions were terminated by addition of 4× SDS sample buffer, and samples were then subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis. Labeled phosphoprotein was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a phosphoimager system (Bio-Rad GS-250). Two major GST-ATF-2 purification products were observed by autoradiography after 32P incorporation and SDS gel electrophoresis, likely full-length GST-ATF-2 and a shorter degradation product. For quantitation of kinase assays, the upper band was used. In control experiments, GST alone was not phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated p38 MAP kinase. To measure MAPKAP kinase-2 activity, immunoprecipitated MAPKAP kinase-2 was used to phosphorylate a peptide from Hsp 27 (250 μm) (36Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking and terminated by transferring 25 μl of reaction products onto Whatman P-81 paper. The P-81 paper was then washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. MAPKAP kinase-1 and p70 S6 kinase assays were performed as described previously (8Bragado M.J. Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G401-G407PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C101-C109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in F-actin content after hormone stimulation were measured by the method of Condeelis and Hall (38Condeelis J. Hall A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as modified by Ding et al. (39Ding G. Franki N. Condeelis J. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C9-C16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acini were fixed for 15 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PIPES buffer (40 mmKPO4, 10 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgSO4 (pH 6.8)) and centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were discarded, and pellets were resuspended in PIPES buffer containing 0.1% saponin and incubated with 0.7 μm rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 60 min in darkness on a rotator. This concentration of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin saturated the F-actin in the acini as determined by using concentrations of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin in a range from 0.2 to 1 μm. Stained pellets were washed three times with 0.5 ml of saponin buffer. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was extracted from cell pellets with methanol, and protein was measured in each sample with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The fluorescence of extracts was measured using excitation at 541 nm and emission at 565 nm. The relative F-actin content was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence emission per microgram of protein of the hormone-stimulated sample divided by the fluorescence emission per microgram of protein of the control sample. The contribution of endogenous fluorescence to the fluorescence of the methanol extract at these wavelengths was negligible (<1%), as determined with extracts from unlabeled tissues. The extent of nonspecific binding of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was determined by the simultaneous addition of excess unlabeled phalloidin. At 100-fold excess of unlabeled phalloidin, nonspecific binding was 3% for both control and treated samples. Pancreatic acini were incubated as indicated above for fluorometric determination of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin binding to actin. At the time points indicated, 100-μl aliquots were transferred to slides previously coated with polylysine (17–30 kDa). The acini were allowed to attach spontaneously to the polylysine substrate during a 1-min incubation. Subsequently, acini were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde, prepared from paraformaldehyde. After rinsing in PBS, fixed acini were incubated sequentially with 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride in PBS for 10 min, with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum for 30 min, and then with 5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum for 60 min. Acini were rinsed thoroughly with PBS and covered with a drop of mounting medium (3:1 mixture of glycerol and PBS containing 4 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine) and a glass coverslip. Actin staining was analyzed by conventional epifluorescence microscopy and by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Noran OZ). With the confocal microscope, the distribution of actin was examined in a series of digitized optical sections (1-μm increments in the Z plane) that encompassed the thickness of the acinus being viewed. A contiguous series of three to four optical sections was sufficient to capture most of the actin staining associated with the luminal region of the acinus. For presentation of the data, this series of individual sections, for each incubation condition, was projected as a stack using Noran Intervision software and was processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0. The presence of p38 MAP kinase in rat pancreatic acini was demonstrated by Western blotting with a specific antibody that revealed a strong signal from a single protein band at an apparent molecular mass of 38–40 kDa (Fig. 1). This protein could be quantitatively immunoprecipitated from both control and stimulated acinar cell lysates, as shown by its absence in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). The immunoprecipitates contained kinase activity for the p38 substrate GST-ATF-2-(1–109) (Fig. 2 A). When acini were stimulated with CCK for varying times, the immunoprecipitated p38 MAP kinase activity was increased by 1 min and reached a maximum after 10 min, when a 2.8 ± 0.1-fold increase was observed (Fig. 2 A). The p38 MAP kinase activity remained elevated for at least 30 min. After incubation for 10 min with different doses of CCK, the minimal response of p38 MAP kinase to CCK stimulation was observed at a 10 pm concentration of the hormone, whereas maximal responses were observed between 300 pm and 1 nm(Fig. 2 B). Higher concentrations led to a decrease in p38 MAP kinase activity.Figure 2Time course and concentration-dependent effect of CCK-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase in rat pancreatic acini. Acini were incubated with or without 1 nm CCK for the indicated times (A) or with CCK at various concentrations for 10 min and then lysed (B). Samples were immunoprecipitated overnight with p38 MAP kinase antibody, and the recovered protein was used in a kinase reaction with GST-ATF-2 as substrate. A representative experiment for each condition is shown at the top of the graphs. The intensity of phosphorylation was measured by a phosphoimager and is expressed as a -fold increase of the value at time 0. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Addition of 0.3 m sorbitol to the incubation medium to increase osmolarity induced a rapid activation of p38 MAP kinase that was significant at 2.5 min and maximal at 10 min and that remained elevated for at least 20 min (Fig. 3 A). The activation of p38 MAP kinase in pancreatic acini was dependent on the concentration of sorbitol (Fig. 3 B). Addition of 0.1m sorbitol led to an ∼2.2-fold increase in p38 MAP kinase, whereas maximal activation (4.4 ± 0.4-fold) was observed with addition of 0.3 m sorbitol. Higher concentrations of sorbitol led to decreased activation. To distinguish whether activation of p38 MAP kinase was specific for sorbitol or whether hyperosmolarity was the cause of the activation, we also stimulated the acini by addition of either mannitol or sucrose. The 4–5-fold activation of p38 MAP kinase observed for each agent was of the same magnitude as that obtained after sorbitol stimulation (data not shown). These data indicate that hyperosmotic stress can activate p38 MAP kinase in isolated rat pancreatic acini. Stimulation of pancreatic acini with 1 nmCCK, 100 μm carbachol, or 100 nm bombesin for 10 min led to a 2.5–3-fold increase in p38 MAP kinase activity (Fig. 4). 1 μm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a potent stimulator of protein kinase C, activated p38 MAP kinase by ∼2-fold. The Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (30 μm), EGF (0.1 μm), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (1 μm) induced only a minimal increase, whereas anisomycin (50 μg/ml) activated p38 MAP kinase ∼2-fold. Incubation of acini with a combination of cyclopiazonic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in additive effects on p38 MAP kinase activity. The strongest p38 MAP kinase activation (∼4.4-fold increase) was observed with hyperosmolarity induced by addition of 0.3 m sorbitol (Fig. 4). The combination of sorbitol and CCK or sorbitol and carbachol showed no additive effect (data not shown). Using an antibody that recognizes only the activated form of p38 MAP kinase by detecting its phosphorylation at tyrosine 182, we were able to measure the tyrosyl phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase as an alternative way of assessing activation (Fig. 5 A). Densitometric analysis of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase following Western blotting showed a 2–3-fold increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation after CCK and sorbitol stimulation (Fig. 5 B). MAPKAP kinase-2 has been reported to be a substrate of p38 MAP kinase (15Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

To determine whether the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 by CCK was due to activation of p38 MAP kinase, we immunoprecipitated MAPKAP kinase-2 from isolated acini that had been stimulated with 1 nm CCK or 0.3 msorbitol and assessed its activity using a peptide from Hsp 27 as substrate. Stimulation with CCK led to an ∼2-fold increase in MAPKAP kinase-2 activity (Fig. 6 A), which correlated with the ability of the hormone to activate p38 MAP kinase. Stimulation with sorbitol produced a 3–4-fold increase in MAPKAP kinase-2 activity, similar to the activation of p38 MAP kinase. MAPKAP kinase-2 has also been reported to be activated by the ERK MAP kinase family (41Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To investigate which of these kinases was responsible for the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 by CCK or sorbitol, we used SB 203580, a pyridinyl imidazole derivative that is a highly specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase activity (42Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). SB 203580 inhibits p38 MAP kinase activity competitively by binding to the ATP-binding domain of the kinase (43Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F.

The eNOS-caveolin-1 interaction inhibits eNOS catalytic activity. In the present study, we show that eNOS also participates in reversible inhibitory interactions with the G protein-coupled bradykinin B2 receptor. eNOS and the B2 receptor are coimmunoprecipitated from endothelial cell lysates by antibodies directed against either of the two proteins.

Inhibition appears to be due to competition between caveolin-1 and Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) for interaction with the enzyme (2Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol.

Thus, one of the mechanisms for eNOS activation in endothelial cells appears to involve agonist-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ and subsequent displacement by Ca2+-CaM of caveolin-1 from its inhibitory interaction with eNOS. For example, it has recently been shown that the eNOS-caveolin-1 complex undergoes dissociation in cultured endothelial cells in response to either the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or the eNOS-activating muscarinic cholinergic agonist, carbachol (5Feron O.

Another endothelial eNOS-activating agonist is bradykinin (BK) (6Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). BK signal transduction in endothelial and other cell types is mediated by G protein-coupled cell surface receptors termed B2 receptors (7McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C.

B2 receptors, like other members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, are predicted to contain seven membrane-spanning α-helices, four extracellular domains, and four intracellular domains. Recently, we have shown that the B2 receptor interacts with its downstream effector enzyme, phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) in a ligand- and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (9Venema V.J. Ju H.

In the present study, we show that the B2 receptor also interacts with another of its downstream effector enzymes, namely eNOS. This interaction is regulated in a ligand- and Ca2+-dependent manner. We have also identified the functional consequences of receptor binding on eNOS catalytic activity and have mapped the region in the receptor involved in interaction with the enzyme.

Bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were scraped from the plates and precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. Anti-B2 receptor antibody (5 μg/ml) or anti-eNOS antibody (5 μg/ml) were then added to the precleared lysates for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein A/G Plus agarose (50 μl) and rocking overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then pelleted and washed two times in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins in gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting for 1 h at 100 mA. Anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-B2 receptor antibody (1:500 dilution) and anti-B2 receptor immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody (1:500 dilution). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit. cDNA constructs encoding GST-B2 receptor fusion proteins were created by subcloning into the GST fusion protein cloning vector, pGEX-4T-1. The construct encoding the B2 receptor intracellular domain 4 (residues 310–364) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the full-length human cDNA using primers containing 5′ EcoRI and SalI sites to allow for digestion and subcloning. Construct inserts encoding the human B2 receptor intracellular domains 1 (residues 57–65), 2 (residues 128–147), and 3 (residues 222–240) were created by annealing two reverse complementary coding sequence oligonucleotides containing 5′ overhangs that created the EcoRI and SalI sticky ends required for subcloning. The cDNA sequence encoding each of the fusion proteins was verified by sequencing in the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Medical College of Georgia. GST-B2 receptor fusion proteins, the GST-AT1 receptor fusion protein, and a GST nonfusion protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose as described previously (2Ju H.

Bovine eNOS was expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose as described previously (12Venema R.C.

The enzyme was purified in buffers containing 2 mm EGTA and was thus completely dependent on exogenous CaM for activity. GST, GST-B2 receptor fusion proteins, or the GST-AT1 receptor fusion protein (100 pmol of each, quantitated by Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay), prebound to glutathione-agarose beads, were incubated overnight (at 4 °C with shaking) with 100 pmol of purified eNOS in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol and the following protease inhibitors: 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Following the overnight incubation, beads were washed six times in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, and the protease inhibitors listed above. Proteins remaining bound to the beads after washing were eluted with 100 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors. Eluted proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody (1:1000 dilution). GST or GST-B2 receptor fusion proteins or synthetic peptides corresponding to the human B2 receptor residues 310–329 (KRFRKKSWEVYQGVCQKGGC), 330–347 (RSEPIQMENSMGTLRTSI), 348–364 (SVERQIHKLQDWAGSRQ), and 310–334 (KRFRKKSWEVYQGVCQKGGCRSEPI) were tested for their effects on eNOS catalytic activity. GST or GST-B2 receptor fusion proteins (300 pmol of each, quantitated by Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with purified eNOS (100 pmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. eNOS activity was then determined by monitoring the rate of conversion ofl-[14C]citrulline froml-[14C]arginine (50 μm) in the presence of excess cofactors including Ca2+ (2 mm), CaM (250 pmol), NADPH (1 mm), FAD (4 μm), FMN (4 μm), and tetrahydrobiopterin (40 μm) in a 200-μl reaction mixture as described previously (12Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Arnal J.-F. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14705-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Purified eNOS (1 μg) was incubated with or without synthetic peptides (10 and 100 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer for 5 min at 37 °C and then subjected to CaM-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (12Venema R.C.

Endothelial bradykinin B2 post-receptor signaling involves activation of eNOS (14Busse R. Fleming I. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether eNOS interacts with the B2 receptor in endothelial cells, we lysed bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in membrane-solubilizing buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and subjected the lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-eNOS and anti-B2 receptor antibodies. Anti-B2 receptor immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody and anti-eNOS immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-B2 receptor antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, eNOS (130 kDa) was specifically coimmunoprecipitated from endothelial cell lysates by the anti-B2 receptor antibody. In addition, the ligand-binding, glycosylated form of the B2 receptor (70 kDa) (15abd Alla S.A. Buschko J. Quitterer U. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Breipohl G. Knolle J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17277-17285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was specifically coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-eNOS antibody. eNOS and the B2 receptor thus appear to form a complex in endothelial cells in a manner similar to that of eNOS and caveolin-1. A definitive answer to the question of how much of the total cellular eNOS is complexed with the B2 receptor cannot be obtained using coimmunoprecipitation protocols because detergent-containing buffers used to solubilize membrane proteins may also disrupt certain protein-protein interactions. However, if it is assumed that none of the eNOS-B2 receptor complex is dissociated during solubilization, our results indicate that <5% of total cellular eNOS exists in a complex with the receptor. Feronet al. (5Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) have reported previously that eNOS can be almost quantitatively immunoprecipitated from endothelial cells with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Therefore, the proportion of eNOS in BAEC that is complexed with the B2 receptor may be small compared with that complexed with caveolin-1. It is also possible that eNOS exists, to at least some extent, in a trimeric complex with both caveolin-1 and the B2 receptor. To examine whether eNOS and the B2 receptor interact directly, we prepared B2 receptor-GST fusion proteins for use in in vitro binding assays. GST fusion proteins containing the human B2 receptor intracellular domain 1 (ID1, residues 57–65), 2 (ID2, residues 128–147), 3 (ID3, residues 222–240), and 4 (ID4, residues 310–364) were each expressed in E. coli. In addition, a GST nonfusion protein was expressed as a control. The GST fusion proteins and GST alone were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose. The GST-B2 receptor fusion proteins and GST alone, prebound to agarose beads, were then used in in vitrobinding assays with recombinant bovine eNOS, expressed and purified from a baculovirus system (2Ju H.

Beads were incubated with eNOS at 4 °C overnight and then washed six consecutive times in buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Proteins remaining bound to the beads after the washing were eluted with reduced glutathione, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-eNOS antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, eNOS (130 kDa) bound specifically to the GST-B2R-ID4 fusion protein but not to GST alone or to the GST-B2R-ID1, GST-B2R-ID2, or GST-B2R-ID3 fusion proteins. eNOS can thus bind directly to the B2 receptor intracellular domain 4. Furthermore, binding of eNOS to this domain is very tight because it is stable during extensive washing in buffer containing 1 m NaCl. To determine whether interaction of eNOS with the B2 receptor C-terminal intracellular domain 4 alters eNOS catalytic activity, we incubated equal quantities of purified, baculovirus-expressed eNOS in the absence and presence of equimolar quantities of purified GST alone or the GST-B2R-ID1, GST-B2R-ID2, GST-B2R-ID3, and GST-B2R-ID4 fusion proteins. eNOS catalytic activity was then determined by arginine-to-citrulline conversion assay in the presence of excess cofactors, Ca2+, and CaM. As shown in Fig. 3, neither GST alone nor the GST-B2R-ID1, GST-B2R-ID2, and GST-B2R-ID3 fusion proteins affected eNOS activity. The GST-B2R-ID4 fusion protein, however, significantly inhibited eNOS activity. Interaction of eNOS with the B2 receptor C-terminal intracellular domain thus appears to inhibit eNOS catalytic activity in a manner analogous to that of the eNOS-caveolin-1 interaction (1Michel J.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To map the region within the B2 receptor C-terminal intracellular domain responsible for eNOS inhibition, we prepared synthetic peptides corresponding to three contiguous segments of the human B2 receptor intracellular domain 4. Each of the peptides was tested for its ability to inhibit the activity of purified, baculovirus-expressed eNOS. eNOS activity was measured by the arginine-to-citrulline conversion assay as before. A peptide corresponding to residues 310–329 potently inhibited eNOS activity (IC50 ∼ 1 μm) (Fig. 4 A). Peptides corresponding to residues 330–347 and residues 348–364, however, had little or no effect on eNOS activity even at concentrations as high as 100 μm (Fig. 4, B and C). A small degree of inhibition by 100 μm of the 330–347 peptide suggested that residues C-terminal to position 329 may have a low affinity inhibitory interaction with eNOS. Therefore, we prepared an additional peptide corresponding to the B2 receptor residues 310–334 and determined its inhibitory potency on eNOS activity. This peptide was an even more potent inhibitor of eNOS (IC50 < 1 μm) than the 310–329 peptide. Thus, it appears that eNOS inhibition by the B2 receptor C-terminal intracellular domain occurs through a membrane-proximal subdomain encompassed by residues 310–334. Furthermore, a peptide comprised of this subdomain is an even more potent inhibitor of eNOS in vitro than the caveolin-1 membrane-proximal scaffolding domains 1 (residues 82–101) and 2 (residues 135–156) peptides shown previously to inhibit eNOS in independent reports from ours and two other laboratories (2Ju H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28187-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Inhibition of eNOS by caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptides occurs through a mechanism involving peptide interference with enzyme binding of Ca2+-CaM. Thus, we have shown previously that preincubation of eNOS with caveolin-1 peptides (10 μm) almost completely blocks subsequent binding of the enzyme to CaM-Sepharose (2Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar,11Venema V.J. Ju H. Zou R. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28187-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To determine whether the B2 receptor peptide inhibits eNOS by a similar mechanism, we preincubated eNOS with and without 10 and 100 μm of the B2 receptor 310–334 peptide. The enzyme was then subjected to affinity chromatography on CaM-Sepharose. eNOS was allowed to bind to the column in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2 and was eluted with 2 mm EGTA. The amount of enzyme eluted (and thus bound to CaM-Sepharose) in each condition was quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-eNOS antibody. No effect of the peptide on eNOS binding to CaM-Sepharose was detected even at a peptide concentration of 100 μm. We have also shown previously that inhibition of eNOS by the caveolin-1 82–101 peptide is reversible by Ca2+-CaM. When the concentration of Ca2+-CaM (1.25 μm) routinely used in the arginine-to-citrulline conversion assay is increased by 10-fold (to 12.5 μm), the inhibitory effects of the caveolin-1 peptide is completely reversed (2Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have performed identical experiments with the B2 receptor 310–334 peptide. No reversal of peptide inhibition by Ca2+-CaM was observed. Inhibition of eNOS by the B2 receptor thus appears to occur through a different mechanism than that of caveolin-1. Furthermore, the B2 receptor interacts with a different domain in eNOS than that bound by caveolin-1 because caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptides (residues 82–101 and 135–156, 100 μm) had no effect on eNOS binding to the GST-B2R-ID4 fusion protein in in vitrobinding assays. To determine whether association of eNOS with the B2 receptor is a ligand-regulated process, BAEC were treated or not treated with BK (1 μmfor 0.5 min) prior to lysis of the cells and immunoprecipitation of lysates with anti-eNOS antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-B2 receptor antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, BK treatment of endothelial cells resulted in a rapid dissociation of the eNOS-B2 receptor complex. Loss of receptor coimmunoprecipitation from treated cells by the anti-eNOS antibody was not due to differences in the amount of eNOS that was immunoprecipitated in each condition because, when membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-eNOS antibody, equal amounts of the protein were detected for both treated and untreated conditions (Fig. 5 B). BK-dependent eNOS-B2 receptor dissociation may occur through a Ca2+-dependent process. Support for this hypothesis is provided by the results of additional experiments in which BAEC were treated or not treated with the Ca2+ionophore A23187 (5 μm for 0.5 min) prior to lysis of the cells and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as above. Like BK, the Ca2+ ionophore also promoted a rapid dissociation of the eNOS-B2 receptor complex (Fig. 5 C), which could not be attributed to different amounts of eNOS being precepitated in the two conditions (Fig. 5 D). Thus, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ promotes dissociation of eNOS from the receptor. These experiments suggest that eNOS activation by BK in endothelial cells involves a ligand- and Ca2+-dependent dissociation of the enzyme from its inhibitory interactions with the B2 receptor. This mechanism of activation is analogous to that described previously involving dissociation of eNOS from caveolin-1 in response to either Ca2+ ionophore or the eNOS-activating muscarinic cholinergic agonist, carbachol (5Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Dissociation, however, is not due simply to displacement of the receptor by Ca2+-CaM because, as shown in the experiments described above, the B2 receptor inhibitory peptide does not compete with Ca2+-CaM for interaction with eNOS. It is conceivable that binding and inhibition of eNOS is a general property of G protein-coupled receptors and thus occurs with receptors for other eNOS-activating agonists such as those for angiotensin II, thrombin, histamine, adenine nucleotides, and endothelin-1 (6Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Because it is not likely that eNOS would bind to more than one receptor at a time, each receptor would sequester a small pool of the total cellular eNOS. Vascular endothelial cells, like vascular smooth muscle cells, possess functional angiotensin II receptors known as AT1 receptors (16Vaughan D.E. Lazos S.A. Tong K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 17Feener E.P. Northrup J.M. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) which are coupled to eNOS activation (18Pueyo M.E. Arnal J-F. Rami J. Michel J-B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C214-C220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether eNOS could bind in vitro to the AT1 receptor C-terminal intracellular domain 4. GST alone, GST-B2R-ID4, and a GST-fusion protein containing intracellular domain 4 (residues 306–359) of the rat AT1 receptor (GST-AT1-ID4) (10Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography. The proteins, prebound to agarose beads, were then used in in vitro binding assays with recombinant bovine eNOS. As shown in Fig. 6, the GST-AT1-ID4 fusion protein bound eNOS in these assays equally as well as did the GST-B2R-ID4 fusion protein. In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate several novel features of eNOS regulation in endothelial cells. First, eNOS interactions with membrane-docking proteins are not restricted to interactions with the integral membrane protein, caveolin-1 but also occur with the transmembrane bradykinin B2 receptor. Second, eNOS interactions with the receptor are direct and inhibitory and are mediated by a membrane-proximal subdomain of the B2 receptor intracellular domain 4. Third, eNOS association with the receptor is regulated in a ligand- and Ca2+-dependent manner, suggesting that agonist-activation of eNOS in endothelial cells may be mediated in part by agonist-stimulated dissociation of eNOS from its inhibitory interactions with the agonist receptor. Fourth, eNOS also interacts in vitro with the AT1 receptor, suggesting that binding of eNOS may occur with receptors for other eNOS-activating agonists. Many examples exist of cell surface receptors that activate downstream effector enzymes through mechanisms involving receptor-effector association. Ligand-induced growth factor receptor autophosphorylation, for example, promotes the interaction of these receptors with various Src homology 2-containing enzymes including PLCγ1 (19Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that activation of the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells as well as the B2 receptor in vascular endothelial cells also involves a transient association of PLCγ1 with the receptors in a ligand- and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (9Venema V.J.

Evidence for signaling by cell surface receptors through a mechanism of activation involving receptor-effector dissociation (rather than association) has, not to our knowledge, been previously described. Receptor-effector dissociation, however, may represent an intriguing new paradigm for post-receptor activation of downstream effector enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2063198400,"Many lines of evidence have suggested that angiotensin II (AngII) plays an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy through AngII type 1 receptor (AT1). To determine whether AngII is indispensable for the development of mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we examined the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and the expression of the c-fos gene as hypertrophic responses after stretching cultured cardiac myocytes of AT1a knockout (KO) mice. When cardiac myocytes were stretched by 20% for 10 min, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) were strongly activated in KO cardiomyocytes as well as wild type (WT) myocytes. Both basal and stimulated levels of ERKs were higher in cardiomyocytes of KO mice than in those of WT mice. Activation of another member of the MAPK family, p38MAPK, and expression of the c-fos gene were also induced by stretching cardiac myocytes of both types of mice. An AT1 antagonist attenuated stretch-induced activation of ERKs in WT cardiomyocytes but not in KO cardiomyocytes. Down-regulation of protein kinase C inhibited stretch-induced ERK activation in WT cardiomyocytes, whereas a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein) and selective inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (tyrphostin, AG1478, and B42) suppressed stretch-induced activation of ERKs in KO cardiac myocytes. Epidermal growth factor receptor was phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by stretching cardiac myocytes of KO mice. These results suggest that mechanical stretch could evoke hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes that lack the AT1 signaling pathway possibly through tyrosine kinase activation.

Among humoral factors, angiotensin II (AngII)1 has recently attracted great attention, because of its established importancein vivo as well as in vitro (6Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). AngII directly induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, independent of an increase in vascular resistance or cardiac afterload (6Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence has suggested that locally produced AngII, more than circulating AngII, is a pivotal stimulator of cardiac hypertrophy and that hemodynamic overload induces cardiac hypertrophy by activating the local renin-angiotensin system (6Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Baker et al. (11Baker K.M. Chernin M.I. Wixson S.K. Aceto J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H324-H332PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that an increase in left ventricular mass induced by constricting the abdominal aorta is completely prevented by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor without decreasing the arterial pressure. Moreover, it has been reported that mechanical stress stimulates secretion of AngII from cardiac myocytes and that the AngII induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through AngII type 1 (AT1) receptor (12Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). However, because AT1-specific antagonists only partially inhibit stretch-induced hypertrophic responses (13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), signaling pathways other than AngII might be involved in mechanical stress-induced hypertrophy. Indeed we have reported that another vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is also involved in stretch-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (14Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y.

More recently, it has been reported that passive load and AngII evoke differential responses in gene expressions and protein synthesis (15Kent R.L. McDermott P.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether AngII is really necessary for the development of cardiac hypertrophy induced by mechanical stress. Many reports have suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family plays an important role in the differentiation and proliferation of many cells (16Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One member of the MAPK family, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), has been reported to be required for phenylephrine-induced expression of specific genes such as atrial natriuretic factor, c-fos, and myosin light chain 2 gene (17Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Thorburn J. Carlson M. Mansour S.J. Chien K.R. Ahn N.G. Thorburn A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although activation of ERKs is not sufficient to fully promote cardiac hypertrophy (18Thorburn J. Carlson M. Mansour S.J. Chien K.R. Ahn N.G. Thorburn A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Kaddoura S. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We and others have reported that mechanical stress activates ERKs in cultured cardiac myocytes (13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K.

Moreover, we have recently reported that another member of the MAPK family, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which has been reported to be activated by various cellular stresses and to play an important role in gene expression and apoptosis in many cell types (24Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 25Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar), is also activated in cardiac myocytes by mechanical stress (26Komuro I. Kudoh S. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Yazaki Y. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and AngII (27Kudoh S. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Takekoshi N. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The third member of the MAPK family is p38MAPK, a mammalian homolog of yeast Hog1 that is activated by osmotic stress (28Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). p38MAPK has been reported to be activated by a variety stimuli similar to those for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (25Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 28Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar) and to be involved in secretion of cytokines and in development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis (29Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In the present study, we elucidated the role of AngII in mechanical stress-induced hypertrophic responses by examining the activation of the MAPK family and the expression of the c-fos gene using cardiac myocytes of AT1a knockout (KO) neonatal mice (30Sugaya T. Nishimatsu S. Tanimoto K. Takimoto E. Yamagishi T. Imamura K. Goto S. Imaizumi K. Hisada Y. Otsuka A. Uchida H. Sugiura M. Fukuta K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18719-18722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that although AT2 was expressed at almost the same levels in both wild type (WT) and KO cardiomyocytes. AT1a and AT1b were not detected in KO cardiac myocytes by 40-cycle amplification. The addition of AngII to cultured media activated ERKs in cardiac myocytes of WT mice but not those of KO mice, suggesting that signals through AT1 were markedly reduced in KO cardiac myocytes. When cardiac myocytes were stretched, however, ERKs and p38MAPK were markedly activated in cardiomyocytes of KO mice as well as those of WT mice. Unexpectedly, basal and stimulated levels of ERKs, but not of p38MAPK, were higher in KO cardiomyocytes than in WT cardiomyocytes. Mechanical stretch also induced expression of the c-fos gene in cardiac myocytes of both mice. Unlike WT cardiac myocytes, an AT1 antagonist had no effects on stretch-induced activation of ERKs in KO cardiac myocytes. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) strongly attenuated stretch-induced ERK activation in WT cells, whereas in KO cells, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but not PKC down-regulation, inhibited ERK activation by stretch. Moreover, EGF receptor was phosphorylated by stretching cardiac myocytes of KO mice. These results suggest that AngII is not indispensable for mechanical stretch-induced hypertrophic responses and that the tyrosine kinase pathway plays a critical role in cardiac myocytes where signals from AT1 are deleted. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and genistein were from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-phosphorylated p38MAPK-specific antibody was from New England Biolabs, Inc. Polyclonal antibody against EGF receptor was purchased from Santa Cruz. Tyrphostins, AG1478, AG1295, and B42, were purchased from Calbiochem. Endothelin-1 was from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). AngII, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), myelin basic protein (MBP), and other reagents were from Sigma. Cardiac myocytes were cultured from 1-day-old neonatal mice of AT1a KO and WT as described previously (4Komuro I. Kaida T. Shibazaki Y. Kurabayashi M. Katoh Y. Hoh E. Takaku F. Yazazki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3595-3598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stretching of cardiac myocytes by 20% was conducted as described previously (4Komuro I. Kaida T. Shibazaki Y. Kurabayashi M. Katoh Y. Hoh E. Takaku F. Yazazki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3595-3598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cardiac myocytes were plated at a field density of 1 × 105cells/cm2 on silicone rubber culture dishes. The culture medium was changed 24 h after seeding to a solution consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Mice were housed under climate-controlled conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were provided with standard food and waterad libitum as described previously (30Sugaya T. Nishimatsu S. Tanimoto K. Takimoto E. Yamagishi T. Imamura K. Goto S. Imaizumi K. Hisada Y. Otsuka A. Uchida H. Sugiura M. Fukuta K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18719-18722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). All protocols were approved by local institutional guidelines. Total RNA was prepared from cardiac myocytes using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST B, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prepared RNA was treated with DNase to eliminate any contamination of genomic DNA. Reverse transcribed AT1a, AT1b, and AT2 mRNA were amplified by PCR using AT1a-, AT1b-, and AT2-specific primers, respectively. Specific PCR primers for AT1a were designed from the murine cDNA sequences of the coding region (31Sasamura H. Hein L. Krieger J.E. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar): 5′-TCACCTGCATCATCATCTGG-3′ for sense and 5′-AGCTGGTAAGAATGATTAGG-3′ for antisense. A sense primer for AT1b was the same as that for AT1a. An antisense primer for AT1b was designed from the same region with different sequences (31Sasamura H. Hein L. Krieger J.E. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar): 5′-AGCTGGTGAGAATAATAACG-3′. The four underlined nucleotides are different between AT1a and AT1b. Each antisense primer specifically amplified AT1a and AT1b. Primers for AT2 were designed according to the coding region of the rat AT2 gene (32Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasamura H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kambayashi, Y., Bardhan, S., Takahashi, K., Tsuzuki, S., Inui, H., Hamakubo, T., and Inagami, T.

Denaturing (94 °C for 45 s), annealing (58 °C for 1 min), and extension (72 °C for 1 min) reactions were repeated 40 times. The activity of ERKs was measured using MBP-containing gels as described previously (21Yamazaki T. Tobe K. Hoh E. Maemura K. Kaida T. Komuro I. Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12069-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, ERKs were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ERKs, aY91, in the presence of 0.15% SDS, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP. Phosphorylation of MBP was assayed by incubating the gel with [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation, the gel was washed extensively, dried, and then subjected to autoradiography. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-phosphorylated p38MAPK-specific antibody, which detects only activated p38MAPK with phosphorylation at the tyrosine 182 residue. The anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as the second antibody, and activated p38MAPK was visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gels. Human c-fos cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Tom Curran) was labeled by a random priming method, and Northern blot analysis was performed as previously reported (4Komuro I. Kaida T. Shibazaki Y. Kurabayashi M. Katoh Y. Hoh E. Takaku F. Yazazki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3595-3598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-EGF receptor polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10), and phosphorylation of EGF receptor was visualized using ECL detection kit. Differences were compared by one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's t test. The accepted level of significance was p < 0.05. AT1a gene is completely replaced by lacZgene in KO mice, and there are no transcripts of AT1a gene in KO tissues (30Sugaya T. Nishimatsu S. Tanimoto K. Takimoto E. Yamagishi T. Imamura K. Goto S. Imaizumi K. Hisada Y. Otsuka A. Uchida H. Sugiura M. Fukuta K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18719-18722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Because AT1b and AT1a have been reported to be expressed in cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats (34Iwai, N., and Inagami, T. (1991) 177, 299–304Google Scholar), we first examined expressions of AT1a and AT1b in cultured cardiac myocytes of neonatal mice by RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for AT1a and AT1b (Fig. 1). Although AT1a gene was expressed in WT cardiac myocytes, AT1a was not amplified by 40-cycle PCR in cardiac myocytes of KO mice (Fig. 1). AT1b mRNA was not detected in cultured cardiac myocytes of both types of neonatal mice (Fig. 1). We amplified AT1b from mRNA of WT adult heart by the same PCR primers and condition (data not shown). AT2 was expressed in both WT and KO cardiac myocytes at almost the same levels (Fig. 1). To determine whether there is no signal through AT1 in cardiac myocytes of KO mice, we added 10−6mAngII to cultured cardiac myocytes and examined activation of ERKs, which has been reported to be induced by AngII through AT1 (13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ.

AngII activated ERKs in cardiac myocytes of WT mice as observed in cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats (Fig. 2 A) (13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K.

In cardiac myocytes of KO mice, some basal activities of ERKs were observed before stimulation (Fig. 2 A). Although 10−7m TPA (Fig. 2 A) and 10−7m endothelin-1 (Fig. 2 B) strongly activated ERKs in KO cardiomyocytes as well as in WT cardiomyocytes, 10−6m AngII did not enhance the ERK activity above the basal levels in KO cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that there is little functional AT1, if any, in cardiac myocytes of KO mice. Our and other laboratories have reported that mechanical stress activates ERKs in cultured cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats (13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H.

J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When cultured cardiac myocytes of WT mice were stretched by 20% for 10 min, ERKs were activated as in cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats (Fig. 3 A). In cardiac myocytes of KO mice, some basal activities of ERKs were detected before stretch and stretch by 20% for 10 min markedly activated both 42- and 44-kDa ERKs (Fig. 3 A). The time course of ERK activation by stretch in KO cardiomyocytes was the same as that in WT cardiac myocytes. The activity of ERKs was increased from 2 min, peaked at 10 min, and returned to basal levels at 30 min in cells of both mice (data not shown). Both basal and stimulated levels of ERKs were higher in KO cardiomyocytes than in WT cells (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that mechanical stress could activate ERKs in cardiac myocytes that lack signals from AT1 and that loss of AT1 signaling somehow increases basal and stimulated levels of ERKs in cardiac myocytes. We next examined the activity of another member of the MAPK family, p38MAPK, which has been reported to be activated through different pathways from ERKs (28Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 37Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). When cardiac myocytes were stretched by 20% for 10 min, p38MAPK was also activated in cardiac myocytes of both WT and KO mice (Fig. 3 B). Unlike ERKs, both basal and stimulated levels of p38MAPK in KO cardiac myocytes were almost the same as in WT cardiomyocytes. Induction of immediate-early response gene expression is one of genetic responses to mechanical stress in cardiac myocytes (2Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether stretch induces expression of c-fos gene in cardiac myocytes of WT and KO mice. Although 10−6m AngII did not induce c-fos gene expression in KO myocytes (data not shown), stretch by 20% for 30 min strongly induced expression of c-fos gene in KO cardiomyocytes as well as in WT cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4). Expression levels of the c-fos gene after stretch were higher in KO cardiomyocytes than in WT cells as in the case of ERKs. To confirm whether AngII is involved in mechanical stress-induced ERK activation in KO cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocytes were stretched in the presence of AngII receptor antagonists. When WT myocytes were stretched in the presence of an AT1 antagonist, CV11974 (10−6m), stretch-induced ERK activation was markedly attenuated (Fig. 5) as reported before in rat cells (13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14Yamazaki T.

Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The pretreatment with an ET type A receptor antagonist, BQ485 (10−6m), slightly reduced the activation in WT cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5). In KO cardiac myocytes, however, although BQ485 attenuated stretch-induced ERK activation at the same degree as in WT cardiac myocytes, CV 11974 had no effects on stretch-induced activation of ERKs (Fig. 5). An AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123319 (10−6m), had no effects in cardiac myocytes of both mice. These pharmacological results strongly suggest that in WT cardiac myocytes, vasoactive peptides such as AngII and ET-1 are involved in mechanical stress-induced activation of ERKs as in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (12Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K.

Invest. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and that in AT1 KO myocytes, AngII is not involved in stretch-induced ERK activation. We next examined the stretch-induced signal transduction pathways leading to activation of ERKs using cultured cardiac myocytes of both mice. In WT cardiomyocytes, down-regulation of PKC by incubation of cardiac myocytes with 10−7m TPA for 24 h strongly inhibited stretch-induced ERK activation (Fig. 6 A). A calcium chelator, EGTA (5 × 10−3m), or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (2 × 10−5m), had no significant effects on the activity of ERKs. In contrast, in KO cardiomyocytes, stretch-induced ERK activation was strongly inhibited by genistein but not affected by down-regulation of PKC or by chelation of calcium (Fig. 6 A). To get insights into what tyrosine kinases are involved in stretch-induced activation of ERKs in KO cardiomyocytes, we preincubated KO cardiac myocytes with another type of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tyrphostins (AG1478, AG1295, and B42) (38Levitzki A.

https://openalex.org/W2103673771,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is a rate-controlling enzyme in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and it therefore plays a central role in glucose homeostasis. The rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene is increased by glucagon (via cAMP) and glucocorticoids and is inhibited by insulin. Under certain circumstances glucose also decreases PEPCK gene expression, but the mechanism of this effect is poorly understood. The glucose-mediated stimulation of a number of glycolytic and lipogenic genes requires the expression of glucokinase (GK) and increased glucose metabolism. HL1C rat hepatoma cells are a stably transfected line of H4IIE rat hepatoma cells that express a PEPCK promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion gene that is regulated in the same manner as the endogenous PEPCK gene. These cells do not express GK and do not normally exhibit a response of either the endogenous PEPCK gene, or of the trans-gene, to glucose. A recombinant adenovirus that directs the expression of glucokinase (AdCMV-GK) was used to increase glucose metabolism in HL1C cells to test whether increased glucose flux is also required for the repression of PEPCK gene expression. In AdCMV-GK-treated cells glucose strongly inhibits hormone-activated transcription of the endogenous PEPCK gene and of the expressed fusion gene. The glucose effect on PEPCK gene promoter activity is blocked by 5 mM mannoheptulose, a specific inhibitor of GK activity. The glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose mimics the glucose response, but this effect does not require GK expression. 3-O-methylglucose is ineffective. Glucose exerts its effect on the PEPCK gene within 4 h, at physiologic concentrations, and with an EC50 of 6.5 mM, which approximates the Km of glucokinase. The effects of glucose and insulin on PEPCK gene expression are additive, but only at suboptimal concentrations of both agents. The results of these studies demonstrate that, by inhibiting PEPCK gene transcription, glucose participates in a feedback control loop that governs its production from gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1977986244,"The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) couples to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi-proteins to activate chemotaxis and exocytosis in neutrophils. PTX reduces not only formyl peptide-stimulated but also agonist-independent (basal) Gi-protein activity, suggesting that the FPR is constitutively active. We aimed at identifying an inverse FPR agonist, i.e. a compound that suppresses constitutive FPR activity. In Sf9 insect cell membranes, the G-protein heterotrimer Gialpha2beta1gamma2 reconstituted N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP)-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) binding and GTPgammaS-sensitive high affinity [3H]FMLP binding. The FPR antagonist cyclosporin H (CsH) potently and efficiently reduced basal GTPgammaS binding in Sf9 membranes. Another FPR antagonist, N-t-butoxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-leucyl-L- phenylalanine did not inhibit basal GTPgammaS binding but blocked the inhibitory effect of CsH on GTPgammaS binding. Na+ reduced basal GTPgammaS binding and eliminated the inhibitory effect of CsH. Similar effects of FMLP, CsH, and Na+ as in Sf9 membranes were observed with FPR expressed in the mammalian cell line HEK293. Our data show that the human FPR possesses high constitutive activity. CsH is an inverse FPR agonist and stabilizes the FPR in an inactive state. Na+ also stabilizes the FPR in an inactive state and, thereby, diminishes inverse agonist efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2095236407,"Glucose plays an important regulatory role in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, which is mostly reflected at the transcriptional level by glucose repression. The signal that initiates glucose repression is unknown, but data indicate that it is located at or above the level of glucose 6-phosphate, suggesting the involvement of either the intracellular or extracellular glucose concentration or the glucose flux in triggering glucose repression. We have investigated the role of the glucose flux and the extracellular glucose concentration in glucose repression by growing the cells in continuous culture under nitrogen limitation. By a step-wise increase in the glucose feed concentration, the glucose flux and extracellular glucose concentrations were modulated in an accurate way. Furthermore, the glucose flux and glucose concentrations were modulated independently of each other by increasing the dilution rate or by the use of fructose as a substrate. Using these approaches we demonstrate that glucose repression is related to the extracellular (or intracellular) glucose concentration rather than the glucose flux. At external glucose concentrations lower than 14 mm, glucose repression of <i>SUC2</i> gene transcription was not triggered, whereas glucose repression of this gene was activated when the glucose concentration exceeded 18 mm. A comparable effect was observed for the glucose-repressible carbon source fructose."
https://openalex.org/W2000504220,"Previous genetic studies have established Reaper and Grim as central regulators of apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Reaper and Grim induce extensive apoptosis in Drosophila, yet share no homology to known vertebrate proteins. In this study, we show for the first time that ectopic expression of Reaper or Grim induced substantial apoptosis in mammalian cells. Reaper- or Grim-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a broad range of caspase inhibitors and by human inhibitor of apoptosis proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2. Additionally, in vivo binding studies demonstrated that both Reaper and Grim physically interacted with human IAPs through a homologous 15-amino acid N-terminal segment. Deletion of this segment from either Reaper or Grim abolished binding to cIAPs.In vitro binding experiments indicated that Reaper and Grim bound specifically to the BIR domain-containing region of cIAPs as deletion of this region resulted in loss of binding. The physical interaction was further confirmed by immunolocalization. When co-expressed, Reaper or Grim co-localized with cIAP1. However, deletion of the N-terminal 15 amino acids of Reaper or Grim abolished co-localization with cIAP1, suggesting that this homologous region can serve as a protein-protein interacting domain in regulating cell death.

It is apparent that the underlying events in apoptosis are evolutionary conserved (1Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). First, there is similarity between the genetic, biochemical, and morphological events associated with apoptosis that are highly conserved between species (2Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

Second, several of the key signaling and effector molecules have highly conserved counterparts that are functionally interchangeable between heterologous species (4Vaux D.L. Weissman I.L. Kim S.K.

Three Drosophila melanogaster genes,reaper (rpr), grim, and hid, have been identified as key regulators of apoptosis during Drosophila embryogenesis (13White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H.

Deletion of a chromosomal segment encoding rpr, grim, and hid results in the loss of apoptotic cell death during fly development (16White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H.

Loss of rpr alone inhibits nearly all apoptosis during Drosophila embryogenesis and attenuates cell death in response to several external inducers. Overexpression of rpr as a transgene in Drosophila eyes or by transfection in a Drosophila cell line results in apoptosis (10Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

Apoptosis induced by Reaper, a surprisingly small protein of 65 amino acid residues, involves activation of caspases because death is inhibited by specific caspase inhibitors (13White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H. Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 18Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T.

A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Grim is predicted to encode a 138-amino acid polypeptide and, likerpr, expression of grim RNA coincides with the onset of apoptosis during embryonic development, and its overexpression induces extensive apoptosis in transgenic flies and cell lines (15Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Reaper and Grim appear to function independently of each other, as cell death induced by Grim does not require expression of reaper(15Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Both proteins do, however, share a highly homologous N-terminal motif. The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP)1 are a family of highly conserved anti-apoptotic proteins first identified in baculovirus by their ability to substitute functionally for the cell death inhibitor p35 (8Clem R.J.

Baculovirus IAPs, namely Op-IAP and Cp-IAP, also block apoptosis in insect SF-21 cells induced by rpr expression (19Vuici D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, Cp-IAP partially inhibits Reaper-induced cell killing in the Drosophila developing eye (10Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and Op-IAP can significantly inhibit HeLa cell killing induced by mammalian caspase-1 (22Hawkins C.J. Uren A.G. Hacker G. Medcalf R.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Cellular homologs of IAPs have also been described in humans (24Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goedded D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (10Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) that, like the baculovirus IAPs, block apoptosis in response to different stimuli. The first discovered human IAP, the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), was identified based on its role in the neurodegenerative disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (25Roy N. Mahadevan M.S. McLean M. Shutler G. Yaraghi Z. Farahani R. Baird S. Besner-Johnston A. Lefebvre C. Kang X. Salih M. Aubry H. Tamai K. Guan X. Ioannou P. Crawford T.O. de Jong P.J. Surh L. Ikeda J.-E.

Recently, four other human homologs, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, X-IAP, and survivin, have been identified, and all demonstrate anti-apoptotic activity (23Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L.

An important structural feature of all IAPs is an N-terminal motif termed the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR). Human c-IAPs were originally identified as proteins that were recruited to the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 (TNFR2) signaling complex through an association involving the BIR-containing region and the receptor-associated adapter molecule TRAF2 (24Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goedded D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that mammalian IAPs, X-IAP, and both cIAPs function to inhibit specific caspases, again an activity attributable to the BIR domain (29Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 30Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Inhibition of downstream caspases likely is not the sole mechanism of action of IAPs as in vivo binding studies demonstrate that both baculoviral and Drosophila IAPs can physically interact with Reaper (through the BIR domain), potentially inhibiting its ability to activate caspases (19Vuici D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although Reaper and Grim are key components of the death pathway in Drosophila, no mammalian homologs have been identified. However, we find thatDrosophila Reaper and Grim can induce apoptosis in human cells. Furthermore, this is attenuated by several caspase inhibitors and, importantly, by human cIAPs. Reaper and Grim were found to bind the BIR domain-containing region of human cIAPs through an N-terminal 15-amino acid domain. Through this interaction, cIAPs can regulate Reaper and Grim by altering their subcellular distribution and blocking their access to downstream caspases and thereby inhibiting apoptosis. These results are the first evidence that the cell death machinery engaged by Reaper and Grim is functionally conserved in mammalian cells. Human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were transiently transfected as described previously (31Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar, 32Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 105 MCF7 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMV β-galactosidase plus 1 μg of test plasmid in 6-well tissue culture dishes using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer instructions. Thirty h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) for 3–4 h. Cells were visualized by phase contrast microscopy. Approximately 300 β-galactosidase-positive cells were assessed for each transfection (n = 3) from three randomly selected fields, and the mean of these was used to calculate percentage apoptosis. Viable or apoptotic cells were distinguished based on morphological alterations typical of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis including becoming rounded, condensed, and detached from the dish (2Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12777) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts encoding C-terminal FLAG-tagged Reaper (Rpr-Flag) and Grim (Grim-Flag) were generated by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques using custom-designed primers and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Truncated versions of Rpr (ΔRpr2–15-Flag) and Grim (ΔGrim2–15-Flag) were generated by deletional polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. Reaper and Grim were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the pGEX-6P vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transient transfections of 293 cells were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation with the constructs encoding the indicated proteins as described previously (33Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 50–60% confluent 100-mm plate of 293 cells was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 6 μg of total DNA. Cells were harvested 30–36 h post-transfection and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Boehringer Mannheim)). Lysates were equally divided and immunoprecipitated with a control monoclonal antibody (mAb) or the specified epitope mAb for 4 h at 4 °C as described (32Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F.

Briefly, full-length Reaper and Grim were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the pGEX-6P vector. 35S-labeled cIAP1 full-length, cIAP1-BIR, and cIAP1-RING were prepared by in vitro transcription translation using the TNT T7- or SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following translation, equal amounts of total35S-labeled reticulocyte lysate were diluted into 1 ml of GST binding buffer (120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6)), incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the various GST fusion proteins, and immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. After repeated washing in GST buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized following autoradiography at −80 °C. Human 293 cells were transiently transfected as described previously (33Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Thirty six h post-transfection, cells were washed once in PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde-PBS for 10 min, and washed three times in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for 10 min, washed three times in PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer (10% goat serum in PBS) for 1 h. Flag-tagged Grim or Reaper constructs were detected using biotinylated M2 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Myc epitope-tagged constructs were detected with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The location and integrity of nuclei was assessed by staining with DAPI (Sigma). Cell staining was visualized by confocal microscopy. Key inducers and regulators of apoptosis, including caspases and mammalian Bcl-2 family homologues, are highly conserved between species, suggesting that the basic mechanism of apoptosis is similar. Given this, we asked if Drosophila Reaper or Grim could induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. Ectopic expression of Reaper or Grim in human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells induced rapid apoptosis (Fig. 1). Morphologically, both Reaper- and Grim-transfected cells displayed alterations characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, becoming rounded, shrunken, and detached from the culture dish (Fig. 1 A). We next determined whether known suppressors of apoptosis inhibited Reaper- or Grim-induced mammalian cell death. Consistent with studies in Drosophila(13White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H. Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 18Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Vuici D.

In addition, mammalian cIAP1 and cIAP2 abrogated both Reaper- and Grim-induced cell killing (Fig. 1, A and B), further suggesting that Reaper and Grim function upstream of caspases. To confirm this, the activation of one of the distal caspases, caspase-7, was examined. Activation of caspase family members occurs following the proteolytic processing of a single polypeptide-inactive zymogen to an active dimeric species consisting of large and small subunits. Given this, the activation of caspase-7 was monitored by the emergence of the active enzyme products in cells transfected with Grim or Reaper. As shown in Fig. 1 C, in vector transfected cells (first lane), caspase-7 is present in its zymogen form, whereas in cells overexpressing the p55 tumor necrosis factor death receptor (second lane), this caspase is converted to the active processed form as evidenced by the appearance of the large catalytic subunit. Because both Grim and Reaper overexpression also resulted in the conversion of caspase-7 to its active form (third and fourth lanes, respectively), cell death induced by these Drosophila death proteins must involve the activation of mammalian apoptotic caspases. However, we were unable to detect direct association between these death proteins and caspases, suggesting an indirect mechanism of caspase activation (data not shown). Furthermore, we analyzed the state of the endogenous apoptotic substrate, PARP. In nonapoptotic cells, PARP is observed in the uncleaved form (116 kDa), whereas in cells transfected with Grim or Reaper, which are undergoing apoptosis, PARP is characteristically cleaved to an indicator apoptotic fragment (85 kDa) (Fig. 1 C). This provides additional confirmation that Grim and Reaper induce apoptosis by activating mammalian caspases. To determine where exactly in the apoptotic pathway Grim or Reaper were functioning, we examined whether two recently described inhibitors of death receptor (CD-95 and TNFR1) mediated apoptosis-inhibited cell death induced by Reaper or Grim. The Molluscum contagiosumviral protein MC159 and the equine herpesvirus 2 protein E8 specifically inhibit recruitment of caspase-8 to the adapter molecule FADD, thereby disrupting assembly of the death receptor signaling complex and abrogating cell death (12Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9621-9624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meini E.

Overexpression of either MC159 or E8 significantly inhibited FADD-induced cell killing, but did not inhibit Reaper- or Grim-induced killing (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that Grim and Reaper must function downstream of caspase-8 recruitment to FADD. Therefore, Grim and Reaper do not appear to engage components of the death pathway involved in proximal death receptor signaling. It has previously been shown that the amino-terminal end of Reaper and Grim share significant homology (15Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Ten of the first 14 residues are identical in both proteins, whereas three of the remainder are conserved substitutions. Using this domain, data bases were searched for proteins showing significant homology. A surprising similarity emerged between this N-terminal segment and the BIR domains of IAPs (Fig. 2). Analysis of the individual BIR domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 revealed that the second BIR domain (amino acid 207–222 or 192–207, respectively) shared highest homology with the amino terminus of both Reaper and Grim (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that both baculovirus and Drosophila IAPs physically interact with and inhibit Reaper-induced killing in Drosophila cells (19Vuici D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because of the observed sequence similarity between the N-terminal domain of Grim and Reaper with the BIR domain of cIAPs, we determined if Grim and Reaper could interact with the cIAPs. Human 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs that directed the synthesis of Flag epitope-tagged Grim or Reaper and Myc epitope-tagged cIAP1. Immunoprecipitation of both Grim-Flag and Reaper-Flag quantitatively co-precipitated cIAP1-Myc (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies have indicated that the BIR domain-containing region of cIAP1 and cIAP2 acts as a protein-protein interaction motif, mediating binding to the TRAF family of receptor-associated adapter proteins (24Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goedded D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and, more recently, to specific caspases (29Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 30Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). To determine whether the BIR domain-containing region of cIAPs was indeed mediating binding, Reaper and Grim were expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria and tested for interaction with in vitro translated cIAP1, cIAP1-BIR (deleted C-terminal Ring finger domain) and cIAP1-Ring (deleted N-terminal BIR-containing domain). As anticipated, full-length cIAP1 bound to both GST-Reaper and GST-Grim (Fig. 3 B, left panel). cIAP1-BIR convincingly bound to both GST-Reaper and GST-Grim but cIAP1-Ring did not, suggesting that the interaction between Reaper and Grim and the human cIAPs was mediated by the BIR-containing domain. A characteristic of a number of components of the cell death pathway is the existence of discrete protein-protein interaction segments. These domains recruit and assemble components of the apoptotic pathway through homophilic interactions and allow for the transduction of apoptotic signals. To determine whether the homologous domain shared between theDrosophila death proteins and the cIAPs is one such interaction domain, truncated versions of Reaper (ΔRpr2–15-Flag) and Grim (ΔGrim2–15-Flag) were generated in which amino acids 2–15 were deleted from the N terminus of both proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the ability of Reaper and Grim to bind cIAP1 was abolished when N-terminal residues 2–15 were deleted (Fig. 4, A and B). To further investigate the significance of this interaction, we determined whether the truncated derivatives of Reaper and Grim, ΔRpr2–15-Flag and ΔGrim2–15-Flag, could still induce apoptosis, and if so, could the cIAPs inhibit apoptosis under these circumstances. Ectopic expression of ΔRpr2–15-Flag or ΔGrim2–15-Flag in human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells induced apoptosis at levels comparable with full-length Reaper and Grim (Figs. 4 C and 1 B). Surprisingly, apoptosis induced by ΔRpr2–15 and ΔGrim2–15 was still blocked by mammalian cIAP1 and cIAP2 (Fig. 4 C). Recent studies have shown that human IAPs function as inhibitors of downstream active caspases. This suggests that cIAPs may be blocking apoptosis induced by ΔRpr2–15and ΔGrim2–15 at such a downstream site. It has previously been shown that Reaper co-localizes with both baculoviral and DrosophilaIAPs in SF-21 insect cells (19Vuici D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To confirm the above interactions between Reaper and Grim and the human cIAPs, 293 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged versions of either full-length Reaper or Grim or ΔRpr2–15-Flag and ΔGrim2–15-Flag in the presence or absence of cIAP1-Myc. When expressed alone, Reaper and Grim localized predominantly to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5,A and B). However, in the presence of cIAP1-Myc, full-length Reaper and Grim displayed a punctate perinuclear localization (Fig. 5, D and J, respectively) that coincided with the subcellular localization of cIAP1-Myc (Fig. 5,E and K). This same perinuclear localization was observed for cIAP1-Myc when expressed alone (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, ΔRpr2–15-Flag or ΔGrim2–15-Flag, when co-expressed with cIAP1-Myc, maintained a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 5, G and M), consistent with the binding studies demonstrating that an intact N terminus is required for the binding of Reaper or Grim to cIAPs. The physical association of cIAPs with Grim and Reaper and the altered subcellular localization mediated by this 15-amino acid region suggests a mechanism by which cIAPs may inhibit apoptosis. By associating with and altering the subcellular localization of Reaper and Grim, the cIAPs may prevent their access to downstream pro-apoptotic effectors, such as caspases. To determine whether such a scenario is indeed true, we examined the ability of Reaper and Grim (full-length and truncated versions) to activate downstream caspase-7 in the presence and absence of cIAP1. As shown in Fig. 6 A, ectopic expression of Reaper or Grim in MCF7 cells can activate caspase-7, as evidenced by the appearance of the intermediate and large catalytic cleavage products. Similarly, both ΔRpr2–15and ΔGrim2–15 activated caspase-7. However, in keeping with the above hypothesis, when co-expressed with cIAP1, Reaper and Grim were no longer able to activate caspase-7 (Fig. 6 A), consistent with the notion that their association with cIAP1 prevented their access to the downstream caspase death machinery. In contrast, ΔRpr2–15 and ΔGrim2–15 activated caspase-7 at comparable levels in the presence of cIAP1 (Fig. 6 A). In this instance, the cells still remained viable (Fig. 4 C) as any active caspase-7 generated was presumably inhibited by cIAP1 functioning as a caspase inhibitor. These results support the hypothesis that the cIAPs initially inhibit Reaper and Grim by a sequestration mechanism involving their N-terminal 15 amino acids (Fig. 6 B). However, if Reaper or Grim bypass this sequestration mechanism (as might occur by proteolytic removal of the N-terminal 15 amino acids), cIAPs are still able to attenuate death by inhibiting downstream active caspases (Fig. 6 B). In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time thatDrosophila Reaper and Grim can interact with human cIAPs. Furthermore, we have mapped the interacting domains to the N-terminal 15 amino acids of Reaper and Grim and the BIR domain of cIAPs. Moreover, through this interaction cIAPs can sequester Reaper and Grim and abrogate their ability to activate caspases. This is the first demonstration of a regulatory function conferred by the homologous N-terminal 15-amino acid segment present in Reaper, Grim, and Hid. Prior to this study, the significance of the striking homology between these three death inducers was unknown. Taken together, these results and previously reported observations, it is likely that the cIAPs function at several levels in the apoptotic cascade, including direct inhibition of downstream caspases and sequestration of initiators of apoptosis such as Reaper and Grim.

Members of this family appear to function primarily as heterodimers and are implicated in a large range of activities that modulate chromosome structure and organization. Studies of yeast strains deficient in SMC1 and SMC2 show defects in the segregation of mitotic chromosomes (8Strunnikov A. Larionov V.L. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 9Saka Y. Sutani T. Yamashita Y. Saitoh S. Takeuchi M. Nakaseko Y. Yanagida M.

A role in chromosome condensation was demonstrated in a cell-free chromosome condensation assay based on Xenopus laevis oocyte extracts (11Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), in which SMC2 and SMC4 subtypes were identified as essential components of the condensin protein complex (12Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). More recently, the Smc1p and Smc3p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were shown to be essential for sister chromatid cohesion (13Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Cell. 1997; 91: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 14Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K.

Cell. 1998; 92: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Finally, evidence for a role of SMC proteins in DNA recombination and repair has been supported by both genetic and biochemical studies. TheSchizosaccharomyces pombe Rad18 gene and its S. cerevisiae homolog RHC18 are SMC-like and were found to act in an unusual postreplicative recombinational repair pathway (17Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J.F. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), whereas mammalian SMC1 and SMC3 proteins were described as essential subunits of a recombinational repair protein complex (RC-1), isolated from calf thymus (18Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SMC proteins display a very characteristic structure: two coiled-coil domains separate evolutionarily conserved head and tail domains, which contain an NTP binding motif (Walker A box) in the N terminus, and a DA box (Walker B) in the C terminus (20Walker J.E. Sarasate M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4237) Google Scholar). The similarity of SMC proteins to motor proteins such as kinesin and myosin has been noted, and both chromatin clamp and DNA motor functions have been proposed for SMC proteins (1Peterson C.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 389-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Gasser S.M. Curr. Biol.. 1995; 5: 357-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Saitoh N. Goldberg I. Earnshaw W.C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SMC proteins generally tend to form either SMC1/SMC3 or SMC2/SMC4 heterodimers (7Jessberger R. Frei C. Gasser S.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These heterodimers then form subcomponents of larger multiprotein complexes, which serve specific biological functions. Examples are the X. laevis 13 S condesin, in which XCAP-C and -E (SMC4 and 2, respectively) are complexed with three non-SMC proteins, required for chromosome condensation (12Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); the bovine recombination protein complex RC-1, in which SMC1 and SMC3 molecules are complexed with DNA ligase III and DNA polymerase ε (19Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); or the C. elegans dosage compensation complex consisting of the two SMC proteins DPY-26 and MIX-1, associated with other proteins (16Lieb J.D. Albrecht M.R. Chuang P.-T. Meyer B.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, it has become evident that SMC proteins in their various heterodimeric combinations and multiprotein complexes act in a range of reactions involving DNA and chromosome dynamics. To date, however, knowledge about the enzymatic activities and the molecular characteristics that allow the SMC proteins or their individual domains to fulfill these various functions has remained very limited. Central to these reactions is the interaction of SMC proteins with DNA. Therefore, we have analyzed DNA binding activities in vitroand in vivo of domains of the S. cerevisiae SMC1 and SMC2 proteins, which represent the two major classes of SMC heterodimers and complexes. N- and C-terminal domains of SMC1 and SMC2 were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. Domains were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pAS130 (SMC1) or pAS405 (SMC2) (8Strunnikov A. Larionov V.L. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Strunnikov A.V. Hogan E. Koshland D.

Polymerase chain reactions were performed with a Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and fused in frame into the pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): SMC1-N, pCF310; SMC2-N, pCF301; SMC1-C, pCF312; and SMC2-C, pCF314. All domains were sequenced to detect potential mutations. See “Results” for exact boundaries of the domains. For protein purification, the fusion proteins were induced in transformed bacteria for 16 h with 1 mm IPTG at 22 °C. The following steps were all performed at 4 °C. The cells were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation in a Sorvall SS.34 rotor at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was added to glutathione agarose (Sigma) and swollen in phosphate-buffered saline. Binding was performed for 2 h, the beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione, and 10% glycerol. The proteins were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. These assays were performed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 0.5–1 ng (3000–6000 cpm) of32P 5′-labeled DNA in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, and protein as indicated. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C in non denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA. All gels were fixed (60 min in 10% acetic acid, 10% ethanol), dried, and exposed for autoradiography. The following DNA substrates were used: a 230-bp EcoRI-KasI M13mp18 DNA fragment (positions 6001–6231), a 232-bp AvaII fragment from pUC19 (positions 1837–2059), the polymers poly(dA-dT), poly(dC-dG), poly(dA-dT)-poly(dT-dA), poly(dG-dC)-poly(dC-dG), poly(dA-dC)-poly(dG-dT) (average length, 8000 bp; synthesized enzymatically; purchased from two sources, Sigma and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the gel-purified, structure-tested cruciform DNA substrates CF01 (29 nucleotides/oligonucleotide; Ref. 21Kupfer C.

Cell. 1988; 54: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); and a 189-bp bent fragment from the Drosophila ftz scaffold-associated region (SAR) with an A/T content of 80% (24Amati B.

Azido-ATP labeling (25Knight K.L. McEntee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 867-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP (9–20 Ci/mmol; ICN), and 1 μg of proteins. Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 60 min and then irradiated for 50 s at a distance of 10 cm from a XL-1500 UV cross-linker (Spectronics Co.). After irradiation, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Complementary DNA strands used in the assay were obtained by heat denaturation of a 32P 3′-labeled dsDNA fragment, 422 bp in length, obtained byAvaI restriction of M13mp18 RFI DNA. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP, 0.13 μm (nucleotides) heat-denatured 422-bp [32P]DNA fragment and various amounts of protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min., reactions were stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 10% SDS and 100 mm EDTA and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide) and autoradiography. The analysis of mitotic stability of plasmids in SMC-overexpressing yeast strains was done basically as described in Ref. 26Hieter P. Mann C. Snyder M. Davis R.W. Cell. 1985; 40: 381-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar. The diploid yeast strain, RS453 (27Doye V. Wepf R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6062-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), was transformed with the ADE2-containing centromere plasmid, pASZ11 (28Stotz A. Linder P. Gene. 1990; 95: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the SMC-containing expression plasmids or pSD.04-HA as a control. The HA-tagged SMC fusion proteins were expressed under the control of the hybrid GALUAS/CYC promoter. Transformed cells were grown on selective plates (minimal medium, lacking adenine and uracil) containing glucose to repress SMC expression. To analyze the influence of overexpressed SMC on pASZ11 plasmid loss, transformed yeast cells were either allowed to grow directly in synthetic drop-out medium lacking uracil and supplemented with adenine (20 mg/liter), 2% (w/v) galactose, 3% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (v/v) lactate for 6–8 generations, or after depleting glucose by preincubating the cells for 12 h in synthetic drop-out medium lacking uracil and adenine and supplemented with 3% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (v/v) lactate. To measure the loss of pASZ11 during growth in the presence of overexpressed SMC, a colony color assay was performed, by plating the cultures on indicator plates (minimal medium with 10 mg/liter adenine and lacking uracil). The rate of plasmid loss per generation was calculated from the numbers of red or half-sectored colonies versus total colonies (red and white) from three independent experiments. Viability was quantified by colony outgrowth on rich medium. The overexpression of SMC proteins was checked by Western blot analysis in each experiment. To follow the cell cycle progression of yeast cells overexpressing SMC, we monitored the genomic DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The diploid yeast strain, RS453, was transformed with the SMC-containing expression plasmids or pSD.04-HA as control. Transformed yeast cells were grown for 12 h in synthetic drop-out medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose, 3% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (v/v) lactate. The cultures were diluted (1:100) into the same medium, lacking glucose, and grown for 24 h to deplete glucose from the medium and to allow maximal induction of the hybrid GALUAS/CYC promoter by galactose. Measurements were taken every 2 h after the addition of 2% (w/v) galactose, and cells were fixed by washing in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACscan analysis. Control cultures were treated identically, but growth was continued on glucose throughout. In order to analyze the biochemical properties of the individual SMC proteins, the N- and C-terminal globular domains of the S. cerevisiae SMC1 and SMC2 proteins were expressed in bacteria as GST-fusion proteins and were purified in their native forms. All purified proteins were >95% homogeneous (Fig. 1), except the SMC2-C preparation, which contained one minor contaminant of roughly 68 kDa. The SMC2-C domain appears to be somewhat less stable because a 29-kDa GST fragment is visible as a breakdown product (see comparison with purified GST, Fig. 1). Both types of the fusion polypeptides were designed to contain the entire N- and C-terminal globular domains, as follows: SMC1-N, amino acids 1–184; SMC2-N, amino acids 1–174; SMC1-C, amino acids 1070–1225; SMC2-C, amino acids 1026–1170 (see Fig. 1). The binding of the SMC terminal domains to a variety of DNA substrates was monitored by gel retardation assays. Increasing amounts (0–80 ng) of N- or C-terminal domain proteins of SMC1 and SMC2 were incubated with a 230-bp fragment of M13 RF DNA (Fig. 2 A). A specific signal was obtained with both C-terminal domains with as little as 10 ng of protein (0.23 pmol; 70-fold molar excess over the probe), but not with either N-terminal domain, even when 80 ng, or a 500-fold molar excess over the probe, was added. Mixing equal amounts of both domains to a total of 80 ng of protein did not affect the gel shift (data not shown). The GST domain alone does not bind DNA at 40 or 80 ng of protein. Thus we conclude that the C-terminal domain, which includes the DA-box and almost no coiled-coil region, is sufficient for DNA binding. Binding of the SMC2 C-terminal domain to the same 230-bp DNA fragment was then challenged by either ds or ss competitor DNA of the same or different origins (Fig. 2, B and C). Titrating increasing amounts of full-length ds competitor DNA (ΦX174 RF) into a reaction with 20 ng of protein reduced the gel shift signal to about one-sixth (densitometry indicates 6.2% of the probe is bound in the absence of competitor, whereas 1% is bound at 1.2 ng of competitor). Approximately the same reduction (from 8.6% DNA bound without competitor to 1.5% bound with competitor) was obtained when 160 ng of ssDNA (ΦX174) was added to the reaction. Complete elimination of the signal was not obtained at even higher amounts of ss competitor (not shown). The preference of the C-terminal SMC protein for dsDNA is therefore about 130-fold. Similar results were obtained for the SMC1 C-terminal domain and an overexpressed C-terminal domain of the bovine SMC1 protein (not shown). The use of either full-length ds or ss M13 DNA revealed similar results: the ds form competes at least 100-fold better than the ss form (data not shown). It was also observed, however, that when intact full-length plasmids were used as competitor, the ds M13 DNA was nearly 100-fold more efficient than either the ds ΦX174 or pBR322 DNA at competing for the interaction with the 230-bp M13 fragment (Fig. 2 C). As discussed below, this suggested to us a preference of the SMC domain for structure or sequence features in the M13 DNA. These features are examined in more detail below. Computer-aided analysis (GCG stem-loop program, Madison, Wisconsin; based on Ref. 29Tinoco I. Borer P.N. Dengler B. Levine M.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Crothers D.M. Gralla J. Nat.

The highest score stem-loop in this fragment (bp 6170–6206) contains 14 bp in the stem, 9 in the loop and a quality score of 30, the second highest of the entire M13 genome. The 13 S condensin protein complex from X. laevis, which contains SMC proteins of the SMC2 and 4 subfamilies, has been shown earlier to bind to synthetic cruciform DNA (30Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It was not clear, however, which of the five polypeptide subunits of that complex possessed the binding activity, or whether the complex needed to be intact to bind these substrates. Moreover, it was unknown whether individual SMC proteins or their DNA binding domains could do so. Using the purified SMC1 and SMC2 C-terminal domains, we found the C-terminal domains bind preferentially to cruciform DNA (substrate CF01), as compared with a linear dsDNA substrate bearing a part of the same DNA sequence (Fig. 3 A). In the gel retardation assay, four bands could be detected, two of which were also present as very faint bands in the negative control and in lanes containing the N-terminal domains. Several new retarded species were generated by interactions with the C-terminal domains of SMC1 and SMC2. The nature of the weak background bands is not clear, but they may reflect differently folded forms of cruciform DNA. In any case, the intensities of these bands are substantially enhanced in the presence of SMC proteins as well. Almost no binding was detected with the linear substrate, whereas binding to the cruciform was readily detectable in both the SMC1 and SMC2 C-terminal proteins. As before, the N-terminal domains and the GST protein control did not interact significantly with either DNA. The apparently lower binding capacity of the SMC1-C compared with SMC2-C in Fig. 3 A is not significant because in other experiments SMC1-C gave an even stronger signal than SMC2-C (Table I, Experiment 2). This variability is in part due to a tendency for the SMC domains to aggregate or misfold upon repeated freeze-thaw cycles (not shown). In no case, however, was the linear DNA substrate bound with an efficiency comparable to that of the cruciform substrate. Quantitation of the autoradiograph showed in average an 20-fold higher affinity for the cruciform over the linear substrate (Table I). Similar results were obtained using another cruciform and using a C-terminal domain cloned from the bovine SMC1 protein with the same cruciform DNA substrate (not shown).Table IRelative affinities of DNA binding by S. cerevisiae SMC protein terminal domainsDNA substrateProteinProtein amountBoundng%Experiment 1 Cruciform (CF01)No protein0<0.1 Cruciform (CF01)GST201.2 Cruciform (CF01)SMC1-N201.1 Cruciform (CF01)SMC2-N202.1 Cruciform (CF01)SMC1-C108.5 Cruciform (CF01)SMC1-C2019.4 Cruciform (CF01)SMC2-C1044.8 Cruciform (CF01)SMC2-C2054.2 LinearNo protein00.9 LinearSMC1-C101.6 LinearSMC1-C201.1 LinearSMC2-C102.2 LinearSMC2-C202.8Experiment 2 Cruciform (CF01)No protein0<0.1 Cruciform (CF01)GST301.1 Cruciform (CF01)SMC1-N301.9 Cruciform (CF01)SMC1-C1023.6 Cruciform (CF01)SMC1-C2043.1 Cruciform (CF01)SMC2-C1012.3 Cruciform (CF01)SMC2-C2014.6 Open table in a new tab SMC proteins have been proposed to bind to the AT-rich SARs, which are implicated in the compaction of loops during chromosome condensation (31Strick R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1995; 83: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These regions are naturally bent, are generally > 70% A+T, contain oligo(dA-dT) stretches, and often have the potential to form stem-loop structures (24Amati B. Pick L. Laroche T. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4007-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 33Homberger H.P. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the efficiency of a series of synthetic DNA polymers as competitors for the complex formed with the labeled 230-bp M13 fragment. The polymers included poly(dA)-poly(dT), poly(dG)-poly(dC), and the alternating polymers poly(dA-dT)-poly(dT-dA), poly(dG-dC)-poly(dC-dG), and poly(dA-dC)-poly(dT-dG) with an average length of 8000 bp. Increasing amounts of these competitor DNAs were added to the binding reaction with the 230-bp M13 dsDNA fragment as labeled binding substrate (Fig. 4 A). Both homopolymers, poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC), compete with low efficiency, as did the alternating poly(dG-dC)-poly(dC-dG) and poly(dA-dC)-poly(dT-dG) polymers. The alternating poly(dA-dT)-poly(dT-dA) polymer, however, was over 200-fold more effective than all other synthetic polymer competitors, and it matches the efficiency of competition by the homologous M13 sequence (see Fig. 4 B). Because the synthetic competitor DNA used reflects the structure of A/T (or G/C)-rich sequences in natural DNA regions to only a limited extent, we tested DNA fragments derived from Drosophila SAR and yeast centromere (CEN) regions as competitors. LikeDrosophila SAR DNA, the yeast centromeric DNA contains both a highly stable stem-loop structure and appropriately spaced oligo-dA stretches that confer both a narrow minor groove and bent character. Both fragments also bind the yeast nuclear scaffold (23Amati B. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In a gel retardation assay using the SMC1 C terminus and the labeled 230-bp M13 fragment, we have used as competitors a 189-bp ftz SAR DNA fragment (80% A/T; Ref. 24Amati B. Pick L. Laroche T. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4007-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a 600-bp centromeric DNA fragment derived from S. cerevisiae CEN3 (80%A/T; Ref. 23Amati B. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the 230-bp M13 control DNA (Fig. 4 B). No significant difference in competition by either the SAR or the CEN DNA substrates could be observed, and both compete only slightly less well than the M13 DNA fragment, which is, serendipitously, one of the best competitors identified. We conclude that the SAR and CEN fragments are strongly bound substrates for SMC proteins. Because these results again suggest a preference of SMC protein binding to DNA secondary structures, we also selected as a binding substrate a DNA fragment of the same length (232 bp) from the plasmid pUC19 (bp 1837–2059), which has no or a very low potential to form stem-loops. The overall G/C content of the M13 and the pUC19 fragments is very similar (51.7 and 49.8% respectively), yet this DNA fragment was very poorly bound by the SMC1-C protein (Fig. 4 C), confirming the earlier observation that SMC proteins have significantly higher affinity for DNA with a propensity to form secondary structures. From the above studies, we concluded that C-terminal domains of SMC proteins not only have the capacity to bind DNA but also have very distinct substrate preferences. We previously demonstrated the ability of the bovine SMC1/3 heterodimer to promote reannealing of complementary strands of DNA (19Jessberger R. Riwar B. Baechtold H. Akhmedov A.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4061-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This reaction relates to a possible pairing function of SMC proteins in DNA recombination. The S. pombecut3/cut14 heterodimer was also shown to promote such a reaction (34Sutani T. Yanagida M. Nature. 1997; 388: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reaction is inherent in the DNA binding capacity of the C-terminal domains of SMC proteins, we compared the efficiency of SMC-C, SMC-N, and Escherichia coli RecA proteins in this assay. Increasing amounts of either SMC1 or SMC2 N- or C-terminal domains were incubated with 32P-labeled 422-nucleotide complementary single-stranded DNA substrates, and the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). Although both terminal domains promoted the reannealing reaction to some extent, about 10-fold lower amounts of the C termini of both SMC proteins (between 0.2 and 0.8 pmol) were necessary to obtain a comparable signal as revealed by densitometric quantification of the reannealing products (Table II). No signal above background was obtained at these low amounts with the N-terminal domains (not shown). Thus, the C termini are the primary mediators in this reaction. The reaction with both N- and C-terminal domains does not depend on, nor is it affected by, the presence of ATP (not shown). The efficiency of this reaction was standardized to the reannealing catalyzed by the RecA protein. On a molar basis, the SMC C termini are about 2-fold more efficient than RecA protein at promoting this reaction (Table II).Table IIQuantitation of reannealing productProteinAmountProductRelative specific activityng/pmol%No protein0 /01.5RecA6 /0.166.41.0RecA12 /0.3212.71.0SMC1-N175 /3.9832.10.2SMC1-N350 /7.9533.40.1SMC1-C9 /0.2122.22.7SMC1-C18 /0.4225.91.6SMC1-C35 /0.8336.71.1SMC1-C70 /1.6744.30.7SMC2-N175 /3.9836.10.2SMC2-N350 /7.9529.80.1SMC2-C9 /0.2020.92.6SMC2-C18 /0.4022.71.4SMC2-C27 /0.6236.31.4SMC2-C36 /0.8226.60.8 Open table in a new tab Although the C-terminal domains possess specific DNA binding and reannealing activities, they also contain a DA box, which is thought to be involved in NTP binding and/or hydrolysis.

We investigated the protective effects of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells induced to undergo apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or by the specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C.

The εV1-2 peptide blocked the inhibitory effect of TPA on both TNF-α- and calphostin C-induced apoptosis. A scrambled version of εV1-2 and a peptide reported to inhibit PKCβ translocation (βC2-4) had no effect on the ability of TPA to inhibit apoptosis. These results suggest that PKCε is required for the protective effect of TPA in TNF-α- and calphostin C-induced apoptosis.

The phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC)1 family of isozymes has a central role in the transduction of extracellular signals and has been implicated in tumor promotion (1Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). PKCs also appear to be important in the regulation of apoptosis, and several reports have indicated that PKC activation can inhibit apoptosis. For example, the tumor-promoting phorbol ester and potent PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) prevents apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Fas, and microtubule-disrupting drugs in human lymphoma cells (2Obeid L.M.

TPA also inhibits apoptotic oligonucleosomal DNA degradation in isolated nuclei from thymocytes (7McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other PKC activators have also been reported to inhibit apoptosis. These include phorbol dibutyrate, which protects mouse spleen blast cells against interleukin-2 withdrawal (8Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Lopez Rivas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and mezerein and bryostatin-1, which block apoptosis induced by the sphingolipid ceramide (9Jarvis W.D. Fornari Jr., F.A.

Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1051-1057PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that there are some reports that demonstrate that PKC activation can induce or increase apoptosis in some cell types (12Kizaki H. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Mcbain J.A. Eastman A. Simmons D.L. Pettit G.R. Mueller G.C. Int. J.

The effects of PKC activation on apoptosis may therefore be cell type-specific and could be determined by factors such as the rate of PKC down-regulation. Evidence has recently emerged suggesting that specific PKC isozymes may be involved in the prevention of apoptosis. Mochly-Rosen and co-workers (15Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) have used peptides that specifically block the interaction of PKC subforms with membrane-associated binding proteins and have demonstrated that a peptide that inhibited membrane translocation of PKCε blocked the protection of cardiac myocytes from hypoxia-induced cell death. In another study, apoptosis in human leukemic cells induced by TNF-α, anti-Fas antibody, sphingomyelinase, and ceramide was associated with the redistribution of PKCδ and PKCε from the membrane to the cytosol. These redistributions were prevented by concentrations of TPA that blocked apoptosis (16Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further reports suggest that PKCε is anti-apoptotic in some cells. For example, in HT58 human lymphoblastic cells, TPA causes growth inhibition and down-regulation of PKC (50Mihalik R. Farkas G. Kopper L. Benczur M. Farago A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These cells could be induced to undergo apoptosis by the general kinase inhibitor staurosporine, but only when the cells had been pretreated with low concentrations of TPA that down-regulated PKCε, but not PKCα and PKCβ (17Basu A. Cline J.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In oncogene-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts, susceptibility to the anticancer drug cisplatin is increased, whereas PKCε expression is decreased compared with nontransformed cells. Stable transfection of these cells with PKCε prevents cisplatin-induced apoptosis and also protects these cells against cisplatin cytotoxicity (17Basu A. Cline J.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that PKCε may be of particular significance in the negative regulation of apoptosis, and this possibility has been explored further in this study. We have used U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells, in which apoptosis induced by ceramide, TNF-α, and the PKC inhibitor calphostin C is strongly inhibited by TPA. In this study, we used peptides based on unique sequences within PKC isozymes that specifically block the binding of individual isozymes to anchoring proteins, termed RACK proteins (receptors foractivated C-kinase). Recent work has demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 14–21 in the V1 region of PKCε prevents phorbol ester-induced translocation of PKCε and inhibits contraction in cultured cardiac myocytes (18Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In a further study, the εV1-2 peptide inhibited hypoxic preconditioning and phorbol ester-mediated protection of cardiac myocytes from hypoxia-induced cell death. In this study, we found that this peptide inhibited the ability of TPA to prevent apoptosis induced by TNF-α and calphostin C (calC). calC also reduced putative PKCε activity and displaced PKCε from the membrane to the cytosol.

Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. To determine specificity, primary antibodies were preincubated for 2 h with 10-fold excess peptide against which the antibody was raised. After incubation with primary antibodies, the membranes were washed, incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min, and washed again. The bound secondary antibody was detected with ECL reagent. Chemiluminescence was photographed with HYPERfilm-ECL. PKC activity in the particulate fraction was measured using the method of Durkin et al. (21Durkin J.P. Tremblay R. Buchan A. Blosser J. Chakravarthy B. Mealing G. Morley P. Song D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with modifications. This method does not require a preliminary extraction with subsequent reconstitution and artificial activation of the enzyme with Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine. PKC activity in the particulate fraction was measured using a PKC peptide substrate based on the epidermal growth factor receptor or a highly selective peptide substrate based on neurogranin-(28–43) that allows measurement of PKC in crude extracts, and a PKC inhibitor peptide based on the pseudosubstrate-(19–31) region of PKC. The assay reaction mixture contained 4–7 μg of protein from the particulate fraction in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mCaCl2, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 50 μm peptide substrate in a final volume of 90 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 500 μm[γ-32P]ATP (220 cpm/pmol in Tris buffer, 0.5 μCi/assay) and stopped after 10 min by the addition of 10 μl of 75 mm orthophosphoric acid. The samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and a 90-μl sample of each supernatant was applied to Whatman P-81 paper (2 cm2). The papers were washed twice in 75 mmorthophosphoric acid with gentle agitation for 10 min. The radioactivity bound to the washed papers was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Qualitative assessment of DNA degradation was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis (22Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Pelleted cells (5 × 106) were fixed by suspension in 70% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Cells were then centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and the ethanol was thoroughly removed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of phosphate/citrate buffer (192 parts 0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 8 parts 0.1 m citric acid (pH 7.8)) at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to new tubes, dried by vacuum in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY), and reconstituted with 15 μl of sterile distilled water. The DNA extract was then incubated with the addition of 3 μl of 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and 3 μl of RNase (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The extract was incubated for a further 30 min with proteinase K (3 μl, 1 mg/ml). After this digestion, 5 μl of loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 30% glycerol) was added, and the extract was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose at 5 V/cm for 3 h. DNA was visualized under UV light after staining with 0.5 g/ml ethidium bromide. U937 cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated with test compounds in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5% fetal calf serum. Chromatin was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after a 30-min incubation with the cell-permeable fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml). The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis at a given time was determined by counting cells exhibiting two or more membrane blebs and brightly stained condensed and fragmented chromatin. At least 200 cells were counted for each sample. The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was also determined using flow cytometry (23van de Loosdrecht A.A. Ossenkoppele G.J. Beelen R.H.J. Broekhoven M.G. Drager A.M. Langenhuijsen M.M. Exp. Hematol. (N. Y.). 1993; 21: 1628-1639PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry results are the percentage of cells (10,000) containing subdiploid DNA. In initial experiments, U937 cells were transiently permeabilized using the TransPortTM kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. In subsequent experiments, cells were permeabilized by electroporation. U937 cells were suspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and 800-μl aliquots were electroporated with or without the indicated peptides at 330 microfarads and 200 V at room temperature. The electroporated cells were kept at room temperature for 10 min and then transferred to RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5% fetal calf serum to a final concentration of 5 × 105cells/ml for treatment. In the presence of light, calC is a highly specific PKC inhibitor that interacts with the regulatory domain of the enzyme and inhibits phorbol ester binding at high concentrations (24Tamaoki T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). calC was chosen for this study because, unlike TNF-α or ceramide, calC induced apoptosis in a large proportion of cells (Fig. 1), thus making biochemical studies more interpretable. Apoptosis induced by low concentrations of calC was acutely blocked by TPA (Figs. 1 and 2). The protective effect of TPA was less after prolonged incubations (Fig. 1), possibly because of down-regulation of PKC. calC induced apoptosis in U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner and generated characteristic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3), membrane blebbing (data not shown), and chromatin condensation (Fig. 2). Using time-lapse microcinematography, it was observed that calC-treated U937 cells underwent fragmentation into clusters of apoptotic bodies in a similar way to cells treated with TNF-α (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of TPA on calC-induced chromatin condensation in U937 cells. U937 cells were treated with either 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO) or 125 nm calC with or without 100 nm TPA for 6 h.

U937 cells (5 × 106) were treated with 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO), with 125 nm calC with or without 100 nm TPA for 7 h, or with 1000 units/ml TNF-α with or without 100 nm TPA for 3 h. Analysis of DNA fragmentation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The main intracellular receptors for TPA are the PKC family of isozymes. Because U937 cells have been reported to contain different profiles of PKC isozymes, we screened our U937 cells using immunoblotting. U937 cells have been reported to express PKCα, PKCβI, PKCδ, and PKCζ, (25Pongracz J. Deacon E.M. Johnson G.D. Burnett D. Lord J.M. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); PKCα, PKCβ, PKCε, and PKCζ (26Ways D.K. Messer B.R. Garris T.O. Qin W. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5604-5609PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ways D.K. Qin W. Garris T.O. Chen J. Hao E. Cooper D.R. Usala S.J. Parker P.J. Cook P.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar); or PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCε, and PKCζ (28Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar). The U937 cells used in this study expressed PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCε, and PKCζ and very low levels of PKCδ, but did not contain detectable levels of PKCα or PKCθ (Fig. 4). PKCβI and PKCβII were predominantly located in the cytosol, whereas PKCε and PKCζ were distributed between the cytosolic and particulate fractions (Fig. 4). To determine whether PKCε translocation is required for the protective effect of TPA, we used a peptide derived from the V1 region of PKCε (εV1-2) that specifically inhibits the TPA-induced membrane translocation of this isoform of PKC. The εV1-2 peptide blocks the interaction between PKCε and anchoring proteins that have been termed RACK proteins. Transient permeabilization with this peptide has been demonstrated to block TPA-induced contraction and protection against hypoxia-induced cell death in cardiac myocytes (15Gray M.O. Karliner J.S.

Furthermore, expression of the V1 fragment of PKCε from which εV1-2 was derived blocked TPA enhancement of neurite outgrowth in PC-12 rat neuroblastoma cells (29Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15028-15035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar peptides have been identified with specificity for PKCδ (29Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15028-15035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and PKCβ (βC2-4) (30Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Clearly, such peptides provide a powerful tool to evaluate the biological roles of individual PKC subforms. Figs. 5 and 6 show the effects of the εV1-2 peptide on the TPA inhibition of calC-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantified both by Hoechst chromatin staining and by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The εV1-2 peptide attenuated the protective effect of TPA against calC- or TNF-α-induced apoptosis, and the effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 5). However, the peptide had no effect on the levels of apoptosis induced by calC or TNF-α and did not induce apoptosis in untreated cells (data not shown). No significant effect was observed with a scrambled peptide containing the same amino acids as εV1-2 or with a peptide that blocks PKCβI and PKCβII binding to RACK proteins (βC2-4 (Figs. 5 and 6). These data strongly support a role for PKCε in mediating the protective effect of TPA against calC- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis. It should be noted that a low concentration of TPA (10 nm) was used in these experiments, a concentration that gave only partial protection against apoptosis (Fig. 5). The εV1-2 peptide was less effective at a higher concentration of TPA (100 nm) (data not shown), as reported previously in cardiac myocytes (18Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).Figure 6Effect of εV1-2 on prevention of calC-induced chromatin condensation by TPA. U937 cells were electroporated with the indicated peptides (10 nm) as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were then treated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 125 nm calC with or without 10 nm TPA for 3 h. Chromatin in intact cells was stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 30 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A prediction from these data is that the εV1-2 peptide should specifically inhibit the TPA-induced translocation of PKCε in U937 cells. Such inhibition has been reported in cardiac myocytes (15Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 18Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, in a number of experiments including a time course (0–60 min) and several concentrations of Triton X-100, the εV1-2 peptide did not significantly inhibit 10 nm TPA-induced translocation of PKCε by Western blotting (data not shown). A similar lack of effect of the εV1-2 peptide was found in preliminary experiments with immunofluorescence localization (data not shown). We suggest two reasons for the inability to demonstrate an inhibitory effect on PKCε translocation. First, U937 cells have a high basal level of particulate PKCε (Figs. 4 and 7) (26Ways D.K. Messer B.R. Garris T.O. Qin W. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5604-5609PubMed Google Scholar), which generates a high background level of immunoreactivity. Second, the peptide blocks only the binding of PKCε to RACK proteins. Interaction of PKCε with other binding proteins will not be inhibited. For example, PKCα, PKCε, and PKCζ have been reported to bind to caveolin (31Oka N. Yamamoto M. Schwencke C. Kawabe J. Ebina T. Ohno S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). PKC also binds to AKAP79 (32Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and to PICK1 (33Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Consequently, any effects of εV1-2 on PKCε translocation will depend on the relative proportions of RACK and other binding proteins in a particular cell type. We are currently investigating possible effects of the peptide on PKCε intracellular localization in the presence of TPA using confocal microscopy. The above results suggest that the binding of PKCε to RACK proteins mediates the protective effect of TPA against both calC- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. These results further suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of TPA requires the phosphorylation of target proteins by PKCε, as PKC only binds to RACK proteins in the presence of activating cofactors (34Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest that PKCε plays a role in the survival of cells that have not been stimulated with agents that directly activate PKC. Expression of PKCε, but not of PKCδ, extended the survival of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cells in the absence of the cytokine (35Gubina E. Rinaudo M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and stable expression of PKCε protected transformed rat embryo fibroblasts from cisplatin-induced apoptosis (17Basu A. Cline J.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, we found that the εV1-2 peptide had no effect on the levels of apoptosis induced by calC and TNF-α or in untreated cells, suggesting that association of PKCε with RACK proteins is not involved in U937 cell survival. PKCε does, however, appear to be inhibited in TNF-α-, Fas- and ceramide-induced apoptosis, where PKCε is displaced from the particulate fraction to the cytosol (16Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We therefore determined if calC also displaced PKCε from the membrane and whether membrane-associated PKCε was active in U937 cells. PKCε immunoreactivity was divided between the particulate and cytosolic fractions of proliferating U937 cells, as has been reported by others (26Ways D.K. Messer B.R. Garris T.O. Qin W. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5604-5609PubMed Google Scholar). Particulate PKCε immunoreactivity was reduced at 10 min by calC and TNF-α (Fig. 7) and ceramide (data not shown) and was associated with increased immunoreactivity in the cytosol (Fig. 7). In calC-treated cells, the reduction in particulate-associated PKCε was sustained for at least 6 h (data not shown). This effect was reversed by TPA (Fig. 7). calC induced apoptosis and displaced particulate PKCε only when U937 cells were exposed to the inhibitor in the presence of light (Fig. 8). This suggests that the effects of calC may be due to direct inhibition of PKC, as calC must be illuminated to inhibit the enzyme (36Bruns R.F. Miller F.D. Merriman R.L. Howbert J.J. Hea"

The integration of retroviral DNA into the host cell chromosome is an obligatory step in the retroviral replication cycle and is catalyzed by a virus-encoded protein, integrase (IN)1 (1Andrake M. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M.

With respect to viral DNA, integration is site-specific and occurs at the ends of the linear DNA. In contrast, many sites in host DNA can be targets for integration. IN is sufficient to perform the integration reactionin vitro, and two well defined steps have been described. In the first step, the “processing” reaction, linear viral DNA is nicked 3′ of a conserved dinucleotide (5′-CA-3′) that is usually located two nucleotides from the 3′-ends of the viral DNA strands (4Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5319-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F.

Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The two target DNA phosphates selected for joining are staggered by 4–6 base pairs on the two DNA strands. IN functions as a multimer that may facilitate the positioning of the two viral DNA ends at the integration site. Subsequent repair and sealing of the 5′-ends of the viral DNA strands gives rise to the characteristic 4–6-base pair duplication of host sequences flanking the integration site. This joining of 5′-ends of the viral strands is thought to be carried out by host mechanisms. In vitro, IN can utilize synthetic duplex viral DNA substrates whose sequence corresponds to a single viral DNA terminus, as well as longer substrates that contain two viral-like DNA ends. To study the latter concerted reaction, we have also constructed substrates comprised of two viral DNA ends held together by a single-stranded DNA tether (10Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although purified IN can join 3′-ends of viral DNA strands to naked target DNA in vitro, the in vivo reaction is likely influenced by components of host chromatin or DNA structure. In a recent study (11Withers-Ward E.S. Kitamura Y. Barnes J.P. Coffin J.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1473-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it was found that many regions of avian host DNA are accessible for ASLV integration in vivo. Within these regions, preferred integration sites were observed, and it was suggested that such preferences may be influenced by local structural variations (11Withers-Ward E.S. Kitamura Y. Barnes J.P. Coffin J.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1473-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that specific components of the transcriptional apparatus may play a role in recruiting HIV-1 (12Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), or yeast Ty3 retrotransposon (13Kirchner J. Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B.

These in vitroresults indicate that specific features of DNA structure, either native or protein-induced, are capable of providing favorable targets for integration. Here we describe a strong local preference for IN-mediated joining of model viral DNA ends to plasmid target DNA in vitro. The preferred sites are situated in the stems of a DNA cruciform, immediately adjacent to the loops. The polarity of joining site selection, with respect to this structure, suggests that a crucial feature of the preferred sites may be a resemblance to DNA ends. The potential for DNA unpairing at viral DNA ends is apparently critical for IN processing activity on viral DNA substrates (21Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and we suggest that partial melting of target DNA may promote IN activity in a similar manner. The construction of the pBR711-2 target plasmid has been described previously (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A synthetic DNA duplex containing two tandem lexA operators was inserted between the BamHI (position 375) and SalI (position 651) sites of pBR322 (see Fig. 2). pBR880-1 was constructed in the same manner except that the potential stem sequences were flipped (see Figs. 4 B and 5 C). Plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit. The ASV DNA substrate was a synthetic 16 mer/18 mer duplex corresponding to the “processed” U3 end of viral DNA, as described previously (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 oligonucleotide duplex substrate (19 mer/21 mer) corresponded to a “processed” viral U5 end: top strand, 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-3′; bottom strand: 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC-3′. Two “fixed” oligonucleotide primers complementary to pBR322 sequences and these were used for PCR-based detection of integration events on both DNA strands. Bottom strand primer: 5′-CACCTGTCCTACGAGTTG-3′, positions 751–768 of pBR322 and top strand primer: 5′-TCTCGGAGCACTGTCCGACCG-3′, positions 271–291 of pBR322. The top strand primer detects integration events on the bottom strand, while the bottom strand primer detects integration events on the top strand. The ASV viral specific primer for PCR-based detection of integration events was as described previously (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M.

Similarly, the HIV-1 viral-specific PCR primer corresponds to the U5 top strand described above.Figure 4Detection of unpaired adenines in supercoiled plasmid by DEPC modification.

Supercoiled pBR711-2 DNA and control DNA (pBRN1, a pBR322 derivative) were incubated at 37 °C in a volume of 200 μl with 80 units of S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) for the indicated times using the suggested buffer. The reactions were stopped with EDTA, and the products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Unpaired adenines were detected as described previously (23Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 158-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Furlong J.C. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3995-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) modification. In our protocol,PstI-cleaved or supercoiled pBR711-2 plasmid DNAs were treated with DEPC, cleaved with SalI, and repair-labeled at the SalI site with 32P. A uniquely end-labeledPstI-SalI fragment was isolated from both substrates and subjected to cleavage with piperidine. The products were fractionated on a 20% acrylamide DNA sequencing gel. ASV IN was purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ASV IN (1 μl, 35 pmol) and 300 ng (∼0.1 pmol) of PstI linearized or supercoiled plasmid target DNA were first incubated on ice for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a reaction volume of 16 μl. (The ASV IN storage buffer contained 0.5 m NaCl, 40% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 1% thiodiglycol, and 0.1 mm EDTA). One picomole of viral DNA substrate corresponding to a processed U3 ASV terminus (U3 16 mer/18 mer) was added, followed by MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. The reactions (20 μl) were then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and were stopped by transfer to a proteinase K solution. After proteinase K digestion (minimum 2 h), the DNAs were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and 10% of the sample was used for PCR-based detection of single-end integration events (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Chow S.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The fixed PCR primers complementary to pBR322 sequences were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The PCR primer complementary to the viral DNA was unlabeled. PCR conditions were: 1 min, 94 °C; 1 min, 37 °C; 2 min, 72 °C; for 30 cycles. PCR products were fractionated on a 7% DNA sequencing gel in parallel with a 10-base pair ladder (Gibco BRL) that was also end-labeled. The reaction conditions described here for in vitro integration were similar to those used for sequence-specific targeting experiments using a LexA repressor-ASV IN fusion protein (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The major modification was to use short time points such that less than one integration event per plasmid target was detected (see “Results”). We have not yet investigated other parameters, such as the requirement for the IN-target DNA preincubation step. For HIV-1 integration assays, a bacterially produced derivative of IN was used. This derivative displays wild-type processing and joining activities, but can be stored and assayed at much higher concentrations than the wild-type protein. 2E. Asante-Appiah and A. M. Skalka, unpublished results.The improved solubility properties do not appear to be relevant to the experiments described here. The buffer conditions and order of addition were similar to those described for ASV integration reactions. Reactions contained 55 pmol of HIV-1 IN, 10 mmMnCl2 and target DNA, and were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Integration events were assayed by PCR as described above. We have previously described in vitrotargeting of an ASV IN-LexA repressor fusion protein to tandemlexA operator sites on a linear plasmid DNA (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The results suggested that the IN-repressor fusion protein can bind to the cognate operator sequences and promote enhanced integration into adjacent regions. Similar results have been described by others (27Bushman F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9233-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,28Goulaouic H. Chow S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we observed that if the plasmid target substrate was supercoiled, the enhanced integration into adjacent regions was abrogated and strongly preferred integration was observed near the junction of the tandem lexA operators. This new preference was seen with wild-type ASV IN, as described below. As in previous experiments, we used a PCR-based assay to detect integration events (22Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1996; 217: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Chow S.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Bushman F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9233-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reaction components include a short viral DNA substrate that represents a single processed ASV DNA end (U3 16 mer/18 mer), purified ASV IN, and a plasmid DNA target containing two tandem copies of the lexA operator (pBR711–2). Joining events near the lexA operators were detected using a PCR primer complementary to fixed positions in the plasmid target DNA and another primer complementary to the viral DNA. The size of the PCR products indicate the distance between the fixed primer and the joining site (including the length of the viral-specific primer). As seen in Fig. 1, many joining events can be detected on both strands of the linear pBR711-2 plasmid substrate in the region scanned in this assay (lanes 3 and 5). However, if the pBR711-2 plasmid target DNA was supercoiled, a strong local enhancement of joining is observed (lanes 4 and 6). As shown, the enhanced sites on both strands mapped to the tandem lexA operators (denotedOP). In some experiments, the enhancement appeared to occur at the expense of other sites; this is seen most clearly in Fig. 1 B (compare lanes 3 and 4; also see Fig. 5 A). Quantitation by phosphoimaging indicates an ∼20-fold increase in signal within this region with the supercoiledversus linear target plasmid (data not shown). The percentage of supercoiled target DNA available decreases as the reaction proceeds because a single joining event anywhere on the target plasmid should relax the DNA. Therefore, in the experiments described above, we used suboptimal conditions for the joining reaction so that the initial events could be measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). The starting plasmid preparation was estimated to be 80% supercoil and, under these conditions, it was converted to approximately 30% supercoil after 60 min (data not shown). Therefore, under the conditions used, the supercoiled DNA represents a significant percentage of the target DNA population. Thus, these assays detect “on average” less than one integration event per target plasmid molecule. A high resolution sequencing gel (see Fig. 5 B) was used to map precisely the enhanced joining sites, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2. The enhanced region can be resolved into approximately seven contiguous joining sites on each strand. This region corresponds to an extensive inverted repeat (IR) sequence comprising the two tandem copies of thelexA operator with an intervening spacer, shown in boldface (Fig. 2). The enhanced joining sites on the two strands are offset symmetrically in the 5′-direction from the axis of symmetry of the IR. However, this assay cannot reveal whether the joining events on both strands are coordinated. The enhanced target sequence (5′-TATACAGT-3′) is present twice in this region on each strand due to the tandem operators, but only the sequence 5′ to the axis of symmetry is preferred in the supercoiled plasmid substrate. These observations, along with the requirement for supercoiling, suggested a structural rather than sequence basis for the preferred joining sites. It has been observed previously that certain IR sequences are capable of forming cruciform structures under conditions of DNA supercoiling (23Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 158-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Pearson C.E. Zorbas H. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The IR corresponding to the tandem lexA operators in the pBR711-2 is predicted to contain perfectly base paired 18-base pair stems and 5 nucleotide loops. We asked whether the IR in pBR711-2 could form such a structure. S1 nuclease produces double-stranded breaks at cruciform loops, and these break points can be mapped using secondary cleavage with a restriction endonuclease (24Panayotatos N. Wells R.D. Nature. 1981; 289: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, S1 nuclease treatment of the pBR711-2 plasmid resulted in a significant increase in the rate of linearization, as compared with another pBR322 derivative that lacked the extensive IR sequence (pBRN1). Linear pBR711-2 DNA produced by S1 nuclease was isolated and subjected to cleavage by PstI (Fig. 3 B). Two discrete fragments, of approximately 3 and 1 kilobase pair, were observed. The sizes of these fragments indicated that treatment with S1 nuclease resulted in preferential linearization by cleavage within or near the lexA operator IR region (Fig. 3 B). The pBR322 backbone of pBR711-2 is known to contain at least one other IR sequence that has the potential to form a cruciform structure (24Panayotatos N. Wells R.D. Nature. 1981; 289: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, under the conditions used here, the introducedlexA operator IR was the major S1-sensitive site detected. If the pBR711-2 was first linearized with PstI and then treated with S1 nuclease, no significant cleavage within the IR region was observed (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that a major S1-sensitive site is present within or near the IR repeat under conditions of supercoiling. This is consistent with the presence of a cruciform structure. Chemical modification studies were carried out to confirm and fine-map the potential cruciform structure (23Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 158-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Furlong J.C. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3995-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Supercoiled and linear forms of pBR711-2 were treated with DEPC, a reagent that preferentially modifies unpaired adenosine residues. As shown in Fig. 4 A, a major modification site in the supercoiled DNA corresponds to the single adenosine residue predicted to fall within the cruciform loop on the top strand (see Fig. 4 B). This adenosine is nonreactive in the linear form of pBR711-2 (Fig. 4 A). Preferential modifications of the three adenosine residues predicted for the bottom strand loop were also detected (see Fig. 4 B; data not shown). It can be noted in Fig. 2 that the stems of the cruciform themselves contain IR elements that also have the potential to form hairpins. However, results of the modification studies suggest that these alternative structures are not favored under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the preferred integration sites map to the stem regions, adjacent to the loops. Most notably, the integration pattern is strand-specific with respect to the stem loop structure. We next asked if the sequence of the cruciform stem loop was crucial for the observed enhancement. We note that the dinucleotide 5′-CA-3′ is embedded within the enhanced joining region near the loop, and this dinucleotide sequence is found near the termini of all retroviral and retrotransposon DNAs. Thus, it seemed possible that the stem loop might be recognized by IN through this appropriately positioned sequence element. To test this hypothesis, a new plasmid substrate was constructed, pBR880-1, in which each stem sequence was replaced by the complementary sequence (see Fig. 5 C). The resulting inversion of each base pair in the stem produced a new stem sequence, but allowed a comparison of two stem-loops of equivalent stability. Results of the PCR-based joining assay are shown in Fig. 5 (only the bottom strand was analyzed). The enhanced joining observed with the supercoiled pBR880-1 target plasmid was quite similar to that with the original pBR711-2 target plasmid (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 8 and 9). As expected, the pBR880-1 IR can apparently form a cruciform structure analogous to pBR711-2. More precise mapping of the integration sites in supercoiled pBR880-1 revealed that the pattern was similar to that observed with pBR711-2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, the primary sequence of the stem is not a major determinant for the enhanced joining events. Rather, we conclude that the structure itself is an important feature. We next asked whether HIV-1 IN displays a similar preference. For these experiments, we used a derivative of HIV-1 IN that shows increased solubility.2 As in the case of ASV, we chose conditions where only a portion of the pBR711-2 supercoiled target DNAs were utilized, such that the integration occurred primarily in a supercoiled target DNA rather than target DNA that had been relaxed by a previous single-end integration event. Because HIV-1 IN is generally less active than is ASV IN, these conditions included a longer incubation time (60 min) as well as use of the preferred metal co-factor, Mn2+. As shown in Fig. 6, HIV-1 IN, like ASV IN, exhibits a preference for the IR region in the supercoiled, but not the linear, form of the plasmid. (Only integration events on the top strand were measured in this experiment.) We conclude that the enhanced integration catalyzed by HIV-1 IN into the IR region in the supercoiled plasmid also reflects targeting to the extruded cruciform structure induced by DNA supercoiling. This preference may, therefore, be a general property of retroviral integrases and, perhaps, related recombinases as well. It is well established that retroviral DNA integration shows little specificity with respect to host-cell target sites. On the other hand, target sites do not appear to be selected entirely at random. For example, several earlier studies have suggested that regions associated with active transcription are preferred in vivo (see Craigie (30Craigie R. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) for a review). However, more recent analyses of ASLV DNA integration events in turkey embryo fibroblasts have demonstrated that many (perhaps all) regions of the host DNA are accessible (11Withers-Ward E.S. Kitamura Y. Barnes J.P. Coffin J.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1473-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Highly preferred sites were also identified within accessible regions, but the underlying mechanisms for such preferences are not yet understood. Local preferences are also observed in vitro with purified IN and naked DNA, and these results have been interpreted to mean that sequence-determined structural variations can influence IN activity (15Kitamura Y. Lee Y.M. Coffin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5532-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Muller H.P. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4704-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19Pruss D. Reeves R. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25031-25041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that integration site selection may be mediated by specific cellular proteins. One cellular protein, denoted Ini-1, has been shown to interact with HIV-1 IN (12Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). As this protein is a component of a transcriptional activator complex, it has been proposed that the HIV-1 pre-integration complex may be recruited to specific sites in the host target DNA through protein-protein interactions (12Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The yeast Ty3 retrotransposon, which expresses a retroviral-like integrase, inserts almost exclusively into the start sites of tRNA genes (31Sandmeyer S.B. Hansen L.J. Chalker D.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that this specificity may involve a protein-protein recruitment mechanism via the transcription factors TFIIIB and TFIIIC (13Kirchner J. Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is also possible that this transcriptional complex may alter DNA structure in a manner that promotes integration (13Kirchner J. Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Curcio M.J. Morse R.H. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 436-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several studies have addressed the effects of protein binding and target DNA structure on IN activity or retroviral integration (14Bor Y.-C. Bushman F.D. Orgel L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10334-10338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,16Muller H.P. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4704-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Pryciak P.M. Sil A. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Pruss D. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5913-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Pruss D. Reeves R. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol.

One general conclusion to be derived from these studies is that certain proteins are capable of bending or distorting DNA in a manner that promotes selective integration into the exposed face of the DNA helix. For example, wrapping of DNA around nucleosomes promotes a pattern of integration sites with a 10-base pair periodicity in vitro (17Pryciak P.M. Sil A. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Pryciak P.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Naked, bent DNA promotes a similar patternin vitro, suggesting that DNA structure is a major determinant of this periodicity (16Muller H.P. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4704-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism or biological significance of these observations is unknown. Here we describe a local target preference in vitro that is clearly based on DNA structure. It is well established that, under conditions of negative supercoiling, certain IR sequences have the potential to form cruciform structures (29Pearson C.E. Zorbas H. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We provide strong evidence for the existence of such a structure in our model target DNA using two standard methods, S1 nuclease sensitivity and DEPC modification. The preferred sites for joining are observed under conditions of DNA supercoiling and correspond to the stem region adjacent to the loops. Within each stem loop of the cruciform, the joining pattern is asymmetric. A polarity of site selection was observed on each strand of the cruciform, whereby only sites corresponding to 3′-ends (sites on the 5′-side of the stem) were preferred. The structure of the preferred joining site that we describe here appears to be distinct from those previously reported. The joining is sequence-independent and does not correlate with an obvious DNA bend. For example, one study has reported that the stem of a DNA hairpin adopts a B-form structure with no obvious distortion (33Cain R.J. Zuiderweg R.R. Glick G.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2153-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). What features of the stem loop might be responsible for the enhanced joining activity, and how might this be relevant to integration in vivo? Clues may be found by comparing the processing and joining reactions. IN uses a single active site and a similar chemical mechanism for both the processing of viral DNA ends, and joining of these ends to target DNA (7Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 9Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In the processing reaction, IN nicks the viral DNA on the 3′-side of the highly conserved CA dinucleotide, which is usually located two nucleotides from the 3′-terminus of both viral strands. If additional duplex sequences are added beyond the terminus, processing is severely inhibited (10Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Vink C. van Gent D.C. Elgersma Y. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the viral processing site relative to the termini may reflect the requirement for partial unwinding of the viral DNA ends during the processing reaction (10Kukolj G. Skalka A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2556-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this respect, a contiguous DNA duplex, the potential target for the joining reaction, is structurally dissimilar from viral DNA ends. As IN uses a common mechanism for processing and joining, we speculate that the integration machinery may exploit target sites that have an end-like character. It is difficult to exclude certain biases that might be imposed by the assay used in this study. However, our results seem consistent with other observations regarding DNA structure and in vitrotarget site selection. For example, using ASV IN we generally observe that with short, linear duplex target DNAs, there is a graded preference for joining close to 3′-termini, as reported by others previously (35Fitzgerald M.L. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4314-4321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preferred target sites in the stem loop fall within a region near the loop and this may reflect a structural resemblance to DNA termini. The observation that there is a polarity of site selection may be relevant to such a model; the “3′-end” of the top strand of the stem is selected. This is analogous to the polarity of recognition of viral ends in the processing reaction. Therefore, we suggest that the stem loops may provide unique end-like structures within the supercoiled plasmid, and that the loop may provide the potential for end-like unpairing. It has previously been suggested that DNA distortion might also cause local unpairing, and this may be the basis for the observed preferences for integration into bent DNA (16Muller H.P. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4704-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,18Pruss D. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5913-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Pruss D. Reeves R. Bushman F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25031-25041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical modification studies have indicated that ASV IN may promote unpairing of DNA termini. 3R. A. Katz, P. DiCandeloro, and A. M. Skalka, manuscript in preparation. However, unpairing of internal target sequences poses a more significant energetic barrier, and the preference that we observe may reflect an exploitation of partially unpaired target DNA. The relevance of our observations to in vivo integration remains to be investigated. As noted above, we suggest that the critical structural feature of the preferred target site described here is the junctions between paired and unpaired DNA that occur at the tips of the stem loops. Thus, we speculate that retroviral integration machinery may exploit partially unpaired cellular DNA sequences. Our results also provide further support for some common elements in recognition and utilization by IN of two apparently diverse DNA substrates, the viral termini and internal cellular target sequences. These results are consistent with the idea that IN uses the same active site for both processing and joining. Although we speculate that the stem loops provide important determinants for IN activity, we cannot exclude a role for the cruciform four-way junction. For example, it is possible that the four-way junction provides a favored binding site for IN, and the target sites are selected through positioning. There is evidence that cruciform structures exist in vivo and they may participate in a wide range of processes, including the initiation of DNA replication, repair, and transcription (29Pearson C.E. Zorbas H. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We note that IN belongs to a structural superfamily that includes the E. coli RuvC protein (36Yang W. Steitz T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), an enzyme that recognizes four-way DNA junctions. In general, very little is known about how retroviral IN recognizes DNA. However, such knowledge is critical to the design of specific inhibitors that may be used to treat HIV infection. Here we identify a strong DNA structure-based preference for IN joining activity. This preference may be based on the resemblance to a structural intermediate in the joining reaction that involves unpaired DNA. Our results may also be relevant to understanding substrate preferences of certain cellular recombinases. It has been shown that the RAG-1/RAG-2 recombinase system (which mediates immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangements) shares mechanistic features with the retroviral IN reaction (37van Gent D.C.

For the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, dopamine β-hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, regulation of gene expression by cyclic AMP, diacyl glycerol, and Ca2+ leads to increased neurotransmitter biosynthesis. In this report, we demonstrate that the cAMP-mediated regulation of transcription from the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter is mediated by the AP1 proteins c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD. Following treatment of cultured cells with cAMP, protein complexes bound to the dopamine β-hydroxylase AP1/cAMP response element element change from consisting of c-Jun and JunD to include c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD. The homeodomain protein Arix is also a component of this DNA-protein complex, binding to the adjacent homeodomain recognition sites. Transfection of a dominant negative JunD expression plasmid inhibits cAMP-mediated expression of the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter construct in PC12 and CATH.a cells. In addition to the role of c-Fos in regulating dopamine β-hydroxylase gene expression in response to cAMP, a second pathway, involving Rap1/B-Raf is involved. These experiments illustrate an unusual divergence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling through multiple pathways that then reconverge on a single element in the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter to elicit activation of gene expression.

The interaction of extracellular factors with the endogenous transcriptional machinery is thought to be essential for phenotype-specific gene expression involved in differentiation and normal function of neurons. In the case of neural crest cell differentiation, growth factors in the embryonic environment are thought to induce expression of proneural transcription factors, which activate genetic pathways necessary for driving expression of pan-neuronal and phenotype-specific genes (1Anderson D.J. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 276-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Lo L. Tiveron M.-C. Anderson D.J. Development. 1998; 125: 609-620PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic pathways involved in expression of neuronal phenotype genes are likely subject to regulation by extracellular factors. The paired-like homeodomain transcription factor, Arix/Phox2a, is a component of a genetic pathway involved in regulation of some phenotype-specific characteristics in cultured neural crest cells (2Lo L. Tiveron M.-C. Anderson D.J. Development. 1998; 125: 609-620PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a role for this homeodomain protein in regulating second messenger-mediated stimulation of catecholaminergic neurotransmitter biosynthetic genes dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH)1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (3Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These enzymes are critical in the biosynthesis pathway of catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, and their expression defines an adrenergic neuronal phenotype. Taken together these studies outline a putative pathway for extracellular signal regulation of phenotype-specific gene expression. Therefore, studies that further define the interaction of the cellular transcriptional machinery with second messenger pathways are needed to provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying regulation and maintenance of neuronal phenotype and function. The transcriptional changes resulting from environmental stimuli are believed to be mediated through ligand and second messenger stimulation of protein phosphorylation cascades. Many neurotransmitter biosynthetic genes are transcriptionally responsive to activation of protein kinase A (via cyclic AMP) and protein kinase C (via diacyl glycerol). A consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE), containing the core sequence TGACGTCA, is found on several neurotransmitter biosynthetic genes, including TH, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and somatostatin (4Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Seasholtz A.F. Thompson R.C. Douglass J.O. Mol.

A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The consensus CRE is recognized by the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 7Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-288PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a consensus AP1 site, containing a core sequence TCA(C/G)TCA and responsive to phorbol esters or other agents that elevate diacyl glycerol, is present on both the TH and VIP genes (8Icard-Liepkalns C. Faucon-Gifuet N. Vyas L. Robert J.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Hahm S.H. Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The AP1 site is recognized by members of the Fos and Jun family of transcription factors. On the genes containing two defined AP1 and CRE regulatory elements, the AP1 and CRE sites are physically separate, and each effector may stimulate transcription independently. In contrast, at least three neurotransmitter biosynthetic genes contain a composite CRE/AP1 site, which is responsive to both cAMP and phorbol ester mediated transcriptional activation. In these genes, dopamine β-hydroxylase, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin, the core CRE/AP1 site, TGCGTCA, contains elements of both the consensus CRE and AP1 sites (10Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P.

This composite CRE/AP1 site will bind to both CREB/ATF and AP1 family members, and the components of the DNA-protein complex may be dependent upon the cell type or environment. For example, the proenkephalin CRE interacts preferably with CREB in nuclear extracts from the striatum, while in adrenal medulla extracts it appears that AP1 complexes predominate (14Konradi C.

As with other neurotransmitter biosynthetic genes, dopamine β-hydroxylase is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern and is responsive to environmental stimuli. Within the rat dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter proximal segment both the cell type specificity and second messenger responsiveness are controlled through one regulatory element, the DB1 enhancer (10Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enhancer consists of the above mentioned CRE/AP1 site located directly adjacent to two core homeodomain protein recognition sites (HD). The DB1 element interacts with the homeodomain transcription factor Arix/Phox2a (17Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which plays a role in determining the noradrenergic phenotype (18Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsch M.-R. Kapur R.P Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Forced expression of Arix in a cell, in and of itself, does not stimulate dopamine β-hydroxylase gene expression (2Lo L. Tiveron M.-C. Anderson D.J. Development. 1998; 125: 609-620PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of dopamine β-hydroxylase gene transcription in the presence of Arix requires simultaneous activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway (3Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell selective regulation of dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter activation likely involves the interaction of the Arix with second messenger regulated transcription factors. The identity of the transcription factors which interact at the AP1/CRE component of the DB1 element is essential to further understanding the biochemical mechanisms by which these AP1/CRE transcription factors interact with Arix to influence cellular neurotransmitter phenotype. In previous studies, the AP1/CRE element has been shown to interact with members of the CREB/ATF family, including CREB, CREM, and ATF-1, in extracts from catecholaminergic cells (3Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Afar R. Silverman R. Aguanno A. Albert V.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, a dominant negative mutant of CREB blocked approximately 50% of PKA induction of a dopamine β-hydroxylase reporter gene. However, other aspects of the analysis suggested that the CREB/ATF factors were not the primary components of the DB1 binding complex. Only a small portion of the DNA-protein complex was reactive with anti-CREB or anti-CREM sera, and the entire complex was disrupted by antisera to Fos and Jun family members. In the study reported here, we have further evaluated the role of the AP1 factors in mediating the cAMP response of the dopamine β-hydroxylase gene, and have evidence that these factors do, in fact, play a major role. This is one of the first demonstrations where AP1 factors directly mediate a cAMP response. The PC12 cells used in these experiments were subclone GR5, isolated by Dr. Rae Nishi at the Oregon Health Sciences University. PC12-GR5 cells are cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). CATH.a cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 8% horse serum and 4% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were originally cloned from a pheochromocytoma (20Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar), while the catecholaminergic CATH.a cells were derived from a tumor within the mouse central nervous system (21Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 hepatoma cells are cultured in minimum Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate. All cells are cultured in an atmosphere of humidified air containing 5% CO2. The construction of plasmids containing the promoter and 5′-flanking sequence of TH and dopamine β-hydroxylase genes cloned adjacent to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) transcription unit has been described previously (4Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol.

Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21579-21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), while the plasmid with a deletion in the AP1 site of the TH promoter construct was a gift from Dr. Ed Ziff (23Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). RSV-Arix contains Arix cDNA sequence 1–1353, which includes all 5′-untranslated and protein-coding sequences and 313 bases of the Arix 3′-untranslated sequence (17Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA segment is cloned into pSPRSV, where Arix transcription is under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and enhancer elements and is followed by a poly(A) addition signal from SV40 (10Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J.

The dominant negative JunD expression construct was a generous gift from Dr. Lester Lau (University of Illinois, Chicago) as described previously (25Yoon J.K. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The KCREB expression plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University), the construction of which was described in Walton et al. (26Walton J.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative construct of Rap1, RapN17, was a gift of Dr. Phil Stork (Oregon Health Sciences University) and is described in Vossler et al.(27Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). DNA used for transfection was purified using the Promega Wizard kit. Following purification according to the manufacturer's procedures, DNA was precipitated from ethanol in the presence of ammonium acetate. PC12 cell cultures, in 100-mm culture dishes, were transfected with 15–23 μg of DNA using calcium phosphate, as described previously. CATH.a cell cultures were transfected with 8–11 μg of DNA using the cationic lipid, PFx 6 (Invitrogen), at a DNA:lipid ratio of 1:3, following the procedure supplied by the manufacturer. Cell cultures contained 3–6 × 106 cells/dish. All transfections contained 1–3 μg of pRSV-luciferase to verify success of transfection. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, and aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for protein content, CAT activity (28Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity (29de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). CAT activity is standardized to co-transfected luciferase, except when cAMP analogs or RSV-PKA are used. Previous experimental results indicated a stimulatory effect of cAMP and PKA on the RSV promoter of RSV-luciferase. 2D. J. Swanson, E. Zellmer, and E. J. Lewis, unpublished observation. For experiments using cAMP or PKA, CAT activity is standardized to total extract protein. In experiments using inducers, these agents were added 18 h before harvesting of cells. PC12 and CATH.a cells were treated with 200 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP). For some experiments, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was added to cultures either alone or with CPT-cAMP at a concentration of 20 nm. Crude nuclear extracts were made from PC12, CATH.a, and HepG2 cells following the method of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovits R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1475Crossref Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) modified by a high salt (0.6 m KCl) extraction of the nuclear pellet (as described by Ausbel (31Ausbel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). Additionally, all buffers used contained Pefbloc (0.2 mg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), and pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml) as protease inhibitors and NaF (10 mm) as a phosphatase inhibitor. The nuclear extracts were dialyzed against nuclear extract buffer, consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm NaF. Protein concentration of each nuclear extract was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and aliquots were frozen and stored at −70 °C. Synthetic sense and antisense oligonucleotides were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, then annealed. The EMSA reactions were carried out in a 20-μl final volume containing 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Nuclear extract protein concentrations were adjusted to 1.7 μg/μl with nuclear extract buffer. Labeled probe (10,000–25,000 cpm Cherenkov counts) was added to the reaction buffer containing 5 μg of nuclear extracts and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For competition EMSAs, reaction mixtures containing nuclear extracts were preincubated for 20 min in the presence of double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides (200 ng) prior to incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide probe. Samples were carefully loaded to minimize mixing, and the complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) using an electrophoresis buffer containing 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized autoradiographically. The sequences of the wild type and mutant oligonucleotides used in this study are as follows, (lowercase letters signifying the mutation): wild type DB1, ATGTCCATGCGTCATTAGTGCAATTAGGG; CR/APm, ATGTCCAgagcTCATTAGTGCAATTAGGG; and the 2HDm, ATGTCCATGCGTCATacGTGCAccTAGGG. In order to identify protein constituents of EMSA complexes, antisera broadly reactive against Fos and Jun family members or antisera reactive with specific family members, were tested in EMSA reactions. Nuclear extracts and reaction buffer components were preincubated together with 4 μg of affinity-purified IgG for 20 min at room temperature prior to a 30-min incubation with labeled probe and separated by electrophoresis as described above. The following is a list of antisera purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and used in the study to characterize AP1 proteins in EMSA: αFos (sc-253x) Fos family-reactive rabbit polyclonal IgG against amino acids 128–152 of human c-Fos p62; c-Fos (sc-52x) c-Fos-specific rabbit IgG against amino acids 3–16 of the human c-Fos gene; Fra-1 (sc-183x) rabbit IgG directed against amino acids 3–22, unique to the amino terminus of mouse Fra-1; Fra-2 (sc-57x) rabbit IgG directed against amino acids 285–299 of the chicken Fra-2 gene product (common to rat and human genes); αJun (sc-44x) Jun-family reactive rabbit polyclonal IgG against amino acids 247–263 of mouse c-Jun p39; c-Jun (sc-45x) c-Jun-specific rabbit IgG against amino acids 91–105 of the mouse c-Jun; JunD (sc-74) JunD-specific rabbit IgG against amino acids 329–341 of the mouse JunD; JunB (sc-46x) JunB-specific rabbit IgG against amino acids 45–61 of the mouse JunB. Arix antisera was raised by immunizing rabbits with a C-terminal peptide of Arix, containing the sequence YFHRKPGPALKTNLF, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antisera was prepared by Atlantic Antibodies, Windham, ME. The serum was affinity-purified with a form of recombinant Arix containing the homeodomain and C-terminal portion fused to glutathioneS-transferase, using the method described by Youssoufian (32Youssoufian H BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from PC12 cells from untreated or treated cultures were analyzed for c-Fos immunoreactivity by Western blot analysis. 10 μg of nuclear extracts were separated on 10% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. c-Fos-specific immunoreactivity was identified using the c-Fos-specific (sc-52) antisera followed by enhanced chemilumiscent detection (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products) and exposure to x-ray film. The AP1/CRE site of the dopamine β-hydroxylase gene lies within the DB1 enhancer element, which also contains two homeodomain binding sites, one of which overlaps the final base of the CRE/AP1 (Fig. 1 A). We have recently reported that cAMP stimulation of PC12 cells induced Fos and Jun family-related binding activities associated with the formation of a major cAMP-induced DB1 binding complex (3Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this previous study, we showed that mutation of seven bases spanning the CRE/AP1 and 5′-homeodomain sites, disrupted the formation of the induced complex, as evidenced by EMSA. To differentiate the AP1/CRE binding site from the homeodomain binding site, an oligonucleotide probe was constructed which contains a 4-base mutation within only the AP1/CRE site (CR/APm), leaving the homeodomain site and adjacent bases intact. In competition analyses, the CR/APm oligonucleotide competes for all complexes binding to the DB1 probe except those running coincident with the induced cAMP complex (Fig. 1 B). When this oligonucleotide was used as a probe in EMSA, the 4-base mutation abolishes formation of the cAMP-induced complex, further demonstrating that the CRE/AP1 element is indeed the site recognized by the induced complex (Fig. 1 B). To ascertain the identity of the Fos and Jun family members involved in the DB1 DNA-protein complex, antisera directed against the individual Fos and Jun species were added to the EMSA reaction. The disruption, or altered mobility, of complex formation by specific antisera indicates the presence of that protein in complex with the DNA probe. In EMSA using nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells, antisera directed against c-Jun and JunD react with DB1 binding complexes, suggesting that these factors interact with DB1 under basal conditions, either as homo- or heterodimers (Fig. 1 C, basal lanes). In extracts from cells treated with cAMP, where an induced complex is visualized, c-Jun and JunD antisera again elicit supershifts. In addition, c-Fos-specific reactivity is evident on the DB1 probe (Fig. 1 C, cAMP lanes). Similar to the loss of cAMP-induced complex in EMSA by mutation of the CRE/AP1 site, (Fig. 1 B), the c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD antisera-specific supershifts were not detected using these mutant oligonucleotides in EMSA (data not shown). This result confirms the specific binding of these AP1 proteins to this site within the DB1 enhancer. Antisera against other closely related AP1 family members (Fra-1, Fra-2, Fos-B, and JunB), did not alter the basal or cAMP treated EMSA pattern on DB1, suggesting that in PC12 cells these proteins do not interact with the DB1 enhancer. Control experiments using a consensus AP1 oligonucleotide probe have verified the efficacy of these antisera in EMSA (data not shown). As previously reported (3Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), antiserum with broad Fos family reactivity (αfos) completely disrupts the complex, and antiserum to Jun family members (αJun) causes partial disruption (Fig. 1 C). These experiments demonstrate that cAMP treatment of PC12 cells increases the binding of AP1 family members to the CRE/AP1 site of the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter. The presence of c-Fos, along with c-Jun and JunD, in the complex induced by cAMP suggests that these proteins may be involved in the induction of dopamine β-hydroxylase transcription by cAMP. The presence of c-Jun and JunD in the basal condition suggests that transcriptional activation may involve a shift in the composition of the AP1 complex, from Jun family members to Fos-Jun family members. We have previously demonstrated that the homeodomain core sites of the DB1 enhancer will bind the homeodomain protein Arix when recombinant protein is used (17Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether native Arix is present in DB1 binding complexes derived from nuclear extracts, we have developed an affinity purified rabbit antisera directed against a C-terminal peptide of Arix. In Western blot analysis, this antisera specifically recognizes a band of appropriate molecular mass (36 kDa) in nuclear extracts from Arix expressing cell lines that is not present in Arix-negative cell lines (data not shown). EMSA analyses with Arix antisera demonstrate reactive supershifts of a complex binding to the DB1 enhancer from unstimulated and cAMP-stimulated PC12 and CATH.a cells but not from Arix-negative HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Arix antisera appears to disrupt the cAMP-induced complex from PC12 cells as well as forming a supershift of protein-DNA complexes, suggesting that Arix is a component of the induced complex. Mutations in the two HD core recognition sites disrupt the Arix antisera supershifts when tested with the 2HDm oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 2). Thus, in the context of nuclear proteins from catecholaminergic cell lines, endogenous Arix binding depends on the presence of intact HD core recognition sites. The proximity of the HD sites binding Arix and the CRE/AP1 site binding AP1 proteins in conjunction with the previous findings that Arix can facilitate transcriptional responses to PKA would suggest that functional interaction of these transcription factors occurs at the DB1 enhancer. To evaluate the involvement of the AP1 proteins in the transcriptional regulation of the DB1 promoter by PKA, an expression vector containing a cDNA encoding dominant negative JunD was co-transfected with the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter-reporter construct (DBH-CAT) and an expression vector carrying the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (RSV-PKA). The dominant negative JunD has a deletion of the DNA binding domain but the dimerization domain remains intact (25Yoon J.K. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, dominant negative JunD will form dimers with all AP1 proteins that normally dimerize with JunD, yet will not bind to DNA, preventing the transcriptional activation by endogenous AP1 partners. In both PC12 cells (Fig. 3 A), and the catecholaminergic CATH.a cell line (Fig. 3 B), expression of the dominant negative JunD caused a 70–80% reduction in the response of the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter to PKA. As we have shown previously (3Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a dominant negative CREB construct, KCREB, reduced PKA-induced transcription by 50% in PC12 cells (Fig. 3 A). We show here a similar effect of KCREB on PKA stimulated DBH-CAT activity in CATH.a cells (Fig. 3 B). The combination of KCREB and dominant negative JunD in PC12 cells did not cause further reduction than JunD alone. These results demonstrate the involvement of AP1 proteins in mediating the cAMP/PKA-induced activation of the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter, and further suggest that the Jun family members involved likely function downstream of CREB/CREM in driving this response. From the experimental results reported thus far, a possible explanation for the role of AP1 family members in the induction of dopamine β-hydroxylase gene transcription is that the cAMP-mediated induction of c-Fo"

One focus of studies on G protein-coupled receptors relates to processes contributing to desensitization, the phenomenon by which sustained exposure of a receptor to an agonist ligand results in a waning of cellular response to the ligand (12Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Elements contributory to this phenomenon include receptor phosphorylation, which can either directly or indirectly result in a diminution of receptor-G protein interactions, internalization of the receptor and/or G protein, and alterations in cellular levels of these proteins (12Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar).During studies of the TRHR we have noted that both the rat TRHR and the G proteins Gqα and G11α are internalized in response to agonist (13Drmota T.

These approaches have been instrumental in providing key information in relation to receptor regulation. However, for many of these, analyses cannot be performed in real time and on intact cells because it is often necessary to fix the cell before visualization.Recently, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) derived fromAequorea victoria has become a powerful adjunct to cell biological research as a molecular marker for gene expression (28Kakinoki Y.

Pines J. McLean Hunter S. Dixon J.P.C. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Development. 1997; 124: 1133-1137PubMed Google Scholar) was attached to the COOH-terminal tail of the long isoform of the rat TRH receptor to analyze the processes contributing to agonist-mediated internalization and trafficking of this receptor.RESULTSA cDNA encoding the long isoform of the rat TRHR was modified such that an 11-amino acid (YTDIEMNRLGK) VSV epitope tag was added to the NH2 terminus of the encoded protein (VSV-TRHR). This construct was modified further by a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy such that a cDNA encoding a highly fluorescent and thermostabilized form of the A. victoria GFP (30Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. McLean Hunter S. Dixon J.P.C. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Development. 1997; 124: 1133-1137PubMed Google Scholar) was linked in-frame with the VSV-TRHR cDNA to generate a VSV-TRHR-GFP cDNA. For convenience of construction this resulted in the alteration of the final amino acid of the TRHR from Ile to Leu and the incorporation of a 2-amino acid (Gly-Ala) linker between the two proteins now contained within the chimeric construct (Fig. 1).Transient expression of the VSV-TRHR-GFP cDNA in HEK293 cells followed by fixation and imaging in a confocal microscope demonstrated expression of the construct. The expressed protein had a predominantly plasma membrane localization (14Milligan G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 13-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To characterize the integrity and functionality of VSV-TRHR-GFP it was expressed transiently in HEK293 cells in parallel with both the unmodified TRHR and VSV-TRHR. The cells were labeled subsequently with [3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml, 24 h), and the capacity of varying concentrations of TRH to stimulate the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates was measured. All three TRHR constructs allowed robust stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate production (Fig. 2 with TRH displaying slightly greater potency at VSV-TRHR-GFP (EC50 = 3.2 × 10−9m) compared with either VSV-TRHR (EC50 = 6.2 × 10−9m) or TRHR (EC50 = 6.9 × 10−9m). However, the fold stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate production over basal produced by VSV-TRHR-GFP (3.2-fold) was lower than that produced by either VSV-TRHR (6.7-fold) or TRHR (6.2-fold). The capacity of each construct to bind [3H]TRH in membranes prepared from these transiently transfected cells and for this to be competed for by increasing concentrations of TRH allowed approximate assessment of the levels of expression and affinity for TRH by application of the formalisms of DeBlasi et al. (35DeBlasi A. O'Reilly K. Motulsky H.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to the binding data. Over a series of such transfections the estimated K d for TRH at VSV-TRHR-GFP was 3.3 × 10−8m, for VSV-TRHR it was 3.8 × 10−8m, and for TRHR it was 4.9 × 10−8m.Figure 2VSV-TRHR-GFP stimulates inositol phosphate production in response to TRH with high potency. Each of TRHR (diamonds), VSV-TRHR (circles), and VSV-TRHR-GFP (squares) was expressed transiently in HEK293 cells.

A single clone, designated VTGP1, was selected for detailed analysis based on expression of the construct with an essentially homogeneous plasma membrane distribution (see later) and maintained contact inhibition of the cells (data not shown). Intact cell binding studies were performed on cells of clone VTGP1 (Fig. 3). These experiments indicated a K d for TRH of 3.8 ± 1.2 × 10−8m with expression of VSV-TRHR-GFP at 1.2 ± 0.2 × 105copies/cell.Figure 3Clone VTGP1 expresses VSV-TRHR-GFP at high levels. Intact clone VTGP1 cells (1 × 106/assay) were used to measure the binding of 10 nm[3H]TRH and its capacity to be competed for by varying concentrations of TRH. Analysis of such data using the formalisms of DeBlasi et al. (35DeBlasi A. O'Reilly K. Motulsky H.J. Trends Pharmacol.

Initially the construct was concentrated heavily at the plasma membrane of the cells (Fig. 4 a ). However, within 3–5 min distinct internalization was occurring (Fig. 4 b). This became more pronounced such that within 10–15 min the bulk of the VSV-TRHR-GFP had been relocated away from the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 c), an effect that was maintained at subsequent times up to at least 30 min (Fig. 4 d).Figure 4VSV-TRHR-GFP is internalized upon exposure to TRH: time course. Live clone VTGP1 cells were grown on coverslips and VSV-TRHR-GFP visualized in the confocal microscope (panel a). TRH (1 × 10−7m) was added, and the cells were visualized over the ensuing 30-min period.

Cells were incubated with or without the low affinity TRHR antagonist/inverse agonist chlordiazepoxide (100 μm) (36Hinkle P.M. Shanshala E.D. II Mol.

Chlordiazepoxide alone did not alter the cellular distribution of VSV-TRHR-GFP (Fig. 5 a). 5 × 10−10m TRH produced little internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP (data not shown); however, 5 × 10−9m TRH caused strong internalization (Fig. 5 b). Coadministration of chlordiazepoxide (100 μm) along with 5 × 10−9m TRH largely inhibited internalization (Fig. 5 c), but 5 × 10−8m TRH was able to overcome the blockade of internalization caused by the antagonist (Fig. 5 d).Figure 5The pharmacology of TRH-mediated internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP. Clone VTGP1 cells were exposed to chlordiazepoxide (1 × 10−4m)( panel a ), 5 × 10−9m TRH ( panel b ), 5 × 10−9m TRH plus chlordiazepoxide (1 × 10−4m) ( panel c), and 5 × 10−8m TRH plus chlordiazepoxide (1 × 10−4m) (panel d) for 30 min.

To establish the concentration requirements for sucrose, intact clone VTGP1 cells in medium were exposed to 1 × 10−8m [3H]TRH for 30 min at 37 °C after preexposure in the presence or absence of either 0.3m or 0.4 m sucrose for 20 min. Subsequently the cells were acid washed to remove cell surface-bound and excess [3H]TRH, and the acid-resistant (internalized) pools of specific [3H]TRH binding were determined. In the absence of sucrose, a substantial amount of specific [3H]TRH binding was acid-resistant and thus represented internalized VSV-TRHR-GFP. However, little acid-resistant [3H]TRH binding was detected in the presence of 0.4 m sucrose, and the levels of acid-resistant [3H]TRH binding were reduced substantially in the presence of 0.3 m sucrose (Fig. 6). We wished to equate this biochemical measurement of VSV-TRHR-GFP internalization with direct visualization. Using the same assay conditions, TRH induced strong internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP in a 30-min period in the absence of sucrose (Fig. 7, a and b). Dramatic differences were observed, however, in the presence of sucrose and indeed between the two concentrations of sucrose used. In the presence of 0.4 m sucrose, little internalization was observed in response to TRH (Fig. 7 c). However, the VSV-TRHR-GFP was now distributed nonuniformly around the plasma membrane with clear punctate concentrations. In the presence of 0.3 m sucrose TRH produced a composite pattern in which a significant fraction of VSV-TRHR-GFP was internalized, but equally a significant fraction was located at punctate but plasma membrane-delineated sites (Fig. 7 d).Figure 6Hyperosmolar sucrose prevents internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP: binding studies. The specific binding of internalized [3H]TRH in intact clone VTGP1 cells was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the absence of sucrose ( 1 ) or in the presence of 0.3m ( 2 ) or 0.4 m ( 3 ) sucrose.

Dual wavelength scanning allowed concurrent detection of plasma membrane-located VSV-TRHR-GFP and internalized Texas Red transferrin in live, untreated, clone VTGP1 cells. Application of TRH resulted in a time-dependent internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP into vesicle populations that were either identical with or overlapped those containing Texas Red transferrin as assessed by the merging of the red and green color signals over a 6–20-min period (Fig. 8).Figure 8Internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP into vesicles in close apposition to those containing transferrin.

Confocal imaging allowed independent location of the Texas Red transferrin (panel a, red) and VSV-TRHR-GFP (panel a, green). TRH (1 × 10−7m) was added and the cells imaged over the ensuing 30 min.

Treatment of cells with cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of microfilament function (4 μg/ml, 30 min), did not interfere with subsequent TRH-mediated internalization (Fig. 9 a). By contrast, pretreatment with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole (1 × 10−5m, 60 min) resulted in TRH producing a punctate plasma membrane and periplasma membrane distribution pattern without resulting in the intense perinuclear, deep, cellular redistribution observed without pretreatment with nocodazole (Fig. 9 b). The acid resistance of the bulk of the intact cell binding of [3H]TRH after nocodazole treatment (Table I) demonstrated that the bulk of the observed VSV-TRHR-GFP was truly internalized rather than simply being bound to plasma membrane-localized TRHR which could be accessed by the low pH wash.Figure 9Internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP: role of microtubule structure.

The specific internalization of [3H]TRH was then followed over a 30-min period at 37 °C as under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are from a representative experiment. Open table in a new tab Very brief exposure (1 min) to TRH followed by washout of the ligand resulted in the appearance of a punctate plasma membrane staining and initiation of internalization (Fig. 10 a). By following the same group of intact cells over an extended time period, even 40 min after the washout of TRH, substantial pools of internalized VSV-TRHR-GFP could be observed in many cells (Fig. 10 b). Over this period substantial amounts of VSV-TRHR-GFP were recycled back to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the plasma membrane distribution of remaining VSV-TRHR-GFP again became essentially homogeneous. A second period of exposure to TRH was then initiated (Fig. 10 c). Rapid concentration of the plasma membrane VSV-TRHR-GFP into punctate structures was again observed, and further internalization of the VSV-TRHR-GFP was initiated, which could be most easily observed in the cells that had not retained heavy levels of internalized VSV-TRHR-GFP during the incubation phase in the absence of TRH (Fig. 10 c). After sustained exposure to TRH, plasma membrane levels of VSV-TRHR-GFP became virtually undetectable (Fig. 10 d).Figure 10Internalization, recycling, and further internalization of VSV-TRHR-GFP as TRH is applied, removed, and reapplied. Clone VTGP1 cells were treated with TRH (1 × 10−7m) for 1 min. This was removed subsequently with extensive washing. Intact cells were then visualized to detect the cellular location of VSV-TRHR-GFP. After the time required for washing, the first exposure was at 4 min( panel a). Extensive internalization could already be observed as well as distinct plasma membrane clustering. Within 10 min, recycling of internalized VSV-TRHR-GFP to the plasma membrane was observed (not shown). 40 min after washout (panel b) a substantial amount of internalized VSV-TRHR-GFP could still be observed in many cells while the remaining plasma membrane located VSV-TRHR-GFP was once more distributed uniformly. TRH (1 × 10−7m) was applied again; (panel c) within 2 min a new round of internalization was evident. With sustained exposure to TRH virtually all of the detectable VSV-TRHR-GFP was internalized within 20 min (panel d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe use of chimeric proteins containing modified forms of the GFP from A. victoria has recently provided a novel means to visualize the expression, distribution, and redistribution of proteins in response to stimulation in intact cells and in real time (28Kakinoki Y.

Seven cell mutants, ZP116, ZP119, ZP160, ZP161, ZP162, ZP164, and ZP165, of 11 P9OH/UV-resistant cell clones showed cytosolic localization of catalase, a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, apparently indicating a defect of peroxisome biogenesis. By transfection of PEX cDNAs and cell fusion analysis, mutants ZP119 and ZP165 were found to belong to a novel complementation group (CG), distinct from earlier mutants. CG analysis by cell fusion with fibroblasts from patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders such as Zellweger syndrome indicated that ZP119 and ZP165 were in the same CG as the most recently identified human CG-J. The peroxisomal matrix proteins examined, including PTS1 proteins as well as a PTS2 protein, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, were also found in the cytosol in ZP119 and ZP165. Furthermore, these mutants showed typical peroxisome assembly-defective phenotype such as severe loss of resistance to 12-(1′-pyrene)dodecanoic acid/UV treatment. Most strikingly, peroxisomal reminiscent vesicular structures, so-called peroxisomal ghosts noted in all CGs of earlier Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants as well as in eight CGs of patients' fibroblasts, were not discernible in ZP119 and ZP165, despite normal synthesis of peroxisomal membrane proteins.

The hierarchy of the highly organized biogenesis of the different subcellular compartments is one of the major characteristics of eukaryotic cells. Peroxisome, a single membrane-bounded organelle, functions in various metabolic pathways such as β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and synthesis of ether phospholipids, plasmalogens (1van den Bosch H.

https://openalex.org/W2093016292,"A critical problem within transcription factor families is how diverse regulatory programs are directed by highly related members. Androgen and glucocorticoid receptors (AR, GR) recognize a consensus DNA hormone response element (HRE), but they activate target genes with precise specificity, largely dependent on the promoter and cell context. We have assessed the role of different receptor domains in hormone-specific response by testing chimeras of AR and GR for their ability to activate the androgen-specific enhancer of the mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) gene. Although all of the mutant receptors activated simple HREs, only a few activated the androgen-specific element. One component shared by receptors functional on the AR-specific target was the AR DNA binding domain. Activation was not due to differential DNA affinity but rather to the AR DNA binding domain escaping suppression directed at the GR DNA binding domain in this enhancer context. A further mechanism increasing specific activation was cooperation of receptors at multiple and weak HREs, which was accentuated in the presence of both the AR N terminus and ligand binding domain. These domains together increased recognition of weak HREs, as demonstrated by in vitro DNase I footprinting and transactivation of mutant enhancers. Further, AR N-terminal subdomains reported to interact directly with the ligand binding domain relieved an inhibitory effect imposed by that domain. Therefore, functions intrinsic to AR augment steroid-specific gene activation, by evading negative regulation operating on the domains of other receptors and by enhancing cooperativity through intra- and inter-receptor domain interactions. These subtle distinctions in AR and GR behavior enforce transcriptional specificity established by the context of nonreceptor factors.

Many developmental, reproductive, and homeostatic functions are coordinated by steroid hormones via their specific receptors that regulate gene expression (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). The basis for distinct physiological roles of each steroid remains enigmatic, because the highly conserved DNA binding domains (DBD)1 of several receptors recognize a common hormone response element (HRE). Multiple mechanisms, acting through distinct receptor domains, may influence specificity. Notably, other transcription factors may interact differentially with receptors, in part via dissimilar N-terminal transactivation domains. The DBDs may display differential affinities on nonconsensus HREs of natural promoters. Further, recently discovered co-activators that interact broadly with conserved regions of the ligand binding domain (LBD) may prove to discriminate among receptors. Steroid receptors interact directly with a variety of transcription factors to elicit precise positive or negative regulation (2Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell.

Nevertheless, no factor has yet been shown to be required by a particular receptor, or to be exclusive in its interactions. The growing number of receptor co-activators and co-repressors (reviewed in Refs. 7Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

However, some co-activators more limited in their receptor associations have been described (9Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some complex regulatory elements from genes that are androgen-specificin vivo retain a specific steroid response when fused to reporter genes, allowing examination of sequence requirements for specificity (10Adler A.J.

These enhancers require as yet unidentified DNA binding factors for specific response, and characteristically depend on multiple nonconsensus HREs, some of which bind androgen receptor (AR) with higher affinity than glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (13Adler A.J.

This discrimination among variant HREs may prevent inappropriate hormonal activation, and the difference may be amplified by multiple receptor binding sites. For AR, activity is modulated by interactions between distinct functional domains of the homodimer. In particular, strong interaction between the amino and carboxyl termini of AR has been implicated in ligand binding, receptor stabilization, and enhanced transactivation (16Zhou Z.-X. Lane M.V.

Biol. 1993; 13: 399-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has not been defined, but active regions have been revealed by their deletion (18Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol.

Large N-terminal deletions render the receptor a trans-dominant repressor of full-length AR (24Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Janne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the LBD is most active in in vitro transcription (25Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), demonstrating that isolated domains can have unexpected behaviors. For androgen-specific response, the enhancer of the mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) gene depends on a consensus HRE and multiple nonreceptor factor binding sites within a 120-bp DNA fragment (10Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GR not only fails to activate this enhancer in transfection, but blocks AR activation, dependent upon an intact GR DBD. Subtle alterations in sequence or position of the HRE, or inclusion of binding sites for other factors, can reduce specificity and permit GR function (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A chimeric receptor that replaced the AR N terminus with that of GR activated simple HREs but not the androgen-specific enhancer, demonstrating importance of this region in selectivity (10Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the N terminus of AR before the DBD and LBD of GR was not sufficient to activate the specific enhancer. To determine domain involvements in specificity, we tested an array of chimeric receptors and find that each domain plays a distinct role. The AR DBD escapes suppression of activity that operates on the GR DBD in the context of the specific enhancer. Perhaps more importantly, interactions within and between receptors increase utility of nonconsensus HREs. This provides a mechanism whereby a specific response can be generated by AR cooperativity from multiple weak elements with poor affinity for GR. The mouse androgen receptor (mAR) and rat glucocorticoid receptor (rGR) cDNAs (26He W.W. Fischer L.M. Sun S. Bilhartz D.L. Zhu X. Young C.Y.F. Kelley D.B. Tindall D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Yamamoto, respectively) were cloned into the pCMV5 expression vector (28Andersson S. Russell D.W. Wilson J.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Chimeric receptors were generated by exchanging the N termini, DBD, or LBD of AR and GR. To create a joint between the DBD and LBD, a BamHI site was introduced by overlap extension PCR-mediated mutagenesis, at Asn533 for GR and Asp634 for AR. Primers for mutagenesis were (mutated bases are lowercase, BamHI sites are underlined): mAR sense, 5′-CCC ACT GAG GAt CCA TCC CAG A-3′ (1891–1913); antisense, 5′-CTG GGA TGG aTC CTC AGT GGG-3′ (1912–1891); rGR sense, 5′-CAC TTC GcA ggA TCC TAA CAA AAC-3′ (1587–1611); antisense, 5′-GTT TTG TTA GGA TccTgC GAA GTG-3′ (1611–1587). To retain similar rGR sequence character, Glu532 and Asn533 were changed to Gln532 and Asp533. No amino acids were changed in mAR. Primers for the other ends of the PCR products were directed at the translation start codon (ATG), and were altered to include a KpnI site overlapping a Kozak consensus: mAR sense, 5′-ggc ggt acc gcc ATG GAG GTG CAG TTA GGG-3′; rGR sense, 5′-ggc ggt acc gcc ATG GAC TCC AAA GAA TCC-3′; and at the 3′-untranslated region (ending with anXbaI site): mAR antisense, 5′-gcg tct aga GTT ATA TAA CAG GCA GAA G-3′; rGR antisense, 5′-gcg tct aga GTT CAA CTT TCT TTA AGG CAA C-3′. The HindIII site in the first zinc finger was mutated to a unique NheI site by PCR to create aNheI-BamHI cassette of the DBD. The same mutagenic primers were used for AR (Ser547) and GR (Ser448), without changing the amino acid sequence of either. mAR sense, 5′-GAT GAA GCT agc GGa TGT CAC TAC GG-3′ (1630–1656); mAR antisense, 5′-CCG TAG TGA CAt CCg ctA GCT TCA TC-3′ (1656–1630); rGR sense, 5′-GAT GAA GCT agc GGA TGT CAc TAC GG-3′ (1333–1359); rGR antisense, 5′-CCG TAg TGA CAT CCg ctA GCT TCA TC-3′ (1359–1333). These first-round chimeric receptors were inserted into pCMV5 between the KpnI and XbaI sites. The ends and junctions of PCR fragments and the DBDs between the NheI and BamHI sites were sequenced to ensure fidelity. Large internal segments were then replaced with unmodified parent receptor cDNA, to obviate extensive sequencing. The fragments were: a 1340-bp SmaI-MunI fragment of the AR N terminus, a 498-bp StuI-NdeI fragment of the AR LBD, a 1146-bp MscI-BspEI GR N-terminal fragment, and a 707-bp PstI-EcoRI GR LBD fragment. To enhance utility of the DBD cassette, the BamHI site in the pCMV5 polylinker was eliminated by treatment of BamHI-cleaved vector with mung bean nuclease, followed by religation. Further, to optimize equivalent expression of the receptors, which now had identical short untranslated leader sequences, the cauliflower mosaic virus ribosomal binding site was introduced at the EcoRI site in the polylinker of pCMV5: 5′-gaa ttc cTT TTT ATT TTT AAT TTT CTT TCA AAT ACT TCC ATC gaa ttc-3′. For controls, mAR and rGR with the introduced NheI and BamHI sites and common leader sequence were generated and denoted ARnb and GRnb. mARΔC was constructed by replacing the human 1685-bpBglII-SacI fragment of AR707-ConAc (the kind gift of M. Marcelli) (29Marcelli M. Tilley W.D. Wilson C.M. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with that from mAR, in pCMV4T. AR N-terminal sequences were introduced into the chimeric receptor GAA via convenient restriction sites that maintained translational frame. The first 37 amino acids of AR were placed at the N terminus of GAA (A37GAA) by joining the SpeI-SmaI fragment encompassing the pCMV5-ARnb promoter and N terminus toSpeI-KpnI-digested GAA (fragments were rendered blunt-ended by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase), introducing an alanine between AR Pro37 and GR Met1. G391aAA truncated the GR N terminus at the BspEI site, which was filled and joined to ARnb at the HaeII site at 1170, resulting in GR Gly391 fused to AR Trp392; this deletes 45 residues of GR, and includes an additional 144 residues of AR, before the DBD. The same primers used to generate the linker scan mutants of C′Δ9 by overlap extension PCR (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were used to mutate HRE-1 (ls7) in the context of C′Δ9 mutants in which the position of HRE-3 was altered by 10 bp (space 10, s10), to generate s10-ls7. CV-1 cells were grown and transfected, and CAT activity assayed as described previously (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, 9 μg of reporter DNA and 100 ng of pCMV5 receptor expression plasmid were introduced by DEAE dextran into 106 CV-1 cells in a 10-cm dish. Cells were grown 40 h with or without 10−7m dexamethasone, or 10−8m dihydrotestosterone (added every 12 h), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 3% charcoal-stripped NuSerum IV (Collaborative Research). Between 10 and 40 μg of cell protein were assayed for CAT activity by the phase extraction method (31Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Some transfections as noted were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation of the same amounts of reporter and receptor DNAs, and 2 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase plasmid. Cells were grown in 5% charcoal-stripped NuSerum IV in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with or without hormone as before, and glycerol-shocked after 16 h. 24 h later, cells were harvested for CAT activity in the cold to stabilize luciferase. COS-7 cells at 50% confluence were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation of 20 μg of pCMV5 receptor DNA. 40 h post-transfection, and 4 h after addition of hormone (10−7mdihydrotestosterone/10−7m dexamethasone), cells were harvested with 0.5 ml/10-cm dish of SDS-TEN buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% sodium lauroyl sulfate; 5% v/v β-mercaptoethanol) (32Wong C.I. Zhou Z.-X. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19004-19012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was sheared by passing the lysate four times through a 26-gauge needle, and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were electroblotted at 15 mA overnight onto BA-85S nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), which was then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline buffer. Receptors containing the AR N terminus were revealed with a rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing mAR residues 133–334 (33Fang Y. Fliss A.E.

Recombinant receptors were obtained from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses (kindly provided by O. Janne), harboring full-length (FL) rAR, rAR deleted between residues 46 and 408 (ΔN), or rAR truncated at amino acid 788 (ΔC) (35Xie Y.-B. Sui Y.-P. Shan L.-X. Palvimo J.J. Phillips D.M. Janne O.A.

Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11514-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis in binding buffer (below) to remove ammonium sulfate, aliquots were stored at −70 °C. For footprinting, increasing quantities of whole cell extracts were mixed with binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 50 nm dihydrotestosterone, protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm benzamidine, 20 milliunits/ml aprotinin), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10,000 cpm of end-labeled DNA probe. The probes were one or three copies of the consensus HRE-3 cloned into the BamHI site of tkCAT (30Adler A.J. Scheller A., Y. Hoffman Y. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the specific enhancer C′Δ9 (10Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), or C′Δ9 mutated at HRE-3 (ls9) or at the weak HRE-1 (ls7). Probes were end-labeled with 32P by polynucleotide kinase at the MluI site and excised withPvuII. After binding the cell extracts to the probe for 3 h on ice, MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to 2 mm each, and varying concentrations of DNase I added for 5 min on ice. The reactions were terminated, deproteinized, concentrated, and resolved on 8% sequencing gels as described previously (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory suggest that the AR N terminus is necessary but not sufficient for androgen-specific gene activation (10Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To examine the intrinsic activities of the major receptor domains, as well as interactions between domains, chimeric receptors were constructed from mAR and rGR. Unique restriction sites were introduced at regions of peptide sequence homology to rejoin the cDNAs (see “Materials and Methods”). A NheI site placed within the first zinc finger and a BamHI site within the nuclear localization signal divided the receptors into three cassettes encompassing N terminus, DBD, and LBD (Fig. 1 A). Receptors are named by the origin of each domain, with A or G for AR or GR; thus the N terminus of GR fused to the DBD and LBD of AR is the chimera GAA. AR, GR, and chimeric receptors were introduced into COS-7 cells, and their expression was compared by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). The receptors were all correct in size, but expression levels varied, despite each having identical 5′-untranslated sequences. AGG accumulated to low levels while GAA and GGA reached high steady states. These disparate levels could result from differences in protein stability or formation of inclusion bodies following overexpression in COS cells (32Wong C.I. Zhou Z.-X. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19004-19012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Gao T. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the functional level of these receptors, as assayed by activation of simple HRE-tkCAT reporters (see below), was more equivalent, and extremes of activity did not correlate with protein expression levels detected by Western blot analysis (see below). The chimeric receptors were tested for induction of CAT activity from the androgen-specific enhancer C′Δ9, in comparison to multimerized consensus HREs (3xHRE-3), by transfection into CV-1 cells (Fig. 1 C). Relative activity is shown rather than fold induction since activity of these reporters in the absence of hormone was negligible. AR activation of C′Δ9-tkCAT was 42% the activity of 3xHRE-3-tkCAT; in Fig. 1 C, activation of the two reporters is on different scales to allow direct comparison of specificversus general function of each receptor. The chimeras activated simple HREs at least as well as AR, with AGG and AGA having a fewfold greater activity, except for GGA which was only one-fourth as active as AR. In sharp contrast, only AAG and GAG activated the specific enhancer C′Δ9 to levels approaching that of AR. These two chimeras had in common the AR DBD, indicating a crucial role for this domain. However, the AR DBD may be necessary but was not sufficient for C′Δ9 induction since GAA was only somewhat more active than GR on the specific enhancer. While not all receptors containing the AR DBD could activate C′Δ9, receptors containing both the AR N terminus and DBD could (AAG and AR itself). In fact, GAG activation of the androgen-specific enhancer was unexpected, because DNA selectivity alone is not known to distinguish AR and GR targets. This suggested experiments below to test whether multiple and perhaps alternative functions were involved in specific response. We have previously shown that AR requires not only the consensus HRE-3 but also a nearby half-site, called HRE-1, to activate the androgen-specific enhancer C′Δ9 (15Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To contrast the mechanisms by which AAG and GAG activated the specific enhancer, their use of the weak HRE-1 was tested. Mutation of this site (C′Δ9-ls7) revealed disparate sensitivities to HRE-1 (Fig. 2), whereas all receptors required HRE-3 for activation (not shown). Unlike AR, whose induction was reduced 5-fold in the absence of HRE-1, GAG was at least as active on the mutant as on the wild type enhancer. AAG activity was decreased without HRE-1, but not to the extent of AR. The dependence upon multiple receptor binding sites suggested that activation by AR relied on cooperativity between receptor dimers. That AAG was less affected than AR suggested multiple domains might be involved in cooperative interactions. To explore this further, ARΔC, which lacks most of the LBD but is half as active as AR on C′Δ9, was tested and, in fact, showed little sensitivity to the weak HRE (Fig. 2). This suggests that the ability of AR to use HRE-1 is not intrinsic to the N terminus or the DBD, but may involve interaction of the AR N and C termini. The intermediate dependence of AAG on two HREs may stem from some functionality provided by the partial homology of the GR LBD. To test further the role of domain interactions and utilization of multiple HREs, a mutant of C′Δ9 was used that supports activation by GR. This variant enhancer has a linker scan disruption within HRE-3 and a copy of the HRE-3 sequence inserted 10-bp distal to the enhancer (see Fig. 3). GR can activate this reporter (s10) about half as well as AR, which was ascribed to escaping repressive effects of juxtaposed nonreceptor factors (13Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mutant receptors that poorly activated C′Δ9 were tested for dependence on a second HRE in derivatives of s10 in which HRE-1 had been inactivated (s10-ls7). AGA, like AR, showed greater induction when both HREs were present (Fig. 3). In contrast, GR, GAG, and ARΔC were unaffected by mutation of the weak element, while AAG (not shown) was intermediate in sensitivity to AR and GR. The sensitivity by AGA to mutation of the weak HRE was greater even than that of AR. This suggested that both AR N and C termini are involved, via direct or indirect interaction, in cooperative usage of multiple HREs. Further, AGA revealed that the AR DBD is not requisite for activity per se in this context, but may serve to evade repression on the specific enhancer that is directed at the other steroid receptors via their DBDs. Results thus far indicated that AR activation of the specific enhancer relied on binding to both HRE-1 and -3. This was not solely a function of the DBD, suggesting that distinct domains of receptor dimers at nearby sites might enhance cooperative DNA binding, due to direct or indirect interactions. To obtain physical evidence of this, baculovirus-expressed FL or N- or C-terminally deleted (ΔN, ΔC) rat ARs were used in DNase I protection assays. DNA binding was first compared with a single element versus three tandem copies of the consensus HRE (Fig. 4). FL AR in 5 μg of Sf9 whole cell extract completely protected 3xHRE-3 from DNase I cleavage, but only protected a single HRE to one-fifth that level. Full protection of single HREs was obtained with 20 μg of extract. This cooperativity extends observations of footprints obtained with just the DBD on the probasin promoter (39Kasper S. Rennie P.S.

In this study, we demonstrate that the thyroid hormone response elements (TRE) from the malic enzyme and myelin basic protein genes (METRE and MBPTRE) respectively, are not functionally equivalent. The METRE, which is a direct repeat motif with a 4-base pair gap between the two half-site hexamers binds thyroid hormone receptor as a heterodimer with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and mediates a high T3-dependent activation in response to TRα1 or TRβ1 in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, the MBPTRE, which consists of an inverted palindrome formed by two hexamers spaced by 6 base pairs, confers an efficient transactivation by TRβ1 but a poor transactivation by TRα1. While both receptors form heterodimers with RXR on MBPTRE, the poor transactivation by TRα1 correlates also with its ability to bind efficiently as a monomer. This monomer, which is only observed with TRα1 bound to MBPTRE, interacts neither with N-CoR nor with SRC-1, explaining its functional inefficacy. However, in Xenopusoocytes, in which RXR proteins are not detectable, the transactivation mediated by TRα1 and TRβ1 is equivalent and independent of a RXR supply, raising the question of the identity of the thyroid hormone receptor partner in these cells. Thus, in mammalian cells, the binding characteristics of TRα1 to MBPTRE (i.e. high monomer binding efficiency and low transactivation activity) might explain the particular pattern of T3 responsiveness of MBP gene expression during central nervous system development.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)1 are transcription factors that belong to the steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily, which are encoded by two distinct genes, c-erbAα and c-erbAβ. Alternative splicing of the α gene primary transcripts at their 3′ extremity generates mRNAs encoding TRα1, which binds thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine; T3), as well as the c-erbAα2 and c-erbAα3 variants, which do not. The β gene expresses two T3-binding isoforms, TRβ1 and the minor form TRβ2 (reviewed in Ref. 1Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar). In the adult animal, the α1 and β1 receptor mRNAs are found in all T3-sensitive tissues, albeit with differences in their relative abundance (2Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez-Castillo A.

Whereas TRα1 expression predominates at early stages and remains steady, TRβ1 expression is initially very low but exhibits a dramatic transient increase during the critical period of the central nervous system maturation (4Bradley D.J.

At this moment, β1 transcripts prevail in the proliferation layer, while those of α1 are localized in the differentiation layer of the developing rat cerebral cortex. These patterns of expression are consistent with specific functions of the two receptors in brain development (7Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Santos A. Gonzalez A.M. Bernal J. Mol.

TR transactivation activities are mediated through binding to specific DNA elements called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) present in the promoter of target genes. TREs are composed of two hexameric half-sites closely related to the consensus AGGTCA, arranged either as a direct repeat (DR), or as palindromic or inverted palindromic (IP) arrays (10Desvergne B.

The recent identification of nuclear receptor co-repressors and co-activators suggests that TR-mediated transcriptional regulation is a stepwise process. It is thought that, in the absence of T3, TR/RXR binds to the TRE and represses basal promoter activity by interacting with silencing factors such as N-CoR and SMRT (25Hörlein A. Naar A. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C. Rosenfeld M. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 26Chen J. Evans R. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). The addition of T3 would release co-repressors, thereby allowing the interaction of the receptors with co-activators such as SRC-1 and p300/CBP (27Onate S. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 28Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R. Rose D. Glass C. Rosenfeld M. Cell. 1996; 85: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Thus, transactivation of target genes would consist of both a derepression and then a further stimulation of the target promoter. While there is evidence for specific roles of TRα1 and TRβ1 in mediating T3 effects as mentioned above, the mechanism by which the two receptors discriminate between specific target genes remains largely unexplained. To address this question, we analyzed two T3-regulated genes, the malic enzyme (ME) and the myelin basic protein (MBP) genes. The ME gene is involved in lipid metabolism, more particularly in lipid synthesis. Its expression is ubiquitous but is up-regulated by T3 in rat liver, kidney, and heart. So far, no specific developmental expression pattern of this gene has been described. The product of the second gene studied herein, MBP, is a major protein constituent of the myelin sheet surrounding the axons. Expression of this gene is nervous system-specific and developmentally regulated. Up-regulation by T3 is mainly observed during the high myelinating activity at the critical period of brain maturation (29Farsetti A. Mitsuhashi T. Desvergne B. Robbins J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23226-23232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the onset of myelination is marked by transiently elevated levels of TRβ1 mRNA that parallel those of MBP mRNA, suggesting the involvement of TRβ1 in the regulated expression of the MBP gene (30Strait K. Carlson D. Schwartz H. Oppenheimer J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, when analyzed in a reporter gene transfection assay, TRβ1 is a more potent T3-dependent inducer of the MBP promoter activity than TRα1. In contrast, the ME promoter is more efficiently stimulated by TRα1 as compared with TRβ1 in response to T3 (31Farsetti A. Desvergne B. Hallenbeck P. Robbins J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15784-15788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This differential regulation of these two genes by TRα1 and TRβ1 is thus physiologically relevant and provides a model to gain insight into the mechanisms of TR isotype-specific action. In this study, we demonstrate that in NIH3T3 cells the TREs of the ME and MBP genes (METRE and MBPTRE) are not functionally equivalent. The METRE, which is a direct repeat motif with a 4-base pair gap between two hexamers (DR4, Fig. 1 A) (32Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mediates high T3-dependent response by both TRα1 and TRβ1. In contrast, the MBPTRE, which consists of an inverted palindrome formed by two hexamers spaced by 6 base pairs (IP6, Fig. 1 A) (31Farsetti A. Desvergne B. Hallenbeck P. Robbins J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15784-15788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), confers a poor TRα1-mediated transactivation as compared with TRβ1. This poor TRα1 activity correlates with its ability to efficiently bind the MBPTRE as monomer. We thus further explored the characteristics of the TRα1 monomer in terms of DNA sequence requirements, functional properties, and co-factor interactions. The construction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter genes, MBP(−256/+3)-CAT and ME(−315/+3)-CAT, has been previously described (29Farsetti A. Mitsuhashi T. Desvergne B. Robbins J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23226-23232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Morioka H. Tennyson G.E. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3542-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and these genes are here referred to as MBP−256 and ME−315, respectively. The MBP/METRE and the MBP−256/5′m reporter gene were obtained by PCR mutagenesis of the MBP−256 reporter according to the protocol described for PCR technology (34Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). The following primers were used for the MBP−256/5′m construct: MBP−187(+), 5′-AATGTTGAACGAGCTGAGGACACGGC-3′; MBP−176(−), 5′-AGCTCGTTCAACATTGTTCTGGATCGC-3′; MBP−260(+), 5′-GCTCTAGACTCTAGGCCTCGTACA-3′; MBP+9(−), 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGATGGTCTGAAGCTCGT-3′. The following primers were used for the MBP/METRE construct: p1, 5′-GGACGTTCGGGTTAGGGGAGGACACGGCGGTGACA-3′; p2, 5′-CCCTAACCCCAACGTCCTCTGGATCGCATCTGCCT-3′; p3, 5′-AACTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAAGGCCTCGTACAGGC-3′; p4, 5′-AATGGCGAGGATCCCTCGAGTGAAGCTCGTCGGAC-3′. MBPTRE/TATA and METRE/TATA reporter genes were obtained by cloning the corresponding MBPTRE or METRE double-stranded oligonucleotides upstream of the −33/+3 promoter sequence of the MBP gene, into the pBLCAT3 vector. For the microinjection of Xenopus oocytes, the ME−315, MBP−256, and MBP−256/5′m were subcloned into pBluescript for single-stranded DNA preparations. The mycI(6–9)CAT plasmid was kindly provided by Georges Spohr (35Modak S.P. Principaud E. Spohr G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, the rat TRα1 and human RXRα were subcloned into pSP64 (Promega). The human RXRα cDNA in which a Kozak sequence was introduced (36IJpenberg A. Jeannin E. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20108-20117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), as well as the rat TRα1 and TRβ1 cDNAs were subcloned into pSG5PL (gift of Dr Hélène Richard-Foy (37Le Ricousse S.

A cDNA clone encoding SRC-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Malcom Parker. Four regions of this SRC-1 cDNA (A, nucleotide positions 67–617; B, 617–1259; C, 1259–2330; and D, 2330–3391; numbering is according to the data for GenBankTM accession no. U40396) were fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) into pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N-CoR interaction domain (25Hörlein A. Naar A. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C. Rosenfeld M. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using mouse liver total RNA as template. The cDNA obtained by reverse transcription using an oligo(dT) was amplified by PCR with the EcoRI end primers N-CoR (+6715), 5′-GGAATTCCCTACTTGCCTTCATTCTTCAC-3′, and N-CoR (−7618), 5′-GGAATTCCCCATCATTTCTTCCTCATCCA-3′ and was subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in culture and transiently transfected by electroporation as described previously (32Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each cuvette contained 4 × 106 cells at a density of 12.5 × 106 cells/ml and a total of 70 μg of plasmid DNA (30 μg of CAT reporter plasmid, 12 μg of each expression vector (or as indicated in the figure legends), 1 μg of pCMVβgal as internal control for transfection efficiency, and pUC19 to complete to 70 μg of transfected DNA). After electroporation, cells were distributed in four 60-mm dishes containing the transfection medium supplemented with 100 nm T3 or with vehicle alone. After 48 h, cell extracts were prepared and β-galactosidase and CAT activities were determined as described previously (32Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were obtained either byin vitro transcription and translation using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) or from Xenopus oocytes whole cell extracts prepared as described below. RXRβ was prepared from nuclear extract of Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus overexpressing mouse RXRβ as described (38Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins GST-N-CoR and GST-SRC were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by the manufacturer (pGEX vectors; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes used correspond to the double-stranded oligonucleotides indicated in the figures flanked on their 5′ side and 3′ side by BamHI and HindIII sequence, respectively, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP. For the binding reaction, the proteins were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature, in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a total volume of 20 μl. After a further 15-min incubation at room temperature in the presence of 30,000 cpm of labeled probe, the complexes were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. For DNA binding competition experiments, a 1.25–12.5-fold molar excess (as indicated) of the unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotide was added for further 10 min after the incubation reaction. For kinetic experiments, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added after the incubation reaction and left for different time periods, as indicated in the figures. Scanning and treatment of the autoradiographies were performed using the Cirrus 1.2 software. When appropriate, gels were analyzed by densitometry. The preparation of Xenopus stage VI oocytes and the microinjection procedure were essentially as described in Wong et al. (39Wong, J., Shi, Y.-B., and Wolffe, A. P. (1995) Genes Dev. 2696–2711Google Scholar) using the Nanoliter Injector (A203XVZ, World Precision Instruments, Inc.). The rTRα1 (3 ng/oocyte) and human RXRα (3 ng/oocyte) mRNAs were injected into the cytoplasms of oocytes, which were incubated at 18 °C overnight in MBSH buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2) supplemented with antibiotics (50 units/ml of ampicillin and streptomycin). Then the ME−315, MBP−256, or MBP−256/5′m single-stranded reporter genes were microinjected into oocyte nuclei (1 ng/oocyte) with the internal control mycI(6–9)CAT (0.2 ng/oocyte) as indicated in the legend of Fig. 6. The oocytes were incubated in MBSH buffer supplemented with antibiotics during 6 h and then collected for transcription analysis (see below). For EMSA, 10 oocytes were injected, and after an overnight incubation, whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (39Wong, J., Shi, Y.-B., and Wolffe, A. P. (1995) Genes Dev. 2696–2711Google Scholar). A group of 15–20 oocytes was collected per sample and homogenized in 10 μl/oocyte of 0.25m Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. The equivalent of 10 oocytes was used for RNA purification and transcription analysis. Total RNA was prepared from the homogenate using the RNazol™ method (Tel-Test Inc.) as described by Wong et al. (39Wong, J., Shi, Y.-B., and Wolffe, A. P. (1995) Genes Dev. 2696–2711Google Scholar). Half of the RNA sample (5 oocytes) was analyzed by primer extension. The RNA (10 μl) was supplemented with 10 μl of a first strand synthesis buffer (2×, provided by Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and end-labeled CAT (5′-GGT GGT ATA TCC AGT GAT TTT TTT CTC CAT-3′) and H4 (5′-GGC TTG GTG ATG CCC TGG ATG TTA TCC-3′) primers (0.2 pmol each). The H4 primer, used as an internal control, detects the endogenous histone H4 mRNA. Annealing occurred for 10 min at 65 °C, 30 min at 55 °C, 20 min at 37 °C, and 5 min at room temperature. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C upon the addition of 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs and 100 units of the Superscript™II RT (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was stopped after 1 h by ethanol precipitation. The extension products were resolved on a 8% sequencing gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by densitometry. CAT mRNA levels corresponding to ME−315, MBP−256, or MBP−256/5′m reporter were standardized to the endogenous histone H4 mRNA levels. To detect functional differences between the two main TR subtypes in the regulation of the ME and MBP promoters, we used transfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells. These cells express RXR as most cell lines do but have very low TR mRNA levels (data not shown). The two CAT reporter constructs used contain either the promoter region of the ME gene up to −315 (ME−315), which encompasses the TRE between −287 and −260 (32Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the MBP promoter up to position −256 (MBP−256) including the TRE located between positions −195 and −165 (31Farsetti A. Desvergne B. Hallenbeck P. Robbins J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15784-15788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The T3-mediated response of the ME−315 reporter gene increased with the amounts of cotransfected expression plasmids for TRα1 or TRβ1 (Fig. 1 B). However, repression by the unliganded TRα1 (mean value of 58% of repression when the cells were transfected with 3 μg of expression plasmid, p < 0.05) was more important than in the presence of TRβ1 (mean value of 73% for the corresponding point, statistically not significant). The overall T3-induced response was also more potent with TRα1 than with TRβ1, a difference that cannot be attributed to TRα1 and TRβ1 differences in expression levels (see below). As seen in Fig. 1 C, the MBP−256 reporter gene poorly responded to T3 and TRα1, and this response was not improved by transfection of higher amounts of TR expression vector. In contrast, TRβ1-mediated activity was dose-dependent, leading to a significant difference in T3 response between the two TR subtypes. Because of the opposite results obtained when using the ME and the MBP reporter genes, we can rule out an apparent functional difference that would be due to a difference in the level of receptor expression. This was further assessed by a RNase protection assay that showed that the level of TRα1 and TRβ1 mRNA after transfection were similar (data not shown). Moreover, the same pattern of activation and repression was observed using different vectors for expressing TRs (pRSV instead of pSG5PL; data not shown). Thus, in transfected NIH3T3 cells, TRα1 induces a strong T3 response of ME−315 but a weak activation of MBP−256. In contrast, TRβ1 mediates an efficient T3 stimulation of both ME and MBP reporter genes. One distinct feature of the ME and MBP promoter that may participate in their different patterns of regulation by T3 concerns the TRE structure, which corresponds to a DR4 in the ME promoter and to an inverted palindrome with a 6-base pair spacing (IP6) in the MBP promoter (Fig. 1 A). To evaluate whether the nature of the TRE was responsible of the poor TRα1-mediated T3 responsiveness of the MBP promoter, we changed the MBPTREfor METRE within the context of the MBP promoter (MBP/METRE; Fig. 1 A). As seen in Fig. 1 D, TRβ1 mediated a similar T3 responsiveness of the wild type and mutated promoter, in contrast to TRα1, which was significantly more efficient when the METRE replaces the MBPTRE. A distinct role of these two TREs in the potency of TRα1-mediated transcriptional activation was further analyzed in the context of a common minimal promoter that only contains the TATA region from −33 to +3 of the MBP promoter (MBPTRE/TATA and METRE/TATA). In this context again, the MBPTREsolely conveyed a low activation by TRα1 as compared with that mediated by METRE (5-fold versus 15-fold, respectively). We thus can conclude that in these different promoter contexts, the MBPTRE element is by itself responsible of the poor TRα1-mediated response of the MBP promoter, while it mediates efficient regulation by TRβ1. To evaluate whether the specific pattern of T3 response through particular response elements by TRα1 may reflect differences in DNA binding properties of the TR subtypes, EMSAs were performed with labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the two TREs. Neither TRα1 nor TRβ1 was able to bind to the ME probe in absence of RXR. The addition of RXR to the TRs resulted in the formation of a major complex that corresponds to the TR/RXR heterodimer (Fig. 2 A). The absence or presence of T3 in the reaction did not change the strength of this signal (data not shown). Binding of TRs to the MBPTRE was quite different from this pattern. In absence of RXR, TRα1 formed two complexes: a fast migrating complex that corresponds to a TRα1 monomer and a slower complex corresponding to a TRα1 homodimer (Fig. 2 B). The addition of T3 triggered the disappearance of the upper complex (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and 4) while provoking a small but reproducible downshift of the faster migrating complex, consistent with their identification as TR homodimer and monomer, respectively (22Andersson M.L. Nordström K. Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennström B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Forgione M. Umeda P.K.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of TRα1 resulted in a parallel increase of the intensity of both the monomer and the homodimer bands (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–9), indicating the absence of cooperativity for the formation of the homodimer. In the presence of both TRα1 and RXR, a third complex was detected. This complex corresponds to a TRα1/RXR heterodimer and was not disrupted by T3 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). As seen in Fig. 2 C, TRβ1 was also able to form a retarded complex on the MBPTRE in absence of RXR. Its slow migration and T3-induced disruption identified it as a TRβ1 homodimer (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 2). No complex corresponding to a TRβ1 monomer was observed (Fig. 2 C, lanes 5–7), although trace amounts were occasionally detected in presence of high concentrations of TRβ1. In the presence of RXR, TRβ1/RXR heterodimers were formed and showed a slightly increased mobility in presence of T3 (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 4). The addition of more RXR to TRα1 or TRβ1-containing binding reactions with the MBPTRE probe resulted in the exclusive detection of TRα1/RXR or TRβ1/RXR complexes (data not shown). In summary, TRα1/RXR and TRβ1/RXR complexes form with a similar efficiency on both TREs. However, a striking difference resides in the binding of TRα1 monomers and TRβ1 homodimers to the MBPTRE, whereas such complexes are not seen on the METRE. We further characterized the properties of the TRα1-containing complexes bound to MBPTRE by competition experiments in EMSA. In such experiments, unlabeled DNA response elements compete with the labeled probe for TR binding, allowing the measurement of either the affinity or the off-rate of the TRα1/MBPTRE complex depending on the experimental design. At equilibrium, a 4-fold molar excess of cold competitor led to a 50% decrease in hetero- and homodimer complexes, while more than 10-fold molar excess was required for a similar inhibition of the monomer complex (Fig. 3 A). This result indicates that the affinity of TRα1 monomer binding is lower than that of dimer binding. A kinetic study showed the disappearance of the complexes as a function of time in presence of a 50-fold molar excess of the competitor. Most of the monomer and most of the homodimer complexes disappeared within the first minute, while 3 min were needed to reduce the heterodimer complex to only 50% (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that the off-rate of TRα1 monomer and homodimer from MBPTRE is higher than that of the TRα1/RXR heterodimer. The occurrence of a h"

The α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDC),1 along with the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) and branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC) constitute the family of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes, important in controlling carbon flux from carbohydrate precursors and a select group of amino acids into and around the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Located in the mitochondrial matrix, the mammalian complexes catalyze the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of their respective α-ketoacid substrates yielding the appropriate acyl CoA derivatives, NADH and CO2. Central to this catalysis is the consecutive action of three catalytic components, each present in multiple copies: a substrate-specific α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (E1), a distinct dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and a common dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) (see Refs. 1Behal R.H.

In prokaryotes, in combination with its catalytic role, the oligomeric E2 core is responsible for tethering and orientating both the E1 and E3 enzymes within the complexes via compact, peripheral subunit-binding domains (3Reed L.J.

These similarities suggested that E1 of OGDC may perform some functions normally devolved to E2 in PDC and BCOADC. Further indirect evidence, in support of putative additional roles for E1 of OGDC came when the genes for rat and human E2-OGDC were cloned (14Nakano K. Matuda S. Yamanaka T. Tsubouchi H. Nakagawa S.

However, no method for the dissociation of OGDC into functionally active E2 and E1/E3 fractions has been reported to date because of the high affinity of the E1 enzyme for the core assembly, a property it shares with the E3BP of PDC (20Sanderson S.J. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report the development of a method for the successful dissociation of mammalian OGDC into its E2 and E1/E3 fractions. Subsequent reconstitution studies with the E2 core recovered appreciable levels (30%) of overall complex activity on addition of the isolated E1 and E3 components. Gel permeation of the E1/E3 fraction of OGDC, under associative conditions, demonstrated that these two enzymes interact with high affinity to form a stable subcomplex with an apparent M r consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry. These studies provide the first direct biochemical evidence that uniquely, in mammalian OGDC, its constituent E1 enzyme is responsible for binding the E3 component to the multienzyme complex. The α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDC),1 along with the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) and branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC) constitute the family of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes, important in controlling carbon flux from carbohydrate precursors and a select group of amino acids into and around the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Located in the mitochondrial matrix, the mammalian complexes catalyze the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of their respective α-ketoacid substrates yielding the appropriate acyl CoA derivatives, NADH and CO2. Central to this catalysis is the consecutive action of three catalytic components, each present in multiple copies: a substrate-specific α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (E1), a distinct dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and a common dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) (see Refs. 1Behal R.H. Buxton D.B. Robertson J.G. Olson M.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 497-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 2Patel M.S. Harris R.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar for reviews). α-Ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes are assembled in a tight but noncovalent fashion. Their multi-component, multi-copy nature results in the formation of massive complexes with M rvalues of 5–10 × 106 that are organized around 24-meric or 60-meric E2 cores, exhibiting octahedral and icosahedral symmetry, respectively. In prokaryotes, in combination with its catalytic role, the oligomeric E2 core is responsible for tethering and orientating both the E1 and E3 enzymes within the complexes via compact, peripheral subunit-binding domains (3Reed L.J.

In higher eukaryotes the identification of an additional component of PDC, E3-binding protein, (E3BP, formerly protein X) with similarities in domain structure to E2 suggested a possible devolution of subunit function (6De Marcucci O.

https://openalex.org/W2127322842,"Raf-1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that is involved in regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recently, we and others showed that Raf-1 is not only activated in mitogenic pathways leading to cell cycle entry but also during mitosis. Transient expression studies in COS cells now demonstrate that, in contrast to growth factor-dependent activation of Raf-1, mitotic activation of Raf-1 is Ras-independent. Dominant negative RasS17N does not interfere with mitotic activation of Raf-1, whereas epidermal growth factor-dependent stimulation of Raf-1 is inhibited. In addition, the Raf-1 mutant RafR89L, which cannot bind to activated Ras, is still stimulated in mitotic cells. Mitotic activation of Raf-1 seems to be partially dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation since the kinase activity of the Raf mutant RafYY340/341FF, which can no longer be activated by Src, is reduced in mitotic cells. Surprisingly, cell fractionation experiments showed that mitotic-activated Raf-1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm in contrast to the mitogen-activated Raf-1 that is bound to the plasma membrane. In addition, mitotic activation of Raf-1 does not lead to stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK or MEK) and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). These data demonstrate that in mitotic cells a Ras-independent mechanism results in a cytoplasmic active Raf-1 kinase which does not signal via the MEK/ERK pathway.

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases stimulate the small GTP-binding protein Ras, which results in activation of a protein kinase cascade headed by Raf-1 (3Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A.

Cytoplasmic inactive Raf-1 directly interacts with activated Ras and is thereby recruited to the plasma membrane where further activation steps take place (5Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H.

Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates and stimulates MEK1 which in turn activates ERK1 and ERK2, members of the family of MAP kinases. ERKs are involved in regulation of gene expression and protein biosynthesis (8Marais R. Marshall C.J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 101-125PubMed Google Scholar). Under certain conditions Raf-1 can stimulate AP-1 activity without measurable activation of ERKs (9Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Cobb M.H. Hibi M. Karin M. Brenner D.A. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6030-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recently, we were able to demonstrate that the avian homologue of Raf-1, c-Mil, can directly interact with c-Jun and phosphorylate c-Jun independently of MAPKs (10Radziwill G. Niehof M. Rommel C. Moelling K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Raf-1 activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions and by phosphorylation events. Direct interaction between activated Ras and two N-terminal regions of Raf-1 leads to translocation of the cytoplasmic inactive Raf-1 to the plasma membrane (11Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binds to the N terminus of Raf-1 as a negative regulator and is displaced by activated Ras (16Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rommel C. Radziwill G. Moelling K. Hafen E. Mech. Dev. 1997; 64: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The interaction between 14-3-3 and the C terminus of Raf-1 is independent of the activation status of Raf-1, and mutations at the C terminus of Raf-1, which lead to loss of binding of 14-3-3, abolish its kinase activity (18Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Besides protein-protein interactions Raf-1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation events. Growth factor-dependent activation of Raf-1 results in an increase of phosphorylation mainly at Ser and Thr residues of Raf-1 and in stimulation of Raf-1 activity (19Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases of the Src family can interact with Raf-1 and can phosphorylate two neighboring tyrosine residues at the C terminus of Raf-1, which results in activation of Raf-1 (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 by non-receptor tyrosine kinases is a major event in stimulation of T cells with cytokines such as interleukin-2 (22Turner B.C. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation also seems to play an essential role in the growth factor-dependent activation of Raf-1, although in this case phosphorylated tyrosine residues are difficult to detect (23Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that oncogenic forms of Ras and Src can synergize in phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 (24Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Raf-1 kinase activity is also under the control of feedback mechanisms. Feedback regulation of Raf-1 involves MEK and ERK, but while the negative feedback mechanism depends on Ras (27Cherniack A.D.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others could demonstrate that Raf-1 is not only stimulated upon mitogenic activation of cells leading to cell cycle entry but also during mitosis (30Mamon H. Williams N. Wood K.

In fibroblast cells this mitotic activation of Raf-1 correlates with an increase in phosphorylation mainly at Ser residues (31Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol.

Moreover, it has been shown that in mitotically arrested T cells the Src-like kinase Lck can bind to Raf-1 and can increase its kinase activity (33Pathan N.I. Ashendel C.L. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30315-30317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study we further analyzed the mechanism of mitotic activation of Raf-1 in fibroblast cells. The data presented here demonstrate that mitotic activation of Raf-1 is independent of Ras. Furthermore, mitotic activation of Raf-1 results in a predominantly cytoplasmic active Raf-1. Moreover, activated Raf-1 does not lead to stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway in mitotic cells, indicating that mitotic Raf-1 uses another signaling pathway. The plasmids pcDNA3FLAG-Rafwt, pcDNA3FLAG-RafR89L (exchange of Arg89 to Leu) and pcDNA3FLAG-RafYY340/341FF (exchange of Tyr340/341 to Phe) have been described recently (29Zimmermann S. Rommel C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. and anti-active ERK antibody from Promega. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. 8–10 h after transfection the medium was changed to normal cultivation medium. After an additional 12 h cells were split 1:3 and incubated for a further 8 h. Then cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole (mitotic cells) or without nocodazole (exponentially growing cells) for 16 h. Exponentially growing cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA (10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml Trasylol (Bayer), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate). Mitotic cells were collected by gentle shake-off from nocodazole-treated plates, washed with PBS, and lysed in RIPA. Protein concentration of RIPA lysates was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal protein amounts were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged Raf proteins. Immunoprecipitates were washed seven times with RIPA and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmNaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Kinase assay was performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 10 μm nonradiolabeled ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 μg of recombinant kinase-inactive GST-MEK K97R for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 4× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%). Proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes that were dried, and the radioactivity incorporated into the substrate was evaluated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of immunoprecipitated Raf proteins was compared by probing the membranes with anti-FLAG antibody followed by detection with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purification of the recombinant kinase-inactive GST-MEK K97A used as substrate for Raf-1 has been described elsewhere (29Zimmermann S. Rommel C. Ziogas A. Lovric J. Moelling K. Radziwill G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA) supplemented with a mixture of phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described above. After incubation for 30 min on ice cells were homogenized with 80 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by two low speed centrifugation steps (1200 ×g for 10 min and 5000 × g for 10 min). After the second centrifugation step, the post-nuclear supernatants were adjusted to the same amount of protein followed by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min). The P100 fraction, which is obtained after ultracentrifugation, corresponds to whole cell membranes. If we would take for the Raf immunoprecipitation the same amount of protein from the cytosolic fraction S100 this would correspond to a small part of whole cell cytosol. Therefore, we decided to measure the Raf amount and activity in whole cell membranes and the whole cytosol. The high speed supernatant representing the cytoplasmic fraction S100 was adjusted to 1× RIPA and the pellet corresponding to the membrane fraction P100 was resuspended in 1× RIPA. Both fractions were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads, and immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG antibody. Cell cycle distribution experiments were performed with FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). A total 5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. 2 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, 30% PBS solution were added. The cell suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 800 μl of PBS, and checked microscopically. The cell suspension was mixed with 100 μl of RNase A (1 mg/ml) and 100 μl of propidium iodide (400 μg/ml), and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min. The ethanol-fixed and propidium iodide-stained cells were analyzed by FACS for their DNA content. Transfected cells were split and incubated for 8 h. Then they were treated without or with nocodazole for 16 h or were serum-starved and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF (Sigma). Cells were lysed in RIPA, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), and blotted to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were probed with the antibodies anti-ACTIVE ERK (Promega) to detect the activated forms of ERK or with anti-ERK C-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect the total amount of ERK. Then, the ERK proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham). In order to analyze the mechanism of Raf-1 activation in mitosis, COS7 cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by treatment with nocodazole. For control of synchronization the DNA content of mitotically arrested cells that detach from the cell culture dish was compared with that of exponentially growing untreated cells by flow cytometry analysis. Treatment of cells with nocodazole for 16 h resulted in an enrichment of cells in G2/M phase to approximately 90% compared with 15% in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1, a and b). Removal of nocodazole resulted in release of the reversible G2/M block, and as early as 2 h after a change to medium lacking nocodazole the cells showed a cell cycle distribution of exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1 d). To test whether ectopic expression of Raf-1 has an effect on cell cycle distribution, a Rat-1 cell line that expresses Raf-1 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter was analyzed. The induction of Raf-1 wild-type expression did not result in a significant difference in the cell cycle distribution of exponentially growing cells or mitotically arrested cells compared with uninduced cells (data not shown). In order to compare Raf-1 kinase activity of mitotic cells and exponentially growing cells a FLAG-tagged Raf-1 protein was expressed in COS7 cells. Transient transfection resulted in an at least a 10-fold overexpression of FLAG-Raf-1 compared with endogenous Raf-1 (data not shown). Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with αFLAG antibody, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant kinase-defective GST-MEK as a Raf-specific substrate (Fig. 2, upper panel). The amount of Raf-1 bound to the antibody was controlled by immunoblotting with the αFLAG antibody (Fig. 2, middle panel). Treatment of cells expressing Raf-1 wild-type (Rafwt) with nocodazole resulted in hyperphosphorylation as indicated by the reduced electrophoretic mobility of Raf-1 and in a 6-fold increase of its kinase activity compared with that of exponentially growing untreated cells (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). As expected the kinase-defective Raf mutant RafK375E used as a control showed no phosphorylation of GST-MEK (lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, as early as 1 h after removal of nocodazole the Raf-1 kinase activity was reduced to the level of untreated control cells, even though an electrophoretic mobility shift of Raf-1 was still visible (lane 5). Thus Raf-1 kinase activity and hyperphosphorylation did not correlate under these conditions. Similar results for mitotic activation of Raf-1 were also obtained using Rat-1 cells that inducibly expressed Raf-1 (data not shown). To demonstrate that mitotically activated Raf-1 did not only result in phosphorylation of MEK but also in its activation in vitro, coupled kinase assays were performed (37Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 38Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Immunecomplexed Raf-1 was incubated with wild-type GST-MEK and kinase-defective His-tagged ERK2 as a substrate specific for MEK. Also in this assay treatment of cells with nocodazole resulted in a 6–8-fold activation of Raf-1 compared with Raf-1 obtained from interphase cells (data not shown). The best characterized upstream activator of Raf-1 is Ras. Activated Ras directly interacts with the cytoplasmic inactive Raf-1 protein, which thereby is translocated to the plasma membrane where further activation steps take place. To study the role of Ras in mitotic activation of Raf-1 the effect of the dominant negative Ras mutant RasS17N on Raf-1 kinase activity was analyzed. Fold activation was determined by correction for the amount of Raf-1 protein present in the different immune complexes. RasS17N did not interfere with mitotic activation of Raf-1, whereas it blocked EGF-induced stimulation of Raf-1 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 6 and lanes 2 and 5). A further evidence that Raf/Ras interaction does not play a role in mitotic activation of Raf-1 was obtained by using the Raf mutant RafR89L, which cannot physically interact with activated Ras. The kinase activity of the Raf mutant RafR89L was elevated in mitotic cells to similar levels like the Raf-1 wild-type and this activation was not inhibited by coexpressed RasS17N (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 8, and 10). Furthermore, coexpression of the N terminus of Raf-1 (RafNT), which blocks the Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation, did not interfere with the mitotic activation of Raf-1 (Fig. 3, lane 13). In contrast, the EGF-dependent activation of Raf-1 was reduced by expression of RafNT (Fig. 3, lane 12). Taken together these data demonstrate that neither direct interaction between Ras and Raf-1 nor other Ras-dependent mechanisms are involved in mitotic activation of Raf-1. In the growth factor-dependent pathway Ras synergizes with Src and Src-like kinases in activation of Raf. Recently it has been published that in mitotic T cells the tyrosine protein kinase Lck can activate Raf-1 (33Pathan N.I. Ashendel C.L. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30315-30317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether tyrosine phosphorylation also plays a role in mitotic activation of Raf-1 in the fibroblast-like COS7 cells used in this study. The Raf mutant RafYY340/341FF in which the two neighboring tyrosine residues are changed to phenylalanines cannot be activated by tyrosine kinases of the Src family (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, comparelanes 5 and 7). RafYY340/341FF showed a reduced kinase activity in mitotic cells compared with Raf-1 wild-type (Fig. 4,lanes 2 and 6). Therefore, these two tyrosine residues may play some role in mitotic activation of Raf-1. However, the weak but significant mitotic activation of RafYY340/341FF suggests that a mechanism independent of the tyrosine residues also seems to be involved (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). As expected coexpression of activated Src led to further activation of Raf wild-type but not of RafYY340/341YY, because Src-dependent activation of Raf-1 depends on the tyrosine residues 340/341 (Fig. 4, compare lane 2 with 4 and lane 6 with8). To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of mitotic-activated Raf-1, phosphoamino acid analyses were performed. However, only serine phosphorylation and not tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected in mitotic activated Raf-1 (data not shown). This suggests that although the two tyrosine residues 340 and 341 seem to be involved in mitotic activation of Raf-1 only a very small subpopulation of Raf-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which is lower than the detection limit. Another explanation would be that phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues are essential for initial activation of Raf-1 but not for the maintenance of Raf-1 activity in mitotic cells. Most mechanisms known to be responsible for activation of Raf-1 involve translocation of the cytoplasmic inactive Raf-1 to the plasma membrane and result in a membrane-bound active Raf-1 (8Marais R. Marshall C.J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 101-125PubMed Google Scholar). Deactivation of Raf-1 leads to the return of the inactive Raf-1 protein to the cytoplasm (39Wartmann M. Hofer P. Turowski P. Saltiel A.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3915-3923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since mitotic activation of Raf-1 was independent of Ras, the cellular localization of active Raf-1 in mitotic cells was investigated. For this, cell fractionation experiments were performed. Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer and low and high speed centrifugation was performed to obtain a membrane fraction (P100) and a cytoplasmic fraction (S100). Protein amounts of the lysates from cells untreated and treated with nocodazole were matched before high speed centrifugation. The cytoplasmic fraction and the membrane fraction were immunoprecipitated with an αFLAG antibody, and the amount of immunoprecipitated Raf-1 was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 5,lower panel). The corresponding membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of nocodazole-treated and untreated cells contain similar amounts of Raf-1 protein (e.g. Fig. 5, lanes 1and 3 and lanes 2 and 4). Raf-1 kinase activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay using GST-MEK as substrate (Fig. 5, upper panel). In cells overexpressing Raf-1 wild-type the amount of Raf-1 protein was about three times higher in the cytoplasmic versus the membrane fraction (Fig. 5, lower panel, lanes 2 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 3). However, the mitotic Raf-1 kinase activity was 11-fold increased in the cytoplasmic fraction and 6-fold increased in the membrane fraction compared with the corresponding Raf-1 kinase activity in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 5, upper panel, compare lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 1 and 3). As expected coexpression of Raf wild-type with oncogenic RasG12V resulted in translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane correlating with a strong increase of Raf-1 kinase activity predominantly in the membrane fraction of exponentially growing cells (lanes 5 and 6). Overexpression of activated RasG12V in nocodazole-treated cells also resulted in membrane-bound active Raf-1 (lanes 7 and 8), implying that the activated Ras is overriding the otherwise Ras-independent mitotic activation of Raf-1. Next, the cellular localization of activated Raf-1 upon a Ras-dependent stimulation mechanism without overexpression of Ras was analyzed. For this, COS7 cells were treated with EGF, which activates Raf-1 in a Ras-dependent manner. EGF-mediated stimulation of Raf-1 resulted in an activated Raf-1 predominantly located at the plasma membrane (compare lanes 9 and 10), which clearly differed from the predominantly cytoplasmic location of mitotically activated Raf-1 (lane 4). Further evidence that mitotic activation of Raf-1 is independent of Raf-1 and resulted in a cytoplasmic active Raf-1 was obtained using the Raf mutant RafR89L. This Raf-1 mutant, which cannot interact with activated Ras, behaved similarly to Raf-1 wild-type and resulted in a cytoplasmic active mitotic Raf-1 (lane 14). Coexpression of RasG12V did not interfere with cellular distribution and activation of RafR89L in mitotic cells as well as in exponentially growing cells (lanes 15–18). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in contrast to the mitogenic activation mechanisms of Raf-1, mitotic activation of Raf-1 is independent of Ras and results in a cytoplasmic active Raf-1. As shown in Fig. 2 the increase in Raf-1 kinase activity was similar after treatment of cells with nocodazole or EGF. In the mitogenic pathway Raf-1 signals through MEK to ERK. To test whether the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was also stimulated in mitotic cells, ERK activity was analyzed in nocodazole-treated cells by immunoblotting using an ERK antibody that detects only the activated forms of ERK1 and ERK2. The total amount of ERK was similar in the different samples as controlled with an antibody recognizing the active as well as the inactive forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (data not shown). In mitotic cells overexpressing Rafwt no activated form of ERK was detectable (Fig. 6, lane 4). In contrast, in cells stimulated with EGF, ERK was strongly activated (lane 2), and even in starved and exponentially growing cells a low level of activated ERK was visible (lanes 1 and 3). Similar results were obtained with untransfected cells (data not shown). Ectopic expression of an epitope-tagged ERK2 resulted in a further increase of ERK activity in EGF-stimulated cells (lane 6), but also under these conditions no active ERK was detectable in mitotic cells (lane 8). In addition, no MEK1 activity could be detected in mitotic cells, whereas MEK1 activity was strongly increased after stimulation of cells with EGF (data not shown). These data demonstrate that mitotic activation of Raf-1 does not correlate with activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, suggesting that Raf-1 may use substrates other than MEK in mitotic cells. To test whether in mitotic cells there is a general block in Raf-1-dependent activation of ERK, COS7 cells were transfected with constitutively activated Raf-1 mutants, RafCT corresponding to the oncogenic v-Raf, and RafY340D mimicking Src-dependent activation. Expression of a constitutively activated Raf-1 resulted in activation of ERK as well as in nocodazole-treated cells, indicating that in this case the effect on down-regulation of ERK was overcome (data not shown). Raf-1, which was originally discovered as an oncogenic Ser/Thr protein kinase in retroviruses (1Moelling K. Heimann B. Beimling P. Rapp U.R. Sander T. Nature. 1984; 312: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is activated by mitogens and is involved in signal transduction in many cell systems. Raf-1 is activated by upstream regulators such as Ras and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Upon growth factor stimulation activated Ras binds to Raf-1 and translocates it to the plasma membrane where additional factors lead to full activation of Raf-1. Growth factor-activated Raf-1 is mainly phosphorylated on Ser and Thr in addition to weak phosphoryation on Tyr (19Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In cytokine-dependent activation, where the key regulators for Raf-1 are the non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases of the Src and Jak family, tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 is the major event (22Turner B.C. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Xia K. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Inhorn R.C. Barber D.L. Rose P.E. Lee R.S.

The synergism between Ras and Src for Raf-1 activation is essential in many systems (8Marais R. Marshall C.J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 101-125PubMed Google Scholar), but there are also exceptions. Upon stimualtion of the CD4 receptor in lymphocytes Raf-1 is activated by the Src-like kinase Lck independently of Ras (41Popik W. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described a positive feedback mechanism for Raf-1, which is independent of Ras, Src, and tyrosine phosphorylation (29Zimmermann S. Rommel C. Ziogas A. Lovric J. Moelling K. Radziwill G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), while a negative feedback is Ras-dependent (27Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus Raf-1 activity can be fine-tuned by an interplay of a number of various signals. In the present study we describe that mitotic activation of Raf-1 is independent of Ras in COS7 cells. Similar results were also obtained with a Rat-1 cell line inducibly expressing Raf-1 (data not shown). Ras-independent stimulation of Raf-1 is shown by several lines of evidence. The use of dominant negative RasS17N and dominant negative RafNT does not interfere with mitotic activation of Raf-1, whereas EGF-dependent stimulation of Raf-1 is inhibited. Furthermore, the Raf-1 mutant deficient for its binding ability to Ras, RafR89L, is still activated in mitotic cells. In contrast to most known activation mechanisms of Raf-1 that take place at the plasma membrane and lead to a membrane-bound active Raf-1, mitotic activation results in an activated Raf-1 predominantly located in the cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic localization of activated Raf-1 is consistent with its Ras-independent activation in mitotic cells. Although the fractionation experiments performed here cannot answer the question of where the initial activation of Raf-1 takes place, the observation of a cytoplasmic active Raf-1 implies some so far unknown biological relevance for mitotic Raf-1. In the present study the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 during mitosis was also analyzed. Kinases of the Src family that are able to directly phosphorylate Raf-1 can be activated in mitotic cells (42Laird A.D. Shalloway D. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently a Lck-dependent activation of Raf-1 has been shown in mitotic T cells (33Pathan N.I. Ashendel C.L. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30315-30317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In fibroblast cells used in our study, phosphorylation of Raf-1 only on Ser and Thr but not on Tyr has been detected (31Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26742-26745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Lovric J. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the Raf mutant RafYY340/341FF that cannot be stimulated by Src showed a reduced activity in mitotic cells compared with Raf-1 wild-type indicates that these two tyrosine residues and therefore tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in mitotic activation of Raf-1. However, the modest activation of RafYY340/341FF implies that an additional activation step for Raf-1 must exist in mitotic cells that is independent of the tyrosine residues 340/341. The level of Raf-1 activation during mitosis is similar to that of growth factor-dependent activation. Surprisingly, the usual substrate of Raf-1, MEK, is not activated in mitotic cells as is the case in mitogen-stimulated cells (42Laird A.D. Shalloway D. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The ERK activity is also down-regulated in mitotic cells (43Edelmann H.M.L. Kuhne C. Petritsch C. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Therefore, regulation mechanisms that involve mitotic active Raf-1 are independent of the MEK/ERK pathway. The mechanism of how MEK activation is uncoupled from Raf-1 activation is unknown. In mitotic cells MEK1 but not MEK2 can be phosphorylated and inhibited by the mitosis-specific Cdc2/cyclin B complex (42Laird A.D. Shalloway D. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition phosphatases may be induced during mitosis which specifically inactivate MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. It is of interest that overexpression of constitutively activated mutants of Raf-1 can overcome the effect of down-regulation of ERK in mitotic cells. Therefore, it seems that there exists a fine-tuned balance between activation and inactivation mechanisms for MEK/ERK. Nocodazole can mediate activation of phosphatases specific for MEK or ERK only if Raf-1 is still not activated. Recently, it has been shown that in detached cells growth factors can activate Ras and Raf-1 but not MEK and ERK (44Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Growth factor activation of MEK and ERK additionally requires cell adhesion. But also in this system the mechanisms that are involved in uncoupling of Ras/Raf-1 and MEK/ERK activation are unknown. Raf-1 can influence the cell cycle machinery at different points. In G0 cells Raf-1 is activated upon mitogenic stimulation of the cells and is involved via the MEK/ERK pathway in regulation of gene expression. During the G1/S transition of the cell cycle Raf-1 may play a role since it can bind via 14-3-3 to the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25A and stimulate its phosphatase activity (45Conklin D.S. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 46Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cdc25A can stimulate the Cdk2/cyclin E complex which leads to progression of the cell cycle. Recently, it has been shown that dependent on the strength of its kinase activity Raf-1 can induce cell proliferation or a growth arrest at G1 (47Lloyd A.C. Obermuller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 48Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 49Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). While low Raf-1 kinase activity induces expression of the G1-specific cyclin D leading to cell proliferation, high Raf-1 kinase activity results in expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP and thereby to growth arrest in G1. This G1 arrest depends at least in part on the active form of the tumor suppressor p53. COS cells and Rat-1 cells used in the present study did not show growth arrest after ectopic expression of oncogenic RasG12V. This can be explained by the presence of the SV40 large T antigen and polyoma T antigen, which were used for immortalization of these cell lines and can interact and inactivate p53. The function of Raf-1 at the G2/M transition and during mitosis is still not known. It has been discussed that mitotic phosphorylation of transcription factors is involved in repression of transcription observed in mitotic cells (42Laird A.D. Shalloway D. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). c-Myc and Ets-1, which are downstream targets of Raf-1 in growth factor-dependent signaling, are hyperphosphorylated specifically during mitosis. It would be of interest to determine whether mitotic Raf-1 is also involved in this mitotic phosphorylation of transcription factors. Interestingly, the presence of a cytoplasmic active Raf-1 in mitotic cells as shown in this study strongly suggests that under these conditions Raf-1 can interact with a different subset of substrates compared with the membrane-bound Raf-1 obtained after growth factor stimulation. It has been shown that the kinase activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 is down-regulated in mitotic cells and stimulated after removal of the mitotic block (42Laird A.D. Shalloway D. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Edelmann H.M.L. Kuhne C. Petritsch C. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, mitotic Raf-1 must signal independently of the MEK/ERK pathway. It would be of interest to know whether the positive regulator of mitosis, Cdc25C, can be stimulated by Raf-1, such as Cdc25A at the G1/S transition. Cdc25C stimulates the Cdc2/cyclin B complex, which is a mitotic activator of Src. Thereby Raf-1 could be indirectly involved in mitotic activation of Src. Another aspect is that signal transduction pathways are involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Mitotic phosphorylation of the oncoprotein 18 by Cdc2 and other still unknown kinases results in down-regulation of its activity, which is essential for the passage through mitosis (50Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this process mitotic Raf-1 also may play a role.

Receptor internalization has been extensively studied, and a number of the internalization/sorting signals involved in this event have been identified. Thus, both tyrosine- and leucine-based receptor internalization/sorting motifs have been described in several receptors (1Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Some receptors are recycled to the cell surface following ligand or protein kinase C (PKC)1-induced internalization and some cycle continuously between the plasma membrane and intracellular endosomal compartments. However, despite extensive studies on receptor sorting, it is still not known whether receptor recycling is a signal-mediated or a default sorting event (2Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell & Dev.

It has recently been described that the TCR is internalized and sorted to a degradative compartment after antibody or antigen stimulation (11Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12Luton F. Buferne M. Davoust J. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar, 13Luton F. Legendre V. Gorvel J.P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3140-3147PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, some studies have indicated that the TCR is not degraded following PKC-mediated internalization (14Minami Y. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, ligand-mediated TCR sorting is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation but independent of PKC and the CD3γ Leu-based sorting motif (16Lauritsen J.P.H. Christensen M.D. Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Ødum N. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1997; 161: 260-267Google Scholar, 17D'Oro U. Vacchio M.S. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D.

In contrast, PKC-mediated TCR internalization is dependent on the Leu-based sorting motif in CD3γ but independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (16Lauritsen J.P.H. Christensen M.D. Dietrich J.

The physiological role of PKC-mediated TCR internalization and recycling is not known.The aim for this study was to examine the functional state of recycled TCR and the mechanisms involved in TCR sorting following PKC-induced internalization. We find that following PKC-induced internalization, the TCR recycles to the cell surface in a functional state. Recycling was absolutely dependent on dephosphorylation of CD3γ but was independent upon actin polymerization, microtubules, and tyrosine phosphorylation. Even though the phosphorylation state of CD3γ controlled TCR recycling, no recycling signal was contained within the cytoplasmic tail of CD3γ. In addition, our results indicated that not only TCR cycling but also T cell responsiveness can be regulated by the phosphorylation state of CD3γ. Receptor internalization has been extensively studied, and a number of the internalization/sorting signals involved in this event have been identified. Thus, both tyrosine- and leucine-based receptor internalization/sorting motifs have been described in several receptors (1Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Some receptors are recycled to the cell surface following ligand or protein kinase C (PKC)1-induced internalization and some cycle continuously between the plasma membrane and intracellular endosomal compartments. However, despite extensive studies on receptor sorting, it is still not known whether receptor recycling is a signal-mediated or a default sorting event (2Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell & Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Likewise, the regulation of receptor recycling is poorly understood.

In this study, we found that specific single amino acid substitutions in H-NS caused an approximately 50% increase in flagellum rotational speed. In fluorescence anisotropy and chemical cross-linking assays, H-NS interacted with the flagellar torque-generating rotor protein FliG to form a complex with a K d of 2.15 μm. Furthermore, one of the altered H-NS proteins that exhibited high speed flagellum rotation bound FliG 50% tighter than wild-type H-NS.

Motility in many bacterial species is achieved by rotating surface-exposed organelles called flagella. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium about 50 genes are required for the biosynthesis and operation of these peritrichous, multicomponent structures. Gene expression is hierarchical, whereby one class of genes must be turned on before the next class can be expressed. At the top of this cascade lies the flhCD master operon, whose expression is required for the expression of all other flagellar genes (reviewed in Refs. 1Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 131-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar and 2Macnab R.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M.

Flagellar filament rotation is controlled by a motor embedded in the inner membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev.

Energy to drive this motor is derived from the transmembrane gradient of protons, or proton-motive force (4Larsen S.H. Adler J. Gargus J.J. Hogg R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1972; 239: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). When the motor rotates counterclockwise (CCW),1 flagella filaments form a tight bundle that propels the bacterium into a smooth swimming pattern. Conversely, during clockwise (CW) rotation, flagellar filaments separate, causing tumbling and directional reorientation (7Larsen S.H. Reader R.W. Kort E.N. Tso W.-W. Adler J. Nature. 1974; 249: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The E. coli flagellar motor consists of a MotA-MotB stator complex which forms a transmembrane proton channel (8Blair D.F.

All three rotor proteins are involved in the processes of flagellar assembly, switching, and rotation (13Yamaguchi S. Fujita H. Ishihara A. Aizawa S.-I. Macnab R.M. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The precise role of FliN is the least well defined, but it may participate in flagella protein-specific export and assembly (17Vogler A.P. Homma M. Irikura V.M. Macnab R.M. J.

It has been shown that hns insertion mutations render bacteria non-motile, suggesting that H-NS is a positive regulator of flagellar gene expression (19Hinton J.C.D. Santos D.S. Seirafi A.

In most instances, such as fimB (27Donato G.M. Lelivelt M.J. Kawula T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6618-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and proU (28Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) expression, H-NS acts as a direct transcriptional repressor. Here we characterized two independent hns point mutations,hnsT108I and hnsA18E, in relation to E. coli motility. Rather than displaying a non-motile behavior, strains carrying these mutations exhibited an unprecedented hypermotility. This novel hypermotile phenotype was a result of enhanced binding of mutant protein H-NST108I to the flagellar rotor, causing increased flagellar rotational speed. Table I lists all bacterial strains, plasmids, and phage used. Media consisted of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, LB agar, T broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl), and soft-agar (T broth, 0.3% agar) (Difco). Antibiotics were added to a final concentration of 100 μg (ampicillin), 20 μg (tetracycline), 20 μg (chloramphenicol), or 50 μg (kanamycin) per ml of medium. Isopropylthiogalactose was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. P1 vir generalized transductions were carried out as described previously (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Cultures were grown at 37 °C for protein purification and 30 °C for motility and flagella assays. AL127 was transformed with various plasmids. Fresh colonies were picked, inoculated onto low agar (0.3%) tryptone plates, and incubated at 30 °C. Swarm diameters were measured every 2–3 h, beginning 9 h post-inoculation. Differences in motility rates were calculated by comparing the swarm diameter of AL127 expressing an hns mutant plasmid relative to the same strain expressing a wild-type hns gene, on the same plate for three individual experiments. Strains were grown at 30 °C overnight in T broth with the appropriate antibiotics and then diluted 25-fold into fresh media and incubated until the A 600 reached 0.3–0.5. Cells from these cultures were incubated on polylysine-coated coverslips for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Bacteria-coated coverslips were dehydrated, critical point dried, attached to aluminum stubs, and sputter coated with gold:palladium. Bacterial flagella were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (Cambridge Stereo Scan S200, LEO Electron Microscopy, Inc.). Flagella were counted on at least 10 fields per strain. Tethering for the flagellar rotational bias and speed experiments was performed as described previously (30Bray D. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: diluted cultures were grown without inducer until the A 600reached 0.4–0.8; flagella were sheared with a Tissue Tearor model 985–370 (Biospec Products, Inc.); and a 1:100 dilution of anti-flagella antibody (36Silverman M. Simon M. Nature. 1974; 249: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) was used. Bacteria were observed by dark field microscopy, recorded to videotape, played back at 1/5 the speed, and scored using The Observer 3.1 videotape analysis system software (Noldus Information Technology). Typically, 30 individual cells were quantitated for 30 s each for CCW bias or 1 min each for flagellum rotational speed. E. coli wild-type H-NS and H-NST108I were each purified as described before (27Donato G.M. Lelivelt M.J. Kawula T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6618-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except the mutant protein lysate was washed from the double stranded DNA-cellulose column at a lower salt concentration (125 versus 250 mmNaCl) than the wild-type cell lysate. His-tagged FliG was nickel-affinity purified basically by the method of Toker and Macnab (31Toker A.S. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) from BL21(DE3) cultures harboring pET28NdefliG. Protein solutions were concentrated with Centricon-10 columns as instructed by the manufacturer (Amicon). Protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). H-NS was labeled with the thiol-reactive probe, fluorescein 5-maleimide, after reduction with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Labeled protein was separated from excess probe by G-25 Sephadex protein spin column purification (Boehringer Mannheim). Anisotropy was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 515 nm, respectively. Data was collected on a LS 50B Luminescence Spectrometer with FL Data Manager software (Perkin-Elmer). The K d was calculated as the FliG concentration corresponding to one-half the maximum anisotropy value on the H-NS-FliG binding curve. FliG was first attached to the heterobifunctional cross-linker, sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Pierce) by incubating for 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris (pH 7.5), H-NS (wild-type or T108I) was added, and the entire reaction was incubated another hour. The cross-linking reactions were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli denaturing sample buffer. Reactions containing equal amounts of each protein (5 μm) were electrophoresed on a 4–20% denaturing gradient gel (Jule Biotechnologies, Inc.) and visualized by Coomassie or Sypro-Orange (Molecular Probes) staining. Complexes were quantitated by volumetric integration on a Gel-Doc 1000 with Molecular Analyst 2.1 software (Bio-Rad). To ensure that we added equal amounts of wild-type H-NS and H-NST108I to FliG, we also quantitated free, uncomplexed H-NS protein. A C-terminal 6xHis-H-NS fusion protein was expressed from pDMG1 and purified under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). An emulsion of TiterMax (Vaxcel) and 300 μg of 6xHis-H-NS was used to inoculate and boost New Zealand White rabbits. Anti-H-NS antiserum obtained was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Anti-FliG antiserum was kindly provided by David Blair (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT) and used at a 1:7000 dilution. H-NS-FliG cross-linked complex reactions were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred, probed with antiserum, and detected as described previously (27Donato G.M. Lelivelt M.J. Kawula T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6618-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H-NS is a global regulator of E. coli gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 32Ussery D.W. Hinton J.C.D. Jordi B.J.A.M.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Mutations in hns have pleiotropic effects on the cell altering synthesis of a variety of gene products involved in numerous, diverse biological pathways (24Bertin P. Lejeune P. Laurent-Winter C. Danchin A. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 889-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Yamada H. Yoshida T. Tanaka K. Sasakawa C. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen.

In particular, transposon insertions in hns result in the loss of bacterial motility due to the lack of master operon flhCD expression (20Bertin P. Terao E. Lee E.H. Lejeune P. Colson C. Danchin A. Collatz E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5537-5540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated a set of random hnsmutations 2G. M. Donato and T. H. Kawula, manuscript in preparation. and determined their effect on motility. Plasmids carrying either no insertion (pACYC vector alone), a wild-type hns gene (pTHK116), orhns point mutations T108I (pMASS46–1), orA18E (pMASS73–4) were separately introduced into AL127, anE. coli hns2-tetR (34Kawula T.H.

Transformants were inoculated onto semi-solid agar plates and motility was determined by measuring the diameter of the bacterial swarm over time. Motility was classified into three distinct categories based on swarm size (Fig. 1). Strains lacking H-NS were non-motile. Motility was restored in these strains upon the addition of a wild-type hns clone in trans. However, the hnsT108I and hnsA18E mutations each conferred a greater than 2-fold increase (2.1 ± .21 and 2.5 ± .17, respectively) in swarm rate as compared with the wild-type strain. These data represent the first instance in which any E. coli mutation, hns or otherwise, resulted in a hypermotile phenotype.Table IBacteria, plasmids, and bacteriophage usedDescriptionSourceBacteria AL127RP437hns2-tetR; P1 transduction from AL90This study AL90hns2-tetRRef. 27Donato G.M.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 131-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In the absence of H-NS, flagellar genes are not expressed resulting in the loss of intact flagella and motility (20Bertin P. Terao E. Lee E.H. Lejeune P. Colson C. Danchin A. Collatz E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5537-5540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for the hypermotile phenotype that we observed with specific hns point mutations was that these alleles affected flagella biosynthesis and/or assembly. To test this hypothesis, we examined strains expressing differenthns alleles by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Visually, there was no discernible difference in cell size or shape or flagellum length or distribution between strains carrying a wild-typehns allele (Fig. 2 A) or either hnsmutation (Fig. 2, B and C). There was also no statistical difference in the average number of flagella/cell between the control and hnsA18E strains and only a very slight increase expressed from the hnsT108I allele (Table II). We concluded that the increased motility rates exhibited by the hnsT108I and hnsA18E alleles were not due to an alteration in the number or construction of functional flagella.Table IIQuantitation of bacterial flagellationStrain NamePlasmidNumber flagella/cellNameDescriptionAL127(hns2-tetR)pTHK116Wild-typehns3.1AL127pMASS46–1hnsT108I3.8AL127pMASS73–4hnsA18E3.1In all plasmids hns gene driven byhns-1 promoter point mutation (34Kawula T.H.

Motion is an alternating series of smooth runs (CCW rotation) and abrupt directional changes called tumbles (CW rotation) (6Berg H.C. Brown D.A. Nature. 1972; 239: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). It is possible that the hnsT108I and hnsA18E mutations caused a shift in flagellar rotational bias resulting in hypermotility. Strains bearing hns mutant alleles may “run” (versustumble) a higher percentage of the time than their wild-type counterparts. To address this issue, we performed tethering experiments (30Bray D. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) to compare the rotational bias of strains containing wild-type or mutant hns genes. In this assay, individual cells harboring plasmid-based hns alleles were tethered to a microscope slide via an anti-flagella antibody. The spinning direction of cell bodies was observed and bias was calculated to be the proportion of the time cells spent rotating CCW (Table III).Table IIIDetermination of flagellar rotational behaviorStrainPlasmidFlagellar rotational biasNameDescriptionNameDescriptionmean ± S.E.RP437Wild-typeNANA.85 ± .04RBB1041Δ(cheA-cheZ)NANA.99 ± .003RP1616Δ(cheZ)6725NANA0 ± 0AL127hns2-tetRpTHK116Wild-typehns.85 ± .03AL127hns2-tetRpMASS46–1hnsT108I.60 ± .04AL127hns2-tetRpMASS73–4hnsA18E.72 ± .05AL127hns2-tetRpMASS36–1hnsR93H.66 ± .03AL127hns2-tetRpMASS49–1124 Stop.76 ± .04Bias defined as fraction of time cells rotating CCW.

NA, not applicable. Wild-type cells generally spin CCW with occasional pauses and direction reversals (36Silverman M. Simon M. Nature. 1974; 249: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both of the wild-type controls (Table III, lines 1 and 4) adopted this spinning mode, rotating CCW 85% of the time. Additional controls included a “gutted” strain (RBB1041) which is deleted for the chemotaxis genes and spins only in the default CCW direction (37Conley M.P. Wolfe A.J. Blair D.F. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5190-5193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (line 2), and a CW-biasedcheZ mutant (RP1616) (38Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 45-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which only tumbles (line 3). Strains with hns mutant alleles T108I orA18E (lines 5 and 6) did not favor a higher running (CCW) bias over wild-type strains. In fact, these strains along with two other hns mutations which did not exhibit a hypermotile phenotype (data not shown), tumbled or paused slightly more frequently than wild-type cells (lines 7 and 8). Thus, the hns mutations did not affect the function of the chemotaxis apparatus or the mechanism of flagellar switching. Flagella propel bacteria by rotating motor-driven helical filaments (35Berg H.C. Anderson R.A. Nature. 1973; 245: 382-386Crossref Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 36Silverman M. Simon M. Nature. 1974; 249: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) whereby swimming speed is directly related to flagellar rotational speed (39Jones C.J. Aizawa S.-I. Adv. Microbial Physiol. 1991; 32: 109-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free-swimming bacteria can transverse 20–60 μm/s in liquid media (40Macnab R.M. Aizawa S.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 51-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas tethered bacteria can rotate their cell bodies 2–9 revolutions/s (36Silverman M. Simon M. Nature. 1974; 249: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We postulated that the hnsT108I and hnsA18Emutations caused hypermotile bacterial swimming behavior by directly increasing the speed at which individual flagella rotated. Once again, we employed bacterial tethering to measure rotational speed using a host strain (AL128) containing a cheA-cheZ deletion as well as an hns2-tetR mutation. This strain enabled us to survey cells that were all rotating in one direction, CCW, without the complications of switching. Rotational speed data (Table IV) were accumulated from cells of the same size and tethered at the same point to maintain similar drag coefficients, overall cell geometry, and load. The controls (Table IV,lines 1 and 2) displayed similar rotational speeds regardless of the location of hns (chromosome- or plasmid-based). In contrast, the addition of either hnspoint mutation in trans (lines 3 and 4) resulted in significant (p < .005 and p < .025, respectively) increases in the speed of the tethered cell body. We concluded that hnsA18E and hnsT108I accelerated flagellar speeds 44–62% (Table IV) over wild-type levels without affecting flagellar assembly (Fig. 2 and Table II) or switching (Table III). This direct effect on flagellum rotational speed likely caused the original swarm plate hypermotile phenotype displayed by these hns mutant alleles.Table IVDetermination of flagellar rotational speedStrainPlasmidFlagellar rotational speedNameDescriptionNameDescriptionrpmRBB1041Δ(cheA-cheZ)NANA268 ± 15AL128Δ(cheA-cheZ)pTHK116Wild-type233 ± 19hns2-tetRhnsAL128Δ(cheA-cheZ),pMASS46–1hnsT108I377 ± 34hns2-tetRAL128Δ(cheA-cheZ),pMASS73–4hnsA18E335 ± 27hns2-tetRData represent mean ± S.E. of 25–30 cells per strain.NA, not applicable.

Flagellar rotation is driven by a reversible rotary motor anchored in the inner membrane at the base of the flagellum (reviewed in Refs. 1Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev.

The motor consists of a stator (MotA and MotB) and a rotor (FliG, FliM, and FliN). The three rotor proteins interact with each other (11Marykwas D.L. Schmidt S.A. Berg H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 564-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Tang H. Braun T.F. Blair D.F. J. Mol.

All three proteins are involved in flagellar assembly, switching, and rotation (13Yamaguchi S. Fujita H. Ishihara A. Aizawa S.-I. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Irikura V.M. Kihara M. Yamaguchi S. Sockett H. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since FliG is the motor protein most involved in speed and torque generation (12Tang H. Braun T.F. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Irikura V.M. Kihara M. Yamaguchi S. Sockett H. Macnab R.M. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we examined the binding between H-NS and FliG in fluorescence anisotropy assays. This technique quantitates protein-protein interactions by measuring the change in anisotropy of a fluorescently labeled protein upon the addition of a second unlabeled protein (44Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of purified N terminus His-tagged FliG was added to fluorescein-labeled H-NS and emission anisotropy of the fluorophore was assessed (Fig. 3). As the concentration of FliG increased the anisotropy values also increased, reflecting the formation of a slower rotating complex and protein binding. The leveling off of the curve at higher FliG concentrations demonstrated protein binding saturation (45Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We calculated the dissociation constant (K d) for the H-NS-FliG complex to be 2.15 ± .25 μm, well within the range of biologically relevant protein associations. These data represent the first direct biochemical evidence that H-NS binds to FliG and forms a complex with the flagellar motor machinery. Since wild-type H-NS bound FliG in the anisotropy studies (Fig. 3), we wanted to determine if the mutant H-NST108I also bound FliG. A difference in binding affinities between FliG and wild-type or mutant H-NS protein might account for the hypermotile swarm phenotype seen with the mutant. We compared binding capabilities of each of these proteins to FliG by chemical cross-linking. Equal amounts of either wild-type or T108I H-NS were cross-linked to FliG. H-NS-FliG complexes were trapped, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained (Fig. 4 A). Tandem Western blots were also performed on identical reactions with anti-H-NS (Fig. 4 B) and anti-FliG antiserums (Fig. 4 C) to confirm that the complexes contained both proteins. Several conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, in agreement with previous work (11Marykwas D.L. Schmidt S.A. Berg H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996;"

We recently isolated an importin α homologue from rice (rice importin α1) and demonstrated that transcription of the gene is down-regulated by light in rice leaves. To address the function of rice importin α1 in the process of nuclear import of proteins, we performed in vitro binding and nuclear import assays. The rice importin α1 showed specific binding to fusion proteins containing either monopartite or bipartite NLSs, but not to a fusion protein containing a Matα-2-type NLS, suggesting that there exists selective binding of rice importin α1 to different plant NLSs. The rice importin α1 is also capable of forming a complex with mouse importin β and NLS protein in vitro. An in vitro nuclear import assay using permeabilized HeLa cells revealed that rice importin α1, in conjunction with other vertebrate transport factors, mediates the nuclear envelope docking of NLS proteins and their subsequent translocation into the nucleus.

Due to the existence of a nuclear envelope that sequesters genomic DNA and separates nuclear and cytoplasmic activities, eukaryotic cells have established an active and strictly regulated, bi-directional nucleocytoplasmic transport system, by which macromolecules larger than 40 kDa in granular size enter and exit the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)1 (1Yoneda Y.

Among them, the best characterized pathway is nuclear import of proteins bearing basic nuclear localization signals (NLSs). NLSs consist of either a short stretch of 3–5 basic amino acids or two basic domains separated by a spacer, referred to as monopartite and bipartite NLSs, respectively. Using an in vitro nuclear import assay with digitonin-permeabilized vertebrate cells, in conjunction with other biochemical techniques, a set of transport factors required for the NLS-mediated nuclear import of proteins has been identified and extensively characterized. NLS-mediated import has been described as a multistep process: NLS recognition and pore docking, translocation through the NPC, and release of the cargo from the inner site of the pore (10Powers M.A. Forbes D.F.

Importin α recognizes and binds to the NLS of a nuclear protein, forming a stable pore-targeting complex (PTAC) in the cytoplasm (13Imamto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose T. Matsubae M.

Translocation of the docked PTAC into the nucleus is an energy-dependent process, mediated by the small GTPase, Ran, along with a homodimeric factor known as p10 or NTF2 (19Melchior F.B. Paschal J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Merkle T. Haizel T. Matsumoto T. Harter K. Dallmann G. Nagy F.

Biol. 1994; 24: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and Ran-binding protein (RanBP1) homologues from Arabidopsis have also been identified (40Haizel T. Merkle T. Pay A. Fefes E. Nagy F. Plant J. 1997; 11: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, there is currently no direct experimental evidence demonstrating the involvement of these plant homologues in the process of nuclear import of proteins. This is due mainly to the lack of an appropriate plant experimental system in which a specific transport factor can be characterized. Recently, two plant in vitro assays for nuclear import of proteins have been developed using permeabilized, evacuolated protoplasts from tobacco BY-2 cells (34Hicks G.R. Smith H.M.S. Lobreaux S. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1337-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Merkle T. Leclerc D. Marshallsay C. Nagy F. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In these assays, however, in vitro import did not require exogenous cytosol and ATP, suggesting that all necessary factors are retained within the permeabilized protoplasts in sufficient amounts for efficient nuclear import. More recently, Broder et al. (42Broder Y.C. Stanhill A. Zakai N. Friedler A. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that plant cell extract can support the transport of NLS-BSA into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, presenting an heterologous experimental system in which to study specific plant factors putatively involved in the nuclear import of proteins. We previously identified a rice cDNA encoding an importin α homologue, tentatively named rice importin α1, and demonstrated that transcription of the gene is down-regulation by light in rice leaves (36Shoji K. Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Uchimiya H. Miyao M. Yamamoto N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that rice importin α1 selectively binds to different types of plant NLSs and mediates the nuclear import of NLS substrates in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. To generate a GST-NLS-GFP fusion protein, an oligonucleotide encoding an appropriate NLS peptide was coupled to the 5′-end of the GFP gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pS65T-C1 (CLONTECH) as template DNA. The 5′-end primer used for the PCR incorporates an EcoRI site at the 5′-end followed in frame by the NLS-encoding nucleotide sequence in the middle. The 3′-end primer incorporates aXhoI site at its 5′-end. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned in frame at the 3′-end of the GST in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The NLSs and the corresponding 5′-end oligonucleotide primers used for the PCR are as follows: 1) SV40 T-NLS (T-NLS, monopartite type): CTPPKKKRKV/5′-ACGGAATTC TGCACCCCGCCGAAAAAAAAACGCAAAGTGATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGGA-3′; 2) SV40 T-NLS mutant (Tm-NLS): CTPPKTKRKV/5′-ACGGAATTC TGCACCCCGCCGAAAACCAAACGCAAAGTGATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGGA-3′; 3) NLS of the maize Opaque-2 transcription factor (O2-NLS, bipartite type): MPTEERVRKRKESNRESARRSRYRKAAHLKC/5′-ACGGAATTC ATGCCGACCGAAGAACGCGTGCGCAAACGCAAAGAAAGCAACCGCGAAAGCGCGCGCCGCAGCCGCTATCGCAAAGCGGCGCACCTGAAA TGCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTT CACTGGAGTT-3′; 4) NLS of the maize transcription factor R (R-NLS, Matα-NLS type): CYMISEALRKAIGKR/5′-ACGGAATTC TGCTATATGATCAGCGAAGCGCTGCGCAAAGCGATCGGCAAACGCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGGAGTT-3′. The NLS-encoding sequences are underlined, and the endonuclease restriction sites are indicated by boldface. The 3′-end primer used was 5′-ACGCTCGAGTTATTTGTAGAGCTCATCCATGCCATGTGT-3′. To generate GST-rice importin α1, a fragment of rice importin α1 cDNA with an artificial EcoRI site at the 5′-end was generated by PCR and inserted between the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEX-6p-1 to obtain an in-frame translation fusion with GST. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by growing in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–6 h at 20 °C, and the proteins were purified essentially according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All the procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) were included in the solutions throughout the purification procedures. The GST portion of the GST-rice importin α1 fusion protein was cleaved by incubation of the fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin with 80 units/ml resin of PrecissionTM protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 5 °C. The PrecissionTM protease is a recombinant fusion protein with GST and hence can be easily removed by glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The purified proteins were concentrated by Millipore Ultrafree-MC (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and finally suspended in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.3) containing 1 mm EGTA and 1 mm DTT.

In vitro protein binding was examined by native gel electrophoresis according to the method of Safer (47Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 20 pmol of each protein was mixed in 15 μl of transport buffer (TB) (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) supplemented with 250 mm sucrose and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 7.5 or 9% polyacrylamide gels were run in the presence of 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EGTA in both the gels and the running buffer. In some experiments, the protein band was excised from the native gel, placed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with stacking gel, overlaid with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresis was carried out. HeLa cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Digitonin-permeabilized cells were prepared as described previously (48Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 49Miyamoto Y.

A 10-μl sample solution containing 1 μl of GST-NLS-GFP (0.2 μg/μl) and appropriate transport factors was diluted with TB. For the nuclear-binding assay, the incubation was performed on ice for 20 min in the presence of rice importin α1 (6 pmol) and mouse importin β (6 pmol), the concentration of which was adjusted with TB containing 2% BSA. For the nuclear import assay, the incubation was performed at 25 °C for 20 min in the presence of rice importin α1 (12 pmol), mouse importin β (3 pmol), GDP-Ran (42 pmol), 1 mm ATP, ATP regeneration system (20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate), and 1 mm GTP, the concentration of which was adjusted with TB containing 2% BSA. After incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in TB. NLS-GFP was detected by Axiophoto microscopy (Xarl Zeiss, Inc.). SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Concentration of proteins was determined by the method of Bradford (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and BSA as the standard. Protein import into the nucleus is initiated by recognition of and binding to the NLS of a nuclear protein by importin α in the cytoplasm. To address the function of rice importin α1, we investigated whether rice importin α1 could bind to an NLS in vitro. We chose three representative plant NLSs that were previously used for in vitro binding studies by Smith et al. (33Smith H.M.S. Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar): (i) T-NLS, the simian virus 40 large T-antigen NLS (a monopartite type NLS); (ii) O2-NLS, identified in the maize transcription factor Opaque-2 (a bipartite type NLS); (iii) R-NLS, identified in the maize transcription factor R (a Matα 2-type NLS). We also used Tm-NLS, a point mutant of the T-NLS, in which the sixth lysine residue of the T-NLS was replaced by a threonine, as a negative control. We inserted these NLS sequences between GST and GFP using recombinant DNA techniques to generate GST-NLS-GFP fusion proteins, rather than chemically conjugating NLSs to BSA protein. This would presumably result in fusion proteins that would function as more natural NLS substrates. For convenience in this paper, we have designated these NLS-GFP fusion proteins: T-, O2-, R-, and Tm-GFP, respectively. The ability of the rice importin α1 to complex with NLS-GFP was assessed using native gel electrophoresis, in which complex formation between two proteins gives a new band with a mobility different from that of either protein alone. The rice importin α1 and each of the NLS-GFPs migrate as single bands on the nondenaturing gel as shown in Fig. 1, lanes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. A mixture of the rice importin α1 with either T-GFP or O2-GFP gives a major new band of retarded mobility with little of either unbound protein at the position of the control (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 7). In contrast, a mixture of the rice importin α1 with either R-GFP or Tm-GFP gives no new visible bands, with migration of each proteins as in the control (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 9). The complex of O2-GFP and rice importin α1 gives almost indistinguishable mobility relative to O2-GFP alone on the gel. However, complex formation between the two proteins is apparent, as all of the rice importin α1 shifted upward, giving a much darker band. In addition, we also confirmed this using the GST-rice importin α1 fusion protein (GST-uncleaved), which gives a clear difference in mobility between the O2-GFP and its complex with rice importin α1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the rice importin α1 selectively binds to T-NLS and O2-NLS, but not to R-NLS. The binding was NLS-specific as the rice importin α1 did not bind to Tm-GFP (Fig. 1, lane 5) that has been shown to be nonfunctional. Importin α simultaneously binds to NLS substrate at one site and importin β via its N-terminal, importin β-binding domain, forming the PTAC in the cytoplasm. We examined the interaction between rice importin α1 and mouse importin β and the effects of T-GFP on the interaction (Fig. 2 A). As a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel did not give a clear separation for the mixture of rice importin α1 and mouse importin β (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), a 9% polyacrylamide gel was run for this particular mixture (Fig. 2 A, lane 10). A weak binding between the two proteins was observed as appearance of a minor intermediate band between the bands of the rice importin α1 and mouse importin β with migration of each protein as in the control (Fig. 2 A, lane 10, arrowhead). There was some smearing of both of the two proteins toward the position of the complex, suggesting partial dissociation during electrophoresis. Addition of T-GFP to the mixture resulted in formation of a large complex with lower mobility on the gel (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) relative to the complex consisting of rice importin α1 and T-GFP (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). SDS-PAGE of the band corresponding to the large complex on the native gel revealed that the complex contained rice importin α1, mouse importin β, and T-GFP, demonstrating that a complex assembly (PTAC) occurred in the mixture (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, addition of T-GFP to the mixture tended to increase the binding of importin β to importin α, as the unbound importin β decreased correspondingly. These results suggest that NLS substrate may promote or stabilize the interaction between rice importin α1 and mouse importin β, and more importantly, that binding of rice importin α1 to mouse importin β is stable only when all the three proteins are present in the mixture. It has been shown that mouse importin α associates directly with mouse importin β in a 1:1 ratio, even in the absence of NLS substrate (43Imamto N. Shimamoto T. Kose T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, much higher affinity between these two proteins, in contrast to that between rice importin α1 and mouse importin β, was observed on the native gel (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). Roughly judged on darkness of unbound importin β band relative to that of control on the gels, more than 50% of importin β bound to mouse importin α, in contrast to about 5–10% of that bound to rice importin α1. The low affinity between rice importin α1 and mouse importin β might be ascribed to the heterogeneity of their origin, in this case one from plant and the other from mouse. Interestingly, even with both importins from the same species, T-GFP was still able to enhance the binding of mouse importin β to mouse importin α, as the unbound importin β decreased correspondingly (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). The mixture of mouse importin β and T-GFP did not result in formation of any complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 9), demonstrating that the PTAC was formed via rice importin α1 binding with both mouse importin β and T-GFP. No complex assembly was observed when Tm-GFP was substituted for T-GFP (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). The PTAC, formed in the cytoplasm by binding of importin α/β heterodimer to NLS protein, docks to the cytoplasmic surface of the NPC via importin β binding to nucleoporins and is then transported as a single entity into the nucleus through a process mediated by the GTPase, Ran. To assess the functional activity of rice importin α1 in the process of nuclear import of proteins, we performed an in vitro nuclear import assay. As has been shown, a sufficient amount of transport factors are retained in permeabilized plant protoplasts to allow efficient nuclear import of proteins to take place (34Hicks G.R. Smith H.M.S. Lobreaux S. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1337-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Merkle T. Leclerc D. Marshallsay C. Nagy F. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), making plant protoplasts unsuitable for characterization of putative transport factors. Therefore, we employed a vertebrate assay system using permeabilized HeLa cells, in combination with vertabrate transport factors, in which the rice importin α1 was substituted for vertabrate importin α. T-GFP and Tm-GFP were used as transport substrates, as positive and negative controls, respectively. In the nuclear binding assay as shown in the Fig. 3 A, the mouse importin β alone was not sufficient to direct the substrate to the nuclear rim (Fig. 3 A, panel c). However, addition of the rice importin α1 in the mixture resulted in efficient accumulation of T-GFP at the nuclear rim (Fig. 3 A, panel a). In contrast, such accumulation did not occur when Tm-GFP was used as substrate (Fig. 3 A, panel e). In the presence of rice importin α1 in the transport solution, T-GFP was translocated efficiently into the nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panel a). The translocation of the substrate was rice importin α-dependent (Fig. 3 B, panel c) and NLS-specific (Fig. 3 B, panel e). Omission of Ran-GDP or depletion of ATP by hexokinase from the transport solution abolished translocation of the substrate into the nucleus (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the rice importin α1 can replace vertebrate importin α in the mediation of nuclear import of NLS substrates, implying that rice importin α1 functions as a NLS receptor in the process of nuclear import of proteins. In agreement with the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 1), rice importin α1 mediated nuclear import of O2-GFP, but not R-GFP, into the nucleus in the import assay (data not shown). Although recent efforts have led to the identification of a number of putative nuclear import factors from plants, no direct functional evidence has been presented. This is due mainly to the lack of an appropriate plant in vitro system in which a putative nuclear transport factor can be characterized. Recently, two groups have independently developed a plant in vitro system for the study of nuclear import of proteins utilizing evacuolated tobacco protoplasts (34Hicks G.R. Smith H.M.S. Lobreaux S. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1337-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Merkle T. Leclerc D. Marshallsay C. Nagy F. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and with which some unique features of plant nuclear import of proteins have been successfully elucidated. However, it has been found that a sufficient amount of transport factors are retained in the permeabilized protoplasts to allow for efficient protein import into the nucleus without the addition of any exogenous factors. This makes such an assay unsuitable for elucidating the role of a specific factor in the process of nuclear import of proteins. For this reason, we employed a vertebrate in vitro nuclear transport assay system to elucidate the function of rice importin α1, which we had identified previously. We demonstrated that rice importin α1, in combination with vertebrate transport factors, can specifically bind to functional NLS-containing proteins and direct them into the nucleus. These data present direct evidence, strongly suggesting that rice importin α1 functions as an NLS receptor in the NLS-mediated nuclear import of proteins within living cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a plant importin α homologue has been directly demonstrated to be functional in the nuclear import of proteins. Our in vitro binding assay revealed that rice importin α1 specifically binds to T-NLS and O2-NLS protein, but not to R-NLS protein. This appears to be contrary to previous binding studies by Smith et al. (33Smith H.M.S. Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in which an importin α homologue of Arabidopsis bound to all the three types of plant NLSs conjugated to BSA. This discrepancy might be due to the different binding assays employed in the experiments. However, this is unlikely, because in both the assays it was clearly shown that the importin α homologues specifically bound to the functional NLS, but not to nonfunctional NLS mutants. Rather, this discrepancy seems likely to suggest the existence of diversity among different importin α homologues with respect to NLS recognition. To date a number of importin α homologues have been identified from a wide range of species, including vertebrates, yeast, and plants. In fact, in many species multiple family members have been identified. Previous in vitro binding studies and nuclear import assays in vertebrate cells have suggested the existence of different specificities of NLS recognition even between importin α homologues of the same origin. For example, in human cells, three importin α family proteins have been identified, namely, Rch1, NPI-1, and Qip1. These human importin α homologues have been shown to be expressed differentially in different tissues and cell lines (52Tsuji L. Takumi T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 53Nadler S.G. Tritschler D. Haffar O.K. Blake J. Bruce A. Cleaveland J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4310-4315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and also have differential affinities for distinct types of NLSs (46Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 49Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have shown in a previous paper (36Shoji K. Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Uchimiya H. Miyao M. Yamamoto N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that the transcription level of rice importin α1 is light-regulated. All these previous and present data together suggest that the nuclear import of proteins is regulated at multiple levels, including the tissue-specific expression of importin α, as well as NLS-selective recognition by different importin α homologues. We have shown previously that nuclear protein forms a stable PTAC with importin α and importin β heterodimer in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear pore binding (14Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8559-8565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether rice importin α1, like vertebrate and yeast importin αs, assembles to form a complex with NLS substrate and importin β, we performed an in vitro binding assay. As shown in the Fig. 2, rice importin α1 bound directly to mouse importin β. However, the affinity was fairly low, compared with that between importin α and importin β of mouse (Fig. 2 C and Ref. 43Imamto N. Shimamoto T. Kose T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We would ascribe the low affinity between rice importin α1 and mouse importin β to the heterogeneity of their origins. Although rice importin α1 shares about 48% identity in amino acid sequence with mouse importin α over the entire length, this may not be sufficient for rice importin α1 to form a tight complex with mouse importin β. In the presence of NLS substrate, a large complex composed of rice importin α1, mouse importin β, and the T-GFP formed in the mixture (Fig. 2 A, lane 6, and Fig. 2 B). Mouse importin β alone did not bind to NLS substrate (Fig. 2 A, lane 9), indicating that the complex formed via rice importin α1 binding simultaneously to the NLS at one site and to importin β at another site. Moreover, the presence of the NLS-substrate in the mixture appeared to enhance the binding affinity between importin α and importin β (Fig. 2 A, lane 6, and Fig. 2 C, lane 4), suggesting that the NLS substrate may promote or stabilize the complex formation. It has been reported that the yeast importin β homologue, Kap 95, enhances binding of the yeast importin α homologue, Kap 60, to NLS-substrate, forming a more stable protein complex (29Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Previously, we also found that mouse importin α/β complex binds at the nuclear rim only in the presence of the nuclear import substrate (43Imamto N. Shimamoto T. Kose T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that the protein complex is most stable when all the PTAC components, importin α, importin β, and the NLS substrate, are present in the complex. These findings suggest a cooperative interaction between NLSs and NLS receptor (importin α/β), in which the importin β enhances binding of importin α to NLSs (29Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), and the NLSs, in turn, enhance binding affinity between importin α and β (present study), consequently leading to formation of stable PTAC in the cytoplasm and docking the PTAC to the NPC (43Imamto N. Shimamoto T. Kose T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Employing the vertebrate system in the present work allowed us to demonstrate that rice importin α1 is capable of mediating nuclear import of NLS-substrate into the nucleus, a strong implication of rice importin α1 as a plant NLS receptor in the process of nuclear import of proteins. We found that, in comparison with mouse importin α, a much higher concentration of rice importin α1 (about four times that of mouse importin α) is necessary to obtain equivalent transport. This could be accounted for by the low affinity between rice importin α1 and mouse importin β. However, the compatibility of rice importin α1 with vertebrate transport factors in our assay suggests that the nuclear import pathway for NLS proteins is well conserved between vertebrate and plant."
https://openalex.org/W2075899920,"The human secretory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (secretory IL-1Ra) gene is controlled through three lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive promoter elements, one of which was identified as an NF-κB binding site. Sequence analysis of the secretory IL-1Ra promoter identified a potential PU.1 binding site located between positions −80 and −90 on the complementary strand overlapping the NF-κB site. Gel shift analysis using this potential binding site with nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 macrophages demonstrated the formation of three complexes, one LPS-inducible and two constitutive. The inducible factor was identified as NF-κB, and the constitutive factors were identified as PU.1 and GA-binding protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of the −93 to −79 promoter region demonstrated that mutation of either the NF-κB 5′-half site or the PU.1/GA-binding protein half-site alone did not significantly decrease LPS responsiveness. However, a mutation that disrupted the binding of all three factors resulted in a 50% decrease in LPS responsiveness. A second PU.1 binding site centered at −230 was identified by gel shift and supershift assays. Mutation of the core GGAA region resulted in a 50% decrease in LPS-responsive promoter activity. Mutation of both the distal and proximal LPS response elements led to an almost complete loss of responsiveness. These data therefore suggest that the regulation of IL-1Ra gene expression is a complex event involving the interactions of three different transcription factors with a single cis-acting element and that the two PU.1 binding sites are the major response elements for LPS-induced IL-1Ra gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2006943966,"Previously, we characterized a DNA-binding protein, HS2NF5, that bound tightly to a conserved region within hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) of the human β-globin locus control region (LCR) (Lam, L. T., and Bresnick, E. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 32421–32429). The β-globin LCR controls the chromatin structure, transcription, and replication of the β-globin genes. We have now purified HS2NF5 to near-homogeneity from fetal bovine thymus. Two polypeptides of 56 and 61 kDa copurified with the DNA binding activity. The two proteins bound to the LCR recognition site with an affinity (3.1 nm) and specificity similar to mouse erythroleukemia cell HS2NF5. The amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of purified HS2NF5 revealed it to be identical to the murine homolog of the suppressor of hairless transcription factor, also known as recombination signal binding protein Jκ or C promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1). The CBF1 site within HS2 resides near sites for hematopoietic regulators such as GATA-1, NF-E2, and TAL1. An additional conserved, high affinity CBF1 site was localized within HS4 of the LCR. As CBF1 is a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, we propose that Notch may modulate LCR activity during hematopoiesis. Previously, we characterized a DNA-binding protein, HS2NF5, that bound tightly to a conserved region within hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) of the human β-globin locus control region (LCR) (Lam, L. T., and Bresnick, E. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 32421–32429). The β-globin LCR controls the chromatin structure, transcription, and replication of the β-globin genes. We have now purified HS2NF5 to near-homogeneity from fetal bovine thymus. Two polypeptides of 56 and 61 kDa copurified with the DNA binding activity. The two proteins bound to the LCR recognition site with an affinity (3.1 nm) and specificity similar to mouse erythroleukemia cell HS2NF5. The amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of purified HS2NF5 revealed it to be identical to the murine homolog of the suppressor of hairless transcription factor, also known as recombination signal binding protein Jκ or C promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1). The CBF1 site within HS2 resides near sites for hematopoietic regulators such as GATA-1, NF-E2, and TAL1. An additional conserved, high affinity CBF1 site was localized within HS4 of the LCR.

Transcription of the β-globin genes is controlled by a powerful genetic element called the β-globin locus control region (LCR).1 The human LCR consists of four erythroid-specific DNase I HSs, 10–50-kilobase pairs upstream of the β-globin genes (1Tuan D. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The LCR controls the chromatin structure, transcriptional activity, and replication timing of the β-globin locus (3Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 4Forrester W.C. Takegawa S. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Groudine M.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A defining feature of the LCR is its ability to confer copy number-dependent and position-independent expression to a linked gene that is stably integrated into chromosomal DNA (3Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the LCR is highlighted by a chromosomal deletion associated with Hispanic β-thalassemia, which removes part of the LCR and correlates with repression of the β-globin genes (5Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). An activity of the LCR distinct from traditional enhancers is that the activation property can be shared by multiple genes over long distances on a chromosome (6Bresnick E.H. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Furukawa T. Zitnik G. Leppig K. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G.

We have proposed a mechanism of coordinate promoter activation involving the recruitment of chromatin remodeling enzymes, which mediate the decondensation of chromatin throughout the β-globin domain (9Bresnick E.H. Tze L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4566-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Bresnick E.H. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 10: 1001-1009Google Scholar). The increase in DNA accessibility is manifested as general DNase I sensitivity (11Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that this chromatin transition is necessary for the subsequent protein-DNA interactions occurring through promoters, enhancers, and silencers that determine the developmental expression pattern of the β-globin genes. An alternative mechanism favors looping interactions between the LCR and individual β-globin gene promoters (12Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Fraser P. Yannoutsos N. Greaves D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Tuan D.Y. Solomon W.B. London I.M. Lee D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), controlling the assembly of preinitiation complexes on the promoters. The chromatin disruption and looping models are not mutually exclusive, as the disruption may be necessary for subsequent promoter interactions. Both mechanisms share the requirement for transactivating proteins that function through the LCR. Multiple hematopoietic and ubiquitous transcription factors interact with conserved sequences within the HSs of the LCR. HS2 is a strong erythroid-specific enhancer, which has been studied extensively (15Sorrentino B. Ney P. Nienhuis A.W.

Mutational analysis suggests that many of these factors are required for optimal HS2-mediated transactivation in transgenic mice and stably transfected cell lines (20Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Caterina J.J. Ciavatta D.J. Donze D. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M.

Previously, we had characterized protein-DNA interactions within a conserved region of HS2 containing an E box (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was a putative TAL1-binding site. TAL1 is a hematopoietic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates hematopoiesis (35Porcher C. Swat W. Rockwell K. Fujiwara Y. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 86: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 36Robb L. Elwood N.J. Elefanty A.G. Kontgen F. Li R. Barnett L.D. Begley C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although TAL1 binding was not detected using MEL and K562 cell nuclear extracts, a novel protein was identified, HS2NF5, that bound tightly to a site overlapping the E box. Recently, we performed a quantitative analysis of recombinant TAL1/E12 heterodimer DNA binding specificity (37Gould K.A. Bresnick E.H. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 87-101PubMed Google Scholar). TAL1/E12 bound to oligonucleotides containing the HS2 E box with very low affinity, in contrast to the high affinity interaction with an optimal TAL1 site. As protein-protein interactions between TAL1 and LIM domain proteins alter the DNA binding specificity of TAL1 (38Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), we postulated that additional factors may allow TAL1 to associate stably with the E box. In contrast to our results with nuclear extracts, Etlinski et al. (30Elnitski L. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) detected TAL1 binding to the E box using K562 extracts. The importance of HS2NF5 in LCR function was suggested by a mutational analysis of the HS2NF5-binding site of HS2 (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This site was necessary for optimal enhancer activity in stable and transient transfection assays. Since HS2NF5 had an apparently unique DNA binding specificity, a variable distribution in cell lines, and was the major activity that bound with high affinity to a functionally important region of HS2, we chose to purify HS2NF5. Here, we describe the identification of two forms of HS2NF5 as the previously cloned transcription factor known as Su(H) in Drosophila (39Furukawa T. Maruyama S. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Cell. 1992; 69: 1191-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Schweisguth F. Posakony J.W.

Science. 1994; 265: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). As Su(H) and CBF1 are critical developmental regulators and downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, we discuss a potential role for Notch signaling in LCR activity and hematopoiesis. Buffer A contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl. Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl. Buffer C contained 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol. Buffer D contained 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA. Buffer E contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mmsucrose, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamide. Buffer H contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamide. All buffers contained 5 mm dithiothreitol. The mouse erythroleukemia cell line MEL was propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cell line was grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide. MEL cells were treated with 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide for 72 h prior to isolating nuclear extract. Fetal calf thymus (from approximately 4-month-old calves) was obtained from Peck Slaughterhouse (Milwaukee, WI). The fresh thymus was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then mixed with 2 volumes of buffer H at 4 °C. The mixture was homogenized in a Waring blender with two pulses of 40 s each. The blended material was filtered through four sheets of cheesecloth and then centrifuged at 545 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 2 volumes of buffer H by resuspension and centrifugation at 545 ×g for 5 min. The pellet was then resuspended by vigorous shaking in 2 volumes of buffer E, and the mixture was centrifuged at 142,413 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 25% (NH4)2SO4 by gradual addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 with stirring. The mixture was stirred for 30 min, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 50% (NH4)2SO4 as described above, and the precipitated material was collected by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was dissolved in a minimal volume of buffer A for Resource-S chromatography. The solution was dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 21,000 ×g, and the resulting nuclear extract was used for the chromatography. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. DNA binding reactions were performed as described previously (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA binding activity was quantitated by analyzing gels with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All chromatographic steps were carried out with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast pressure liquid chromatography system at 4 °C. The crude extract was chromatographed in three consecutive runs on a 20-ml Resource-S cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. Proteins were resolved with a 50–450 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. HS2NF5 DNA binding was measured by EMSA in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HS2NF5 activity eluted as a homogeneous peak between 200 and 380 mm NaCl. The fractions containing maximal HS2NF5 activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer B. The dialyzed material from the Resource-S column was centrifuged for 15 min at 21,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 12-ml Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer B. Proteins were resolved with a 100–400 mm NaCl gradient in buffer B at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. HS2NF5 DNA binding was measured by EMSA in the presence of 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). HS2NF5 activity eluted as a major peak between 160 and 260 mm NaCl. A minor peak eluted at a slightly lower salt concentration but was not analyzed further, as it was present in fractions containing a high concentration of protein, which would have reduced considerably the fold purification. The fractions containing maximal HS2NF5 activity were pooled. Ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled material from the Q-Sepharose column to a final concentration of 1 m. The mixture was applied to a 10-ml phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer B containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were resolved with a 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate gradient in buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. HS2NF5 DNA binding was measured in the presence of 0.25 μg of poly(dI-dC). HS2NF5 activity eluted as a homogeneous peak between 150 and 300 mmammonium sulfate. The fractions containing maximal HS2NF5 activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer C. The pooled material from the phenyl-Sepharose column was applied to a 5-ml double-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma) column equilibrated in buffer C. Proteins were resolved with a 150–450 mm KCl gradient in buffer C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. HS2NF5 DNA binding was assayed in the presence of 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC). HS2NF5 activity eluted as a homogenous peak between 270 and 390 mm KCl. Protein concentrations of the pooled samples from each of the first three columns were determined by the Bradford assay. Proteins were analyzed by resolving on 9% SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining. In place of the DNA-cellulose step, we also used sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography with the concatamerized HS2NF5 site coupled to Sepharose. Although HS2NF5 could also be isolated with this column, the yield of HS2NF5 was lower than with the DNA-cellulose column (data not shown). The pooled material from the DNA-cellulose column was dialyzed against buffer D and concentrated by lyophilization. The mixture was applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer D, and proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. HS2NF5 DNA binding was measured by EMSA in the presence of 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After dialysis against Milli-Q filtered water and lyophilization, proteins were analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fractions of DNA-cellulose-purified material were dialyzed against Milli-Q water and concentrated by lyophilization. The proteins were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. After thorough destaining, gel pieces containing the 56- and 61-kDa forms of HS2NF5 were excised and subjected to carboxyamidomethylation proteolysis with trypsin as described previously (43Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy sequencing was performed by Bill Lane of the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. The eluted peptides were separated by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC coupled to the electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile in 0.05% acetic acid at a flow rate of 700 nl/min. Ionization was assisted with a coaxial sheath liquid of 70% methanol, 0.05% acetic acid. Spectra were acquired as successive sets of three scan modes as follows: full scan MS over them/z range 395–1118 amu, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in that full scan. These data-dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass and MS/MS spectra for peptide sequence information. Base peak relative ion abundance corresponded to a load of 5–35 fmol by comparison with a standard peptide mixture analyzed under identical conditions. Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of the peptides was facilitated by searching NCBI non-redundant protein and EST data bases with the algorithm Sequest (44Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates III., J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5411) Google Scholar). Quantitative DNA binding studies suggested that the amount of HS2NF5 in nuclear extracts of MEL and K562 cells was low, which would make purification of ample amounts for sequencing difficult. Instead, we found that HS2NF5 DNA binding activity was present in nuclear extracts of fetal calf thymus, and it resembled HS2NF5 from MEL and K562 cells. To compare the DNA sequence specificity of MEL and thymus HS2NF5, we performed EMSAs using nuclear extracts fractionated on a Resource-S column, followed by a Q-Sepharose column. As shown in Fig. 1, titrations were performed with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing a wild-type or mutated HS2NF5 site (Fig. 1 A) and a constant amount of fractionated extract. The HS2NF5-DNA complexes formed with MEL cell and thymus extracts had an identical mobility on the nondenaturing gel. A mutant oligonucleotide, Mut-1, was tested, which had been shown previously not to bind HS2NF5 (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No HS2NF5 binding to Mut-1 was detected with either extract. In contrast, another mutated oligonucleotide, Mut-2, which had been shown previously not to affect HS2NF5 binding (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was bound by both MEL and thymus HS2NF5. Thus, the DNA binding activity of MEL and thymus HS2NF5 appeared to be indistinguishable, justifying the use of thymus extract for purifying HS2NF5. The HS2NF5 purification scheme is outlined in Fig. 2. Fetal calf thymus nuclear extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by chromatography on Resource-S, Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and double-stranded DNA-cellulose columns (data not shown). Protein samples from each stage of the purification were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining to evaluate the purity of HS2NF5. As shown in the extensively silver-stained gel of Fig. 3 A, after four chromatographic steps, two major protein bands of 56 and 61 kDa were present in fractions 22–28. A smaller amount of protein from another purification is shown on the right to illustrate the copurification and purity of the 56- and 61-kDa proteins (Fig. 3 B). Both the 56- and 61-kDa bands were characterized by microheterogeneity.Figure 3SDS-PAGE analysis of purified HS2NF5. A, fetal calf thymus nuclear extract (10 μg), the Resource-S pool (10 μg), the Q-Sepharose pool (10 μg), the phenyl-Sepharose pool (10 μg), and fractions from the DNA-cellulose column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The positions of the two forms of HS2NF5 are indicated. B, purified HS2NF5 from another purification (fraction 24) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. C, comparison of the relative amount of 56- and 61-kDa polypeptides detected by silver staining and the DNA binding activity of HS2NF5 quantitated from EMSA (data not shown). D, densitometric scan of stained proteins in fraction 24 of panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To show further that the 56- and 61-kDa bands represent HS2NF5, we compared the relative amount of DNA binding activity measured by EMSA (data not shown) with the relative amount of the 56- and 61-kDa polypeptides detected by densitometric analysis of the silver-stained bands (Fig. 3 A). As the binding activity and protein correlated well, this supports the identity of the 56- and 61-kDa bands as HS2NF5 (Fig. 3 C). The purity of HS2NF5 in fraction 24 from the DNA-cellulose column was estimated to be 94% by densitometric analysis (Fig. 3 D) and reverse-phase chromatography on a microcapillary C18 HPLC column (data not shown). The purification results are summarized in Table I. A 52,450-fold purification of HS2NF5 was achieved, with a yield of 27%.

The binding activity of HS2NF5 in the nuclear extract could not be accurately determined, since the crude extract contained substances that inhibited binding. The protein concentrations of fractions 22 and 24 of the DNA-cellulose column were estimated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining relative to standard proteins. The protein concentrations of fractions 26 and 28 were too low to be measured. The DNA binding specificity of purified HS2NF5 was assessed by EMSA with a labeled wild-type HS2NF5 oligonucleotide and unlabeled wild-type and mutant competitors (Fig. 4 A). Two mutations were shown previously (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to reduce HS2 enhancer activity (E box mut, CAGATG changed to GTCGAC; HS2NF5 mut, TTCTCA changed to CTGCAG). In addition, as a control, we tested a third mutant (TAA mut, GCC changed to TAA), which we had shown previously to have no effect on HS2NF5 DNA binding (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The wild-type and TAA mut oligonucleotides strongly reduced binding (wild type, 94.8 and 97.9% decrease at 50- and 200-fold excess, respectively; TAA mut, 79 and 93.2% decrease at 50- and 200-fold excess, respectively) (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the E box mut and HS2NF5 mut oligonucleotides only weakly competed for binding (E box mut, 48 and 61% decrease at 50- and 200-fold excess, respectively; HS2NF5 mut, 8.0 and 43% decrease at 50- and 200-fold excess, respectively), which agrees with our previous analysis of HS2NF5 DNA binding specificity in MEL cell nuclear extracts (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since the mutations of the E box mut and HS2NF5 mut oligonucleotides prevent HS2NF5 DNA binding and were shown previously to decrease HS2 enhancer activity (34Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these results suggest that impaired HS2NF5 binding may be responsible for the inhibition. To determine whether the 56- and 61-kDa forms of HS2NF5 have distinct DNA binding properties or bind to DNA as a heteromer, we resolved the purified material on an analytical gel filtration column. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the 56- and 61-kDa proteins were partially separated by the"

An α<sub>2A</sub>AR truncation, encoding transmembrane (TM) regions 1–5, was first delivered basolaterally, but within minutes appeared apically, and at steady-state was primarily lateral in its immunocytochemical localization. A TM 1–5 truncation with the third intracellular loop revealed more intense lateral localization than for the TM 1–5 structure, consistent with the role of the third intracellular loop in α<sub>2A</sub>AR stabilization.

Disruption of nosAdoes not affect the growth rate but causes an arrest in development after the cells have aggregated. nosA contains seven exons and codes for a developmentally regulated 3.5-kb mRNA. The 125-kDa NOSA protein is present in the cytosol at constant levels during growth and development. The C-terminal region of NOSA has homology with ubiquitin fusion degradation protein-2 (UFD2) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and putative homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. UFD2 is involved in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of model substrates in which ubiquitin forms part of the translation product, but ufd2 mutants have no detected phenotype. In accord with the homology to UFD2, we found differences in the ubiquitination patterns between nosA mutants and their parental cell line. While general in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination is minimally affected, ubiquitination of individual proteins is altered throughout growth and development in nosA mutants. These findings suggest that events involving ubiquitination are critical for progression through the aggregate stage of the Dictyostelium life cycle.

Protein levels and activities are regulated by differential gene expression, translational regulation, and post-translational modification. One such modification is the attachment of the small 8-kDa ubiquitin protein to a specific set of substrates, which targets these proteins to proteasomes for degradation. Although the ubiquitin pathway has the capacity to degrade almost every protein, it is a benign component of the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The protein degradation cascade begins when ubiquitin is attached to ubiquitin-activating enzymes of the E11 class through a high energy thioester bond. Activated ubiquitin is then transferred to substrates by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of the E2 class. The carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin forms a covalent bond with the ε-NH2 group of a lysine in the target protein. In some cases, the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins also requires the E3 ubiquitin ligases, which form complexes with specific E2 conjugating enzymes and the substrate, to confer specificity. Subsequent cycles result in the formation of multimeric ubiquitin chains on the target protein that are recognized by the 19 S cap of the proteasome. The multiubiquitin chain is removed by ubiquitin-specific hydrolases before the protein is unfolded and enters the 20 S proteasome for degradation (see Ref. 1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar for a review). Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis serves diverse cellular functions. In addition to cell cycle regulation by degradation of cyclins (for reviews, see Refs. 2Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar and 3Pagano M.

This organism has a variety of motile and developmental behaviors; in addition to forming cysts, the organism is capable of aggregation and subsequent differentiation into stalk and spore cells, as shown in Fig. 1 A. Developmental mutants defective in various components of the ubiquitin pathway have been isolated. The mutations have been mapped to the genes encoding the proteasomal subunit PRTC (13Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPA, 2R. Gomer, personal communication. and the conjugating enzyme UBC1 (14Clark A. Nomura A. Mohanty S. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1989-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In a genetic screen to identify genes essential for cellular differentiation, we isolated a gene we have called nosA (fornospores). The disruption of nosA results in a developmental arrest at the tight aggregate stage; occasional aggregates go on to form fruiting bodies that lack spores. The developmental blockade is stage-specific, despite the fact that the protein is present throughout growth and development. The carboxyl-terminal 525 amino acids of NOSA share 57% similarity with the UFD2 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. UFD2 is a component of the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway, which has been studied in S. cerevisiae for its ability to degrade ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion proteins (15Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Mutagenic analysis of the lysine residues in the ubiquitin domain of a ubiquitin-β-galactosidase test protein suggests that the internal lysines at positions 29 and 48 of ubiquitin are the major attachment sites for additional ubiquitins. The ubiquitination at Lys48 requires UFD2. A physiological role for UFD2 has not been established, because the S. cerevisiae mutant has no apparent phenotype other than the failure to degrade the test substrate, and no natural substrate has been identified. To investigate whether NOSA is involved in ubiquitination during development of Dictyostelium, we examined the distribution of ubiquitin conjugates. The disruption of nosA had no effect on the stability of the endogenous ubiquitin fusion protein Ubex52, which resembles the model substrates used for studying UFD2 in S. cerevisiae. However, we found altered patterns of ubiquitination in dividing and developing nosA mutant cells. We identified at least three proteins that are stabilized in thenosA mutant, suggesting that the role of the NOSA protein during development is to remove a specific set of proteins to ensure developmental progression. The isolation of nosA in D. discoideum links a component of the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway to cellular differentiation and defines a distinctive phenotype that can be employed for further biochemical and genetic studies. The original mutation was created in a variant of AX3 called DH1, which is a uracil auxotroph (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strain MYC1 was derived from AX3 by disruption of the pyr5–6 locus using pMYC10 as described (17Insall R.H. Soede R.D.M. Schaap P. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). DH1 and MYC1 were provided by Peter Devreotes. For multicellular development, axenically growing cells in midlog phase (2–4 × 106 cells/ml) were washed twice in cold SorC buffer (16.7 mmNa2H/KH2PO4, 50 μmCaCl2 (pH 6.0)). The cells were resuspended in SorC buffer and plated on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp.), which rested on SorC-saturated Whatman filter pads (grade 17), at a density of 8.1 × 105 cells/cm2. The strain DH1 was electroporated in the presence of the restriction enzymeEcoRI and the selectable plasmid pJB1, which had been precut with the same enzyme (18Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). pJB1 carries the pyr5–6 gene (19Boy-Marcotte E. Vilaine F. Camonis J. Jacquet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and confers stable uracil prototrophy upon integration of the plasmid into an EcoRI site in the genome. After 3 weeks of selection, prototrophs were allowed to form plaques on lawns of bacteria. The nosA mutant, formerly called R7, formed only tight aggregates (Fig. 1 B). The genomic fragment containingnosA was isolated by taking advantage of the selectable plasmid pJB1, which contains pBluescript, inserted into exon VII (Fig. 4 A). Genomic DNA from the nosA mutant was isolated, cut with a number of restriction enzymes, religated, and transformed into the E. coli strain DH5α. In this way, the genomic fragments flanked by BclI (1.9 kb), PstI (3.4 kb), and HincII (3.1 kb) sites were isolated. For the recovery of the 5′-end of nosA, genomic DNA from the parental strain DH1 was cut with BstBI, size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and eluted from the gel. Fragments in the range of 3–4 kb were ligated with pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) that had been digested with ClaI and dephosphorylated. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α. The resulting genomic minilibrary was screened with the32P-labeled 0.55-kb PvuII fragment of nosA. Total RNA was prepared as described (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) from axenically grown cells in late log phase (about 5 × 106 cells/ml) that were starved for 6 h in SorC at 2 × 107/ml. From this preparation, poly(A)+ RNA was purified by using the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Double-stranded cDNA was generated from 0.9 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). ThenosA cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription PCR, employing primer pairs that define two overlapping fragments of nosA. Taq polymerase (Promega) was used in all PCR reactions, unless otherwise indicated. The 5′ portion of nosA was amplified using the primers 5′nosA (5′-CCCCGAGCTCGCAATAGATCAACAAATATTAAAAG-3′) with a syntheticSacI site and primer pR7-J2 (5′-AAGCTAACCATTCATCAA-3′) usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene), followed by reamplification with 5′nosA and the nested primer nos-2 (5′-AATTGATACCAATATGTAAAGC-3′). The amplified PCR product of 0.96 kb was digested with SacI and KpnI and subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). This plasmid was named pc5′NosA. The 3′ portion of the NOSA gene was amplified using the primers nos-3 (5′-ATGATATCACAAAGGATACTAG-3′) and nos-6 (5′-AAAAAAAAGGATGGAAATAATGAT-3′), followed by reamplification with nos-3 and the nested primer 3′nosA (5′-CCCCTCGAGATTGTTTTTTCTTTGAAGCTAACC-3′), which contains a syntheticXhoI site. The amplified 1.7-kb PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI and subcloned into pGEM-7f(+/−) (Promega). The resulting plasmid was linearized withSacI and KpnI, and the SacI/KpnI fragment from pc5′NosA was inserted to yield plasmid pcNOSA(S/X). This plasmid was digested with SacI and XhoI and thenosA cDNA fragment of 2.54 kb was inserted into the expression vector pDXA-HC (21Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site was mapped by using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system, version 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA using the primer EXT-3 (5′-ATTTGGGGTTCTAACTG-3′). The original RNA template was removed by RNase H treatment, and the first strand DNA was purified with a spin column (Qiagen). After dC tailing of the 3′-end of the cDNA, the 5′-extension product was amplified using the provided anchor primer and EXT-4 (5′-AACTGGACTAGTGTTTCCTTTTTG-3′). The 5′-extension product was subcloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (InVitrogen) for sequencing. The complete nosA cDNA sequence was derived from the partial cDNA and the 5′-extension. DNA and RNA blotting techniques were performed as described previously (22Podgorski G.J. Franke J. Faure M. Kessin R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3938-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) were used to blot RNA. The various probes used for Northern blot hybridization were prepared by purification of the appropriate restriction fragments on low melting temperature agarose gels and were labeled by the random priming method (23Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). A probe specific to nosA was prepared from the plasmid pJB7 (see below) by isolation of the nosA-specificBclI/EcoRI fragment (1.6 kb). TheecmB-specific probe was derived from theEcoRI/HindIII fragment of pDd56 (24Ceccarelli A. McRobbie S.J. Jermyn K.A. Duffy K. Early A. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7463-7476Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ThepsA-specific probe was derived from the NheI/SphI fragment from a pBR322-based plasmid D19 that carries thepsA cDNA (25Early A. McRobbie S.J. Duffy K.T. Jermyn K.A. Tilly R. Ceccarelli A. Williams J.G. Dev. Gen. 1988; 9: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against NOSA was generated by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). A synthetic peptide comprising the C-terminal amino acids ETKKKIDEWLASKKKQ of NOSA was prepared and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) according to the method described (26Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The conjugated peptide was injected into rabbits (New Zealand White), boosted twice, and then tested on crude cell extracts from Dictyostelium strain DH1 and F11 by Western blot. Polyclonal antibodies against ubiquitin were from Sigma. Antisera against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of human UbCEP52 (Ubex52) were a gift from K. L. Redman and were prepared as described (27Redman K.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium cells harvested at various times during development on filters were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The proteins from 5 × 105 cells were size-fractionated on 6.0, 7.5, or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immobilized proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) with a semidry electroblotter (Integrated Separation System) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal loading was verified by staining the membrane with 0.2% Ponceau S in 3% trichloroacetic acid. Blots were blocked with blotto (5% instant nonfat dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% Merthiolate)), prior to incubation with the primary antibody. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The immobilized proteins were detected on x-ray film by chemiluminescence with Luminol as the substrate (Renaissance, DuPont). The plasmid pJB1 carries a fragment of theD. discoideum genome containing pyr5–6 (28Jacquet M. Guilbaud R. Garreau H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the ClaI site of pBluescript II-KS (Stratagene). For the deletion of the nosA locus, two knockout constructs were made, p5′3′/bsr and pNosA-bsr (see Fig. 4 for location of restriction sites in the nosA locus). To construct p5′3′/bsr, the blasticidin resistance (bsr) cassette (29Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) from pBsR519 was subcloned into pBluescript as a PstI fragment. The 1.2-kbBclI/XbaI fragment of nosA, which had been previously subcloned into pBluescript, was released by restriction withSmaI and SacII and was inserted downstream of the bsr cassette. The 0.8-kb PstI/EcoRI fragment of nosA, which was previously subcloned into pUC19, was released by restriction with HindIII and EcoRI and inserted upstream of the bsr cassette. The resulting plasmid, p5′3′/bsr, was restricted with HindIII and SacII, and the 3.4-kb fragment containing the bsr cassette flanked by the genomic nosA fragments was used for transformation of DH1 to generate the nosA mutant 2E4. nosA mutant cells (F11) were transformed with a plasmid that expresses β-galactosidase as described by Hadwiger and Firtel (30Hadwiger J.A. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Parental DH1 cells and transformed F11 cells were mixed in a ratio of 9:1 and allowed to develop on nitrocellulose filters as described above. Structures were fixed at various stages of development and stained for β-galactosidase activity as described (31Richardson D.L. Loomis W.F. Kimmel A.R. Development. 1994; 120: 2891-2900PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared from axenically grown cells in late log phase (about 5 × 106 cells/ml) that were starved for 6 h in SorC at 2 × 107/ml, washed once with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), resuspended in Tris buffer at 108/ml, and frozen at −70 °C. The extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved. Ubiquitin (Sigma U6253) was purified by gel filtration on a 40-ml (48.5 cm) Sephadex G50 column equilibrated with Tris buffer. The purified ubiquitin was labeled with 125I (from NEN Life Science Products) using IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described (32Smith D.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except that Tris buffer was used rather than phosphate buffer. The labeled ubiquitin was separated from free iodine on a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with Tris buffer. Mg-ATP contained 50 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Na-ATP (pH 7.5), 10 mm dithiothreitol. Ubiquitination reactions were performed initially as described (33Ramos P.C.R. Ferreira R.M.B. Ricardo C.P.P. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 569-575Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). ATP was required, but an ATP-regenerating system was not necessary. The following protocol was used after optimization for 125I-labeled ubiquitin incorporation: 9 μl of extract (about 8 × 107 cells/ml); 9 μl of125I-labeled ubiquitin (60 μg/ml), 3 μl of Mg-ATP, 9 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Reactions were incubated for 0–60 min at 30 °C, and aliquots were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried on Whatman 3MM paper, and the 125I label was detected at −70 °C by autoradiography using x-ray film, with enhancing screens. The nosA mutant was isolated in a REMI mutagenesis screen to identify developmental genes (18Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A population of uracil auxotrophs was mutagenized and selected for uracil prototrophy, and then 5000–10,000 transformants were examined individually as plaques growing on bacterial lawns. The colonies were inspected for morphological aberrations. ThenosA mutant, initially called R7, was blocked at the tight aggregate stage, which corresponds to stage 2 in Fig. 1 A. The plasmid pR7-Bcl was recovered from this mutant by digestion of the genomic DNA of R7 withBclI, religation, and transformation of E. coli(see “Experimental Procedures”). To test whether the nosA mutation is responsible for the described phenotype, the plasmid pR7-Bcl was used to create identical mutants by homologous recombination. In four independent transformations of DH1 with linearized pR7-Bcl, 66 recombinants were generated, of which 27 (41%) showed the nosA phenotype. Southern blots of retransformants showed that all transformants with a mutant phenotype had the nosA locus disrupted by homologous recombination. One of these transformants was the F11 strain that was used in this study. Transformants with a wild-type phenotype had the plasmid inserted at random sites, leaving nosA intact (data not shown). The fact that the phenotypes could be reproduced only in those mutants in which nosA was disrupted, indicates that the phenotype resulted from the insertional mutation.NosA-specific probes only detect single fragments in Northern hybridizations, indicating that nosA is present as a single locus in the genome. Because the integration of pJB1 during REMI mutagenesis was at the 3′-end of the gene, we created the gene replacement mutant 2E4 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 4 A), which had thenosA phenotype. Northern blots with a partialnosA cDNA as a probe showed that 2E4 is anosA null mutant producing no transcript (data not shown). Instead of forming fruiting bodies (stage 9 in Fig. 1, A and E), allnosA mutants aggregate and arrest after about 12 h at what is called the tight aggregate stage (Fig. 1 B). At this stage, all cells have aggregated and start to differentiate into prespore or prestalk cells. Sometimes aggregates succeeded in making a stalk and even produced a sphere of liquid on top of the mass but the sori contained no viable spores or other cells (Fig. 1, Cand D). Note that the stalk, which passes through the empty sorocarp, is visible in Fig. 1, C and D. To determine whether a few spores were made, we treated these structures with detergent to kill any cell that was not a spore and then plated the survivors on lawns of bacteria. With the F11 mutant, no spores were detected. F11 had the same phenotype as the original mutant R7 (Fig. 1 D). Only the fruiting body stage is shown for F11. Taken together, the same phenotype was observed for the original REMI mutant R7, the retransformant F11, the nosA 0 mutant 2E4, and the mutant 15-S-12, which carried a partial deletion (data not shown). Thus, four independent mutant alleles of nosA gave rise to the same phenotype. In Dictyostelium, a number of genes are expressed in one cell type but not in the other. These genes can be used to monitor the developmental stage reached by mutants. The extracellular matrix protein-coding gene, ecmB, is a prestalk cell marker, and the spore coat protein coding gene, psA, is a prespore-specific marker. In Northern blots with RNA from developing wild-type and mutant cells, the nosA mutation reduces transcription of the prespore gene to a greater extent than transcription of the prestalk gene (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the ability of a small percentage of F11 aggregates to make a stalk and form fruiting bodies with empty sori. The nosA mutation causes a cell-autonomous defect. When the mutant amoebae were marked with a β-galactosidase expression cassette driven by a constitutive actin 15 promoter (34Shaulsky G. Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the mutant cells could be identified in chimeras with isogenic parental cells. In these mixtures, aggregation proceeded normally, but at the tight aggregate stage, the mutant cells were excluded and left in the periphery (Fig. 3). No mutant cells synergized with wild-type cells to form spores, which indicates an extreme cell-autonomous phenotype. The nosA mutant by itself arrested exclusively at the tight aggregate stage in these experiments. The genomic fragment containingnosA was isolated by plasmid rescue and from a genomic mini-library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The nosAlocus has been mapped to chromosome 6 (35Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Loomis W.F. Kuspa A. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo, Japan1997: 15-30Google Scholar). The NOSA gene consists of seven exons as shown in Fig. 4 A. The coding sequence is flanked by a 5′-untranslated region of 181 nucleotides and a short 3′-untranslated region of 42 nucleotides as determined by comparison with different cDNAs. The short AT-rich introns of about 80–120 bp, which are flanked by conserved splice sites, are typical forDictyostelium (37Wu L. Franke J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A translational start codon was located and has the consensus sequences typical for Dictyosteliumgenes (37Wu L. Franke J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A single open reading frame of 3.27 kb was identified in the genomic DNA and cDNA utilizing this start site. The length of the open reading frame plus nontranslated sequences corresponds to the size of the mRNA detected in Northern blots. There is a polyglutamine and a polyasparagine stretch at the 5′-end of nosA. These have been described in otherDictyostelium genes (38Shaw D.R. Richter H. Giorda R. Ohmachi T. Ennis H.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but their origin and functional significance are not known. The NOSA polypeptide does not contain any previously characterized motifs (39Bairoch, A. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19, (suppl.) 2241–2245Google Scholar, 40Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). No sequence homology was found with the known E1, E2, or E3 enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The NOSA gene is developmentally regulated as a 3.5-kb transcript (Fig. 5 A). Expression is at its peak at 4 h, when the cells are in the initial stages of aggregation, remains high through aggregation, and then decreases. Transcript is present at all stages, including vegetative growth. Western blotting with a NOSA antibody revealed a protein of the expected 125-kDa size in wild-type cells present throughout growth and development (Fig. 5 B). The fact that the antibody does not detect the NOSA protein in the nosA mutant shows that the antibody is specific for NOSA (Fig. 5 C). The disturbance of in vitro ubiquitination patterns (see below) throughout growth and development follows the temporal expression of NOSA. Gel filtration revealed that NOSA behaved like a globular protein with a molecular weight of 125,000–200,000 and is not part of a large complex (data not shown). High speed sedimentation analysis (1 h at 170,000 ×g) followed by Western blotting demonstrated that NOSA is a cytosolic protein (data not shown). The first indication of a role fornosA in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis came from BLAST homology searches (41Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar) in which nosA was found to be related to the S. cerevisiae sequence ufd2. In S. cerevisiae, the ufd2 product is necessary for degradation of an artificial substrate in which ubiquitin is coded as part of the protein, instead of being added post-translationally. The C-terminal 525 amino acids of NOSA share 57% similarity with UFD2, which includes an internal region of 75–85% homology that we call the NOCT region (for NOSA-C-terminal region) as shown in Fig. 4. The suggested role of the UFD pathway is the degradation of ubiquitin fusion proteins. Two such proteins occur naturally: Ubex52 and Ubex72 (42Westphal M. Müller-Taubenberger A. Noegel A. Gerisch G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 92-96Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Ohmachi T. Giorda R. Shaw D.R. Ennis H.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5226-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These genes code for ubiquitin plus 52- and 72-amino acid C-terminal extensions, respectively, which are found in ribosomes. They may resemble the artificial substrates used by Johnson et al. (15Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) to recover the ufd mutants, because ubiquitin forms a part of the translational product.

Recently, the human IL9 receptor (hIL9R) gene locus has also been implicated in determining susceptibility to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma. In order to evaluate the structure and function of the encoded product, we analyzed receptor transcripts derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 50 unrelated donors. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region identified a splice variant that contains an in frame deletion of a single residue at codon 173 (ΔQ). This variant could be permanently expressed in a cytokine-dependent murine T-cell line but lacked the ability to induce proliferation in response to human IL9. In situ analyses of cells expressing the wild-type and ΔQ receptors found both forms to be expressed at the cell surface, but the ΔQ receptor was unable to bind hIL9 and could not be recognized by N-terminal specific antibodies. These findings demonstrate that hIL9RΔQ presents an altered structure and function and suggests its potential role in down-regulating IL9 signaling in effector cells and associated biological processes.

Asthma is a complex inflammatory disorder that is characterized by periodic airway obstruction, wheezing, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)1(1Hopp R.J. Townley R.G. Biven R.E. Bewtra A.K. Nair N.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Clinical studies of asthma have revealed that the pathology of this disease is associated with widespread narrowing of the airways due to edema and infiltration of multiple inflammatory cells into the lung epithelia (2Mcfadden Jr., E.R. Gilbert I.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1928-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These cell types include mast cells, eosinophils, B-cells, and TH2-lymphocytes as the predominant cell mediators of this disorder (3Delprete G.F. DeCarli M. D'Elios M.M. Maestrelli P. Ricci M.

While these inflammatory cells appear to be important, their precise role in producing BHR is unclear and still under investigation. Nevertheless, the response to antigen and subsequent release of chemical inflammatory mediators (histamines, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, etc.) by a number of these cells has been documented (5Holgate S.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have suggested that BHR is a multigenic process (6Holgate S.T. Church M.K. Howarth P.H. Morton N.E. Frew A.J.

Recently, we have identified interleukin-9 (IL9) as a factor in regulating airway hyperresponsivess in inbred strains of mice (12Nicolaides N.C. Holroyd K.J. Ewart S.L. Eleff S.M. Kiser M.B. Dragwa C.R. Sullivan C.D. Grasso L. Zhang L.Y. Messler C.J. Zhou T. Kleeberger S.R. Buetow K.H. Levitt R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

C57BL/6 mice, which show low airway responsiveness, had undetectable levels of IL9 in activated splenocytes and in the lung, while DBA/2 mice, which have airway hypperresponsiveness, expressed robust levels of IL9 in both tissues. A role for IL9 in asthma and allergy has been supported by the findings that it has pleiotropic activities on cell types associated with these diseases such as TH2 lymphocytes, B-cells, mast cells, and eosinophils (13Dugas B.

These two activities as well as the effect of IL9 on controlling BHR in mice suggest that it and its associated pathway(s) are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy and asthma. Most recently, Holroyd et al. 2Holroyd, K. J., Martinati, L. C., Trabetti, E., Scherpbier, T., Eleff, S. M., Boner, A. L., Pignatti, P. F., Kiser, M. B., Dragwa, C. R., Hubbard, F., Sullivan, C. D., Grasso, L., Messler, C. J., Huang, M., Hu, Y., Nicolaides, N. C., Buetow, K. H., and Levitt, R. C. (1998) Genomics, in press. have found genetic linkage of asthma and BHR to the IL9 receptor (hIL9R) locus in humans, supporting the notion that this pathway is involved in the disease process in humans. Because of the genetic linkage of the IL9 receptor locus to allergy and asthma susceptibility, we explored the possibility that variations in hIL9R structure/function or gene expression may exist. Here we report the identification of an abundantly expressed receptor splice variant (referred to as ΔQ receptor) that lacks codon 173. This variant is unable to bind IL9 and transduce its signal to effector cells. These data suggest a mechanism for modulating IL9 signaling in effector cells. Peripheral blood was obtained by consent from 50 unrelated donors. Venipuncture was performed, and blood was collected into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA. An equal volume of PBS (Mg2+/Ca2+-free) was added to whole blood. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque gradients (Pharmacia Biotech 17-1440-02) (21Stoeckert C.J. Nicolaides N.C. Haines K.M. Surrey S. Bayever E. Exp. Hematol. 1990; 18: 1164-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Purified cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 days. Cytoplasmic RNA and genomic DNAs were isolated from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin-treated PBMCs as described previously (22Nicolaides N.C. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 154-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR as described (23Nicolaides N.C. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Papadopoulos N. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Genomics. 1995; 30: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Primers used to amplify the entire coding region of the hIL9R (GenBankTM accession no. M84747) were as follows: 5′-GCT GGA CCT TGG AGA GTG-3′ (R8 forward, centered at nucleotide 208 of the cDNA) and 5′-GTC TCA GAC AAG GGC TCC AG-3′ (R1801 reverse, centered at nucleotide 1822 of the cDNA) (15Renauld J.C.

Benedict C. Basu R. McNinch J. Blood. 1994; 83: 3199-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the structural analysis of hIL9R, reverse transcriptase-PCR products containing the entire coding region of the hIL9R from 50 donors were cloned into pCR2.1 T-tailed vectors (Invitrogen). At least 10 recombinant clones from each individual were completely sequenced. Recombinant expression vectors were engineered by subcloning the relevant cDNAs from the original cloning vector as EcoRI fragments into the EcoRI restriction site of the LXSN retroviral vector (25Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechnology. 1989; 9: 980-990Google Scholar) that contains a neomycin resistance gene as a selectable marker. The GH8 (the only combination of codons 344 and 410–418 that has not been reported by others nor observed in our IL9R structure analysis) and GR9 (see Fig. 2 A) expression plasmids were engineered by first subcloning the GR8 and GH9 forms of the hIL9R cDNA into the EcoRI site of pZeoSV2 (Invitrogen) to produce pZeoGR8 and pZeoGH9, respectively. The GH8 and GR9 cDNAs were then engineered by exchanging XmaI fragments of these plasmids (5′ site is located in the pZeoSV2 polylinker, and the 3′ site is located at nucleotide 1328 (between codons 344 and 410) of the receptor cDNA) to generate pZeoGH8 and pZeoGR9. Finally, GH8 and GR9 cDNAs were subcloned asEcoRI fragments from pZeoSV2 into the EcoRI site of LXSN vector. pZeoRR9 was obtained by replacing theBstEII/NotI fragment of pZeoGH9 containing base pairs 791–1822 of the hIL9R cDNA with theBstEII/NotI fragment from ph9RA6 (26Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Successively, the EcoRI/XhoI fragment from pZeoRR9 containing the RR9 version of the hIL9R cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of LXSN. Constructs were sequenced using the ABI Prism DNA sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer), and reactions were run in a model 377 DNA automated sequencer (ABI Prism, Perkin-Elmer). TS1 is an IL9-dependent murine T cell line (15Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5690-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 25 ng/ml of murine IL9 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mo7e is a cytokine-dependent human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line that proliferates in response to IL3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL9, or stem cell factor. These cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 50 ng/ml human IL9 or 10 ng/ml IL3. COS7 cells were purchased from ATCC and were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. TS1 cells stably expressing various forms of hIL9R variants were generated by electroporation and Geneticin (G418) selection. Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing 10 μg of the appropriate plasmid, pulsed (260 V/1000 microfarads) in a GenePulse II electroporator (Bio-Rad), and resuspended in growth medium. After 24 h, cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies) for approximately 14 days, at which time mock-transfected cells died. Selected cells were maintained in growth medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml murine IL9 and 0.4 mg/ml G418. Expression of hIL9R was periodically assessed by Western blot. Interleukin-9-induced cell proliferation was performed as follows. TS1 transfectants were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at 103 cells/well in 96-well microplates and grown in the presence of 5 ng/ml recombinant human IL9 or murine IL9. Proliferation was assayed after 7 days using a modified protocol of the acid phosphatase assay (CLONTECH). Briefly, 50 μl of a buffer containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate) was added per well containing 0.2 ml of growth medium and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.05 n sodium hydroxide and quantified by absorbance at 410 nm using a Dynatech model MR600 plate reader. All experiments were performed in at least triplicate. To analyze tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins upon cytokine stimulation, TS1 transfectant cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in DMEM plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. 2 × 107 cells were treated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml of either human or murine IL9 and immediately washed in cold PBS. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer as described under “Immunoprecipitations, Immunoblotting, and Antibodies.” 2–5 × 107 cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× “Complete” protease inhibitors mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) and then incubated for 45 min on ice. Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube. For immunoprecipitations, 1–5 μg of antibody was added to the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 20 μl of Protein A + G-agarose-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the samples and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min, and beads were washed four times. After the final wash, beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 3 min before electrophoresis on 8% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobillon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) in 48 mm Tris base, 40 mm glycine, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol and blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) (Bio-Rad) and 5% condensed milk (or 1% bovine serum albumin for anti-phosphotyrosine). Membranes were probed using specific primary antibodies (listed below) followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and chemiluminescence (Pierce). Specific antibodies for murine and human IL9R (sc698) and murine Jak1, Irs1, Irs2, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5, and phosphotyrosine were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Jak3 and monoclonal anti-hIL9R MAB290 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and R & D Systems, respectively. The anti-N-terminal hIL9R antibodies AH9R-1, -2, and -7 have been previously described (26Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were plated onto glass coverslips after electroporation with the appropriate plasmids. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 5 μg/ml of the anti-N-terminal hIL9R monoclonal antibody MAB290 (R & D Systems) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-mouse IgG Texas Red-conjugated antibody (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were then fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and blocked for 30 min in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Cells were then incubated with 2 μg/ml of the carboxyl-terminal specific hIL9R polyclonal antibody sc698 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with 1:100 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG Texas Red-conjugated antibody (Sigma). Cells were washed three times with PBS and then counterstained with 1 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Samples were analyzed using an Olympus AX-70 microscope, and micrographs were taken and printed using a Sony camera DKC5000/Sony printer UP-D8800 system. FACS analysis was performed as described previously (26Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL9 (4 μg) was iodinated using IODO-GEN-bead (Pierce) yielding 20,000 CPM/ng of protein as described previously (15Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C.

Cells were layered over 800 μl of a 1.5:1 mixture of dibutyl- and dioctylphtalate oils and centrifuged at 750 × g for 1 min. Cell pellets were counted in a Gamma 5500 counter (Beckman) to obtain counts of bound125I-IL9. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 200-fold excess of unlabeled IL9. Data represent the mean of triplicate experiments. Cellular fractionation was performed as described (28Cofano F. Moore S.K. Tanaka S. Yuhki N. Landolfo S. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4064-4071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were washed once in PBS, resuspended in 0.2 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1× “Complete” protease inhibitors mixture (Boehringer Mannheim)). Cells were disrupted through a 25-gauge needle and further incubated for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were sequentially centrifuged at 700 × g for 7 min, 3500 × g for 10 min, and 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell content) was recovered, and the membrane pellet was washed once in hypotonic buffer. Membrane proteins were extracted by solubilization in CHAPS buffer (PBS, 8 mm CHAPS, complete protease inhibitor) and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Total cell extracts were obtained by RIPA buffer extraction as described above. In order to analyze hIL9R nucleotide structure in randomly ascertained individuals, we established a cohort of 50 unrelated volunteers. These volunteers were asked to report their past medical history as being nonallergic, allergic, or asthmatic. Using this criterion, 29 out of 50 volunteers were determined to be allergic and/or asthmatic. PBMCs were purified from these individuals, mitogen-stimulated, and cultured for 6 days, at which time maximal IL9R expression is found. 3N. Nicolaides, unpublished observation. Cells were then harvested, and cytoplasmic RNAs and genomic DNA were isolated. Full-length hIL9R cDNAs (see Fig. 1for a schematic representation of the hIL9R cDNA) were generated from each sample by reverse transcription and amplified by PCR. Products were then cloned into T-tailed vectors and sequenced. A comparison of sequences from an average of 10 clones from each individual enabled us (i) to determine if nucleotide variations were natural or due to Taq polymerase-induced mutations; (ii) to analyze transcription of both alleles; and (iii) to identify post-transcriptionally altered forms. Table I summarizes the frequency of the more common variants identified in our transcript analyses. Several alternative splice forms involving exons 3, 4, 5, and 8 were found as minor species. Two exon 5 splice variants were identified in which the first 5 or 29 nucleotides of the exon were deleted, resulting in a frameshift. These alternative splice variants (containing total deletion of exon 3, total deletion of exon 4, or partial deletion of exon 5) could all result in potential soluble receptors, because the transmembrane domain of the receptor is encoded by exon 7. In contrast, the splice variant lacking exon 8 could produce a receptor retaining the transmembrane domain but lacking the intracellular signaling domain encoded by the sequences of exons 8 and 9.Table IFrequency of sequence alterations detected in hIL9R transcriptCodonNucleotide changeAmino acid changeFrequency%173CAG to ΔCAGGln to ΔGln0–50310AGG to GGGArg to Gly76344CTG to CATArg to His47410–417/410–418(AGC)9 to (AGC)89 Ser to 8 Ser47Determined from an average of 10 cloned transcripts from each of 50 individuals.Determined from greater than 100 independent alleles. Open table in a new tab Determined from an average of 10 cloned transcripts from each of 50 individuals. Determined from greater than 100 independent alleles. In addition to the above described splice variants, a more commonly expressed splice variant was also identified that results from an in frame deletion of the first three nucleotides of exon 6 (corresponding to codon 173 and referred to as ΔQ receptor here on). The ΔQ receptor was found present in 47 out of 50 individuals, and its frequency (percentage of transcripts detected from an average total of 10 clones per sample) ranged up to 50%. The mean frequency of ΔQ receptor transcripts found in nonallergic and allergic and/or asthmatic individuals was 28.7% (S.E. = 1.9) and 18.3% (S.E. = 3.5), respectively. Several nucleotide variations were also identified within the coding sequences of exon 9. Polymorphisms involving codons 310 and 410–417/410–418 have been previously uncovered because of the use of different libraries during the initial cloning studies of the receptor (15Renauld J.C.

The residue at codon 310 encodes for either arginine (Arg310) or glycine (Gly310), depending on whether the first nucleotide at this codon is an adenine or a guanidine, respectively. Another sequence variation, which has been previously described (15Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5690-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Chang M.S. Engel G. Benedict C. Basu R. McNinch J. Blood. 1994; 83: 3199-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vermeesch J.R. Petit P. Kermouni A. Renuald J.C. Van Den Berghe H. Marynen P. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1997; 6: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), consists of an intragenic trinucleotide repeat (AGC) between codons 410–417 or 410–418 encoding for either 8 or 9 serines (hereafter referred to as SER8 or SER9, respectively). A novel polymorphism was found at codon 344 that results in a change from CGT (the published sequence) to CAT and produces an arginine (Arg344) to histidine (His344) substitution. In addition, we noticed a 1:1 correspondence between Arg344 and SER8 and, conversely, His344 and SER9 (see Table I). Interestingly, the hIL9R cDNA, which was originally cloned from the human megakaryoblastic leukemic cell line Mo7e (15Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5690-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), contained an Arg344 and SER9, as did the megakaryoblastic leukemic cell line UT-7 (24Chang M.S. Engel G. Benedict C. Basu R. McNinch J. Blood. 1994; 83: 3199-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prove the consistency of our experimental protocol, we extracted RNA from Mo7e cells, reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified the full-length receptor cDNA, and cloned it into T-tailed vectors. We analyzed 16 independent cDNAs and found that 6 had the Arg344-SER8 allele, while the remaining 10 clones contained the published sequence (Arg344-SER9). We also genotyped the human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line KG-1 and found that it was a His344-SER9 homozygote (an allele found in our cohort). At the present time, we do not know whether the Arg344-SER9 allele found in MO7e and UT-7 cells is a rare allele or the result of a mutational event that occurred during transformation in these tumor cells. One mechanism that can affect gene function is monoallelic expression. One could hypothesize that if this mechanism is involved in altering receptor function, then heterozygous individuals may appear to be homozygous at the transcript level. Of the 23 (out of 50) individuals that appeared to be homozygous at the transcript level, all were homozygous at the genome level, as determined by the codon 310 or 344 polymorphisms located within exon 9 (see above). These data rule out the possibility of an effect on gene expression that is due to an altered regulatory element and also confirm the previous finding that the IL9R gene escapes X inactivation in PBMCs (27Vermeesch J.R. Petit P. Kermouni A. Renuald J.C. Van Den Berghe H. Marynen P. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1997; 6: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further structure/function studies on the receptors containing the various missense changes at codons 310, 344, and 410–417/410–418 were continued in an attempt to gain further insight into the functional activity of these isoforms. In addition, the ΔQ splice variant was also studied because of its prevalence within our cohort in contrast to the other alternative splice isoforms (those lacking exons 3, 4, 5, and 8) that appeared less frequently. Cell lines were generated that expressed the various receptor isoforms in order to study receptor function (see Fig. 2 A for details on constructs). Each of the receptor variants was subcloned into the LXSN mammalian expression vector that contains a murine moloney leukemia viral long terminal repeat for constitutive expression and a neomycin resistance gene as a selectable marker. Each construct was then electroporated into the murine TS1 cell line. This cell line was derived from primary murine T-lymphocytes and was found to be dependent on murine IL9 for growth and survival, but it is not responsive to human IL9 (30Renauld J.C. Goethals A. Houssiau F. Merz H. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4235-4241PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were then analyzed by Western blot for hIL9R expression. As shown in Fig. 2 B, comparable hIL9R expression was found for all isoforms except for GR8, which showed 3-fold less expression. Interestingly, we noticed that GR8 protein ran slightly faster than GH9 when a higher electrophoretic resolution could be obtained (Fig. 2 C). The addition of human IL9 to the cells did not result in change of the migration pattern between the GR8 and GH9 receptors (lanes 4 and 6). To address the possibility that this migratory difference was due to cell-specific post-translational modifications, we transiently transfected the simian derived COS7 cells with the GR8, GR9, GH8, and GH9 expression plasmids. Cells were grown for 48 h and then harvested for protein and analyzed for IL9 receptor migration by Western blot. In these conditions, GR8 and GH8 ran faster than GH9 and GR9 (data not shown), indicating that the serine repeat, and not the Arg344/His344polymorphism, was critical for this shift in electrophoretic mobility. Studies are in progress to understand the nature of this differential mobility. TS1 survival and proliferation depend on the presence of murine IL9 and are not supported by the human cytokine. Ectopic expression of the human receptor renders these cells responsive to the human ligand (15Renauld J.C. Druez C. Kermouni A. Houssiau F. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. Proc. Natl Acad.

CD2 is a cell surface glycoprotein which is expressed on immature thymocytes and on mature T cells and NK cells (1Howard F.D. Ledbetter J.A. Wong J. Bieber C.P. Stinson E.B. Herzenberg L.A. J.

The ligand for human CD2 is CD58 (LFA-3), a ubiquitously expressed cell surface protein found on many cell types including antigen presenting cells (4Selvaraj P. Plunkett M.L. Dustin M. Sanders M.E. Shaw S. Springer T.A. Nature. 1987; 326: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar,5Krensky A.M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Robbins E. Nagy J.A. Springer T.A. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 611-616PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike integrins such as CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), the adhesion between CD2 and CD58 is not dependent on TCR1 triggering (6Dustin M.L. Springer T.A.

Rather, the CD2-CD58 interaction between T cells and their cognate partners facilitates the T cell recognition process and subsequent T cell activation (8Moingeon P. Chang H.C. Sayre P.H.

Cross-linking of CD2 molecules by specific pairs of mAbs recognizing distinct epitopes on human CD2 initiates a signaling cascade which leads to T cell cytokine production, proliferation, and cytolytic activity (11Meuer S.C. Hussey R.E. Fabbi M. Fox D. Acuto O. Fitzgerald K.A. Hodgdon J.C. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L.

For optimal mAb-mediated activation two antibody specificities are needed, one directed against conventional CD2 epitopes and the second against an activation-associated epitope of CD2, termed CD2R. The CD2R epitope has recently been mapped to the flexible linker region between the two extracellular domains of CD2 (14Li J. Smolyar A. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Its appearance coincides with reorientation of the adhesion domain (D1) relative to the membrane proximal domain (D2) of the CD2 extracellular segment. Such domain reorientation occurs upon CD58 binding to CD2 and following T cell activation (14Li J. Smolyar A. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CD2 interaction with CD58 regulates the responsiveness of activated human T cells to IL-12 (15Gollob J.A. Li J. Kawasaki H. Daley J.F. Groves C. Reinherz E.L. Ritz J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1886-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gollob J.A. Li J. Reinherz E.L. Ritz J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, both IL-12-stimulated T cell proliferation and interferon-γ production are markedly augmented by CD2 ligation. Finally, some studies have uncovered a unique role for CD2 in the regulation of anergy (17Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Griffin J.D. Gray G.S. Gribben J.G. Nadler L.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stimulation of anergized alloreactive T cells with a combination of specific alloantigen in conjunction with CD2-CD58 co-receptor ligation reverses the anergic state. In contrast, identical allostimulation but in the absence of CD2-CD58 co-ligation on T cells and allostimulators, respectively, fails to restore responsiveness (17Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Griffin J.D. Gray G.S. Gribben J.G. Nadler L.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Signaling through CD2 is dependent on its cytoplasmic domain (8Moingeon P. Chang H.C. Sayre P.H. Clayton L.K. Alcover A. Gardner P. Reinherz E.L. Immunol.

Comparison of CD2 from various species shows the highest homology occurring in this segment (21Brown M.H. Sewell W.A. Mason D.Y. Rothbard J.B. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J.

While the cytoplasmic domain has no intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity and no tyrosine residues which might serve as docking sites for SH2 domains upon phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 23Pawson T.

Med. 1991; 173: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The CD2 tail contains several proline-rich regions (19Chang H.C. Moingeon P. Lopez P. Krasnow H. Stebbins C. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two of these (PPPGHR) are known to be important in inducing IL-2 production (33Chang H.C. Moingeon P. Pedersen R. Lucich J. Stebbins C. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Related proline-rich sequences bind to SH3 domains of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family (23Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). For example, the SH3 domain of p56 has been shown to bind to the rat CD2 cytoplasmic tail at least in vitro (34Bell G.M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. Kish L. Imboden J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to residues 269–270 and 200–310 (according to the human CD2 numbers) bind to p56-GST fusion proteins (34Bell G.M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. Kish L. Imboden J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In vivo intracellular colocalization experiments, however, suggest, that p59 rather than p56 has a predominant association with CD2 (35Gassmann M. Amrein K.E. Flint N.A. Schraven B. Burn P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), perhaps by binding through the p59 SH3 domain. The activation of protein tyrosine kinases is one of the proximal steps in signaling cascades which ultimately lead to the activation of T cell effector function. For p56 it has been shown that this kinase is involved in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (36Gupta S. Weiss A. Kumar G. Wang S. Nel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of MAPK is manifold. Several studies reported that MAPK can phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors ELK, Jun, and Stat-1 and thereby participates in the regulation of gene expression (37Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). A different pathway leading to Jun activation is the Rac/JNK pathway (38Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Recently, the Pyk2 tyrosine kinase has been described, shown to be involved in the activation of JNK (39Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and has been linked to TCR signaling via p59 (40Quian D. Lev S. van-Oers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this study, we have begun to dissect the differences in TCR- and CD2-based signaling pathways. Since p56 is thought to be most important at a proximal step in CD3 signaling, we investigated the role p56 plays in CD2 signaling. To this end, we have employed the Jurkat variant JCaM1.6s which lacks functional p56 and is unable to transmit TCR signals leading to IL-2 production. We here report that although the TCR pathway is not functional in JCaM1.6s, these cells can be induced to produce IL-2 by stimulation via CD2. Furthermore, we present evidence for a p56-independent CD2 signal transduction pathway which uses Pyk2 and JNK and leads to the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site, important for initiation of IL-2 transcription.

Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and sorted for high CD2 and CD3 expression (JCaM1.6s) and further sorted for those cells which show a fast and high rise in intracellular free Ca2+ levels following CD2 stimulation (JCaM1.6s.S3). Both JCaM1.6s and JCaM1.6s.S3 were analyzed for p56 by in vitro kinase activity and p56 was found to be not enzymatically active. J77 is a CD2posCD3posCD8neg subclone of the Jurkat cell line (29Alcover A. Alberini C. Acuto O. Clayton L.K. Transy C. Spagnoli G.C. Moingeon P. Lopez P. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ca2+ assay was performed as described (43Koyasu S. Tse A.G.D. Moingeon P. Hussey R.E. Mildonian A. Hannisian J. Clayton L.K.

Increase in intracellular free Ca2+ in Indo-1 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) loaded cells was induced by either a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T112 and anti-T113(1:100) or 20 μg/ml biotinylated RW28C8 alone or by further cross-linking with 100 μg/ml avidin (Sigma). Maximal Ca2+influx was induced by the addition of 10 μg/ml 4-bromo-calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma). The analysis was performed on an EPICS V cell sorter (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (43Koyasu S. Tse A.G.D. Moingeon P. Hussey R.E. Mildonian A. Hannisian J. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (1 × 107) were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with either a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T112 and anti-T113 (1:100) or the anti-CD3ε mAb 2AD2A2 (1:100). Cells were then washed with ice-cold TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), resuspended in lysis buffer (1 × 107 cells/ml; 1% Triton X-100 in TBS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 0.2 TIU/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 1 mm PMSF (Sigma), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4 (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), 5 mmNa2H2P2O7 (Sigma), and 5 mm sodium fluoride (Fisher) or 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate (Sigma)) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of postnuclear lysate with 10 μl of GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) preincubated with the respective Abs. Beads bound immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and TBS and were eluted by boiling in SDS (Laemmli) sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted as described below. Lysis of cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above. After washing with lysis buffer and kinase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) the beads bound immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μm ATP and were incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at room temperature. Kinase reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm EDTA. After washing 3 times with lysis buffer/EDTA and once with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, the phosphorylated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE and after drying the gels were subjected to autoradiography. Some in vitro kinase assays were carried out in the presence of 10 μg/sample poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) (Sigma). The kinase reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer and the samples were further processed as described above. Western blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes of proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard procedures. Protein detection was carried out by incubating the membranes with 1:1000 dilutions of specific mAbs (4G10, PLC-γ1) or rabbit heteroantisera (ZAP70, p56, p59, Pyk2, pMAPK, Erk1/MAPK, Raf) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed with TBS/Triton X-100 (0.05%) and incubated with 1:2000 dilutions of HRPO-labeled anti-mouse IgG2b, anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit Abs (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS/Triton X-100, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham International, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and exposing the membranes to films for various time intervals. Unspecific binding of Abs was inhibited by preincubating the membranes with blocking buffer (TBS containing either 5% fetal calf serum or 5% non-fat dry milk and 10 mmNaN3) for at least 2 h at room temperature. 1 × 107 cells were stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C with either a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T112 and anti-T113 (1:100), the anti-CD3ε mAb 2AD2A2 (1:100), or 25 ng/ml phorbol ester (PMA). Cells were then washed with ice-cold TBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of JNK-lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.7, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 mm PMSF (Sigma), 0.1 mmNa3VO4 (Fisher Scientific), 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate (Sigma) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were then diluted 1:4 to a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.7, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 mm PMSF (Sigma), 0.1 mm Na3VO4 (Fisher Scientific), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma) and rotated for 4 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Pharmacia) preincubated with anti-JNK Ab. Bead-bound immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and kinase buffer (20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and subsequently resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 2 μg/sample GST-Jun fusion protein (kindly provided by M. Karin) and were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS (Laemmli) sample buffer and the samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and after drying the gels were subjected to autoradiography. 1 × 105 cells/well were stimulated in Immulon enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) with either PMA alone (25 ng/ml, Sigma), PMA plus a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T112 and anti-T113 (1:100), PMA plus the anti-CD3ε mAb RW28C8 (1 μg/well, precoated overnight onto the plates at 4 °C) or PMA plus calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μg/ml). After 48 h culture supernatants were harvested and examined by human IL-2 specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Endogen Inc., Cambridge, MA). 5 × 107 cells, unstimulated or stimulated for 4 or 6 h at 37 °C with either a combination of stimulatory anti-CD2 (anti-T112 plus anti-T113, 1:100) or with a 1:100 dilution of anti-CD3ε mAb 2AD2A2, were incubated on ice for 15 min with 400 μl of ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) and spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 s. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer C (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) and left for 30 min on ice. After spinning for 5 min at full speed, the supernatants were removed, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by BCA Assay (Pierce) and 10 μg/sample were used in the EMSA. The double-stranded oligonucleotides (AP1 consensus, NF-κB consensus, NF-AT consensus, and Oct 1 consensus) and the Abs for the supershifts (anti-c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FRA1, FRA2, Fos-B, NF-κB p50 and p65) used in these EMSA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 10 μg of NE were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) for 30 min on ice with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim) and either 2 μl of the respective Ab or a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide as competitor. Subsequently, 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligo were added and incubated with the NE at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The proteins were separated on 5.2 (EMSA) or 4% (supershift) gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. JCaM1.6 is a Jurkat cell line variant, which lacks functional p56 and is unresponsive to TCR stimulation such that it fails to generate IL-2 upon anti-CD3 cross-linking (42Straus D. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that different TCR and/or CD2 surface expression levels between Jurkat and JCaM1.6 might account for a component of the signaling defect, JCaM1.6 cells were sorted on a FACSVantage for high co-expression of both CD2 and CD3, equivalent to the surface expression number of these receptors found on the Jurkat line J77 (Fig. 1 A). The sorted JCaM1.6 (referred to as JCaM1.6s) as well as JCaM1.6s cells, further sorted for maximal Ca2+ mobilization upon CD2 cross-linking (termed JCaM1.6s.S3), were analyzed by in vitro kinase assay for p56 autophosphorylation and poly(Glu-Tyr) substrate phosphorylation activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, and in contrast to J77, JCaM1.6s does not express detectable amounts of functional p56, as judged by in vitro autophosphorylation of unstimulated, anti-CD2-, or anti-CD3ε-stimulated JCaM1.6s cells. Similarly, by in vitro kinase assay, anti-p56 antibody immunoprecipitates from JCaM1.6s.S3 cells do not reveal autophosphorylation activity or any enzymatic activity using the poly(Glu-Tyr) substrate (data not shown). Although TCR cross-linking by anti-CD3ε mAb or anticlonotypic mAb does not activate JCaM1.6 cells (42Straus D. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), the status of the CD2 pathway in these cells was not defined. To first address the integrity of CD2 mediated signaling, we analyzed Ca2+mobilization in both JCaM1.6s, the Ca2+ sorted JCaM1.6 s.S3 and J77 following anti-CD2 or anti-CD3ε stimulation. In contrast to J77, in which both anti-CD2 and anti-CD3ε mAbs induced a long lasting and high rise in intracellular free Ca2+, only anti-CD2 stimulation via the combination of anti-T112 plus anti-T113 mAbs resulted in a substantial Ca2+influx in JCaM1.6s (data not shown). After sorting, the Ca2+ response of JCaM1.6s.S3 to anti-CD2 stimulation was equal or even higher than in J77 (Fig. 2 A). Addition of biotinylated anti-CD3ε mAb alone was not sufficient for Ca2+mobilization in JCaM1.6s (data not shown) or in JCaM1.6s.S3 (Fig. 2 A). Rather extensive cross-linking of the biotinylated anti-CD3ε mAb by avidin was required to lead to a detectable Ca2+ transient. This appears as a low magnitude rise in Ca2+ of short duration and most probably is due to the initial release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+stores (Fig. 2 A) (41Weiss M.J. Daley J.F. Hodgdon J.C.

Given that phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 leads to increased phosphatidylinositol turnover and the release of Ca2+from intracellular Ca2+ stores (45Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar, 46Imboden J.B. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 446Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation status of PLC-γ1 was determined prior to and following stimulation in the J77 and JCaM1.6s cells. In J77, the stimulation via both CD2 and CD3ε results in a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 as shown by anti-Tyr(P) Western blot analysis of anti-PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, only activation via CD2 leads to a clear tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in JCaM1.6s (Fig. 2 B), whereas anti-CD3ε stimulation had a minor effect (Fig. 2 B). These differences were not a consequence of gel loading of the anti-PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates as revealed by sequential Western blotting with anti-PLC-γ1 antibody. To next determine whether the CD2 pathway in JCaM1.6s could elicit IL-2 production, we determined the levels of IL-2 secretion in the supernatant of anti-CD2 stimulated JCaM1.6s cells in a human IL-2 specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Table I) and by intracellular staining of IL-2 in these stimulated JCaM1.6s (data not shown). Parallel analysis was performed in the same cells following anti-CD3ε mAb stimulation. As shown in Table I, stimulation via CD2 in JCaM1.6s cells results in substantial IL-2 production, in fact to a level equivalent to 50% of the maximal induction measured upon bypassing receptor triggering with the combination of calcium ionophore plus PMA. In contrast, and as expected, no IL-2 production is induced by TCR cross-linking by anti-CD3ε. Data from different subclones of JCaM1.6s obtained by sequential sorting for Ca2+mobilization following CD2 stimulation are shown (JCaM1.6s.S1, JCaM1.6s.S2, and JCaM1.6s.S3). The amount of IL-2 produced increases with enhanced Ca2+ responsiveness to CD2 stimulation.Table ICD2 triggering induces IL-2 production in the absence of p56StimulusIL-2 (ng/ml)NoneA23187α-CD3εα-CD2J770.0517.956.1723.56JCaM1.6s0.016.090.082.60JCaM1.6s.S10.015.770.092.77JCaM1.6s.S20.0514.390.177.36JCaM1.6s.S30.0343.760.1621.13Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for IL-2 content after 48 h stimulation with A23187, α-CD3ε mAb RW28C8, or α-CD2 mAbs anti-T112 plus anti-T113; or after no stimulation (none).

PMA was added to all wells at 25 ng/ml. S.D. of triplicate samples <5% for all entries. Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of kinases such as the Src kinases p56 or p59 or the related tyrosine kinase ZAP70 are major events in TCR signaling and are also thought to be involved in signal transduction via CD2 (47Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The Jurkat variant JCaM1.6s gives us the opportunity to investigate these events in the absence of p56. To this end, we performed a series of Western blots with J77 and JCaM1.6s cells following anti-CD2 or anti-CD3ε stimulation. In J77, activation via both CD2 and CD3 results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p56 and the appearance of a second p60 band due to the serine/threonine phosphorylation of p56 (48Fischer S. Marie-Cardine A. Ramos-Morales F. Bougeret C. Soula M. Maridonneau-Parini I. Benarous R. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 605-609PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). As expected, both lck bands are absent in the phosphotyrosine blot of p56 immunoprecipitates from JCaM1.6s. Note that the p58 band appearing in the Tyr(P) blot of both J77 and JCaM1.6s is nonspecific, being unrelated to p56. Reanalysis of the stripped blot with anti-lck antiserum shows that these p56- and p60-phosphorylated proteins in J77 indeed represent p56 (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). In J77, stimulation via the CD3 pathway leads to a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70, whereas activation via CD2 induces weaker but definite ZAP70 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, upper panel).

We observed that the laminins expressed predominantly in normal adult rat or mouse skeletal muscle bound α-dystroglycan in a Ca2+-dependent, ionic strength-sensitive, but heparin-insensitive manner as we had observed previously with purified placental merosin (Pall, E. A., Bolton, K. M., and Ervasti, J. M. 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 271, 3817–3821). Rat skeletal muscle laminins partially purified by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography also bound α-dystroglycan without sensitivity to heparin. We also confirm previous studies of dystrophicdy/dy mouse skeletal muscle showing that the α2 chain of merosin is reduced markedly and that the laminin α1 chain is not up-regulated detectably. However, we further observed a quantitative decrease in the expression of laminin β/γ chain immunoreactivity in α2 chain-deficient dy/dy skeletal muscle and reduced α-dystroglycan binding activity in laminin extracts fromdy/dy muscle. Most interestingly, the α-dystroglycan binding activity of residual laminins expressed in merosin-deficientdy/dy skeletal muscle was inhibited dramatically (69 ± 19%) by heparin. These results identify a potentially important biochemical difference between the laminins expressed in normal and dy/dy skeletal muscle which may provide a molecular basis for the inability of other laminin variants to compensate fully for the deficiency of merosin in some forms of muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2013882789,"Abstract The integrase protein of bacteriophage λ mediates recombination via four distinct pathways. The recent in vitro reconstitution of the efficient bidirectional reaction between two attLtenP′1 target sites now allows comparisons of this pathway, known as the bent-L pathway, with the inefficient bidirectional straight-L pathway and with the efficient but unidirectional pathways of integration and excision. To this end, a series of higher order intermediates of the bent-L pathway was characterized using gel mobility shift assays, two-dimensional gel analysis, and footprinting. The analysis spans the initial binding of proteins to individual DNA target sites, synapsis of two partner DNA targets, and strand exchange. This study identifies a presynaptic “checkpoint” of recombination. It shows that synapsis is a slow step in the recombination reaction, while subsequent strand exchange is comparatively fast. Synaptic complexes contain a preponderance of recombinant products, suggesting that an energetically favorable but somewhat subtle conformational change drives strand exchange. In addition, comparison of wild-type integrase with a catalytically defective mutant of integrase, IntF, showed that, in addition to the catalysis defect, this mutant has different DNA-binding properties than the wild-type protein."

We show here that these DNA sequence-dependent conformational changes alter the efficiency with which the repressor activates transcription from 434 PRM. Several lines of evidence suggest that binding site sequence affects the repressor's ability to activate transcription by altering the accessibility of the activation surface on the repressor to RNA polymerase.

Many prokaryotic transcriptional activators bind to a specific DNA sequence at or near the promoter and affect transcription initiation by making direct contacts with RNA polymerase. Several studies have shown that changing the juxtaposition of the activator binding site with respect to the promoter can alter the effectiveness of the activator protein (2Gaston K. Bell A. Kolb A. Buc H. Busby S. Cell. 1990; 62: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Woody S.T. Fong R.S.-C. Gussin G.N. J. Mol.

Moreover, the ability of certain proteins to activate or repress transcription initiation depends on the sequence to which they bind (6Monsalve M. Mencia M. Rojo F. Salas M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that proper alignment of the activator surface and the RNA polymerase is critical for functional catalysis of transcription initiation by the activator protein. Hence, alterations in the geometry of the ternary complex formed between RNA polymerase, the activator protein, and DNA may be expected to influence the efficiency of transcription initiation. A variety of sequence-dependent DNA structure effects, such as twist and twisting deformability of the DNA, the width of the major and/or minor grooves, the ability of the DNA to bend or sequence-directed intrinsic bends within the DNA, have been shown to influence protein-DNA complex stability (8Koudelka G.B.

Given that the activation surfaces of the transcriptional activator proteins must be precisely aligned with their specific targets, DNA sequence-dependent differences in the conformation of the activator protein-DNA complexes may alter their efficiency of transcriptional activation. Despite this realization, very little data exist concerning the role of DNA sequence-dependent structure on transcriptional activator function. This is in part the result of the lack of knowledge concerning the effects of variations in binding site sequence on the conformation of protein-DNA complexes. In this paper, we explore the effects of sequence-dependent differences in the conformation of a bacteriophage 434 repressor-DNA complex on its transcriptional activation function. The repressor protein of bacteriophage 434 is a helix-turn-helix-containing DNA-binding protein encoded by thecI gene. This protein controls the developmental fate of the phage by acting as a transcriptional regulator. The bacteriophage chromosome contains two operator regions OR and OL, each of which is divided into three repressor binding sites. The repressor binds to each of six binding sites or operators in the bacteriophage chromosome with differing affinities. This binding site discrimination is critical for the phage's choice between lytic and lysogenic development. For example, in OR, the repressor binds with highest affinity to two sites, OR1 and OR2. In this configuration, the repressor bound at OR2 activates transcription at the PRMpromoter, presumably by contacting RNA polymerase, leading to expression of the genes that are responsible for maintenance of the lysogenic state (13Bushman F.D. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9353-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Bushman F.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This binding configuration also permits the repressor to concurrently inhibit transcription of genes needed for lytic phage growth by repressing transcription from the PRpromoter. Higher concentrations of the repressor result in its binding to OR3, causing repression of PRMtranscription. The repressor binds its site as a dimer of identical subunits. The sequences of these sites display incomplete rotational symmetry (for examples, see Fig. 1). The 2-fold related “recognition” α-helices, one from each protein monomer, lie in successive major grooves on one face of the DNA. Each recognition helix is positioned in the major groove so that its side chains can make base-specific contacts with the outermost 4 or 5 base pairs in each half of the operator sequence. The repressor makes no base-specific contacts to the central 4 bases of the site. Earlier work established that sequence-specific differences in DNA structure and/or flexibility of the noncontacted bases at position 6–9 at the center of the 434 operator affect both the affinity of the 434 repressor for operator and modulates the repressor's ability to recognize the base pairs at specific operator positions (1Bell A.C.

First, sequence-dependent differences in the structure of the unbound DNA and the varying abilities of these structures to be distorted affect overall affinity of operator for the repressor (8Koudelka G.B. Harbury P.H. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4633-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Second, the sequence of the noncontacted bases affects specificity and affinity by preventing optimal interaction between the repressor's DNA contacting residues and the contacted bases (1Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These conformational changes are manifested in an increased nuclease sensitivity of particular DNA sequences in complex with the repressor. The effects of noncontacted bases sequence on operator affinity for the repressor are important in determining the life cycle choices of the phage; the differences between the noncontacted base sequences of OR1, OR2, and OR3 prevent the repressor from recognizing the position 4 base in OR3, but allow recognition of the base at this position in OR1 and OR2 (15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)1. The binding of the 434 repressor to OR2 is necessary and sufficient for activation of PRM transcription (14Bushman F.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When bound at OR2, the repressor closely approaches RNA polymerase at PRM (13Bushman F.D. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9353-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since the conformation of the 434 repressor-DNA complexes vary with DNA sequence, it follows that the precise alignment of the activation surface on the repressor may vary with binding site sequence. We present data supporting the assertion that the conformation of the repressor-operator complex, as modified by sequence-dependent differences in DNA structure, critically affects the ability of the 434 repressor to activate transcription. We also discuss the structural alteration that may be related to sequence-dependent differences in repressor transcriptional activation. Wild-type and mutant 434 repressors were prepared as described by Wharton (43Wharton, R. P. (1986) Determinants of 434 Repressor DNA Binding Specificity. Ph.D thesis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MAGoogle Scholar). Sigma-saturated wild-typeE. coli RNA polymerase was obtained from Epicentre Technologies or prepared as described (17Tang H. Kim Y. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 130-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Holo-RNA polymerase bearing a deletion of the COOH-terminal domain of the α-subunit (residues 201–310) was reconstituted from subunits by the method described (17Tang H. Kim Y. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 130-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [α-32P]UTP and [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Transcription reactions were programmed with DNA fragment isolated from variants of the plasmid pJX. pJX was constructed by isolating a 150-base pair EcoRI and BamHI fragment from pRP16 (18Lauer G. Pastrana R. Sherley J. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 139-147PubMed Google Scholar) by agarose gel electrophoresis. This fragment, which bears wild-type 434 OR, PR, and PRM, was inserted into pEMBL 8+ (19Dente L. Cesareni G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) that had been previously cut withEcoRI and BamHI. The 450-bp transcription template was prepared by isolating the 450-base pair PvuII fragment from this plasmid. Point mutants in OR2, OR3 and/or promoter sequence (see Fig. 1 for sequences) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as described in Ref. 20Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, using pJX as the polymerase chain reaction template. A control template fragment containing the RNA-I promoter was isolated from pJX and mixed in equimolar ratios with experimental template. Transcription reaction were performed essentially as described (14Bushman F.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, each DNA template (at 5 nm) was incubated without or with varying amounts of 434 repressor for 10 min at 23 °C in the transcription buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. Except for experiments to determine the time course of run-off transcript formation, RNA polymerase was added to a final concentration of 50 nm, and incubation was continued for another 15 min at 37 °C to allow the formation of open complexes. The transcription reaction was started by the addition of 0.25 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP, 0.04 mm UTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and 0.1 mg/ml heparin. After 10 min of further incubation, the reactions were stopped by addition of formamide dye mix (90% formamide) and fractionated on 6% denaturing gels. The amounts of RNA transcripts resulting from initiation at PRand PRM were quantified relative to the amount of RNA-I transcript by PhosphorImager analysis of these gels. KMnO4footprinting was performed essentially as described (11Wu L. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18975-18981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 400-base pair PvuII-HindIII DNA fragment derived from the desired pJX derivative was 3′ end-labeled using the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP. This fragment was incubated without or with varying concentrations of 434 repressor at 23 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of RNA polymerase. After varying times of additional incubation at 37 °C, the DNA was exposed to 10 mm KMnO4 for 1 min. The oxidation reaction was stopped by adding 1.3 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and the DNA was purified by two ethanol precipitations. The precipitated DNA fragments were dissolved in 100 μl of 1 m piperidine and incubated for 15 min at 90 °C to induce cleavage at the modified bases. The DNA was then diluted in the same volume of double distilled H2O, lyophilized twice, dissolved in formamide dye mix, and fractionated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The products were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. DNase I footprinting assays were performed essentially as described in Ref. 21Wu L. Vertino A. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9134-9135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The 400-base pairPvuII-HindIII DNA fragment was 3′ end-labeled as described above. The DNA was mixed with increasing amounts of 434 repressor in transcription buffer. After 10 min of incubation at 23 °C sufficient DNase I was added to give, on average, one cleavage/DNA molecule in 5 min of further incubation. The digested samples were precipitated with ethanol and butanol-2, dissolved in a formamide dye, and resolved on 6% denaturing gels. Since changes in the DNA sequence bound by the repressor affect the conformation of the 434 repressor-operator complex (1Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), 1E. Ziedins and G. Koudelka, unpublished results. we hypothesized that these sequence changes may alter the ability of the repressor to interact with the RNA polymerase. This idea was tested by examining the ability of the repressor to activate PRM transcription when bound at wild-type and mutant OR regions. At wild-type OR in the absence of the repressor, only transcripts resulting from RNA polymerase initiation at the PR promoter are detectable (Fig. 2 A). As shown previously (13Bushman F.D. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9353-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Bushman F.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), adding increasing amounts of the 434 repressor to the reaction inhibits transcription from PR and stimulates transcription from PRM. Maximum stimulation of PRM occurs at 800 nm repressor, the concentration corresponding to that needed to completely occupy OR1 and OR2 under these conditions (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). These findings illustrate the positive transcriptional regulatory role of the repressor at PRM and the negative effect of the repressor on PR transcription (14Bushman F.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Blackwell Press, Palo Alto, CA1986Google Scholar). As was also shown previously, adding higher concentrations of the repressor (≥3.2 μm) results in repression of PRM transcription. Binding results show that repression of PRM results from OR3 becoming occupied by the repressor (Fig. 3 A), thereby preventing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter.Figure 3Binding of wild-type 434 repressor to on wild-type OR1+, OR2+, OR3+ (A), OR1+, OR2+OR3− (B), and OR1+, OR2–4G, OR3− (C) templates. DNase I footprinting conditions are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Repressor concentrations were increased in 2-fold steps starting at 50 nm protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With wild-type 434 OR, the differences between the concentrations of the repressor required to stimulate PRMand those that repress it are not large (Fig. 2 A). To increase this difference, we introduced a mutation in OR3 that decreases its affinity for the repressor without disturbing PRM (see Fig. 1 for sequences). Fig. 2 B shows that the repressor activates PRM from this OR3− template as well as it does from the wild-type promoter. About 3-fold more repressor is needed to begin to see repression of PRM transcription on this template than on the wild-type template. As expected, the decreased ability of the repressor to repress PRM transcription is due to inhibition of the repressor binding to OR3 (Fig. 3 B). To facilitate examination of the effects of OR2 mutations on transcription from PRM in the studies described below, we used the OR3− template as starting material. Comparing Fig. 2, B and C, shows that transcription activation of PRM by the repressor bound at an OR2 bearing an A → G mutation at position 4 (see Fig. 1 for sequences) is reduced as compared with that seen when the repressor is bound to wild-type OR2. Fig. 3 Cshows that the ∼3-fold reduction in transcription stimulation is seen even though the repressor has completely occupied the mutant OR2. Fig. 3 C also shows that the decreased activation is not due to the inhibitory effect of partial occupancy of OR3 by the repressor on these templates. On this template, the repressor appears to be unable to specifically bind OR3 at concentrations ≥ 6.4 μm. Therefore, the decreased activation by the repressor from the mutant OR2 is a result of a DNA sequence-induced disruption of the activating signal from the DNA-bound repressor to RNA polymerase and not by affecting binding site occupancy. To begin to examine the mechanism of how position 4 mutation affects transcription activation by the repressor bound at OR2, we determined the salt concentration dependence of transcription activation by the repressor. Previous studies (1Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)1showed that both the conformation and stability of wild-type operator-repressor complexes are insensitive to salt concentration. However, we also showed that position 4 A → G mutation increases the salt dependence of operator affinity for the repressor, with corresponding changes in the conformation of the repressor-operator complex (15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).1 The data in Fig. 4 show that the level of repressor-activated PRM transcription from wild-type OR2 is unaffected by changing the salt concentration between 50 and 100 mm NaCl. As we anticipated from the binding studies (1Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar),1 the concentration of repressor needed to maximally stimulate PRM is also unaffected by changes in salt concentration (not shown). In contrast to the results obtained with the OR2+ template, increasing salt concentration decreases the maximal level of repressor-stimulated transcription of PRM on the template bearing an A → G change at position 4 in OR2. Despite the increased sensitivity of the repressor's binding to the mutant OR2, binding experiments show that at either 50 or 100 mm salt maximal PRM stimulation occurs when the repressor completely occupies the mutant OR2 (not shown). Hence, the effect of salt on transcription activation from the position 4 mutant operator mirrors its effect on binding to the repressor. We established previously that position 4 mutation affects affinity by changing the conformation of the repressor-operator complex (1Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).1 Thus, these position 4-induced conformational changes may also affect the repressor transcription activation. Results of previously reported binding experiments showed that the conformation of the repressor-operator complexes bearing position 4 substitution can be returned to a configuration that resembles the wild-type complex by changing the identity of the base at position 6 (15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To verify that position 4 base sequence affects the repressor's ability to activate transcription by altering the conformation of the repressor-operator complex, we changed the identity of the base at operator position 6 in different position 4 base sequence contexts and measured the repressor's ability to activate PRMtranscription on these templates. Fig. 5shows that changing the position 6 base pair from G·C to either T·A or A·T partially overcomes the deleterious effect of the position 4 A → G change on transcriptional activation by the repressor. Consistent with the partial effect of position 6 mutation on correcting the repressor binding deficiency of a position 4 mutant binding site (15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the effect of position 6 mutation on restoring transcriptional activation by the repressor is not complete. This observation suggests a strong correlation between the conformation of the repressor-operator complex and the efficiency with which the repressor can activate transcription. In contrast with the favorable effects of position 6 mutation on the repressor transcription activation on the position 4 mutant OR2 site, changing position 6 in the context of the wild-type position 4 sequence decreases the ability of the repressor to activate transcription. In the context of a position 4 A·T base sequence, changing the base at position 6 from G·C → T·A decreases transcriptional activation by about 12%, whereas changing position 6 to A·T decreases the repressor's ability to activate transcription by 40%. The observed differences in the relative effect of position 6 substitution on activation in wild-type OR2 correlate with their relative effect on the conformation of the repressor-operator complex. Taken together, the data in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5indicate that changing the sequence of the binding site of the 434 repressor alters the ability of the repressor to activate transcription. These sequence-dependent effects occur either upon changing the sequence of contacted or noncontacted bases. To examine whether DNA sequence-induced structural changes uniquely affect transcription activation by the repressor, we examined the effect of changing Gln-33, one of the residues that contact operator position 4, to alanine. This protein sequence change relaxes the position 4 base specificity of the repressor (23Koudelka G.B. Lam C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23812-23817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analyses show that changing this residue causes the DNA phosphate backbone at operator position 4 to move closer to the protein and also changes the relative rotation of the two DNA-bound monomers (see Ref. 26Harrison S.C. Aggarwal A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 933-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). 2D. Rodgers and S. C. Harrison, personal communication.Relative to the wild-type repressor, the Gln-33 → Ala change decreases the ability of the repressor to activate transcription from wild-type OR2 by ∼2.5-fold (data not shown). Interestingly, the effect of changing position 4 from A·T → G·C has a smaller effect on transcriptional activation by the Ala-33 repressor than it does on the wild-type repressor. The smaller effect of the DNA mutation on activation by the Ala-33 repressor correlates with the decreased effect of the operator sequence change on binding of this protein. These observations are consistent with the idea that the position 4 A → G mutation influences the repressor's ability to activate transcription by altering the conformation of the repressor-operator complex. A trivial explanation for the effect of position 4 mutation on transcriptional activation is that the A → G change affects the ability of RNA polymerase to bind the promoter. The change in OR2 is 46 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of PRM and is thereby in a position unlikely to affect interaction of the promoter DNA with the ς70 subunit. However, DNA base changes in this region of the PRMpromoter may affect protein contacts made by the carboxyl-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNA polymerase (24Gussin G.N. Olson C. Igarashi K. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tang Y. Murakami K. Ishihama A. DeHaseth P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6945-6951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this idea, we examined the effect of OR2 mutation on the ability of the repressor to activate transcription of an RNA polymerase bearing an α-subunit in which the carboxyl-terminal domain of this subunit has been deleted. Our results show that changing position 4 from A → G similarly decreases repressor-activated transcription by both wild-type RNA polymerase and RNA polymerase bearing the truncated α-subunit (data not shown). The identical effect of the position 4 sequence change on the amount of repressor-activated transcription by these two polymerases shows that the transcription defect is not due to effects on the protein DNA interactions of the α-subunit. Insight into how the position 4 sequence changes affect the repressor's ability to activate transcription requires an understanding of how the repressor normally stimulates transcription. The repressor could function by recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter, or it may stimulate transcription by increasing the rate of an RNA polymerase-promoter complex isomerization step. To begin to distinguish between these alternatives, we altered the sequence of the −35 region of PRM and characterized the ability of RNA polymerase to transcribe these templates in the absence and presence of the repressor (see Fig. 1 for sequences). Inspection of the sequence of PRM reveals that this promoter bears nonconsensus sequences in both −35 and −10 regions. Changing the sequence of the −35 region of PRM toward consensus greatly increases the ability of RNA polymerase to transcribe this DNA in the absence of the repressor (Fig. 6 A). Since the −35 regions of PR and PRM overlap, changing the −35 sequence of PRM changes the −35 sequence of PR away from consensus. As expected from this sequence change, Fig. 6 A also shows that the mutation decreases the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription at PR. The repressor is unable to stimulate transcription on the template bearing the improved PRM −35 region (Fig. 6 B). Both footprinting (data not shown) and the observed inhibition of PR transcription (Fig. 6 B) indicate that repressor binding is unperturbed by the −35 change in PRM. These observations, together with the finding that changing the sequence of the −10 region of the PRM promoter toward consensus has no effect on transcription initiation in the absence of repressor (data not shown), are consistent with the idea that the low level of transcription from wild-type PRM may be due to imperfect interactions between RNA polymerase and the −35 region of the promoter. In the wild-type promoter, the repressor may function to replace or stabilize these non-ideal protein-DNA contacts (see below). The observation that the repressor is unable to activate transcription from the −35 mutant promoter suggests that the repressor activates transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase to PRM. This idea was tested by following the time course of open complex formation in parallel with the time course for the formation of run-off transcripts in the presence of the repressor on templates bearing either wild-type or mutant OR2. Fig. 7 B shows that the amount of open complex formed, as measured by KMnO4 sensitivity, increases with time on both wild-type and mutant templates. These increases are matched by increases in the amount of run-off transcript formed (Fig. 7 A). Analysis of these data reveals that the rates at which both open complexes and run-off transcripts are formed are similar and unaffected by the sequence of OR2. If the OR2 mutation affected the repressor's ability to stimulate a rate-limiting RNA polymerase isomerization step that precedes open complex formation, we would expect that the rate of open complex and transcript formation would be decreased. This is clearly not seen. Moreover, the observation that the rate of run-off transcription matches the rate of open complex formation on both the wild-type and mutant templates shows that the OR2 mutation is not affecting any potential repressor-stimulated events in the transition of RNA polymerase from the initiating to elongating states. The results in Fig. 7, A and B, show that both the amount of run-off transcripts formed and extent of open complexes detected on the mutant OR2 templates are lower than those observed with the wild-type OR2 template. This finding is consistent with a lowered affinity of RNA polymerase for the mutant template-repressor complex, as compared with the wild-type case. These results suggest that the OR2 A → G mutation alters the ability of the repressor to stabilize RNA polymerase contacts with the promoter and not RNA polymerase isomerization steps. Moreover, the observation that the overall yield of transcripts is affected to a greater extent by OR2 mutation than is the amount of open complexes formed is also consistent with this suggestion. Decreasing the amount of initial RNA polymerase promoter complexes decreases the overall flux through the pathway toward transcript formation. Since open complex formation precedes transcript initiation, the amount of open complexes should be less affected by decreased RNA polymerase binding affinity than is transcript formation. The data presented here indicate that the ability of a regulatory protein to activate transcription depends upon the sequence of its DNA binding site. Changing the sequences of contacted or noncontacted bases in the binding site of the 434 repressor alters its ability to activate transcription from PRM. These DNA sequence changes appear to affect transcription by altering the conformation of the protein-DNA complex. Having shown that the conformation of a protein-DNA complex can regulate its ability to activate transcription, we would like to ascertain how the change in conformation disrupts transmission of the activating signal from the 434 repressor to RNA polymerase. However, before we can do this, we must first know the nature of the activation signal transmitted by the repressor. Two models for the signal transmission can be imagined. In the first model, the repressor may stimulate transcription from PRM by inducing the formation of a particular DNA structure. Changing the DNA sequence, and thereby its structure, may disrupt the signal. Alternatively, the repressor may stimulate transcription by directly interacting with RNA polymerase. Changing the conformation of the repressor-operator complex may compromise the quality of this interaction by decreasing the accessibility of the surface of the repressor that is responsible for interacting with RNA polymerase. Two lines of evidence suggest that the repressor stimulates transcription via a direct protein contact with RNA polymerase. First, Bushman et al. (27Bushman F.D. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 54: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) identified mutations in the 434 repressor that do not affect DNA binding, but are defective in transcriptional activation. Therefore, the DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions of the repressor are separable, consistent with the idea that the repressor activates transcription by making a protein-protein contact with RNA polymerase. Together with structural studies (28Aggarwal A. Rodgers D.W. Drottar M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Science. 1988; 242: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 29Shimon L.J.W. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the results of biochemical and genetic experiments indicate that these repressor mutations lie in a region that should be in direct apposition with the ς70 subunit of RNA polymerase (14Bushman F.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Bushman F.D. Anderson J.E. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Nature. 1985; 316: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, Fig. 5 shows that identical position 6 sequence changes made in two different position 4 backgrounds have opposite effects on transcriptional activation by DNA-bound 434 repressor. It is difficult to imagine that similar sequence changes could affect DNA structure in precisely opposite ways depending on the sequence at position 4. Hence, the 434 repressor appears to activate transcription by making a direct protein contact with RNA polymerase. Thus, changes in the conformation of the repressor-operator complex appears to interfere with transcriptional activation by the repressor by altering the geometry of the interaction between the repressor and RNA polymerase. Knowing that the repressor-operator complex structure modulates the interaction between the repressor and RNA polymerase permits us to ask how DNA sequence changes give rise to the transcriptional effects. Our previous work shows that changing the sequence of bases at operator positions 4 and/or 6 can result in an alteration of the relative position of the protein with respect to the DNA phosphate backbone (15Bell A.C. Koudelka G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). How might these structural alterations affect the 434 repressor-RNA polymerase interaction? One possibility is that the alteration in the relative position of the repressor with respect to the DNA phosphate backbone misaligns RNA polymerase with the activating surface of the repressor. We tested this idea by measuring the distance between a residue in the activating surface of the repressor and the DNA phosphate that is known to be contacted by both RNA polymerase and the repressor in the ternary transcription complex. We analyzed the three-dimensional structures of the 434 repressor and its mutants bound to several different DNA binding sites (28Aggarwal A. Rodgers D.W. Drottar M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Science. 1988; 242: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 29Shimon L.J.W. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Rodgers D.W. Harrison S.C. Structure. 1993; 1: 227-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)2 with attention to the distance between Glu-19, the residue in part responsible for transcription activation by the 434 repressor, and the “shared” phosphate that is 5′ to the position 9 base. These measurements show that this distance is ≥ 4 Å longer in the wild-type repressor-OR2 complex (31Rodgers D.W. Harrison S.C. Structure. 1993; 1: 227-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) 3Protein Data Bank ID code 1RPE. than it is in complexes between repressor and operators bearing a G·C base pair at position 4 (29Shimon L.J.W. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) 4Protein Data Bank ID code 1PER.. The smaller distance between these two groups is also found in complexes between the wild-type operator and the repressor bearing the Gln-33 → Ala substitution. 5D. Rodgers and S. C. Harrison, unpublished results. These observations suggest that the structural change imparted by the protein and DNA sequence alterations decreases the repressor's ability to activate transcription by preventing RNA polymerase from easily accessing the activating surface of the repressor. The structural explanation for the transcription data suggests an inherent inflexibility in the activation mechanism of the 434 repressor that is distinct from other prokaryotic activators such as CAP (32Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the mutations in the 434 repressor that decrease its ability to activate transcription are located in the first helix of its helix-turn-helix unit. This structural unit is also responsible for governing DNA binding by the repressor. At least one of the targets for the activation signal is likely to be located in the segment of the ς70 subunit of RNA polymerase that contacts the −35 region of the promoter (33Kuldell N.

The constraints imposed by proximity of the DNA binding regions with protein-protein interfaces in both repressor and RNA polymerase, and the necessity for DNA binding by each, imply that changes in the geometry of the repressor's interaction with operator and/or the orientation of the two repressor monomers on DNA would profoundly affect the geometry of the protein-protein contact. The DNA-induced alterations in repressor-operator conformation appear to affect transcription activation by preventing the repressor from stabilizing the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction. Since the repressor is unable to stimulate transcription by RNA polymerase strongly bound at the PRM promoter bearing a consensus −35 region (Fig. 7), this suggests that the wild-type repressor-operator complex may stimulate transcription from wild-type PRM by increasing the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter. Kinetic experiments show that the highly homologous λ repressor stimulates transcription from λ PRM by increasing the rate of an isomerization step that is RNA polymerase concentration-independent (37Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 38Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Cell. 1983; 32: 327-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Positive control mutations in the two proteins lie at homologous positions (27Bushman F.D. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 54: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Hochschild A. Irwin N. Ptashne M. Cell. 1983; 32: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the structure of the two repressor-operator complexes are highly similar (26Harrison S.C. Aggarwal A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 933-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 28Aggarwal A. Rodgers D.W. Drottar M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C.

Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 242: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar); it is therefore difficult to reconcile their apparent differences in activation mechanisms. Two non-exclusive hypotheses may resolve this discrepancy. The first hypothesis involves the realization that the formation of an open promoter complex is a multistep process. The rate of each forward and reverse step in the pathway to form an open complex is characterized by a rate constant that varies with promoter sequence. For different promoters, the RNA polymerase-promoter species that are in rapid equilibrium with the free protein and DNA may differ with sequence. Hence, the rate of transformation between two identical types of promoter complexes may be dependent or independent of RNA polymerase concentration. By this argument, λ and 434 repressor could catalyze the same chemical step, but whether this step is observed as an effect on the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter or isomerization of a tightly bound promoter complex may vary with promoter sequence. The second hypothesis is based on the finding that the distance between the phosphate that is shared by both RNA polymerase and repressor binding sites and the surface of the repressor that contacts RNA polymerase differs between λ and 434 repressor-operator complexes (29Shimon L.J.W. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 41Jordan S.R. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 242: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the target of the activating regions of the repressors on the RNA polymerase molecule may be different. Such a proposal is not unprecedented, several other non-lambdoid repressor transcriptional activators have distinct targets on the ς70 subunit (42Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The possible differences between the activation surface on the RNA polymerase targeted by the two proteins may contribute to the observed differences in their activation mechanisms. The results we present here expand our ideas about how sequence differences between binding sites for a particular activator protein contribute to its activation function. It is well established that sequence differences allow an activator protein to discriminate between various binding sites along a strand of DNA and that this discrimination is crucial for proper biological functioning of the activator. The data presented here show that in addition to regulating binding affinity, binding site sequence can alter the activation efficiency of the protein."

The goal of the present study was to use a combination of protease sensitivity and guanidine denaturation analyses to investigate whether human RAP correspondingly contained multiple structural domains. Protease sensitivity analysis using six proteolytic enzymes of varying specificity showed that RAP has two protease-resistant regions contained within repeat 1 (residues 15–94) and repeat 3 (residues 223–323). Guanidine denaturation analysis showed that RAP has two phases in its denaturation, an early denaturation transition at 0.6 m guanidine HCl, and a broad second transition between 1.0 and 3.0 m guanidine HCl. Analysis of the denaturation of the individual repeats showed that, despite the similarity in sequence and protease sensitivity between repeats 1 and 3, repeat 1 was a stable structure, with a sharp transition midpoint at 2.4 m guanidine HCl, while repeat 3 was relatively unstable, with a transition midpoint at 0.6m guanidine HCl. Repeat 2 had a denaturation profile almost identical to that of repeat 3. Denaturation analysis of the contiguous repeats 1 and 2 (residues 1–210) indicated that repeats 1 and 2 probably interact to form one structural domain represented by the broad transition, while repeat 3 constitutes a separate domain represented by the early transition. A two-domain model of RAP three-dimensional structure is proposed that integrates both structural and functional information, in which a helical segment from repeat 2 interacts with the known three-helix bundle of repeat 1 to form a four-helix bundle structural domain, while repeat 3 forms the other structural domain.

The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP)1 is a receptor antagonist (1Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) for endocytic receptors of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family (2Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) that currently comprises five members (1Bu G. Curr. Opin.

RAP was discovered initially as a protein co-purifying with LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) (3Kristensen T. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J Bendtsen L. Sand O. Sottrup-Jensen L FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 4Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to which it binds with high affinity. Subsequently, it has been shown that RAP inhibits all known ligands of LRP (5Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 6Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), of which there are at least 15 (1Bu G. Curr. Opin.

Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of ligand binding to LRP on the cell surface does not seem to be the natural function of RAP, since it is not detected extracellularly despite the presence of a putative signal peptide (8Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of RAP instead appears to be one of an intracellular chaperone. It is localized in the early compartments of the secretory pathway (9Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using its COOH-terminal HNEL sequence as a retention signal (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Within the endoplasmic reticulum, RAP acts as an antagonist by transiently interacting with LRP to prevent premature ligand binding by maintaining LRP in an inactive state (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, RAP functions as a folding chaperone for LRP by preventing aggregation of newly synthesized receptors (11Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These roles for RAP are supported by the finding that RAP-null cells have a 75% reduction of functional LRP (12Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Structurally, RAP is a triplicate repeat sequence (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) where repeat 1 comprises approximately residues 1–100, repeat 2 residues 101–200, and repeat 3 residues 201–323. Recently, an alternative alignment of the three repeats has been proposed (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with repeat 1 encompassing residues 18–112, repeat 2 residues 113–218, and repeat 3 residues 219–323. There is a high degree of homology between repeats (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There are 5 or 6 binding sites on LRP for RAP (14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, repeat 1, but not repeat 3, can inhibit the interaction of α2-macroglobulin with LRP, while repeat 3, but not repeat 1, can promote the folding and subsequent secretion of LRP (14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, RAP has been shown to be a major pathogenic epitope in Heymann nephritis; residues 31–53 in repeat 1 are sufficient to induce immune deposits in passive Heymann nephritis (17Kerjaschki D. Ullrich R. Exner M. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2007-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RAP has about 38% predicted α-helical structure, based on circular dichroic analysis (8Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution structural studies of Nielsenet al. (18Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) demonstrated that repeat 1 (residues 18–112) consists mostly of an up-down-up three-helix bundle comprising residues 23–88. The NMR analyses of Ellgaard et al. (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) further indicated that repeats 1 and 2 were highly ordered but that repeat 3 was not, despite the similarity in primary structure between repeats 1 and 3. The goal of the present study was to ascertain whether the repeats of RAP constitute separate structural domains that might coincide with the established functional differences of these regions (1Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using a combination of protease sensitivity and guanidine denaturation analyses, we have found that RAP has two protease-resistant domains, contained within repeats 1 and 3. However, repeats 1 and 3 are considerably different in their resistance to guanidine denaturation, while repeat 2 is extremely sensitive to both proteases and guanidine denaturation. Our studies suggest that RAP has two structural domains of different characteristics that may relate to the functional differences of the RAP repeats. A full-length clone for human RAP (6Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) fused to glutathione S-transferase was expressed in bacteria and purified by a modification of the method of Warshawsky et al. (19Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After lysis of the cells by sonication in the presence of Triton X-100, the lysate was bound to glutathione-agarose to enrich for the RAP fusion protein, which was released from the resin with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After dialysis into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and digestion with α-thrombin atE:S = 1:6000 for 6 h at 4 °C, RAP was purified to homogeneity on heparin-Sepharose in a gradient of 0 to 0.75m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified RAP was dialyzed, lyophilized, and reconstituted in water (which was exposed briefly to ammonia vapors to aid the solubilization process) at a concentration of 1–2 mg/ml and stored frozen at −80 °C until use. Initial isolation of RAP was performed in the absence of protease inhibitors. Upon storage at later stages of purification, degradation from endogenous proteolysis occurred. Therefore, a mixture of inhibitors (“Complete,” Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, 1 tablet per 50 ml) was included in the lysis, glutathione-agarose, and heparin-Sepharose steps, but excluded in the dialysis steps (before thrombin cleavage of glutathioneS-transferase-RAP and before lyophilization). The cDNA construction, expression, and isolation of the various individual repeats of RAP have been described previously (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Eight enzymes of varying specificities were screened as possible probes of RAP structure. All enzymes were dissolved in water at 1–2 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C before use. Of these eight enzymes, six were found to be informative: porcine pancreatic elastase (protease type IV, Sigma),Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (protease type XVII-B, Sigma), α-lytic protease (generous gift of Dr. David Agard, University of California, San Francisco), chymotrypsin (type VII, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated, Sigma), trypsin (type XIII, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma), and thermolysin (protease type X, Sigma). α-Thrombin, prepared by a modification of the procedure of Miletich et al. (20Miletich J.P. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not digest RAP appreciably at either high E:S ratios (up to 1:10) or at elevated temperatures (up to 37 °C). Subtilisin (protease type VIII, Sigma) digested RAP rapidly at all ratios tested into fragments too small to be informative. RAP (40 μg) was digested at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in 5 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8 (except subtilisin digests, which were carried out in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm CaCl2) at ambient temperature (∼22 °C) for various times and various E:S ratios to establish optimal conditions for analysis. We were seeking conditions that would allow identification of the most rapid initial cleavages and reasonably large fragments that were relatively stable with longer times of digestion. Times in the range of 0–7 h and the following E:S ratios were selected: elastase, 1:100; V8 protease 1:100; α-lytic protease 1:2000; chymotrypsin, 1:640; trypsin, 1:1000; thermolysin, 1:200. After digestion at the optimal conditions, reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and snap freezing in liquid N2, then electrophoresed on 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25 mA until the sample penetrated the running gel, then 40 mA for 4 h), blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Bio-Rad trans blot semidry transfer cell and then stained briefly with Coomassie Blue. The identified bands were excised with a razor blade, and the membrane was subjected to sequence analysis on a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Procise 494 to identify the fragment NH2-terminal sequence. In some cases, fragments were isolated from digests by high performance liquid chromatography and submitted for mass spectrometric analysis to identify the COOH-terminal boundary. Peptides were isolated by reverse phase chromatography (Delta Pak C-4, 3.9 × 150 mm) in a gradient of 2–54% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, redissolved in 50% methanol, 1% acetic acid, and infused directly into a Finnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer for electrospray ionization. Spectra were collected from 600–2000m/z and deconvoluted using Finnigan Bioworks v.8.3 software. The peptide sequence and mass spectrometry analyses were performed by personnel at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine. Guanidine HCl denaturation was performed at ambient temperature in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, using a final RAP concentration of 100 μg/ml and various guanidine HCl (Ultrapure, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) concentrations. After overnight denaturation (22 h), circular dichroic spectra were obtained on a Jasco 600 C spectrometer. A cell with 0.1-cm path length was used, and three repetitions of scans between 250 and 210 nm were averaged for each sample. The molar ellipticity, [θ], was calculated at 222 nm from the equation [θ] = MRWθλ10−1 l −1 c −1(where MRW is mean residue weight = 117 for RAP, θλ is the ellipticity at wavelength λ in degrees,l is path length in cm, c is concentration in g/ml), and plotted against the guanidine HCl concentration. The double negative troughs at 208 and 222 nm are often used to estimate secondary structure. For our purposes, the helical content (f H) of RAP was estimated at 222 nm (0m guanidine HCl) from the equation [θ] = −30,300f H −2340 (21Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). A renaturation experiment was also performed to ascertain whether the denaturation of RAP was reversible. After denaturation for 22 h in 3.0 m guanidine HCl at a RAP concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, the sample was diluted 10-fold with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, to 0.3 m guanidine HCl, 100 μg/ml RAP, and allowed to renature for 5 h before measurement of the circular dichroic spectra. Fig. 1shows the time course of digestion of RAP with each of the six informative enzymes. In most cases, initial digestion yielded a large fragment encompassing about two-thirds of RAP that disappeared with time and a smaller fragment encompassing about one-third that was relatively stable. The exception was with V8 protease, where the initial digestion yielded approximately half-molecules. The major fragments identified from the enzyme digests are given in Table I. For elastase, the first cleavage was at residue 99–100, giving rise to fragments PPE-1 and PPE-5, the latter of which was extremely stable, even to overnight digestion (not shown). A subsequent cleavage at residue 207–208 gave rise to PPE-3 and PPE–4 and contributed to the disappearance of PPE-1. The α-lytic protease digest was similar: the first cleavage at residue 100–101 or 101–102 yielded a stable NH2-terminal fragment, αLP-5, and αLP-1. Another early cleavage at residue 173–174 yielded αLP-2 and αLP-3 (the latter gave way to αLP-4 after cleavage at residue 208–209). αLP-6 represented an internal fragment (residues 101/102–173) that was not present in the elastase digest.Table IProteolytic fragments of RAPEnzymeFragment no.Approximate M r × 10−3NH2 termini identified (residue no.)Probable identificationElastasePPE-128100100–323-225−2(−2)–207-315208208–323-414208208–311-512−2(−2)–99α-Lytic proteaseαLP-128101, 102101/102–323-225−2(−2)–173-319174174–323-415209209–323-513−2(−2)–100/101-69101, 102101/102–173V8 proteaseV8–122−2(−2)–164-221165, (168)165–323-319−2, 5(−2)/5–151-416−2, 5, 190, (193)(−2)/5–134 and 190–323ChymotrypsinCh-125−2, 2(−2)/2–183-217184184–323-31622–121-414213, (205)213–323TrypsinTr-1289898–323-2179898–222-312−2, (4), 6(−2), 6–97-41014, (15)14–97ThermolysinTh-128104104–323-217104104–222-315207207–323-412−2(−2)–98 103Bacterial endoprotease activityBAC-12895, 10295/102–323-218177177–323-312−2(−2)–94/101Residues in parentheses were present in minor amounts.Based on M r.Based on cleavage sites identified by NH2-terminal sequence in other peptides.Based on enzyme specificity.Based on mass spectrometry.

The half-molecules arising initially in the V8 digest as a result of cleavage at residue 164–165 were both NH2- (V8-1) and COOH-terminal (V8-2) fragments giving way to V8-4, which represents both NH2-terminal (presumed cleavage at residue 134–135) and COOH-terminal (cleavage at residues 189–190 and 192–193) peptides that persist over time. V8-3 was comprised of slightly larger NH2-terminal fragments that also gave way to V8-4. Chymotryptic digestion occurred first at residue 183–184, giving rise to Ch-1 and Ch-2. Each of these gave way to the more stable fragments Ch-3 and Ch-4, respectively, deriving from further cleavages at residues 121–122 and 212–213 (minor cleavage also at residue 204–205). Trypsin cleaved initially at residue 97–98 to yield the stable NH2-terminal fragments, Tr-3 and Tr-4, while thermolysin cleaved at residue 103–104 to yield a similar fragment, Th-4. Further cleavages at residue 221–222 (trypsin) or 206–207 (thermolysin) led to the disappearance of Tr-1 or Th-1, and the appearance of Tr-2 or Th-3, respectively. Proteolytic fragments that resulted from bacterial endogenous protease activity when RAP was isolated in the absence of inhibitors (not shown) were also purified and the cleavage sites identified (Table I). The cleavages at residues 94–95, 101–102, and 176–177 (Fig. 2) were probably the result of more than one enzyme, since the characteristics of the sequences at the cleavage sites were somewhat different from one another. A summary of the cleavage sites identified is presented in Fig. 2. It is apparent that the protease-sensitive regions are the extreme NH2 terminus (residues 1–15); the boundary between RAP repeats 1 and 2 (residues 94–103); most of repeat 2, especially the region from residues 164–192; and near the boundary between repeats 2 and 3 (residues 204–222). The protease-resistant regions, defining probable structural domains of highly ordered structure, are in repeat 1, residues 15–94, and repeat 3, residues 223–323. Fig. 3 shows the guanidine HCl denaturation profile for intact RAP. In the absence of guanidine, the protein had a [θ]222 = −13,992 degrees cm2dmol−1, corresponding to a helical content of about 38%, using the relationship described under “Experimental Procedures.” This result agrees with the findings of Strickland et al.(8Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The denaturation profile had two distinct features. The first was the rapid denaturation of a portion of the RAP structure at low guanidine HCl concentrations, with a transition midpoint at approximately 0.6 m. The second feature was denaturation of another portion of the RAP structure over a broad range up to >3m guanidine HCl. This result indicates that there may be at least two structural domains within RAP. We also performed renaturation experiments with intact RAP. After standing 22 h in 3 m guanidine HCl, rapid dilution to 0.3 m guanidine HCl, and 5 h of renaturation before measurement of the circular dichroic spectra, RAP had regained about 94% of its ordered structure, based on [θ]222 at 0.3m guanidine HCl, comparing with to without prior denaturation at 3 m guanidine HCl. This result indicates that RAP denaturation is almost entirely reversible within 5 h. In order to ascertain which portions of the RAP structure corresponded to the two phases of the guanidine denaturation profile, the individual repeats of RAP (14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were also subjected to guanidine denaturation and circular dichroic analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, repeats 1 (represented by residues 1–110) and 3 (represented by residues 191–323), despite their similarities in primary structure, had very different denaturation profiles. Repeat 3 denatured rapidly at low guanidine HCl concentrations, with a transition midpoint at about 0.6 m, similar to the first transition observed in the intact protein (Fig. 3). In contrast, repeat 1 was much more stable to guanidine denaturation, unfolding in a fairly sharp transition with a midpoint at approximately 2.4 m guanidine HCl. This latter profile was dissimilar to either of the transitions of intact RAP. Repeat 2 (represented by residues 91–210) had a denaturation profile almost identical to that of repeat 3 (Fig. 4 B),indicating a structure of low stability. Therefore, it appeared that either repeat 2 or 3 represented the early transition in the intact protein, and that repeat 1 interacted with one or the other of repeat 2 or 3 to yield the second, broad transition of the intact protein. In an attempt to differentiate the contribution of repeat 2 from that of repeat 3 to the unfolding of repeat 1, we performed guanidine denaturation on a RAP fragment consisting of contiguous repeats 1–2 (14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the denaturation profile of RAP 1–2 (residues 1–210) was not exactly like the second transition of the intact protein, the sharp second transition occurring in the sum of the individual profiles of repeats 1 + 2 had been reduced to a significant extent (Fig. 5). We have demonstrated in this study that human RAP has two highly protease-resistant regions corresponding to a majority of repeats 1 (residues 15–94) and 3 (residues 223–323). In contrast, RAP repeat 2 was found to be very susceptible to limited proteolysis along almost its entire sequence, with the possible exception of the region approximately from residues 123–164 (only two presumed cleavages occur within this region). A consensus of secondary structural prediction algorithms 2Secondary structure predictions were performed using the NCSA Biology Workbench 3.0, available on the internet at the address http://biology.ncsa.uiuc.edu. From the “Protein Tools” menu, the “Add New Protein Sequence” was first selected and the RAP sequence was pasted into the “sequence” window and imported to the workbench. Next, under the “MPSSP-Protein Secondary Structure Prediction” option, all secondary structure prediction methods were selected (references available at the Internet site) and the job was submitted for analysis. The “joint” option was also selected and the helical boundaries given in the “joint” prediction were used in this work. predicts about 50% helical content for RAP, somewhat higher than the 38% determined experimentally by us and Strickland et al. (8Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even so, the protease-resistant regions correspond mostly to predicted helical segments and that, with only a few exceptions, the protease cleavage sites fall within predicted coil regions; the major coil regions are predicted to be residues 1–18, 88–115, 160–184, 197–225, and 294–323 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the predicted helical segments within repeat 1 correspond almost exactly with the solution structure of repeat 1 determined by Nielsen et al. (18Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); that is, residues 23–34, 39–65, and 73–88. This helical segment of repeat 1 was completely resistant to limited proteolysis (Fig. 2). The results of the guanidine HCl denaturation study suggest that repeat 1 is a highly ordered, stable structure while repeats 2 and 3 are relatively unstable (Fig. 4 B). This is despite the sequence similarities between repeats, especially between repeats 1 and 3 (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and despite the similarity between repeats 1 and 3 in their resistance to limited proteolysis. The highly stable nature of repeat 1 is in agreement with the findings of Ellgaard et al. (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Nielsen et al. (18Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), who found that repeat 1 was a highly ordered, stable structure by NMR analysis. Our results with repeat 2 are in contrast with those authors, however, who suggested that repeat 2 was similar in structural properties to repeat 1. We found that repeat 2 was relatively unstable, as assessed by guanidine HCl denaturation, and less ordered as measured by its extreme sensitivity to limited proteolysis. However, the helical content of all three repeats appears to be similar, based on the consensus of secondary structure predictions2 (Fig. 2) and on [θ]222 at 0 m guanidine HCl (Fig. 4 B). We found that repeat 3, while highly structured as determined by resistance to limited proteolysis (in this respect resembling repeat 1), is unstable as measured by guanidine HCl denaturation (in this respect resembling repeat 2). Ellgaard et al. (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) stated that repeat 3 appeared to be an unstable structure but implied that its structural properties might be different in the context of the intact protein. Resolution of these matters will ultimately require the complete three-dimensional structural determination of the intact RAP. It is intriguing to compare some of the properties we have found for RAP segments with those of the two structural domains of apolipoprotein (apo) E, which is one of the ligands for LRP. Some similarities between RAP and apoE have been noted previously, in both function, such as binding to LRP (2Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and heparin (19Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in sequence (8Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains of apoE are rather similar in structural properties to those of RAP repeats 1 and 3. The NH2-terminal domain of apoE is a stable and highly ordered helical structure resembling a globular protein (22Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is an antiparallel four-helix bundle domain (24Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) that is resistant to proteolysis and has a guanidine HCl denaturation transition at about 2.4 m (22Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP repeat 1, with three helices (18Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), is nevertheless resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 2) and has a guanidine HCl denaturation transition at 2.4 m (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, the COOH-terminal domain of apoE is a highly ordered helical structure that is protease-resistant but relatively unstable, with a guanidine HCl denaturation transition at about 0.7m (22Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), very similar to RAP repeat 3 (Figs. 2 and 4 B). Another similarity between RAP repeat 3 and the COOH-terminal domain of apoE is that they are both predicted to have extremely long uninterrupted helical segments. However, Stricklandet al. (8Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that RAP repeat 3 has some sequence and other structural similarities to the NH2-terminal (rather than the COOH-terminal) domain of apoE. There are functional similarities as well; both RAP repeat 3 and the NH2-terminal domain of apoE bind to members of the LDL receptor gene family and to heparin, for example. It is also tempting to compare the apoE “hinge” region, a protease-sensitive connection between the two domains (22Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with repeat 2 of RAP. The protease sensitivity is similar, but the analysis of RAP repeat 2 does indicate that it has some degree of secondary structure (Figs. 2 and 4 B). It is possible that RAP repeat 2 could function as a hinge between two independent domains represented by RAP repeats 1 and 3. However, arguing against this possibility is the fact that repeat 1 does not appear to fold independently as do the two domains of apoE (22Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because the sharp denaturation transition of repeat 1 (Fig. 4 B) is not maintained in the intact protein (Fig. 3). Thus, although the repeat 1 structure has been solved and shown to be a three-helix bundle (18Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), our data indicate that, in the intact protein, repeat 1 is not itself a discrete structural domain. The fact that repeat 1 apparently interacts with some other portion of the RAP structure is an issue not completely resolved by our study. This supposed interaction somewhat destabilizes that region of the protein, with the sharp denaturation transition of repeat 1 at 2.4m guanidine HCl (Fig. 4 B) replaced by a very broad transition in the intact protein from about 1.0 to 3.0m guanidine HCl (Fig. 3). Repeat 1 could interact with either repeat 2 or 3 to yield the broad transition of Fig. 3, with the remaining repeat yielding the early transition. Our attempts to identify that interaction showed that repeat 1–2 (residues 1–210) did not exactly reproduce the second transition (Fig. 5). This may indicate that the particular fragment selected (residues 1–210) was not a close enough approximation of the true interacting portions of the molecule. Nevertheless, there was some indication that repeat 1 was influenced by repeat 2. In contrast, for apoE, the approximations of the two domains produced by thrombolytic digestion exactly reproduced the guanidine HCl denaturation transitions of the intact apoE (22Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the possibilities for a portion of repeat 2 or 3 contributing to the interaction with repeat 1, a likely one is that a helical segment from repeat 2 or 3 interacts with the up-down-up helical arrangement of repeat 1 to form a four-helix bundle. Such a possibility is suggested from the analyses of Nielsen et al. (18Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), who identified a similarity in the repeat 1 topology to that of cytochromeb 562, which is itself a four-helix bundle. A strong candidate to serve the role of providing the fourth helix for the three-helix bundle in repeat 1 of RAP might be the predicted helical segment within repeat 2 that is mostly protease-resistant;i.e. residues 134–159. In addition, functional data support the notion of repeats 1 and 2 as a structural domain. Whereas repeats 1 and 2 individually have low affinity for LRP (14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), repeat 1–2 (residues 1–210) has high affinity for LRP, 3S. Rennke, M. P. Mazolo, M. R. Wardell, and G. Bu, unpublished observations. suggesting that there is a synergistic effect involving repeat 1 and 2 interaction that contributes to LRP binding. This sort of arrangement would yield a structure that would allow for the functioning of repeats 1 and 2 together as a domain and repeat 3 as a separate domain, which has some basis from previous functional studies (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J.

In Fig. 6 we present a highly schematized model of this structure, which we emphasize is only one of many possibilities. Whether this will be borne out by the complete structural determination of RAP remains to be seen. As stated in the Introduction, two versions of the triplicate repeats of RAP have been offered. The version of Bu and co-workers (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with boundaries of residues 1–100, 101–200, and 201–323, leaves a unique 23-residue segment at the COOH terminus of repeat 3. The version of Ellgaard et al. (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with boundaries of residues 18–112, 113–218, and 219–323, leaves a 17-residue NH2-terminal extension as a unique portion. Ellgaardet al. (13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) argue that their version better fits the functional analysis of RAP repeats. The protease sensitivity map (Fig. 2) seems compatible in some respects with either the boundaries proposed by Bu and co-workers (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol.

Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, we note that two unique functions of RAP repeat 3 are contained in its extreme COOH terminus and therefore might be expected to be associated with a unique structure, which the Bu and co-workers version would predict. The endoplasmic reticulum retention signal is contained within this segment (7Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and a major binding site to heparin occurs in the COOH-terminal region (26Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and has now been localized to the 301–323 sequence.3 We thank Dr. Alan Schwartz (Washington University School of Medicine) for his generous support, Dr. Carl Frieden (Washington University School of Medicine) for advice about circular dichroism and for the use of the Jasco 600 C instrument, Dr. David Agard (University of California, San Francisco) for the gift of α-lytic protease, Mark Crankshaw of the Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine for performing the peptide sequence and mass spectrometry analyses, and Diana Craik for help with manuscript preparation."
