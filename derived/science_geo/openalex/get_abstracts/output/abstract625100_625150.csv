https://openalex.org/W2904039649,"Osteoporosis is a common aging-related disease diagnosed primarily using bone mineral density (BMD). We assessed genetic determinants of BMD as estimated by heel quantitative ultrasound in 426,824 individuals, identifying 518 genome-wide significant loci (301 novel), explaining 20% of its variance. We identified 13 bone fracture loci, all associated with estimated BMD (eBMD), in ~1.2 million individuals. We then identified target genes enriched for genes known to influence bone density and strength (maximum odds ratio (OR) = 58, P = 1 × 10-75) from cell-specific features, including chromatin conformation and accessible chromatin sites. We next performed rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 126 knockout mice with disruptions in predicted target genes and found an increased abnormal skeletal phenotype frequency compared to 526 unselected lines (P < 0.0001). In-depth analysis of one gene, DAAM2, showed a disproportionate decrease in bone strength relative to mineralization. This genetic atlas provides evidence linking associated SNPs to causal genes, offers new insight into osteoporosis pathophysiology, and highlights opportunities for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2904705904,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy is an effective treatment for invasive breast cancer. However, experimental studies in mice also suggest that chemotherapy has pro-metastatic effects. Primary tumours release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, that can facilitate the seeding and growth of metastatic cancer cells in distant organs, but the effects of chemotherapy on tumour-derived EVs remain unclear. Here we show that two classes of cytotoxic drugs broadly employed in pre-operative (neoadjuvant) breast cancer therapy, taxanes and anthracyclines, elicit tumour-derived EVs with enhanced pro-metastatic capacity. Chemotherapy-elicited EVs are enriched in annexin A6 (ANXA6), a Ca2+-dependent protein that promotes NF-κB-dependent endothelial cell activation, Ccl2 induction and Ly6C+CCR2+ monocyte expansion in the pulmonary pre-metastatic niche to facilitate the establishment of lung metastasis. Genetic inactivation of Anxa6 in cancer cells or Ccr2 in host cells blunts the pro-metastatic effects of chemotherapy-elicited EVs. ANXA6 is detected, and potentially enriched, in the circulating EVs of breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy."

Here, we developed vDISCO, a pressure-driven, nanobody-based whole-body immunolabeling technology to enhance the signal of fluorescent proteins by up to two orders of magnitude. This allowed us to image and quantify subcellular details through bones, skin and highly autofluorescent tissues of intact transparent mice. For the first time, we visualized whole-body neuronal projections in adult mice. We assessed CNS trauma effects in the whole body and found degeneration of peripheral nerve terminals in the torso. Furthermore, vDISCO revealed short vascular connections between skull marrow and brain meninges, which were filled with immune cells upon stroke. Thus, our new approach enables unbiased comprehensive studies of the interactions between the nervous system and the rest of the body."

This research characterized the particle size distribution and estimated the mass concentration of vaping aerosols produced at power outputs spanning the operating range typical of second generation variable voltage EC devices.EC aerosol was characterized from a single coil atomizer powered by a variable voltage EC battery at the minimum and maximum dial settings (3.3, 11.2 Watts, W), and a lab controlled power supply (3-11.9 W). Aerosol particle size distribution was measured by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer and Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, spanning 16 nm to 19.8 μm. A mouth puff was simulated using a 100 mL glass syringe.Consistent with prior studies, sub-micron EC aerosol size distributions were bimodal, with peaks at 40 and 200 nm, however a previously unreported third mode was observed at approximately 1000 nm. The ~1000 nm mode accounted for 7-20x the aerosol mass of the smaller modes. Increasing atomizer power decreased count concentration of particles <600 nm but increased particle count >600 nm. Particle mass distribution shifted toward micron sized particles with increasing power and increased the respirable fraction of aerosol, likely due to increased coagulation and condensation around nano-sized particles.Vaping power greatly affects EC aerosol count and mass distribution. Mouth puffed EC aerosol spans a much wider particle size range than previously reported, although the major portion of the mass is still well within the alveolar size range the larger particles will deposit within the oro-pharyngeal cavity at 2-3x greater efficiency than in alveoli. These observations have major clinical implications, as aerosol particle size distribution determines deposition sites along the respiratory tract. The results of this experiment stress the need for further research to inform the design, regulation and use of e-cigarette products."
https://openalex.org/W2907328820,"The inflammasome plays an important role in the inflammatory innate immune response after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Inhibition of the inflammasome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in improved outcomes by lowering the levels of caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1b. We have previously shown that inflammasome proteins are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with TBI and that higher levels of these proteins were consistent with poorer outcomes after TBI when compared to patients that presented these inflammasome proteins at lower levels.Here we extend our work by analyzing serum from 21 TBI patients and CSF from 18 TBI patients compared to 120 serum samples and 30 CSF samples from no-TBI donor controls for the expression of caspase-1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), interleukin(IL)-1b and IL-18. Analysis was carried out using the Ella Simple Plex system (Protein Simple) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of inflammasome proteins as biomarkers of TBI. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, confidence intervals and likelihood ratios for each biomarker was determined. ROC curves, confidence intervals, sensitivity and specificity for each biomarker examined revealed that caspase-1 (0.93 area under the curve (AUC)) and ASC (0.90 AUC) in serum and ASC (1.0 AUC) and IL-18 (0.84 AUC) in CSF are promising biomarkers of TBI pathology. Importantly, higher protein levels (above 547.6 pg/ml) of ASC (0.91 AUC) were consistent with poorer outcomes after TBI as determined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE).These findings indicate that inflammasome proteins are excellent diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of TBI."

Owing to its simplicity and ease of use, this strategy can be scaled up readily for discovery of natural products in streptomycetes. Transcription factor decoys, DNA molecules designed to mimic regulatory DNAs and prevent repressors binding to their DNA targets, are used to achieve de-repression of silent biosynthetic gene clusters, resulting in production of new natural products."

https://openalex.org/W2905006539,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated via the expression of the transcription factors OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC (OSKM) in somatic cells. In contrast to murine naive iPSCs, conventional human iPSCs are in a more developmentally advanced state called primed pluripotency. Here, we report that human naive iPSCs (niPSCs) can be generated directly from fewer than 1,000 primary human somatic cells, without requiring stable genetic manipulation, via the delivery of modified messenger RNAs using microfluidics. Expression of the OSKM factors in combination with NANOG for 12 days generates niPSCs that are free of transgenes, karyotypically normal and display transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic features indicative of the naive state. Importantly, niPSCs efficiently differentiate into all three germ layers. While niPSCs can be generated at low frequency under conventional conditions, our microfluidics approach enables the robust and cost-effective production of patient-specific niPSCs for regenerative medicine applications, including disease modelling and drug screening."

https://openalex.org/W2907518674,"Ribosomal proteins are the building blocks of ribosome biogenesis. Beyond their known participation in ribosome assembly, the ribosome-independent functions of ribosomal proteins are largely unknown. Here, using immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, His-ubiquitin pulldown, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, along with siRNA-based knockdown approaches, we demonstrate that ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) directly interacts with histone H2A and is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that in response to DNA damage, RPL6 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)–dependent manner, promoting its interaction with H2A. We also observed that RPL6 depletion attenuates the interaction between mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and H2A histone family member X, phosphorylated (γH2AX), impairs the accumulation of MDC1 at DNA damage sites, and reduces both the recruitment of ring finger protein 168 (RNF168) and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination (H2AK15ub). These RPL6 depletion–induced events subsequently inhibited the recruitment of the following downstream repair proteins: tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (TP53BP1) and BRCA1, DNA repair-associated (BRCA1). Moreover, the RPL6 knockdown resulted in defects in the DNA damage–induced G2–M checkpoint, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. In conclusion, our study identifies RPL6 as a critical regulatory factor involved in the DDR. These findings expand our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins in cell physiology and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2906803963,"The marine bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae (Pdd) is a generalist and facultative pathogen that causes disease in a wide range of marine animals including fish species of importance in aquaculture. Disease outbreaks in fish farms have been correlated with an increased water temperature during summer months. In this study, we have used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of Pdd RM-71 cultured at two different temperatures, which simulated temperature conditions experienced during free swimming lifestyle at mid latitudes in winter months (15°C) and during outbreaks in aquaculture in warm summer months (25°C). The enhanced bacterial growth of Pdd observed at 25°C in comparison to 15°C suggests that an elevated seawater temperature contributes to the build-up of a sufficient bacterial population to cause disease. In comparison to growth at 15°C, growth at 25°C resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in DNA synthesis, nutrient uptake, chemotaxis, flagellar motility, secretion systems and antimicrobial resistance. Plasmid-encoded virulence factors, which include a putative adhesin/invasin OmpU, a transferrin receptor and a serum resistance protein, were also upregulated. Transcription factor RpoS, genes involved in cold shock response, modulation of cell envelope and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes of yet unknown function were downregulated at 25°C. Notably, the gene encoding damselysin cytotoxin (Dly) was among the most highly transcribed genes at the two assayed temperatures, at levels comparable to the most highly expressed housekeeping genes. This study contributes to our understanding of the regulatory networks and biology of a generalist marine bacterial pathogen, and provides evidence that temperature regulates multiple physiological and virulence-related functions in Pdd."
https://openalex.org/W2907929229,"Oxidative stress–induced vascular endothelial cell (VEC) injury is a major mechanism in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Lunasin, a soybean-derived 43-aa peptide, has been previously shown to possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities other than its established anticancer activities. This study investigated the effects of lunasin on protecting VECs from oxidative damage and inhibiting atherosclerotic plaque progression in apolipoprotein E–deficient (ApoE−/−) mice and explored its underlying mechanism. Biochemical and histologic analyses were performed by using EA.hy926 human VECs and a high-fat diet (HFD) ApoE−/− mouse atherosclerosis model. Our data indicated that lunasin attenuated H2O2-induced, mitochondria-dependent endothelial apoptosis via down-regulating Bax and up-regulating Bcl-2, inhibiting the mitochondrial depolarization, and reducing the release of cytochrome c, as well as decreasing the activation of casρase-9 and caspase-3 in vitro and in vivo. Mechanic studies showed that lunasin significantly up-regulated heme oxygenase-1 via the PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2/antioxidant response element pathway, and reduced H2O2-induced ROS production in VECs, thereby attenuating oxidant-induced endothelial injury and inhibiting atherosclerotic plaque progression in ApoE−/− mice. In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that lunasin protects VECs from oxidative damage by enhancing heme oxygenase-1 expression via activation of the PI3K/Akt/ nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2/antioxidant response element pathway and inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, thereby effectively attenuating atherosclerosis in HFD-fed ApoE−/− mice. Lunasin may act as a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.—Gu, L., Ye, P., Li, H., Wang, Y., Xu, Y., Tian, Q., Lei, G., Zhao, C., Gao, Z., Zhao, W., Tan, S.

https://openalex.org/W2906959586,"Finding safe and effective treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the elderly is of clinical interest given the comorbidities and associated polypharmacy in this population. However, the number of patients older than age 65 years enrolled into clinical trials of anti-HCV medications generally have been limited and thus reaching meaningful conclusions for this demographic has been difficult. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a once-daily, all-oral, ribavirin-free, pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapy that has demonstrated high sustained virologic response rates at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) and a favorable safety profile in patients with chronic HCV infection. This analysis evaluated the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients aged ≥65 years. Data were pooled for treatment-naïve and -experienced patients with chronic HCV genotype (GT) 1–6 infections who received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in 9 Phase 2 and 3 trials. SVR12 and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated for patients aged ≥65 versus <65 years. Of the 2369 patients enrolled, 328 (14%) were aged ≥65 years. Among patients aged ≥65 years, 42% and 34% had GT1 and GT2, respectively; 40% were treatment-experienced and 20% had compensated cirrhosis. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment resulted in SVR12 rates of 97.9% (95% CI, 96.3–99.4; n/N = 321/328) for patients aged ≥65 years and 97.3% (95% CI, 96.6–98.0; n/N = 1986/2041) for patients aged <65 years. The rates were not significantly different between the two age groups (P = 0.555). DAA-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, or serious AEs were similarly rare (<0.5%) for patients ≥65 and <65 years old. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option for patients aged ≥65 years with chronic HCV infection."

The influences of different sample drying pretreatments on flavonoids and antioxidant activity of ferns have not studies. Dryopteris erythrosora leaves used to analyze flavonoid alterations resulting from drying pretreatments. The total flavonoid content of D. erythrosora leaves exposed to different pretreatments was significantly different. The total flavonoid content of samples initially air-dried in shade and then oven-dried at 75°C were the highest (7.6%), while samples initially dried at 75°C had the lowest content (2.17%). Antioxidant activities of D. erythrosora leaves with different pretreatments varied. Group B first air-dried in the shade and then oven-dried at 75°C and group C first air-dried in the sun and then oven-dried at 75°C, both showed relatively stronger antioxidant activity. The best pretreatment for preserving the flavonoids was to first dry the plant material in the shade and then complete the drying process in an oven at 75°C.

https://openalex.org/W2907785023,"Mulberry leaf polysaccharide (MLP) was extracted and purified by DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography to afford two major purified polysaccharides (MLP-1 and MLP-2). The purified polysaccharides were characterized, and their immune-enhancing properties were investigated. MLP-1 had a molecular weight of 9.31×104 Da and was composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, xylose, and arabinose in a molar ratio of 0.71:1.00:2.76:1.13:3.70:2.81. The molecular weight of MLP-2 was 2.22×106 Da, and its monosaccharide constituents were mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose in a molar ratio of 1.31:8.45:6.94:1.00:11.96. Infrared spectroscopy showed that each MLP had a typical absorption peak characteristic of sugars, and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy showed that neither MLP contained nucleic acid or protein components. Then, the abilities of these polysaccharides to stimulate spleen lymphocyte proliferation in mice in vitro were compared by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MLP-2 was more effective than MLP-1; therefore, MLP-2 was chosen for the study of its immune-enhancing effects in vivo. For the in vivo experiments, 14-day-old chickens immunized with Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine were orally administered MLP-2, and Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) was used as the control. Each chicken was orally administered 4 mg or 8 mg of MLP-2 for seven consecutive days starting three days before ND vaccine immunization. MLP-2 significantly improved the ND serum antibody titer and interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and immunoglobulin A (sIgA) concentrations in tracheal and jejunal wash fluids, and increasing numbers of immune globulin A-positive (IgA+) cells in cecal tonsils and increased body weight. These results indicated that MLP-2 could significantly enhance immune activity and could therefore be utilized as an immunopotentiator drug candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2907333688,"Many studies have shown that aerobic exercise improves cognitive function and maintains brain health. In particular, moderate-intensity exercise is effective for improving cognitive performance. However, there is no strong consensus on whether a single exercise session improves working memory (WM) function, as it does inhibitory function. It is possible that these discrepancies involve inter-individual differences in WM function. Therefore, we investigated whether acute mild and moderate aerobic exercise improve WM, and whether there exist inter-individual differences in improvements in WM. Thirty healthy subjects were recruited and participated in three experimental conditions (control, mild-intensity exercise, and moderate-intensity exercise). Subjects performed 10 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer with an individualized load. Their pedaling rate was maintained at 60 rpm. In the control condition, subjects rested on the cycle ergometer instead of performing exercise. The N-back task (2-back and 0-back task) was performed to assess WM function before, 5 min, and 15 min after the 10-min exercise session. In this study, to elucidate the effect of an acute bout of mild or moderate exercise on WM, the “2-back– 0-back” contrast, which is assumed to represent WM function, was calculated. The Two-Dimensional Mood Scale was adopted to measure changes in psychological mood states efficiently. The results revealed that working memory function was not improved by acute mild or moderate exercise. However, baseline working memory function was significantly associated with any change in working memory function following exercise, and this was independent of exercise intensity. Subjects with the lowest working memory function at baseline responded the most favorably. The results revealed that improvements in working memory function after a single session of aerobic exercise depend on baseline working memory function."
https://openalex.org/W2907538099,"Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) oscillation is a fundamental signaling response of cartilage cells under mechanical loading or osmotic stress. Chondrocytes are usually considered as nonexcitable cells with no spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling. This study proved that chondrocytes can exhibit robust spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling without explicit external stimuli. The intensity of [Ca2+]i peaks from individual chondrocytes maintain a consistent spatiotemporal pattern, acting as a unique ""fingerprint"" for each cell. Statistical analysis revealed lognormal distributions of the temporal parameters of [Ca2+]i peaks, as well as strong linear correlations between their means and sds. Based on these statistical findings, we hypothesized that the spontaneous [Ca2+]i peaks may result from an autocatalytic process and that [Ca2+]i oscillation is controlled by a threshold-regulating mechanism. To test these 2 mechanisms, we established a multistage biophysical model by assuming the spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling of chondrocytes as a combination of deterministic and stochastic processes. The theoretical model successfully explained the lognormal distribution of the temporal parameters and the fingerprint feature of [Ca2+]i peaks. In addition, by using antagonists for 10 pathways, we revealed that the initiation of spontaneous [Ca2+]i peaks in chondrocytes requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+, and that the PLC-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway, which controls the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, can affect the initiation of spontaneous [Ca2+]i peaks in chondrocytes. The purinoceptors and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels on the plasma membrane also play key roles in the spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling of chondrocytes. In contrast, blocking the T-type or L-type voltage-gated calcium channel promoted the spontaneous calcium signaling. This study represents a systematic effort to understand the features and initiation mechanisms of spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling in chondrocytes, which are critical for chondrocyte mechanobiology.-Zhou, Y., Lv, M., Li, T., Zhang, T., Duncan, R., Wang, L., Lu, X.

Eight female athletes, part of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Brazilian Team along the Olympic Cycle 2015-2016 participated in the study, with a mean age of 20.4±2.5 years. The following instruments were used: RESTQ-76 Sport, CD-RISC 10, documental analysis of physical therapy records, and structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation); Repeated Measured ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-hoc, Student's ""t"" test, Friedman test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Cohen's d, and inductive thematic analysis. We found relatively stable levels of stress and recovery across the season; total recovery levels were higher than stress at all four measured timepoints (p<0.05); All athletes had at least one injury, with a total of 14 injuries; No significant correlations were found between the quantitative scores of resilience, stress and recovery; Training and the sport's scoring system were the most relevant perceived stressors; athletes presented meta-cognition and a non-positive evaluation (neutral) of stressors; Social support was considered the main psychological factor for the resilience process; such process resulted in improved control and interpretation of emotions; Our hypothesized model proposes that, in the relationship between stress and injuries, resilience acts by optimizing the injury recovery process. It was concluded that resilience plays a role in the process of injury rehabilitation and stress control in elite rhythmic gymnastics' athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2904327845,"Phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) governs stage-specific interactions with different cellular machines. The CTD consists of Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 heptad repeats and sequential phosphorylations of Ser7, Ser5 and Ser2 occur universally at Pol II-transcribed genes. Phosphorylation of Thr4, however, appears to selectively modulate transcription of specific classes of genes. Here, we identify ten new Thr4 kinases from different kinase structural groups. Irreversible chemical inhibition of the most active Thr4 kinase, Hrr25, reveals a novel role for this kinase in transcription termination of specific class of noncoding snoRNA genes. Genome-wide profiles of Hrr25 reveal a selective enrichment at 3' regions of noncoding genes that display termination defects. Importantly, phospho-Thr4 marks placed by Hrr25 are recognized by Rtt103, a key component of the termination machinery. Our results suggest that these uncommon CTD kinases place phospho-Thr4 marks to regulate expression of targeted genes."
https://openalex.org/W2907788385,"Iso-α-acids (IAAs) are hop-derived bitter acids of beer. Epidemiologic studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial for cognitive function, but they do not show the ingredients in alcoholic beverages. Previously, we reported that long-term consumption of IAAs prevents inflammation and Alzheimer pathologies in mice, but their effects on cognitive function have not been evaluated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the consumption of IAAs improves spatial and object recognition memory functions not only in normal Crl:CD1(ICR) male mice but also in mice with pharmacologically induced amnesia. IAA consumption increased the total and extracellular levels of dopamine in the hippocampus of mice and Sprague-Dawley male rats, respectively. Dopamine D1 receptor antagonist treatment and knockdown of dopamine D1 receptor expression in the hippocampus attenuated IAA-induced spatial memory improvement. Furthermore, vagotomy attenuated the effects of IAAs in improving spatial and object recognition memory functions and increasing the total level of dopamine in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the consumption of IAAs activates dopamine receptor—signaling in the hippocampus in a vagus nerve—dependent manner and, consequently, improves spatial and object recognition memory functions.

A promising new treatment approach may be mechanical CPR devices (mechanical CPR). Methods In a retrospective analysis of the German Resuscitation Registry between 2007–2014, we examined the outcome after using mechanical CPR on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We compared mechanical CPR to manual CPR. According to preclinical risk factors, we calculated the predicted ROSC-after-cardiac-arrest (RACA) score for each group and compared it to the rate of ROSC observed. Using multivariate analysis, we adjusted the influence of the devices’ application on ROSC for epidemiological factors and therapeutic measures. Results We included 19,609 patients in the study. ROSC was achieved in 51.5% of the mechanical CPR group (95%-CI 48.2–54.8%, ROSC expected 42.5%) and in 41.2% in the manual CPR group (95%-CI 40.4–41.9%, ROSC expected 39.2%). After multivariate adjustment, mechanical CPR was found to be an independent predictor of ROSC (OR 1.77; 95%-CI 1.48–2.12). Duration of CPR is a key determinant for achieving ROSC. Conclusions Mechanical CPR was associated with an increased rate of ROSC and when adjusted for risk factors appeared advantageous over manual CPR. Mechanical CPR devices may increase survival and should be considered in particular circumstances according to a physicians’ decision, especially during prolonged resuscitation."
https://openalex.org/W2907707037,"Tropical forests in the Americas are undergoing rapid conversion to commercial agriculture, and many migratory bird species that use these forests have experienced corresponding populations declines. Conservation research for migratory birds in the tropics has focused overwhelmingly on shade coffee plantations and adjacent forest, but both cover types are now in decline, creating an urgent need to evaluate conservation opportunities in other agricultural systems. Here we compare how a community of 42 Neotropical migratory bird species and a subset of five conservation-priority species differ in usage and habitat associations among a secondary forest baseline and four expanding commercial plantation systems in Guatemala: African oil palm, teak, rubber, and mixed-native hardwoods. We found that mixed-native hardwood plantations supported the highest richness and diversity of all migrants and that the three hardwood plantation types generally outperformed oil palm in richness and diversity metrics. Despite this, oil palm supported high abundance of several common and widespread species also experiencing range-wide population declines and may therefore play an important role in conserving common species. Mature secondary forest hosted low abundance and diversity of the full migratory community, but high abundance and richness of conservation priority migrants along with native hardwood and teak plantations. Likewise, the percentage of forest cover on the landscape was positively associated with priority migrant abundance and richness but negatively associated with the abundance of migrants in general, highlighting how individual species within the broad group of Neotropical migratory landbirds respond differently to anthropogenic changes in land use. Across all cover types, the retention of tall overstory trees increased the abundance, richness, and diversity of all migrants, which indicates that vertical structural diversity and remnant trees are important habitat features for birds in agricultural landscapes. Our findings show that conservation opportunities exist in hardwood and oil palm plantations, though the species likely to benefit from conservation action will vary among plantation types. For the subset of conservation priority migrants, our results suggest that conservation efforts should combine strategies that retain and restore secondary forest, promote the adoption of native hardwood and teak plantations, and promote the retention of tall, remnant trees in agricultural landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2907890485,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced in the airway during allergic lung inflammation and both promotes and inhibits features of asthma pathology. These mixed effects relate to 4 E-prostanoid (EP) receptor subtypes (EP1, 2, 3 and 4) expressed at different levels on different resident and infiltrating airway cells. Although studies have asserted both EP2 and EP4 expression in human airway smooth muscle (HASM), a recent study asserted EP4 to be the functionally dominant EP subtype in HASM. Herein, we employ recently-developed subtype-selective ligands to investigate singular or combined EP2 and EP4 receptor activation in regulating HASM signaling and proliferation. The subtype specificity of ONO-AE1-259-01 (EP2 agonist) and ONO-AE1-329 (EP4 agonist) was first demonstrated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing different EP receptor subtypes. EP receptor knockdown and subtype-selective antagonists demonstrated EP2 and EP4 receptor responsiveness in HASM cells to the specific ONO compounds, whereas PGE2 appeared to preferentially signal via the EP4 receptor. Both singular EP2 and EP4 receptor agonists inhibited HASM proliferation, and combined EP2 and EP4 receptor agonism exhibited positive cooperativity in both chronic Gs-mediated signaling and inhibiting HASM proliferation. These findings suggest both EP2 and EP4 are functionally important in HASM, and their combined targeting optimally inhibits airway smooth muscle proliferation.-Michael, J. V. Gavrila, A., Nayak, A.

Using combinations of cells genome-edited to not express G proteins and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer–based sensors, we confirmed marked selectivity of GPR35 for Gα13. Incorporating Gα12/Gα13 chimeras and individual residue swap mutations into these sensors defined that selectivity between Gα13 and Gα12 was imbued largely by a single leucine-to-isoleucine variation at position G.H5.23. Indeed, leucine could not be substituted by other amino acids in Gα13 without almost complete loss of GPR35 coupling. The critical importance of leucine at G.H5.23 for GPR35–G protein interaction was further demonstrated by introduction of this leucine into Gαq, resulting in the gain of coupling to GPR35. These studies demonstrate that Gα13 is markedly the most effective G protein for interaction with GPR35 and that selection between Gα13 and Gα12 is dictated largely by a single conservative amino acid variation.—Mackenzie, A.

https://openalex.org/W2908249270,"Advances in oncology have enabled physicians to treat low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN) in outpatient settings. This study was aimed to explore the usefulness of the CISNE model and identify better triage in the emergency setting. This is a retrospective cohort study on 400 adult FN patients presenting to the Emergency Department of National Cancer Center, Korea from January 2010 to December 2016. All had been treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for solid tumors in the previous 30 days. The primary outcome was the frequency of any serious complications during the duration of illness. Apparently stable patients numbered 299 (74.8%) of 400, and the remainder comprised clinically unstable patients. The stable patients fell into three cohorts according to the risk scores: CISNE I (low risk), 56 patients (18.7%); CISNE II (intermediate), 124 (41.5%) and CISNE III (high), 119 (39.8%). The primary outcome occurred in 10.7%, 19.4% and 33.6%, respectively, according to the cohort. Compared with the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer Risk Index Score (MASCC RIS), CISNE I stratum had significantly lower sensitivity (0.22 vs. 0.95 of MASCC low risk) but higher specificity (0.91 vs. 0.17) to predict zero occurrence of the primary outcome. The CISNE model was useful for identifying low-risk FN patients for outpatient treatment. The combination of the CISNE and MASCC RIS may help emergency physicians cope with FN more confidently."
https://openalex.org/W2907094712,"Our aim is to explore if cognitive challenge combined with objective physiology can reveal abnormal frontal alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We used quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to investigate brain activities during N-back working memory (WM) processing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2) in an aging cohort. We studied 60–100 year old participants, with normal cognition, and who fits one of two subgroups from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins: cognitively healthy (CH) with normal amyloid/tau ratio (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau ratio (CH-PAT, n = 14). We recorded behavioral performances, and analyzed alpha power and alpha spectral entropy (SE) at three occasions: during the resting state, and at event-related desynchronization (ERD) [250 ~ 750 ms] during 0-back and 2-back. During 0-back WM testing, the behavioral performance was similar between the two groups, however, qEEG notably differentiated CH-PATs from CH-NATs on the simple, 0-back testing: Alpha ERD decreased from baseline only in the parietal region in CH-NATs, while it decreased in all brain regions in CH-PATs. Alpha SE did not change in CH-NATs, but was increased from baseline in the CH-PATs in frontal and left lateral regions (p<0.01), and was higher in the frontal region (p<0.01) of CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. The alpha ERD and SE analyses suggest there is frontal lobe dysfunction during WM processing in the CH-PAT stage. Additional power and correlations with behavioral performance were also explored. This study provide pilot information to further evaluate whether this biomarker has clinical significance."
https://openalex.org/W2907720830,"Background Outcome measurement is fundamental to assess needs and priority of care in palliative care settings. The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) was developed from earlier versions of this tool. Its use is encouraged to ameliorate the assessment of individual outcomes in palliative care settings. This study aimed to translate and culturally adapt IPOS into Italian, and explore its face and content validity. Methods After forward-backward translation, a qualitative study explored the views of and cognitive processes used by respondents. We conducted individual semi structured interviews with 21 patients admitted to two palliative care services, from hospitals, hospices and the community, and focus groups with 12 professionals working in multidisciplinary palliative care teams and used thematic analysis. The results were integrated in a final audit, including the project team and the original POS developers, to refine the final format of the tool. Results We conducted 21 face to face cognitive interviews with patients, and 2 focus groups with 14 professionals. Patients and professionals felt content and format of IPOS appropriate and feasible, and not burdensome. Some layout problems were raised leading to adaptation. Main issues regarded: clarifying the meaning of choices and some cultural interpretation of some questions and response options and interpretation of some instructions. We proposed using some new terms as more appropriate and comprehensive in our context, such as replacing the term “family” with “dear ones”. The items that appeared unchanged from the previously validated Italian POS were left unmodified to maintain coherence. Conclusions The Italian IPOS, in its four versions directed to patients or staff and with a recall period of 3 or 7 days, has face and content validity for use in clinical settings and is ready for further psychometric and clinimetric validation."
https://openalex.org/W2907269806,"Exposure to trichloroethene (TCE), an occupational and ubiquitous environmental contaminant, is associated with the development of several autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). However, mechanisms contributing to TCE-mediated AIH are not known. Earlier, we have shown that dichloroacetyl chloride (DCAC), one of the reactive metabolites of TCE with strong acylating capability, can elicit an autoimmune response at much lower dose than TCE in female MRL+/+ mice. Furthermore, Kupffer cells (KCs), the liver resident macrophages, are crucial for hepatic homeostasis, but can also participate in the immunopathogenesis of AIH. However, contribution of KCs in TCE-mediated AIH and the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We hypothesized that increased apoptosis and delayed clearance of apoptotic bodies, due to compromised KC function, will result in the breakdown of self-tolerance, autoimmunity, and ultimately AIH. Therefore, using an in vitro model of immortalized mouse KCs, we investigated the contribution of DCAC in TCE-mediated AIH. KCs were treated with different concentrations of DCAC and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V and PI staining. Also, the impact of DCAC on phagocytic potential of KCs was evaluated. Furthermore, markers of inflammasome (NLRP3 and caspase1) were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. DCAC treatment resulted in significantly increased early and late-stage apoptosis, accompanied with inflammasome activation (NLRP3 increases). DCAC treatment resulted in decreased phagocytic function of KCs in a dose-dependent manner, with reduced MFG-E8 levels (phagocytotic function). Furthermore, DCAC exposure led to induction of phos-ERK and phos-AKT signaling. These findings suggest that DCAC induces apoptosis and inflammasome activation, while compromising the phagocytic function of KCs. Our data support that increased apoptosis and impaired KC function by DCAC could be contributory to TCE-mediated AIH."
https://openalex.org/W2907321064,"Older emergency department (ED) patients are at risk for adverse outcomes, however, it is hard to predict these. We aimed to assess the discriminatory value of clinical intuition, operationalized as disease perception, self-rated health and first clinical impression, including the 30-day surprise question (SQ: ""Would I be surprised if this patient died in the next 30 days"" of patients, nurses and physicians. Endpoints used to evaluate the discriminatory value of clinical intuition were short-term (30-day) mortality and other adverse outcomes (intensive/medium care admission, prolonged length of hospital stay, loss of independent living or 30-day readmission).In this prospective, multicentre cohort study, older medical patients (≥65 years), nurses and physicians filled in scores regarding severity of illness and their concerns (i.e. disease perception and clinical impression scores) immediately after arrival of the patient in the ED. In addition, patients filled in a self-rated health score and nurses and physicians answered the SQ. Area under the curves (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) were calculated.The median age of the 602 included patients was 79 years and 86.7% were community dwelling. Within 30 days, 66 (11.0%) patients died and 263 (43.7%) patients met the composite endpoint. The severity of concern score of both nurses and physicians yielded the highest AUCs for 30-day mortality (for both 0.75; 95%CI 0.68-0.81). AUCs for the severity of illness score and SQ of nurses and physicians ranged from 0.71 to 0.74 while those for the disease perception and self-rated health of patients ranged from 0.64 to 0.69. The discriminatory value of the scores for the composite endpoint was lower (AUCs ranging from 0.60 to 0.67). We used scores that have not been previously validated which could influence their generalisability.Clinical intuition,-disease perception, self-rated health and first clinical impression-documented at an early stage after arrival in the ED, is a useful clinical tool to predict mortality and other adverse outcomes in older ED patients. Highest discriminatory values were found for the nurses' and physicians' severity of concern score. Intuition may be helpful for the implementation of personalised medical care in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2907881122,"Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus responsible for a significant number of deaths in Latin America. This virus is transmitted through the bite of Aedes aegypti, the main mosquito vector, and Ae. albopictus. During blood uptake, the mosquito injects its saliva into the host to facilitate the feeding process. Mosquito saliva contains potent immunogens capable of inducing antibody production directly related to mosquito bite exposure intensity and disease risk. In this study, we first determined the DENV infection status by two different DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) based rapid tests and qRT-PCR, then measured the levels of IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies against salivary proteins of Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes in volunteers living in a dengue endemic area. Our results show that people with a positive DENV diagnosis present higher levels of IgG4 antibodies than people with a negative diagnostic test, and that these antibody levels were higher in people with secondary DENV infections. With this study, we show that detection of IgG4 antibodies against mosquito saliva may be a reliable method to evaluate the risk of dengue infection."

Although α4 integrin is known to be a potential target of reactive oxygen species (ROS)–induced cysteine glutathionylation, the physiological significance and underlying regulatory mechanism of this event remain elusive. Here, using in vitro and in vivo biochemical and cell biology approaches, we show that physiological ROS-induced glutathionylation of α4 integrin in neutrophils increases the binding of neutrophil-associated α4 integrin to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) on human endothelial cells. This enhanced binding was reversed by extracellular glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase promoting protein deglutathionylation. Furthermore, in a murine inflammation model, Grx1 disruption dramatically elevated α4 glutathionylation and subsequently enhanced neutrophil egress from the bone marrow. Corroborating this observation, intravenous injection of recombinant Grx1 into mice inhibited α4 glutathionylation and thereby suppressed inflammation-induced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow. Taken together, our results establish ROS-elicited glutathionylation and its modulation by Grx1 as pivotal regulatory mechanisms controlling α4 integrin affinity and neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow under physiological conditions. α4 integrin plays a crucial role in retention and release of neutrophils from bone marrow.

GSH reaction with the free sulfhydryl (–SH) on certain cysteines of proteins induces protein glutathionylation and forms protein–GSH mixed disulfide adducts (Pr-SSG).

However, whether glutathionylation is essential for α4-mediated neutrophil adhesion and related physiological cellular processes is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that ROS induced α4 integrin glutathionylation and subsequently regulated the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells. We further showed that Grx1 reversed the glutathionylation of α4 integrin physiologically. Disruption of Grx1 increased α4 integrin glutathionylation and inhibited neutrophil binding to endothelial cells. On the contrary, Grx1 overexpression or Grx1 protein addition resulted in opposite effects. Under rest conditions, most neutrophils exist in the bone marrow. During infection or inflammation, massive neutrophils are mobilized from the bone marrow to the circulation (16Zhao E. Xu H. Wang L. Kryczek I. Wu K. Hu Y. Wang G. Zou W.

To avoid improper infection or excessive inflammation, it is of great importance to appropriately govern bone marrow neutrophil retention and mobilization. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that α4 integrin is the central integrin to regulate marrow neutrophil retention and mobilization (17Burdon P.C. Martin C. Rankin S.M.

As stress conditions induce elevated level of ROS, we speculated that Grx1- and ROS-mediated α4 integrin glutathionylation might be involved in neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow. Our results showed that Grx1 depletion resulted in increased neutrophil egress from the bone marrow and concomitantly increased α4 integrin glutathionylation and vice versa. This study reveals that Grx1-mediated and ROS-induced α4 integrin glutathionylation are important physiological regulatory mechanisms controlling α4 integrin functions in neutrophils and then participate in bone marrow neutrophil mobilization under stress conditions. The bone marrow extracellular space is highly oxidizing, even stronger than the intracellular compartment (14Zhang X. Liu P. Zhang C. Chiewchengchol D. Zhao F. Yu H. Li J. Kambara H. Luo K.Y.

Thus, extracellular proteins of neutrophils might be regulated by ROS-induced glutathionylation. First, we performed in vitro glutathionylation assays with biotinylated GSH (BioGEE) to confirm the possible modifications of α4 integrin. As expected, recombinant α4 integrin was glutathionylated in vitro (Fig. 1A). H2O2 significantly increased the α4–BioGEE mixed disulfide adducts (BioGSS-α4) signal, whereas treatment with DTT eliminated glutathionylation of α4. To determine the modification of α4 integrin in neutrophils, we tested α4 glutathionylation with a GSH-specific antibody. Although no band was detected in neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 (dHL60) cell lysates, there was a band corresponding to the size of α4 integrin after formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF) stimulation (Fig. 1B). The glutathionylation signals elevated along with increasing concentrations of fMLF (1–10 μm) (Fig. 1B) and reached a peak at the 5-min time point, which then decreased along the time course (Fig. S1). To confirm whether the modified protein was α4 integrin, lysates of fMLF-treated dHL60 cells were pulled down with α4 antibody or GSH antibody and then were tested with α4 and GSH antibodies. Both assays showed that α4 integrin of neutrophils was indeed glutathionylated by ROS (Fig. 1, C and D). Glutathionylated α4 signals were detected after pulldown enrichment, even in nontreated dHL60 cells. Similarly, in murine neutrophils, fMLF triggered the glutathionylation of α4 integrin (Fig. 1E). Also, glutathionylated α4 was detected even without fMLF treatment. It is well known that ROS are mostly generated by NADPH oxidase in chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils (13Sakai J. Li J. Subramanian K.K. Mondal S. Bajrami B. Hattori H. Jia Y. Dickinson B.C. Zhong J. Ye K. Chang C.J. Ho Y.S. Zhou J. Luo H.R. Reactive oxygen species-induced actin glutathionylation controls actin dynamics in neutrophils.Immunity. 2012; 37 (23159440): 1037-104910.1016/j.immuni.2012.08.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To investigate whether glutathionylation of α4 integrin was directly induced by ROS, dHL60 cells were pretreated with diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), which is an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. After fMLF treatment, DPI-pretreated cells showed a significant decrease in α4 glutathionylation (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that α4 integrin is glutathionylated in neutrophils and that physiological ROS drastically augments the glutathionylation signal. To predict the modified cysteines of α4 integrin by glutathionylation, molecular docking was performed by docking GSH into the α4 integrin β-propeller and thigh domain crystal structure (PDB code 4IRZ). It was shown that the S atom of Cys278 of α4 integrin was quite close to the S atom of GSH (4.9 Å) (Fig. 1G), indicating that these two S atoms might be able to form a disulfide bond. To verify the role of Cys-278 in α4 integrin glutathionylation, constructs expressing either mutation of Cys278 to Asp (278Asp) or WT FLAG-α4 were transfected in HL60 cells. dHL60 cells with 278Asp mutant α4 integrin displayed much lower H2O2-elicited glutathionylation of α4 integrin (Fig. 1H). The result suggests that Cys278 might be one of the glutathionylated sites of α4 integrin. Next we tested the role of ROS-induced glutathionylation of α4 integrin in neutrophils adhering to endothelial cells using an in vitro adhesion assay of 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled neutrophils binding to a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer. As shown in Fig. 2A, either H2O2 or fMLF treatment elicited apparent increased adhesion of dHL60 cells to HUVECs, whereas α4 antibody treatment disrupted the effect. Consistently, fMLF-treated murine neutrophils showed elevated adhesion to HUVECs, and the increased adhesion was inhibited by the α4 antibody (Fig. 2B). Also, zaurategrast, an inhibitor of α4 integrin (21Rettig M.P. Ansstas G. DiPersio J.F. Mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells using inhibitors of CXCR4 and VLA-4.Leukemia. 2012; 26 (21886173): 34-5310.1038/leu.2011.197Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), displayed a similar effect (Fig. 2C). A membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl blocker, N-ethylmaleimide treatment largely decreased adhering neutrophils (Fig. S2). The adhesion assay was also performed with VCAM-1 antibody or IgG-pretreated HUVECs. VCAM-1 antibody, but not IgG, abolished the effect of ROS-triggered elevated adhesion (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained in the adhesion of murine neutrophils to HUVECs (Fig. 2E). We also examined the effect of mutation of Cys278 to Asp on ROS-induced increased adhesion of neutrophils to HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 2F, the adhesion rate of dHL60 cells with 278Asp mutant α4 integrin to HUVECs was significantly decreased compared with WT dHL60 cells after H2O2 stimulation. These results indicate that ROS-induced glutathionylation promotes the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells through α4 integrin and VCAM-1. Grx is the main reductase of glutathionylation in mammals. In addition to the action in intracellular components, Grx1 has been reported to exist with catalytic activity in some extracellular environments, such as sputum, plasma, and bone marrow extracellular space (14Zhang X.

Therefore, we speculated that Grx1 might physiologically modulate the glutathionylation of α4 integrin. We primarily tested the effect of Grx1 on glutathionylation of α4 integrin in vitro. In a very similar fashion as DTT treatment, fusion Grx1 protein addition significantly weakened the glutathionylation signal of FLAG-α4 (Fig. 3A). The glutathionylated α4 integrin signal in dHL60 cells was also decreased when adding Grx1 protein to the culture medium (Fig. 3B). To further evaluate the role of Grx1 in glutathionylation of α4 integrin, we examined the glutathionylation of α4 integrin in Grx1-overexpressing dHL60 cells. Grx1 overexpression drastically decreased the glutathionylation of α4 in response to fMLF but barely affected the expression of α4 integrin (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. S3A). With increasing concentrations of fMLF stimulation, the α4-SSG signals of Grx1-overexpressing dHL60 cells also elevated but were always weaker than the control. By contrast, a Grx inhibitor, Cd2+, slightly increased α4 glutathionylation in neutrophils (Fig. 3E). To investigate whether Grx1 directly participated in α4 integrin glutathionylation, a Grx1 knockout mouse was used (Fig. S3B). Similar to Cd2+ treatment, murine Grx1-deficient neutrophils showed much stronger α4 glutathionylation than the WT cells (Fig. 3F). Together, our results demonstrate that α4 deglutathionylation is physiologically controlled by Grx1. As our data show, glutathionylation modulated integrin α4/VCAM-1–dependent neutrophil adhesion by modifying α4. Grx1, the main regulator of α4 integrin deglutathionylation, might also be involved in this process. Therefore, the effect of Grx1 on α4-mediated neutrophil binding to immobilized VCAM-1 was tested first. According to a previous study (15Liu S.Y. Tsai M.Y. Chuang K.P. Huang Y.F. Shieh C.C. Ligand binding of leukocyte integrin very late antigen-4 involves exposure of sulfhydryl groups and is subject to redox modulation.Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38 (18196516): 410-42310.1002/eji.200737556Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and our pretest, 1 μg/ml was chosen as the concentration of recombinant ligands. The effects of Grx1 on neutrophil binding to immobilized Fc were also examined as controls. Grx1 overexpression reduced dHL60 cell adhesion to VCAM-1 but not Fc (Fig. 4, A and B). Then the binding activity in murine Grx1−/− neutrophils was detected. In contrast, Grx1 deficiency activated murine neutrophils adhering to VCAM-1 but not Fc (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, even without H2O2 treatment, Grx1 already displayed an impairing effect in ligand binding activity of α4 integrin in this assay (Fig. 4, A and C). Our results suggested that Grx1 might inhibit neutrophil binding to VCAM-1. To further evaluate the function of extracellular Grx1, murine WT and Grx1−/− neutrophils were pretreated with Grx1 protein. The result showed that Grx1 pretreatment suppressed the adhesion of WT neutrophils to VCAM-1 and restored the adhesion of Grx1−/− neutrophils to immobilized VCAM-1 (Fig. 4, E and F). In addition, we performed a ligand-binding assay to soluble VCAM-1. Soluble VCAM-1 was prelabeled with FITC and then detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that more murine Grx1−/− neutrophils bound to FITC-labeled VCAM-1 than the WT after H2O2 treatment, whereas, under rest conditions, cells displayed a similar binding ability to VCAM-1 (Fig. 4G). These results also support the inhibiting effect of Grx1 on the ligand-binding activity of α4 integrin to VCAM-1. Next, the role of Grx1 in neutrophils adhering to endothelial cells was investigated. Primary results showed that recombinant Grx1 pretreatment decreased the adhesion of dHL60 cells to the HUVEC monolayer in response to H2O2 (Fig. 5A), and fewer Grx1-overexpressing dHL60 cells adhered to HUVECs (Fig. 5B). Then Grx1-overexpressing dHL60 cells were pretreated with Cd2+, which rescued the impairing effect of Grx1 on dHL60 cells adhering to HUVECs after H2O2 stimulation (Fig. 5C). As Cd2+ is membrane-permeant, it may inhibit both intracellular and extracellular Grx1 activities (24Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Acute cadmium exposure inactivates thioltransferase (glutaredoxin), inhibits intracellular reduction of protein-glutathionyl-mixed disulfides, and initiates apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (10854441): 26556-2656510.1074/jbc.M004097200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We thus performed the experiment pretreated with a Grx1-specific antibody to block the extracellular Grx1 activity. Similarly, Grx1 antibody–treated dHL60 cells displayed significantly increased adhesion to HUVECs (Fig. 5D). A Wright–Giemsa staining assay was also explored to directly observe the adhesion of neutrophils to HUVECs. As Fig. 5E shows, the morphology of HUVEC was much larger than that of dHL60 cell. Therefore, it is very clear to distinguish dHL60 cells from HUVECs. It can be observed that much fewer Grx1-overexpressing dHL60 cells attached to HUVECs than the control (Fig. 5, E and F). In murine neutrophils, Grx1 pretreatment also impaired the adhesion of neutrophils to HUVECs (Fig. S4). In contrast, Grx1 abolishment promoted murine neutrophils adhering to the HUVEC monolayer (Fig. 5G). Then murine Grx1−/− neutrophils were treated with recombinant Grx1 protein. As expected, the elevated adhesion after H2O2 stimulation was attenuated (Fig. 5H). It is noteworthy that sometimes Grx1 showed an impairing effect on adhesion of neutrophils to HUVECs under rest conditions, which might be due to the basic ROS level under rest conditions that has been detected in a previous study (25Zhu H. Kwak H.J. Liu P. Bajrami B. Xu Y. Park S.Y. Nombela-Arrieta C. Mondal S. Kambara H. Yu H. Chai L. Silberstein L.E. Cheng T. Luo H.R. Reactive oxygen species-producing myeloid cells act as a bone marrow niche for sterile inflammation-induced reactive granulopoiesis.J. Immunol. 2017; 198 (28235862): 2854-286410.4049/jimmunol.1602006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistently, we observed a visible glutathionylated α4 signal in murine Grx1−/− neutrophils without stimulation (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these data show that Grx1 might negatively modulate the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells through α4/VCAM-1 signaling in response to ROS. Increasing evidence has shown that integrin α4/VCAM-1 is critical adhesion signaling in the mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow. We explored neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow during inflammation using an intraperitoneal Escherichia coli–induced acute peritonitis model in live mice. As expected, mice pretreated with zaurategrast displayed impaired neutrophil egress from the bone marrow (Fig. 6A). As our in vitro results showed that Grx1 modulated integrin α4/VCAM-1 adhesion signaling, we speculated that Grx1 might take part in neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow by regulating α4 integrin. Preintravenous injection of recombinant Grx1 protein attenuated the glutathionylated α4 integrin of bone marrow neutrophils (Fig. 6B). Grx1-pretreated mice showed fewer neutrophils in peripheral blood, only half compared with control mice, at the 1-h time point after challenge (Fig. 6C), and even before peritonitis, administration of Grx1 impaired the glutathionylation of α4 integrin and decreased the number of neutrophils in peripheral blood (Fig. S5). On the contrary, we compared bone marrow neutrophil mobilization between WT and Grx1−/− mice. We also checked the glutathionylation of α4 integrin and neutrophil number in peripheral blood 1 h after intraperitoneally injecting live E. coli. The Western blot result showed that Grx1 deficiency induced a dramatically elevated level of glutathionylated α4 integrin signal (Fig. 6D), and many more neutrophils in the circulation were detected in Grx1−/− mice (Fig. 6E). We also measured the alternation of neutrophil number in the bone marrow at the 1-h time point after the challenge by flow cytometry. The variation tendencies of neutrophil numbers in the bone marrow were contrary to those in peripheral blood (Fig. S6), but no significant differences were observed in zaurategrast pretreatment, Grx1 pretreatment, or Grx1−/− mice compared with the control. As noted previously, Grx1 knockout mice were similar to their WT littermates in differential leukocyte counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood (13Sakai J. Li J. Subramanian K.K. Mondal S.

Furthermore, α4 integrin inhibitor (zaurategrast) pretreatment lessened the effects of Grx1 depletion. Zaurategrast-treated Grx1−/− mice showed similar neutrophil number as WT mice in the circulation (Fig. 6F). Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the location of neutrophils in the bone marrow after inflammation. The slides showed that more Grx1-attenuated neutrophils appeared near the marrow venous sinusoidal endothelium than WT neutrophils (Fig. 6G and Fig. S7, red). These results suggest that Grx1 might prevent neutrophil egress from the bone marrow via α4 integrin in response to stimuli. As reported previously (26Bajrami B. Zhu H. Kwak H.J. Mondal S. Hou Q.

Metastasis requires a coordinated program of cellular changes that promote increased survival, migration, and energy consumption. These pathways converge on mitochondrial function, where distinct signaling networks of kinases, phosphatases, and metabolic enzymes regulate these processes. The protein kinase A–anchoring protein dAKAP1 compartmentalizes protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling enzymes at the outer mitochondrial membrane and thereby controls mitochondrial function and dynamics. Modulation of these processes occurs in part through regulation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Here, we report an inverse relationship between the expression of dAKAP1 and mesenchymal markers in breast cancer. Molecular, cellular, and in silico analyses of breast cancer cell lines confirmed that dAKAP1 depletion is associated with impaired mitochondrial function and dynamics, as well as with increased glycolytic potential and invasiveness. Furthermore, disruption of dAKAP1–PKA complexes affected cell motility and mitochondrial movement toward the leading edge in invasive breast cancer cells. We therefore propose that depletion of dAKAP1–PKA “signaling islands” from the outer mitochondrial membrane augments progression toward metastatic breast cancer.

Recent advances in detection and diagnosis, when combined with precision therapies that tailor drug treatment to the genetic profile of patients increase the likelihood of good prognoses (1Harbeck N.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the transition to metastatic breast cancers remains challenging, yet it is a necessary prelude to the development of new therapies. The onset of metastasis is often marked by a cellular reprogramming paradigm that alters gene expression patterns, migration competency, and metabolism (3Quail D.F. Joyce J.A.

Recent evidence suggests that PKA activity facilitates the acquisition and maintenance of epithelial-like properties in breast cancer cells (18Pattabiraman D.R. Bierie B. Kober K.I. Thiru P.

Consequently, the loss of anchored PKA signaling at organelles including mitochondria may contribute to phenotypic changes that precede metastasis.

Using a combination of in silico and experimental approaches, we discovered that differential expression of dAKAP1 in breast tumors accompanies molecular and cellular changes that promote metastasis.

In this report, we show that the loss of dAKAP1 signaling islands from the outer mitochondrial membrane occurs as breast cancer cells acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype. Classification of dAKAP1 expression levels as “high” or “low” segregates a panel of breast cancer cell lines into functionally distinct groups that differ both in their metabolism and cell motility. Functionally, we show that dAKAP1-associated PKA represses mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial movement toward the leading edge. These findings support the notion that low dAKAP1 promotes motility in breast cancer cells. This infers that therapeutically regulating these mitochondrial signaling complexes may be applicable to the management of tumor metabolism and invasiveness. The in vivo tumor microenvironment contains two key compartments: tumor cells and the surrounding stroma (20Sotgia F. Whitaker-Menezes D. Martinez-Outschoorn U.E. Salem A.F. Tsirigos A. Lamb R.

This promotes altered tumor metabolism that is associated with metastasis and cell proliferation (9Vander Heiden M.G. DeBerardinis R.J.

Because dAKAP1 may be involved in the establishment and growth of certain tumors, we sought to establish whether changes in the expression pattern of this anchoring protein could serve as a cellular index of metastatic potential (19Rinaldi L.

A panel of 45 paired primary and metastatic breast cancer tumors was screened immunohistochemically for dAKAP1 levels. Analysis of a representative tissue pair is shown in Fig. 1, A–F. Staining in tumors (Fig. 1, A and D, shaded regions) was compared with staining in neighboring stromal tissue. Immunofluorescent detection of dAKAP1 (green) and counterstaining with the nuclear marker DAPI (blue) revealed the tissue distribution of this anchoring protein (Fig. 1, B and E). Samples were classified based on fluorescent intensity, and pseudocolor signal intensity gradients were used to visualize dAKAP1 protein levels in these compartments (Fig. 1, C and F). As predicted, strong dAKAP1 staining in tumors was evident in 60% of the primary tumor samples (Fig. 1G, yellow). In contrast, only 42% of the corresponding metastatic tumor sections exhibited robust expression of this anchoring protein (Fig. 1H, yellow). Thus, dAKAP1 expression is suppressed at secondary metastatic sites as compared with primary tumors. In keeping with this notion, only 4% of the primary breast tumors were scored as weakly expressing dAKAP1 as compared with 22% of the metastatic tumors (Fig. 1, G and H, teal). Paired analyses of these 45 matched tissue samples provide further evidence of reduced dAKAP1 tumor staining after metastasis (Fig. 1I). This supports the hypothesis that low dAKAP1 expression is associated with a molecular environment that promotes metastasis. Tumor cells are thought to transition through a mesenchymal-like state as they invade surrounding tissue and establish distant tumors (28Sciacovelli M. Frezza C. Metabolic reprogramming and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer.FEBS J. 2017; 284 (28444969): 3132-314410.1111/febs.14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the relationship between the expression of dAKAP1, as well as 10 other AKAPs, and a set of mesenchymal markers across a large panel of breast cancer cell lines. mRNA expression data were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) for AKAP genes and an in-house curated set of 36 mesenchymal markers (Fig. 2, A and B) (11Zeisberg M. Neilson E.G. Biomarkers for epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119 (19487819): 1429-143710.1172/JCI36183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar, 12Gujral T.S. Chan M.

We observed a strong inverse correlation between the expression of mesenchymal genes and the mitochondrial anchoring protein dAKAP1 (Fig. 2, A and B). This inverse correlation was unique among not only the AKAPs but also other genes involved in mitochondrial morphology and function (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, a similar inverse association with dAKAP1 expression was also apparent across a variety of cancer etiologies, suggesting that this relationship to mesenchymal markers is broadly conserved across multiple cancer types (Fig. S1, A and B). Correlative analyses in both breast cancer cell lines and tissues further support the notion that dAKAP1 expression is inversely related to a mesenchymal-like phenotype (Fig. S1, C–E). Although some AKAPs were positively correlated with mesenchymal markers in our analyses, we chose to focus on dAKAP1 to study how the regulation of outer mitochondrially anchored PKA signaling might influence breast cancer cell physiology. This negative correlation between dAKAP1 mRNA levels and average mesenchymal marker expression persisted across the 59 breast cancer cell lines represented in the CCLE (Pearson’s r = −0.74 (Figs. 2, E and F, and S1, F and G). Moreover, an expanded analysis of metastasis-related genes revealed that reduced dAKAP1 expression is particularly coincident with the up-regulation of adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix components (Fig. S1H). Next, it was important to determine whether this relationship was conserved in the context of clinical patient samples. Primary breast cancer tumors can be classified in several ways but are clinically resolved into four subtypes: Basal, Her2, Luminal A, and Luminal B (30Parker J.S. Mullins M. Cheang M.C. Leung S.

With this in mind, we analyzed mRNA and protein levels in data sets generated from patient samples (Fig. 2, G and H). Again, dAKAP1 expression was negatively correlated with the appearance of mesenchymal markers. A similar negative correlation was evident in each breast cancer subtype, suggesting that reduction in this anchoring protein is a general phenomenon in tumor cells (Fig. 2, G and H). The inverse correlation was particularly evident in basal and Her2 classifications. This analysis provides evidence that decreased dAKAP1 levels are associated with the appearance of mesenchymal proteins in clinical samples from breast cancer patients. Biochemical validation initially involved immunoblot analysis of primary tumor lysates obtained from four patients (Fig. 2I; samples are detailed in Table S1). Samples were arranged in descending order of dAKAP1 protein levels (as determined in exploratory analyses) (Fig. 2I, top). E-cadherin served as a marker of epithelial identity (Fig. 2I, second from top), whereas N-cadherin and the transcription factor Snail were used as mesenchymal markers (Fig. 2I, middle and second from bottom) (11Zeisberg M. Neilson E.G. Biomarkers for epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119 (19487819): 1429-143710.1172/JCI36183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Detection of Eif2α served as a loading control (Fig. 2I, bottom). Strong immunoblot detection of dAKAP1 expression correlated with high E-cadherin and lower levels of N-cadherin (Fig. 2I, top, middle, and second from bottom, patients A and B) (9Vander Heiden M.G.

Similarly, reduced detection of dAKAP1 was linked to increases in N-cadherin, consistent with the characteristic cadherin switch observed in EMT (Fig. 2I, top, middle, and second from bottom, patients A and B). Low expression of dAKAP1 was also linked to increases in the transcription factor and mesenchymal marker Snail (Fig. 2I, top, middle, and second from bottom, patients C and D). Based on these cumulative analyses, we predicted that dAKAP1 levels drop as cells adopt a mesenchymal phenotype. To systematically examine the role of dAKAP1 in breast cancer cell survival and metastasis, we turned to well-characterized model cell lines. Altered metabolism and increased cell motility are hallmarks of tumor progression (9Vander Heiden M.G. DeBerardinis R.J.

We queried published cell line data sets to investigate whether changes in dAKAP1 are linked to either process. Data from a large-scale proteomic analysis on a panel of breast cancer cell lines showed that dAKAP1 abundance varies across molecular subtypes (34Lawrence R.T. Perez E.M. Hernández D. Miller C.P.

Our analysis shows that luminal subtypes express higher levels of dAKAP1, whereas basal/claudin-low types show minimal expression (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot analysis of lysates from four representative cell line confirmed that expression levels of dAKAP1 protein followed this predicted trend (Fig. 3B, top). Quantification of data from three independent experiments reinforced the notion that dAKAP1 protein is low in basal/claudin-low cells (Fig. 3C, gold columns). Independent analysis by RII overlay shows the distribution of AKAPs in each breast cancer cell line (Fig. S1I).

https://openalex.org/W2908078822,"Introduction Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with rate and severity of trauma. However, it is unclear whether there is an independent association between SES and mortality after injury. Our aim was to assess the relationship between SES and mortality from trauma. Materials and methods We conducted a secondary analysis of the Trauma Audit and Research Network dataset. Participants were patients admitted to NHS hospitals for trauma between January 2015 and December 2015, and resident in England. Analyses used multivariate logistic regression with thirty-day mortality as the main outcome. Co-variates include SES derived from area-level deprivation, age, injury severity and comorbidity. All analyses were stratified into minor and major trauma. Results There were 48,652 admissions (68% for minor injury, ISS<15) included, and 3,792 deaths. Thirty-day mortality was 10% for patients over 85 with minor trauma, which was higher than major trauma for all age groups under 65. Deprivation was not significantly associated with major trauma mortality. For minor trauma, patients older than 40 had significantly higher aORs than the 0–15 age group. Both the most and second most deprived had significantly higher aORs (1.35 and 1.28 respectively). Conclusions This study provides evidence of an independent relationship between SES and mortality after minor trauma, but not for major trauma. Our results identify that, for less severe trauma, older patients and patients with low SES with have an increased risk of 30-day mortality. Policy makers and service providers should consider extending the provision of ‘major trauma’ healthcare delivery to this at-risk population."

The BRICHOS domains from human prosurfactant protein C (proSP-C) and integral membrane protein 2B (Bri2) efficiently reduce neurotoxicity associated with Aβ42 fibril formation both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the serum half-lives and permeability into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of recombinant human (rh) proSP-C and Bri2 BRICHOS domains injected intravenously into WT mice. We found that rh proSP-C BRICHOS has a longer blood serum half-life compared with rh Bri2 BRICHOS and passed into the CSF but not into the brain parenchyma. As judged by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA, rh Bri2 BRICHOS passed into both the CSF and brain. Intracellular immunostaining for rh Bri2 BRICHOS was observed in the choroid plexus epithelium as well as in the cerebral cortex. Our results indicate that intravenously administered rh proSP-C and Bri2 BRICHOS domains have different pharmacokinetic properties and blood–brain/blood–CSF permeability in mice. The finding that rh Bri2 BRICHOS can reach the brain parenchyma after peripheral administration may be harnessed in the search for new therapeutic strategies for managing Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2906035266,"Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) is a transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. GW7647 is a potent PPARα agonist that must reach the nucleus to activate this receptor. In cells expressing human fatty acid–binding protein 1 (FABP1), GW7647 treatment increases FABP1's nuclear localization and potentiates GW7647-mediated PPARα activation; GW7647 is less effective in cells that do not express FABP1. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, here we substituted residues in FABP1 known to dictate lipid signaling by other intracellular lipid-binding proteins. Substitutions of Lys-20 and Lys-31 to Ala in the FABP1 helical cap affected neither its nuclear localization nor PPARα activation. In contrast, Ala substitution of Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96, located in the loops adjacent to the ligand-binding portal region, abolished both FABP1 nuclear localization and GW7647-induced PPARα activation but had little effect on GW7647–FABP1 binding affinity. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we determined the WT FABP1 structure and analyzed the dynamics in the apo and GW7647-bound structures of both the WT and the K57A/E77A/K96A triple mutant. We found that GW7647 binding causes little change in the FABP1 backbone, but solvent exposes several residues in the loops around the portal region, including Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96. These residues also become more solvent-exposed upon binding of FABP1 with the endogenous PPARα agonist oleic acid. Together with previous observations, our findings suggest that GW7647 binding stabilizes a FABP1 conformation that promotes its interaction with PPARα. We conclude that full PPARα agonist activity of GW7647 requires FABP1-dependent transport and nuclear localization processes."
https://openalex.org/W2908176967,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is a key mechanism for activating transmembrane proteins such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) for cellular signaling and degradation. EpCAM is highly expressed in carcinomas and progenitor and embryonic stem cells and is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Strictly sequential cleavage of EpCAM through RIP involves initial shedding of the extracellular domain by α-secretase (ADAM) and β-secretase (BACE) sheddases, generating a membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment EpCTF. Subsequently, the rate-limiting γ-secretase complex catalyzes intramembrane cleavage of EpCTF, generating an extracellular EpCAM-Aβ–like fragment and an intracellular EpICD fragment involved in nuclear signaling. Here, we have combined biochemical approaches with live-cell imaging of fluorescent protein tags to investigate the kinetics of γ-secretase–mediated intramembrane cleavage of EpCTF. We demonstrate that γ-secretase–mediated proteolysis of exogenously and endogenously expressed EpCTF is a slow process with a 50% protein turnover in cells ranging from 45 min to 5.5 h. The slow cleavage was dictated by γ-secretase activity and not by EpCTF species, as indicated by cross-species swapping experiments. Furthermore, both human and murine EpICDs generated from EpCTF by γ-secretase were degraded efficiently (94–99%) by the proteasome. Hence, proteolytic cleavage of EpCTF is a comparably slow process, and EpICD generation does not appear to be suited for rapidly transducing extracellular cues into nuclear signaling, but appears to provide steady signals that can be further controlled through efficient proteasomal degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2907941252,"Systemic endothelial dysfunction is a key characteristic of preeclampsia (PE), which is a serious disorder of human pregnancy. We have previously reported that high-temperature requirement factor (Htr)A4 is a placenta-specific protease that is secreted into the maternal circulation and significantly up-regulated in PE, especially early-onset PE. We have also demonstrated that high levels of HtrA4 detected in the early onset PE circulation induce endothelial dysfunction in HUVECs. In the current study, we investigated whether HtrA4 could cleave the main receptor of VEGFA, the kinase domain receptor (KDR), thereby inhibiting VEGFA signaling. We first demonstrated that HtrA4 cleaved recombinant KDR in vitro. We then confirmed that HtrA4 reduced the level of KDR in HUVECs and inhibited the VEGFA-induced phosphorylation of Akt kinase, which is essential for downstream signaling. Further functional studies demonstrated that HtrA4 prevented the VEGFA-induced tube formation in HUVECs and dose-dependently inhibited the VEGFA-induced angiogenesis in explants of mouse aortic rings. These data strongly suggest that high levels of HtrA4 in the maternal circulation could cleave the main receptor of VEGFA in endothelial cells to induce a wide-spread impairment of angiogenesis. Our studies therefore suggest that HtrA4 is a potential causal factor of early onset PE.-Wang, Y., La, M., Pham, T., Lovrecz, G. O., Nie, G. High levels of HtrA4 detected in preeclamptic circulation may disrupt endothelial cell function by cleaving the main VEGFA receptor KDR."
https://openalex.org/W2906690333,"Eccentric cycling training induces muscle hypertrophy and increases joint power output in non-athletes. Moreover, eccentric cycling can be considered a movement-specific type of strength training for cyclists, but it is hitherto unknown if eccentric cycling training can improve cycling performance in trained cyclists. Twenty-three male amateur cyclists were randomized to an eccentric or a concentric cycling training group. The eccentric cycling was performed at a low cadence (~40 revolution per minute) and the intensity was controlled by perceived effort (12–17 on the Borgs scale) during 2 min intervals (repeated 5–8 times). The cadence and perceived effort of the concentric group matched those of the eccentric group. Additionally, after the eccentric or concentric cycling, both groups performed traditionally aerobic intervals with freely chosen cadence in the same session (4–5 x 4–15 min). The participants trained twice a week for 10 weeks. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximal aerobic power output (Wmax), lactate threshold, isokinetic strength, muscle thickness, pedaling characteristics and cycling performance (6- and 30-sec sprints and a 20-min time trial test) were assessed before and after the intervention period. Inferences about the true value of the effects were evaluated using probabilistic magnitude-based inferences. Eccentric cycling induced muscle hypertrophy (2.3 ± 2.5% more than concentric) and augmented eccentric strength (8.8 ± 5.9% more than concentric), but these small magnitude effects seemed not to transfer into improvements in the physiological assessments or cycling performance. On the contrary, the eccentric training appeared to have limiting or detrimental effects on cycling performance, measured as Wmax and a 20-min time trial. In conclusion, eccentric cycling training did not improve cycling performance in amateur cyclists. Further research is required to ascertain whether the present findings reflect an actual lack of efficacy, negative effects or a delayed response to eccentric cycling training."
https://openalex.org/W2907526101,"The purpose of the current study was to compare CT-signs of portal venous confluence infiltration for actual histopathological infiltration of the vein or the tumor/vein interface (TVI) in borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).101 patients with therapy-naïve, primarily resected PDAC of the pancreatic head without arterial involvement were evaluated. The portal venous confluence was assessed for contour irregularity (defined as infiltration) and degree of contact. The sensitivity and specificity of contour irregularity versus tumor to vein contact >180° as well as the combination of the signs for tumor cell infiltration of the vessel wall or TVI was calculated. Overall survival (OS) was compared between groups.Sensitivity and specificity of contour irregularity for identification of tumor infiltration of the portal venous confluence or the TVI was higher compared to tumor to vessel contact >180° for tumor cell infiltration (96%/79% vs. 91%/38% respectively, p<0.001). The combination of the signs increased specificity to 92% (sensitivity 88%). Patients with contour irregularity/ tumor to vein contact >180°/ both signs had significantly worse overall survival (16.2 vs. 26.5 months/ 17.9 vs. 37.4 months/ 18.5 vs. 26.5 months respectively, all p<0.05).Portal venous confluence contour irregularity is a strong predictor of actual tumor cell infiltration of the vessel wall or the TVI and should be noted as such in radiological reports."
https://openalex.org/W2906859708,"Seasonal floodplain wetland is one of the most variable and diverse habitats found in coastal ecosystems, yet it is also one of the most highly altered by humans. The Yolo Bypass, the primary floodplain of the Sacramento River in California's Central Valley, USA, has been shown to provide various benefits to native fishes when inundated. However, the Yolo Bypass exists as a tidal dead-end slough during dry periods and its value to native fishes has been less studied in this state. During the recent drought (2012-2016), we found higher abundance of the endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), than the previous 14 years of fish monitoring within the Yolo Bypass. Meanwhile, Delta Smelt abundance elsewhere in the estuary was at record lows during this time. To determine the value of the Yolo Bypass as a nursery habitat for Delta Smelt, we compared growth, hatch dates, and diets of juvenile Delta Smelt collected within the Yolo Bypass with fish collected among other putative nursery habitats in the San Francisco Estuary between 2010 and 2016. Our results indicated that when compared to other areas of the estuary, fish in the Yolo Bypass spawned earlier, and offspring experienced both higher quality feeding conditions and growth rates. The occurrence of healthy juvenile Delta Smelt in the Yolo Bypass suggested that the region may have acted as a refuge for the species during the drought years of 2012-2016. However, our results also demonstrated that no single region provided the best rearing habitat for juvenile Delta Smelt. It will likely require a mosaic of habitats that incorporates floodplain-tidal sloughs in order to promote the resilience of this declining estuarine fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2907327710,"Cooperation is one of the most studied paradigms for the understanding of social interactions. Reciprocal altruism -a special type of cooperation that is taught by means of the iterated prisoner dilemma game (iPD)- has been shown to emerge in different species with different success rates. When playing iPD against a reciprocal opponent, the larger theoretical long-term reward is delivered when both players cooperate mutually. In this work, we trained rats in iPD against an opponent playing a Tit for Tat strategy, using a payoff matrix with positive and negative reinforcements, that is food and timeout respectively. We showed for the first time, that experimental rats were able to learn reciprocal altruism with a high average cooperation rate, where the most probable state was mutual cooperation (85%). Although when subjects defected, the most probable behavior was to go back to mutual cooperation. When we modified the matrix by increasing temptation rewards (T) or by increasing cooperation rewards (R), the cooperation rate decreased. In conclusion, we observe that an iPD matrix with large positive reward improves less cooperation than one with small rewards, shown that satisfying the relationship among iPD reinforcement was not enough to achieve high mutual cooperation behavior. Therefore, using positive and negative reinforcements and an appropriate contrast between rewards, rats have cognitive capacity to learn reciprocal altruism. This finding allows to infer that the learning of reciprocal altruism has early appeared in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2907567991,"Several sensitive methods are available for red blood cell (RBC) antibody screening. Among these, gel and glass card systems have demonstrated comparably good performance in retrospective studies and are widely used in routine patient diagnostics, but their performance in prospective studies has not been sufficiently characterised.Gel card (Bio-Rad DiaMed) and glass bead-based (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) column agglutination technologies were used to screen for antibodies prospectively (group A) and for antibody identification in stored and fresh samples known to contain RBC antibodies retrospectively (group B). Untreated reagent RBCs and either papain-treated (Bio-Rad) or ficin-treated panel C cells (Ortho) were used for antibody identification.RBC-reactive antibodies were detected in 22 of 1000 group A samples, three of which tested positive only by gel card agglutination, and four only by glass bead agglutination (including one false positive each). Group B comprised 202 sera with known antibodies: 33 of these samples contained 36 antibodies detected only by gel card agglutination, whereas 9 samples contained antibodies detectable only by glass bead-based agglutination. Discrepancies mostly involved weak antibodies reactive by enzyme only. Two sera contained antibody mixtures that neither system detected completely. Of note, in antibody differentiation batches one and two, anti-Lua was reactive in 7 of 7 and 1 of 8 samples, respectively.Both column agglutination tests for red cell antibodies had equal sensitivity and specificity with unstored samples. In stored samples, weak and enzyme-only antibodies were more frequently detected with the gel card system."
https://openalex.org/W2907488731,"Needles are commonly used in the clinic for percutaneous procedures. The outcome of such procedures heavily depends on accurate placement of the needle. There are two main challenges to achieve high accuracy: First, aligning the needle with the targeted lesion, and second, compensating for the deflection of the needle in the tissue. In order to address these challenges, scientists have developed several robotic setups for needle steering. However, the subject is still under research and reliable implementations which can be used in clinical practice are not yet available. In this paper, we have taken some steps in order to bring needle steering closer to practice. A new hybrid control algorithm is developed, which enables us to control a flexible needle by combing base-manipulation and beveled-tip steering methods. A pre-operative path planner is developed which considers the clinical requirements. The proposed method is tested in the lung of a fresh-frozen human cadaver. The work-flow of the experiments are similar to the current clinical practice. Three experimental cases are used to evaluate the proposed steering algorithm. Experimental Case I shows that using the proposed steering algorithm controllability of the needle is increased. In Case II and Case III, the needle is steered in a gelatin phantom and a human cadaver, respectively. The targeting accuracy of 1.35±0.49mm in gelatin phantom and 1.97±0.89mm in cadave is achieved. A feasibility study is performed, in which a fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle is steered in the lungs of a human cadaver under computed tomography guidance. The targeting error for the feasibility study is 2.89±0.22mm. The results suggest that such a robotic system can be beneficial for clinical use and the patient receives less x-ray radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2908148147,"In order to explore the metric structure of the space of remembered colors, a computer game was designed, where players with normal color vision had to store a color in memory, and later retrieve it by selecting the best match out of a continuum of alternatives. All tested subjects exhibited evidence of focal colors in their mnemonic strategy. We found no concluding evidence that the focal colors of different players tended to cluster around universal prototypes. Based on the Fisher metric, for each subject we defined a notion of distance in color space that captured the accuracy with which similar colors where discriminated or confounded when stored and retrieved from memory. The notions of distance obtained for different players were remarkably similar. Finally, for each player, we constructed a new color scale, in which colors are memorized and retrieved with uniform accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2907632768,"The species Loxosceles rufescens is native to the Mediterranean but considered cosmopolitan because it has been dispersed worldwide. A previous study revealed 11 evolutionary lineages across the Mediterranean, grouped into two main clades, without any clear phylogeographic pattern. The high genetic diversity within this species (p-distances of up to 7.8% in some Mediterranean lineages), together with the results obtained with different species delimitation methods (GMYC, TCS) could indicate the existence of cryptic species. Here we compare the mitochondrial and microsatellite diversity to elucidate if the lineages of L. rufescens in the Mediterranean should be considered different species (cryptic species) or populations of the same species. To do so, we analyzed the cox1 diversity of 196 individuals, of which, we genotyped 148, sampled from 19 localities across the Mediterranean. STRUCTURE analyses of microsatellite data identified two genetic clusters of L. rufescens. One cluster included individuals from Western Mediterranean localities (Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, Balearic Islands) and Israel, while the second one grouped individuals from Italian and Greek localities, including Sardinia, Sicily and Tunisia. These patterns suggest that geographic proximity is the more significant factor in the clustering with microsatellite data and shows the existence of gene flow between the nearest geographic areas, even if the individuals belong to different mitochondrial lineages or clades. The lack of correspondence between both genetic markers suggests that the evolutionary lineages found within L. rufescens should not be considered different species. We conclude that these phylogenetic linages and their distribution may be the result of the maternal evolutionary history of the species and human-mediated dispersion."

Using multivariate analyses, acute morbidity was associated with outcomes such as hospitalisation (OR: 11, 95%-CI 9-13), mortality (OR 15, 95%-CI 6-49), and ICU admission (OR: 46, 95%-CI 25-96). Reliability of the construct ""acute morbidity"" was estimated using Cohens Kappa, which was 0.96 for intra-rater and 0.94 for inter-rater reliability.Reliability of the framework for acute morbidity was high. Construct validity was shown by associations with hospitalisation, mortality, and ICU admission."
