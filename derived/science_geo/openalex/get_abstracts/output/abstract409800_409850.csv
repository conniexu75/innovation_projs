https://openalex.org/W2060915038,"Recent studies have suggested a bacterial role in the development of autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Over 30 billion nucleotide bases of Illumina shotgun metagenomic data were analyzed from stool samples collected from four pairs of matched T1D case-control subjects collected at the time of the development of T1D associated autoimmunity (i.e., autoantibodies). From these, approximately one million open reading frames were predicted and compared to the SEED protein database. Of the 3,849 functions identified in these samples, 144 and 797 were statistically more prevalent in cases and controls, respectively. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, adhesions, motility, phages, prophages, sulfur metabolism, and stress responses were more abundant in cases while genes with roles in DNA and protein metabolism, aerobic respiration, and amino acid synthesis were more common in controls. These data suggest that increased adhesion and flagella synthesis in autoimmune subjects may be involved in triggering a T1D associated autoimmune response. Extensive differences in metabolic potential indicate that autoimmune subjects have a functionally aberrant microbiome. Mining 16S rRNA data from these datasets showed a higher proportion of butyrate-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria in controls compared to cases, while those bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids other than butyrate were higher in cases. Thus, a key rate-limiting step in butyrate synthesis is more abundant in controls. These data suggest that a consortium of lactate- and butyrate-producing bacteria in a healthy gut induce a sufficient amount of mucin synthesis to maintain gut integrity. In contrast, non-butyrate-producing lactate-utilizing bacteria prevent optimal mucin synthesis, as identified in autoimmune subjects."

Systems biology analyses of oleaginous algae could greatly accelerate the commercialization of algal-derived biofuels by elucidating the key components involved in lipid productivity and leading to the initiation of hypothesis-driven strain-improvement strategies. However, higher-level systems biology analyses, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, are highly dependent upon available genomic sequence data, and the lack of these data has hindered the pursuit of such analyses for many oleaginous microalgae. In order to examine the triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathway in the unsequenced oleaginous microalga, Chlorella vulgaris, we have established a strategy with which to bypass the necessity for genomic sequence information by using the transcriptome as a guide. Our results indicate an upregulation of both fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthetic machinery under oil-accumulating conditions, and demonstrate the utility of a de novo assembled transcriptome as a search model for proteomic analysis of an unsequenced microalga."
https://openalex.org/W2171356409,"Bacterial magnetosomes are membrane-enveloped, nanometer-sized crystals of magnetite, which serve for magnetotactic navigation. All genes implicated in the synthesis of these organelles are located in a conserved genomic magnetosome island (MAI). We performed a comprehensive bioinformatic, proteomic and genetic analysis of the MAI in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense. By the construction of large deletion mutants we demonstrate that the entire region is dispensable for growth, and the majority of MAI genes have no detectable function in magnetosome formation and could be eliminated without any effect. Only <25% of the region comprising four major operons could be associated with magnetite biomineralization, which correlated with high expression of these genes and their conservation among magnetotactic bacteria. Whereas only deletion of the mamAB operon resulted in the complete loss of magnetic particles, deletion of the conserved mms6, mamGFDC, and mamXY operons led to severe defects in morphology, size and organization of magnetite crystals. However, strains in which these operons were eliminated together retained the ability to synthesize small irregular crystallites, and weakly aligned in magnetic fields. This demonstrates that whereas the mamGFDC, mms6 and mamXY operons have crucial and partially overlapping functions for the formation of functional magnetosomes, the mamAB operon is the only region of the MAI, which is necessary and sufficient for magnetite biomineralization. Our data further reduce the known minimal gene set required for magnetosome formation and will be useful for future genome engineering approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2080372016,"A variety of animal species utilize the ultraviolet (UV) component of sunlight as their environmental cues, whereas physiological roles of UV photoreception in mammals, especially in human beings, remain open questions. Here we report that mouse neuropsin (OPN5) encoded by the Opn5 gene exhibited an absorption maximum (λmax) at 380 nm when reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal. Upon UV-light illumination, OPN5 was converted to a blue-absorbing photoproduct (λmax 470 nm), which was stable in the dark and reverted to the UV-absorbing state by the subsequent orange light illumination, indicating its bistable nature. Human OPN5 also had an absorption maximum at 380 nm with spectral properties similar to mouse OPN5, revealing that OPN5 is the first and hitherto unknown human opsin with peak sensitivity in the UV region. OPN5 was capable of activating heterotrimeric G protein Gi in a UV-dependent manner. Immuno-blotting analyses of mouse tissue extracts identified the retina, the brain and, unexpectedly, the outer ears as the major sites of OPN5 expression. In the tissue sections of mice, OPN5 immuno-reactivities were detected in a subset of non-rod/non-cone retinal neurons as well as in the epidermal and muscle cells of the outer ears. Most of these OPN5-immuno-reactivities in mice were co-localized with positive signals for the alpha-subunit of Gi. These results demonstrate the first example of UV photoreceptor in human beings and strongly suggest that OPN5 triggers a UV-sensitive Gi-mediated signaling pathway in the mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2094941596,"Activation of the PI3K pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory response. The loss of mTORC2 has been shown to abrogate the activation of Akt, a critical downstream component of PI3K signaling. However, the biological importance of mTORC2 in innate immunity is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that rictor, a key component of mTORC2, plays a critical role in controlling the innate inflammatory response via its ability to regulate FoxO1. Upon LPS stimulation, both rictor-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and rictor knockdown dendritic cells exhibited a hyperinflammatory phenotype. The hyperinflammatory phenotype was due to a defective Akt signaling axis, because both rictor-deficient MEFs and rictor knockdown dendritic cells exhibited attenuated Akt phosphorylation and kinase activity. Analysis of downstream Akt targets revealed that phosphorylation of FoxO1 was impaired in rictor-deficient cells, resulting in elevated nuclear FoxO1 levels and diminished nuclear export of FoxO1 upon LPS stimulation. Knockdown of FoxO1 attenuated the hyperinflammatory phenotype exhibited by rictor-deficient MEFs. Moreover, FoxO1 deletion in dendritic cells attenuated the capacity of LPS to induce inflammatory cytokine expression. These findings identify a novel signaling pathway by which mTORC2 regulates the TLR-mediated inflammatory response through its ability to regulate FoxO1.

PI3K is a heterodimeric enzyme that consists of a regulatory (p85) and a catalytic (p110) subunit (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4640) Google Scholar). PI3K has the ability to phosphorylate both lipids and proteins. The activation of PI3K drives the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. A major downstream target of PI3K is the AGC family member and kinase Akt (Protein Kinase B). Upon the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane through its pleckstrin homology domain. Sequential phosphorylation of Akt on both serine 473 and threonine 308 are required for full activation. Phosphorylation of Akt on threonine 308 is mediated by PDK1 (2Alessi D.R. James S.R.

In contrast to mTORC1, the mTORC2 complex is typically insensitive to rapamycin and consists of mTOR, sin1, mLST8, and rictor (17Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Rüegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N.

Thus, although rictor-deficient cells have been reported to exhibit defective Akt phosphorylation and activity, the loss of rictor appears to only affect a subset of Akt substrates. TLR-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway has been shown to play an important role in regulating both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production (19Martin M. Schifferle R.E. Cuesta N.

Although PI3K activation can engage a diverse number of cell signaling pathways that directly or indirectly affect the inflammatory response, its ability to activate Akt is believed to play a predominant role. Studies by Androulidaki et al. (23Androulidaki A. Iliopoulos D. Arranz A. Doxaki C. Schworer S. Zacharioudaki V. Margioris A.N. Tsichlis P.N. Tsatsanis C.

Several downstream targets of Akt, including mTORC1 and GSK3, have been identified to play pivotal roles in controlling the inflammatory response downstream of Akt. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt or the downstream kinases mTORC1 and GSK3 in TLR-stimulated cells has been shown to differentially control the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (15Weichhart T.

Blood. 2010; 115: 4758-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) assessing the inflammatory properties of mTORC1 suggested that the ability of mTORC1 to control the inflammatory response is likely due to mTORC1 negatively regulating the activity of GSK3 in LPS-stimulated cells. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of Akt signaling in controlling the inflammatory response. In the present study, we investigated the role of rictor in the regulation of the TLR4-mediated inflammatory response. We demonstrate that the loss of rictor by genetic deletion or siRNA-mediated knockdown abrogated the TLR4-mediated phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473, resulting in reduced kinase activity. Rictor deficiency augmented the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation. Analysis of multiple downstream substrates of Akt revealed that phosphorylation of mTORC1/S6K1 and GSK3 was not affected in TLR4-stimulated rictor-deficient MEFs. However, the phosphorylation of FoxO1 was impaired in both rictor-deficient MEFs and rictor knockdown DC. Previous studies have shown that FoxO1, a transcription factor negatively regulated by Akt, enhanced TLR4-mediated inflammation (25Su D. Coudriet G.M. Hyun Kim D. Lu Y. Perdomo G. Qu S. Slusher S. Tse H.M. Piganelli J. Giannoukakis N. Zhang J. Dong H.H. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2624-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that in the absence of rictor, the nuclear levels of FoxO1 were highly elevated, and cells were unable to export FoxO1 into the cytoplasm upon TLR4 stimulation. Complementation of rictor-deficient MEFs with a constitutively active Akt attenuated their hyperinflammatory phenotype and restored FoxO1 phosphorylation and nuclear/cytosolic shuttling. Knockdown of FoxO1 attenuated the hyperinflammatory phenotype exhibited by rictor-deficient MEFs stimulated with LPS. Moreover, FoxO1 KO DC exhibited attenuated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased production of IL-10. These findings identify a novel signaling pathway by which mTORC2 regulates the TLR4-mediated inflammatory response through FoxO1 regulation. DC and MEFs were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium or DMEM (Invitrogen), respectively, and supplemented with 10% FBS (R10), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Ultra pure LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from Invivogen. The SGK-1 inhibitor (GSK 650394) was purchased from Trocris, and the PKC-α inhibitor (Gö 6976) was purchased from LC Laboratories. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and Lipofectamine LTX were obtained from Invitrogen and used for the siRNA transfection studies. TransAMTM NF-κB, FoxO1 transcription factor ELISA kits, and the nuclear extraction kits were purchased from Active Motif. Akt (Ser-473) and Akt (Thr-308) ELISA kits were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Cytokine ELISA kits were purchased from eBioscience or R & D System. Myr-Akt plasmids were obtained from Addgene (catalog number 16244). FoxO1 and rictor-specific siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All of the antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology with the exception of PKC-α (Ser-657; Millipore), total SGK1 (Santa Cruz), and SGK-1 (Ser-422; Santa Cruz). FOXO1L/L mice were generously provided by Dr. DePinho (Harvard University) and bred with CD11c.Cre recombinase mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The experimental mice were CD11c.Cre+.FOXOL/L mice, and the control mice were CD11c.Cre−.FOXO1L/L littermates. Wild type and rictor-deficient MEFs were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 in Costar 6-well plates and rested overnight. After LPS (1 μg/ml) stimulation, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) for immunoblot. After generation, DC were plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 in 12-well Costar plate and rested overnight. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Co.), and samples were run on NuPage Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using the Kodak Image Station 4000MM system. For cytokine analysis, DC or MEFs were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 in Costar 96-well plates and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml). Cell-free supernatants were harvested 20 h after LPS stimulation and assayed for cytokine levels according to the manufacturer's protocol (R & D Systems). The Akt assay kit was purchased from Cell Signaling (9840). The assay was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, wild type and rictor-deficient MEFs were plated in Costar 6-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 106 in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS (R10), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. After resting overnight, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 0 min, 30 min, and 1 h. The medium was aspirated off, and the cells were washed with cold PBS twice before adding the cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling). The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Lysates were then incubated overnight with a Sepharose bead-conjugated Akt antibody (Cell Signaling) at 4 °C along with gentle agitation. The lysates were incubated with the GSK3 fusion protein for 30 min. Western blots were probed for phospho-GSK3 α/β (Ser-9) (Cell Signaling) and total AKT (Cell Signaling) to establish equal loading. For densitometry analysis, phospho-GSK bands were first normalized to total AKT and then to the WT null condition. Bone marrow was flushed from the femur and tibiae of 6-week-old female mice using sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and homogenized by passage through an 18.5-gauge syringe repeatedly. The cells were washed in PBS (Invitrogen), centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (R10), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 ng/ml recombinant murine-GM-CSF (referred to as R10F). The cells were then plated at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/10 ml medium in 100-mm Petri dishes. Three days after harvest, 10 ml of R10F with 5 ng/ml rm-GM-CSG was added to each plate. On day 6, half of the medium was removed from each plate, and the cells in the extracted volume were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh R10F with 5 ng/ml rm-GM-CSG. On day 8, the steps of day 6 were repeated. On day 10, the nonadherent cell were harvested by collecting the supernates, and purity was checked by typing DC markers (>90%). DC were transfected with nontargeting control (Ctrl) siRNA (sc-37007), siRNA-rictor (sc-61479), or siRNA-FoxO1 (sc-35383) from Santa Cruz using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The transfections of the myr-Akt plasmid were performed using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection studies, the levels of total rictor and FoxO1 were assessed by Western blot 3 days after transfection. For cytokine expression studies, transfected cells were stimulated with LPS 3 days post-transfection, and cell-free supernatants were assayed by ELISA 20 h after the addition of LPS (R & D Systems). As previously described, the 3×IRS-pGL2-luciferase reporter (Addgene) is driven by three copies of insulin response sequence, which is recognized by FoxO1(26Tang E.D. Nuñez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The 3×IRS-pGL2-luc reporter was obtained along with the pCMV β-galactosidase reporter from Addgene. MEFs were plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete DMEM (described above) in 12-well plates, rested overnight, and transfected utilizing Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of 3×IRS luciferase reporter and 10 ng of pCMV β-galactosidase reporter. The Promega luciferase reporter assay system was utilized and was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Six hours post-transfection, the cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml). After an additional 18 h, the medium was aspirated off, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed for the assay. Luciferase activity was represented as a ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity. Statistical significance between groups was evaluated by the analysis of variance and the Turkey multiple comparison test using the InStat program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Differences between groups were considered significant at the level of p < 0.05. Akt has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of the TLR response (19Martin M. Schifferle R.E. Cuesta N. Vogel S.N. Katz J. Michalek S.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because mTORC2 is required for the full activation of Akt, we sought to define a role for mTORC2 in TLR4-mediated inflammatory activity. The genetic deletion of rictor, a key component of mTORC2, results in embryonic lethality (9Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y. Moffat J. Brown M. Fitzgerald K.J.

Thus, to determine the role of rictor in regulating the inflammatory response, we initially employed the use of rictor-deficient MEFs (9Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y.

To ensure that the absence of rictor did not result in an altered mTORC1 expression profile, we monitored the levels of mTOR, raptor, mLST8, and rictor in wild type and rictor-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1, A and B). As compared with wild type cells, the absence of rictor did not affect the levels of mTOR, raptor, or mLST8 in rictor-deficient cells. Moreover, the levels of mTOR, rictor, raptor, or mLST8 were not noticeably affected upon stimulation with LPS (Fig. 1, A and B). To date, no studies have described a role for rictor in the phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 in TLR-stimulated innate immune cells (8Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5223) Google Scholar, 9Guertin D.A. Stevens D.M. Thoreen C.C. Burds A.A. Kalaany N.Y. Moffat J. Brown M. Fitzgerald K.J. Sabatini D.M. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Thus, we monitored the phosphorylation levels of Akt on serine 473 in LPS-stimulated MEFs and DC. Stimulation of wild type MEFs with LPS induced the phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473, whereas no detectable levels of Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 were observed in rictor-deficient MEFs stimulated with LPS (Fig. 1, C and D). We also assessed the phosphorylation of Akt in LPS-stimulated DC treated with rictor siRNA. As demonstrated in Fig. 1E, DC treated with siRNA targeting rictor resulted in a greater than 90% reduction in the cellular levels of rictor, as compared with DC treated with control siRNA. An assessment of Akt phosphorylation showed that DC treated with rictor siRNA exhibited a severe defect in their ability to phosphorylate Akt on serine 473, as compared with LPS-stimulated DC treated with control siRNA (Fig. 1F). To directly assess Akt activity, we utilized an Akt activity assay in which Akt was immunoprecipitated and then co-cultured with a peptide fragment of GSK3α/β, a well characterized substrate of Akt. Interestingly, although both nonstimulated, rictor-deficient and wild type MEFs exhibited similar levels of Akt activity, exposure to LPS resulted in a large discrepancy in Akt activity between the wild type and rictor-deficient MEFs. The loss of rictor dramatically reduced the kinase activity of Akt in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1G). Treatment of wild type MEFs with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 diminished Akt activity upon LPS stimulation, illustrating that the induction of Akt activity by LPS is P13K-dependent in MEFs (Fig. 1G). We next assessed whether the loss of rictor affected the LPS-mediated inflammatory response. Stimulation of rictor-deficient MEFs with LPS resulted in significantly enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-8, as compared with wild type control MEFs stimulated with LPS (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, A and B). To confirm and extend these results, we also assessed the LPS-induced inflammatory response in dendritic cells exhibiting a knockdown in the cellular levels of rictor. As shown in Fig. 1E, DC treated with siRNA targeting rictor exhibited a reduction in total cellular levels of rictor, as compared with DC treated with control siRNA. Moreover, LPS-stimulated DC treated with rictor siRNA produced significantly elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12, as compared with LPS-stimulated DC treated with control siRNA (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, C–F). These data demonstrate that rictor plays a fundamental role in controlling the inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated cells. We then asked whether complementation of rictor-deficient cells with a constitutively active Akt would attenuate the hyperinflammatory response exhibited by rictor-deficient MEFs stimulated with LPS. Transfection of rictor-deficient cells with a constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) resulted in enhanced levels of Akt, as compared with rictor-deficient cells transfected with an empty vector control plasmid (Fig. 2G). In addition, treatment of Myr-Akt transfected MEFs with LPS over 6 h did not result in altered expression of Akt levels, demonstrating stable transfection (Fig. 2G). LPS stimulation of rictor-deficient cells expressing an empty vector control plasmid did not exhibit any significant difference in their ability to produce IL-6, as compared with nontransfected rictor-deficient cells stimulated with LPS (Fig. 2H). However, rictor-deficient cells expressing a constitutively active Akt produced significantly less IL-6 when stimulated with LPS, as compared with LPS-stimulated rictor-deficient cells expressing an empty control vector (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2H). Thus, the complementation of rictor-deficient cells with a constitutively active Akt attenuated their hyperinflammatory phenotype upon LPS stimulation. Several downstream targets of Akt have been demonstrated to be critical in regulating the innate inflammatory response. Thus, we screened the phosphorylation and activity of several downstream targets of Akt to determine the cause of the hyperinflammatory phenotype of rictor-deficient cells stimulated with LPS. The constitutively active serine/threonine kinase GSK3-β can be inactivated via the ability of Akt to phosphorylate GSK3-β on serine 9, and this phospho-mediated inactivation of GSK3-β results in suppression of the ability of LPS to induce inflammatory cytokines (21Guha M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32124-32132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 28Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S. Michalek S.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether rictor-deficient MEFs exhibited a defect in their ability to phosphorylate GSK3-β when stimulated with LPS. An evaluation of the levels of phosphorylated GSK3-β in LPS-stimulated, rictor-deficient cells revealed similar levels and kinetics of GSK3-β phosphorylation, as compared with the levels observed in wild type cells stimulated with LPS (Fig. 3A). The Akt signaling pathway is also responsible for the phosphorylation of mTOR, which is a component of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Therefore, any defects in the levels of mTOR phosphorylation would likely result in defective activity downstream of mTORC1. Moreover, because mTORC1 inhibition has been demonstrated to augment the production of inflammatory cytokines by LPS-stimulated cells, a defect in mTOR phosphorylation could potentially explain the hyperinflammatory phenotype exhibited by rictor-deficient cells stimulated with LPS (15Weichhart T. Costantino G. Poglitsch M. Rosner M. Zeyda M. Stuhlmeier K.M. Kolbe T. Stulnig T.M. Hörl W.H. Hengstschläger M. Müller M.

However, as shown in Fig. 3B, the levels of mTOR phosphorylation were similar in both wild type and rictor-deficient MEFs stimulated with LPS. The inability of rictor to affect mTOR phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated cells is further evident by the observation in Fig. 3C, wherein levels of p70S6K1 phosphorylation, a downstream mTORC1 target, were similar in both wild type and rictor-deficient MEFs stimulated with LPS. Recent studies by Lee et al. (29Lee K. Gudapati P. Dragovic S. Spencer C. Joyce S. Killeen N. Magnuson M.A. Boothby M. Immunity. 2010; 32: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) have shown that mTORC2 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB in TCR/CD28-stimulated CD4+ T cells. Because of the importance of NF-κB in the transcription of many inflammatory cytokines, we next assessed whether the phosphorylated and DNA binding levels of NF-κB were affected in rictor-deficient cells stimulated with LPS. Analysis of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation demonstrated that the phosphorylation levels NF-κB p65 serine 536 were not discernibly affected in rictor-deficient MEFs stimulated w"
https://openalex.org/W2062084353,"Decreased zinc levels are a hallmark of prostate cancer tumors as zinc uniquely concentrates in healthy prostate tissue. Increased dietary zinc correlates with decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer and decreased mortality from prostate cancer. The mechanisms of prostatic zinc homeostasis are not known. Lower zinc levels in the tumor are correlated directly with decreased expression of the zinc transporter hZIP1. We report identification of a microRNA cluster that regulates multiple zinc transporters, including hZIP1. Screening in laser capture microdissected prostate cancer tumors identified miR-182 as a potential regulator of hZIP1. Regulation of hZIP1 by miR-182 via two binding sites was confirmed in primary prostate cell cultures. miR-96 and miR-183 are expressed as a cluster with miR-182 and share similar sequences. Array profiling of tissue showed that miR-183, -96, and -182 are higher in prostate cancer tissue compared with normal prostate. Overexpression of the entire miR-183-96-182 cluster suppressed five additional zinc transporters. Overexpression of miR-183, -96, and -182 individually or as a cluster diminished labile zinc pools and reduced zinc uptake, demonstrating this miR cluster as a regulator of zinc homeostasis. We observed regulation of zinc homeostasis by this cluster in prostate cells and HEK-293 cells, suggesting a universal mechanism that is not prostate-specific. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a miR cluster targeting a family of metal transport proteins. Individually or as a cluster, miR-183, -96, and -182 are overexpressed in other cancers too, implicating this miR cluster in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2066662117,"Zinc is indispensable to all forms of life as it is an essential component of many different proteins involved in a wide range of biological processes. Not differently from other metals, zinc in proteins can play different roles that depend on the features of the metal-binding site. In this work, we describe zinc sites in proteins with known structure by means of three-dimensional templates that can be automatically extracted from PDB files and consist of the protein structure around the metal, including the zinc ligands and the residues in close spatial proximity to the ligands. This definition is devised to intrinsically capture the features of the local protein environment that can affect metal function, and corresponds to what we call a minimal functional site (MFS). We used MFSs to classify all zinc sites whose structures are available in the PDB and combined this classification with functional annotation as available in the literature. We classified 77% of zinc sites into ten clusters, each grouping zinc sites with structures that are highly similar, and an additional 16% into seven pseudo-clusters, each grouping zinc sites with structures that are only broadly similar. Sites where zinc plays a structural role are predominant in eight clusters and in two pseudo-clusters, while sites where zinc plays a catalytic role are predominant in two clusters and in five pseudo-clusters. We also analyzed the amino acid composition of the coordination sphere of zinc as a function of its role in the protein, highlighting trends and exceptions. In a period when the number of known zinc proteins is expected to grow further with the increasing awareness of the cellular mechanisms of zinc homeostasis, this classification represents a valuable basis for structure-function studies of zinc proteins, with broad applications in biochemistry, molecular pharmacology and de novo protein design."

The analyses revealed statistically detectable elevations in levels of non-esterified monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and mead acid (20:3n-9) in mid-frontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus of AD patients. Further studies showed that brain mRNAs encoding for isoforms of the rate-limiting enzyme in MUFAs biosynthesis, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1, SCD-5a and SCD-5b), were elevated in subjects with AD. The monounsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio ('desaturation index')--displayed a strong negative correlation with measures of cognition: the Mini Mental State Examination test (r = -0.80; P = 0.0001) and the Boston Naming test (r = -0.57; P = 0.0071). Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role for the lipogenic enzyme SCD in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2042744344,"Modafinil is a mild psychostimulant with pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects. Unlike many conventional stimulants, modafinil has little appreciable potential for abuse, making it a promising therapeutic agent for cocaine addiction. The chief molecular target of modafinil is the dopamine transporter (DAT); however, the mechanistic details underlying modafinil's unique effects remain unknown. Recent studies suggest that the conformational effects of a given DAT ligand influence the magnitude of the ligand's reinforcing properties. For example, the atypical DAT inhibitors benztropine and GBR12909 do not share cocaine's notorious addictive liability, despite having greater binding affinity. Here, we show that the binding mechanism of modafinil is different than cocaine and similar to other atypical inhibitors. We previously established two mutations (W84L and D313N) that increase the likelihood that the DAT will adopt an outward-facing conformational state—these mutations increase the affinity of cocaine-like inhibitors considerably, but have little or opposite effect on atypical inhibitor binding. Thus, a compound's WT/mutant affinity ratio can indicate whether the compound preferentially interacts with a more outward- or inward-facing conformational state. Modafinil displayed affinity ratios similar to those of benztropine, GBR12909 and bupropion (which lack cocaine-like effects in humans), but far different than those of cocaine, β-CFT or methylphenidate. Whereas treatment with zinc (known to stabilize an outward-facing transporter state) increased the affinity of cocaine and methylphenidate two-fold, it had little or no effect on the binding of modafinil, benztropine, bupropion or GBR12909. Additionally, computational modeling of inhibitor binding indicated that while β-CFT and methylphenidate stabilize an “open-to-out” conformation, binding of either modafinil or bupropion gives rise to a more closed conformation. Our findings highlight a mechanistic difference between modafinil and cocaine-like stimulants and further demonstrate that the conformational effects of a given DAT inhibitor influence its phenomenological effects."

Communication performance was low according to OPTION and high according to the three patient administered measures. No correlations were found between observer and patient judges, neither for means nor for single items. Patient report measures showed some moderate correlations.Existing SDM measures do not refer to a single construct. A gold standard is missing to decide whether any of these measures has the potential to indicate patient involvement.Pronounced heterogeneity of the underpinning constructs implies difficulties regarding the interpretation of existing evidence on the efficacy of SDM.

https://openalex.org/W1972251269,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, imports and metabolizes host cholesterol during infection. This ability is important in the chronic phase of infection. Here we investigate the role of the intracellular growth operon (igr), which has previously been identified as having a cholesterol-sensitive phenotype in vitro and which is important for intracellular growth of the mycobacteria. We have employed isotopically labeled low density lipoproteins containing either [1,7,15,22,26-(14)C]cholesterol or [1,7,15,22,26-(13)C]cholesterol and high resolution LC/MS as tools to profile the cholesterol-derived metabolome of an igr operon-disrupted mutant (Δigr) of M. tuberculosis. A partially metabolized cholesterol species accumulated in the Δigr knock-out strain that was absent in the complemented and parental wild-type strains. Structural elucidation by multidimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed the accumulated metabolite to be methyl 1β-(2'-propanoate)-3aα-H-4α-(3'-propanoic acid)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-5-indanone. Heterologously expressed and purified FadE28-FadE29, an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the igr operon, catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 2'-propanoyl-CoA ester side chains in substrates with structures analogous to the characterized metabolite. Based on the structure of the isolated metabolite, enzyme activity, and bioinformatic annotations, we assign the primary function of the igr operon to be degradation of the 2'-propanoate side chain. Therefore, the igr operon is necessary to completely metabolize the side chain of cholesterol metabolites."

To date, RNA-seq analysis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been reported. In this study, we performed transcriptome analyses for 10 matched pairs of cancer and non-cancerous tissues from HCC patients on Solexa/Illumina GAII platform. On average, about 21.6 million sequencing reads and 10.6 million aligned reads were obtained for samples sequenced on each lane, which was able to identify >50% of all the annotated genes for each sample. Furthermore, we identified 1,378 significantly differently expressed genes (DEGs) and 24, 338 differentially expressed exons (DEEs). Comprehensive function analyses indicated that cell growth-related, metabolism-related and immune-related pathways were most significantly enriched by DEGs, pointing to a complex mechanism for HCC carcinogenesis. Positional gene enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were most significantly enriched at chromosome 8q21.3–24.3. The most interesting findings were from the analysis at exon levels where we characterized three major patterns of expression changes between gene and exon levels, implying a much complex landscape of transcript-specific differential expressions in HCC. Finally, we identified a novel highly up-regulated exon-exon junction in ATAD2 gene in HCC tissues. Overall, to our best knowledge, our study represents the most comprehensive characterization of HBV-related HCC transcriptome including exon level expression changes and novel splicing variants, which illustrated the power of RNA-seq and provided important clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis at system-wide levels."
https://openalex.org/W1976303643,"The volume of the hippocampus measured with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the neuropathologic basis of structural MRI changes in the hippocampus in the elderly has not been directly assessed. Postmortem MRI of the aging human brain, combined with histopathology, could be an important tool to address this issue. Therefore, this study combined postmortem MRI and histopathology in 100 elderly subjects from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. First, to validate the information contained in postmortem MRI data, we tested the hypothesis that postmortem hippocampal volume is smaller in subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease compared to subjects with mild or no cognitive impairment, as observed in antemortem imaging studies. Subsequently, the relations of postmortem hippocampal volume to AD pathology, Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, gross infarcts, microscopic infarcts, and hippocampal sclerosis were examined. It was demonstrated that hippocampal volume was smaller in persons with a clinical diagnosis of AD compared to those with no cognitive impairment (P = 2.6 × 10(-7)) or mild cognitive impairment (P = 9.6 × 10(-7)). Additionally, hippocampal volume was related to multiple cognitive abilities assessed proximate to death, with its strongest association with episodic memory. Among all pathologies investigated, the most significant factors related to lower hippocampal volume were shown to be AD pathology (P = 0.0018) and hippocampal sclerosis (P = 4.2 × 10(-7)). Shape analysis allowed for visualization of the hippocampal regions most associated with volume loss for each of these two pathologies. Overall, this investigation confirmed the relation of hippocampal volume measured postmortem to clinical diagnosis of AD and measures of cognition, and concluded that both AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis affect hippocampal volume in old age, though the impacts of each pathology on the shape of the hippocampus may differ."
https://openalex.org/W2169073371,"Background Mutations of the gene for PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are a cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1 protein has been localised to mitochondria and PINK1 gene knockout models exhibit abnormal mitochondrial function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cells derived from PD patients with a range of PINK1 mutations demonstrate similar defects of mitochondrial function, whether the nature and severity of the abnormalities vary between mutations and correlate with clinical features. Methodology We investigated mitochondrial bioenergetics in live fibroblasts from PINK1 mutation patients using single cell techniques. We found that fibroblasts from PINK1 mutation patients had significant defects of bioenergetics including reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, altered redox state, a respiratory deficiency that was determined by substrate availability, and enhanced sensitivity to calcium stimulation and associated mitochondrial permeability pore opening. There was an increase in the basal rate of free radical production in the mutant cells. The pattern and severity of abnormality varied between different mutations, and the less severe defects in these cells were associated with later age of onset of PD. Conclusions The results provide insight into the molecular pathology of PINK1 mutations in PD and also confirm the critical role of substrate availability in determining the biochemical phenotype – thereby offering the potential for novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent these abnormalities."

Here we used cine-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track administered cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) and to measure changes in cardiac function over four months in the infarcted rat heart. Methods and Results CDCs, cultured from neonatal rat heart, comprised a heterogeneous population including cells expressing the mesenchymal markers CD90 and CD105, the stem cell marker c-kit and the pluripotency markers Sox2, Oct3/4 and Klf-4. CDCs (2×106) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP+) were labelled with fluorescent micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO). Labelled cells were administered to the infarcted rat hearts (n = 7) by intramyocardial injection immediately following reperfusion, then by systemic infusion (4×106) 2 days later. A control group (n = 7) was administered cell medium. MR hypointensities caused by the MPIOs were detected at all times and GFP+ cells containing MPIO particles were identified in tissue slices at 16 weeks. At two days after infarction, cardiac function was similar between groups. By 6 weeks, ejection fractions in control hearts had significantly decreased (47±2%), but this was not evident in CDC-treated hearts (56±3%). The significantly higher ejection fractions in the CDC-treated group were maintained for a further 10 weeks. In addition, CDC-treated rat hearts had significantly increased capillary density in the peri-infarct region and lower infarct sizes. MPIO-labelled cells also expressed cardiac troponin I, von Willebrand factor and smooth muscle actin, suggesting their differentiation along the cardiomyocyte lineage and the formation of new blood vessels. Conclusions CDCs were retained in the infarcted rat heart for 16 weeks and improved cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W1998701837,"Cell adhesion and migration depend on engagement of extracellular matrix ligands by integrins. Integrin activation is dynamically regulated by interactions of various cytoplasmic proteins, such as filamin and integrin activators, talin and kindlin, with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin β subunit. Although filamin has been suggested to be an inhibitor of integrin activation, direct functional evidence for the inhibitory role of filamin is limited. Migfilin, a filamin-binding protein enriched at cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contact sites, can displace filamin from β1 and β3 integrins and promote integrin activation. However, its role in activation and functions of different β integrins in human vascular cells is unknown. In this study, using flow cytometry, we demonstrate that filamin inhibits β1 and αIIbβ3 integrin activation, and migfilin can overcome its inhibitory effect. Migfilin protein is widely expressed in different adherent and circulating blood cells and can regulate integrin activation in naturally-occurring vascular cells, endothelial cells and neutrophils. Migfilin can activate β1, β2 and β3 integrins and promote integrin mediated responses while migfilin depletion impairs the spreading and migration of endothelial cells. Thus, filamin can act broadly as an inhibitor and migfilin is a promoter of integrin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2062551853,"Some invasive species flourish in places that impose challenges very different from those faced in their native geographic ranges. Cane toads (Rhinella marina) are native to tropical and subtropical habitats of South and Central America, but have colonised extremely arid regions over the course of their Australian invasion. We radio-tracked 44 adult cane toads at a semi-arid invasion front to investigate how this invasive anuran has managed to expand its geographic range into arid areas that lie outside of its native climatic niche. As predicted from their low physiological control over rates of evaporative water loss, toads selected diurnal shelter sites that were consistently cooler and damper (and thus, conferred lower water loss rates) than nearby random sites. Desiccation risk also had a profound influence on rates of daily movement. Under wet conditions, toads that were far from water moved further between shelter sites than did conspecifics that remained close to water, presumably in an attempt to reach permanent water sources. However, this relationship was reversed under dry conditions, such that only toads that were close to permanent water bodies made substantial daily movements. Toads that were far from water bodies also travelled along straighter paths than did conspecifics that generally remained close to water. Thus, behavioural flexibility—in particular, an ability to exploit spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the availability of moist conditions—has allowed this invasive anuran to successfully colonize arid habitats in Australia. This finding illustrates that risk assessment protocols need to recognise that under some circumstances an introduced species may be able to thrive in conditions far removed from any that it experiences in its native range."

In order to improve our ability to design effective control policies, we investigate the factors affecting their numbers and space use in natural areas of continental Europe.We describe the patterns of cat presence, abundance and space use and analyse the associated environmental and human constraints in a well-preserved Mediterranean natural area with small scattered local farms. We failed in detecting cats in areas away from human settlements (trapping effort above 4000 trap-nights), while we captured 30 individuals near inhabited farms. We identified 130 cats, all of them in farms still in use by people (30% of 128 farms). All cats were free-ranging and very wary of people. The main factor explaining the presence of cats was the presence of people, while the number of cats per farm was mostly affected by the occasional food provisioning with human refuse and the presence of people. The home ranges of eight radio tagged cats were centred at inhabited farms. Males went furthest away from the farms during the mating season (3.8 km on average, maximum 6.3 km), using inhabited farms as stepping-stones in their mating displacements (2.2 km of maximum inter-farm distance moved). In their daily movements, cats notably avoided entering in areas with high fox density.The presence, abundance and space use of cats were heavily dependent on human settlements. Any strategy aiming at reducing their impact in areas of conservation concern should aim at the presence of settlements and their spatial spread and avoid any access to human refuse. The movements of domestic cats would be limited in areas with large patches of natural vegetation providing good conditions for other carnivore mammals such as red foxes."
https://openalex.org/W2008651705,"MicroRNAs (miRs) and the canonical Wnt pathway are known to be dysregulated in human cancers and play key roles during cancer initiation and progression. To identify miRs that can modulate the activity of the Wnt pathway we performed a cell-based overexpression screen of 470 miRs in human HEK293 cells. We identified 38 candidate miRs that either activate or repress the canonical Wnt pathway. A literature survey of all verified candidate miRs revealed that the Wnt-repressing miRs tend to be anti-oncomiRs and down-regulated in cancers while Wnt-activating miRs tend to be oncomiRs and upregulated during tumorigenesis. Epistasis-based functional validation of three candidate miRs, miR-1, miR-25 and miR-613, confirmed their inhibitory role in repressing the Wnt pathway and suggest that while miR-25 may function at the level of â-catenin (β-cat), miR-1 and miR-613 act upstream of β-cat. Both miR-25 and miR-1 inhibit cell proliferation and viability during selection of human colon cancer cell lines that exhibit dysregulated Wnt signaling. Finally, transduction of miR-1 expressing lentiviruses into primary mammary organoids derived from Conductin-lacZ mice significantly reduced the expression of the Wnt-sensitive β-gal reporter.

We identified 30 proteins that were significantly altered by morphine and integrated them into a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network representing potential morphine-regulated protein complexes. Graph theory-based analysis of this network revealed clusters of densely connected and functionally related morphine-regulated clusters of proteins. One of the clusters contained molecular chaperones thought to be involved in regulation of neurotransmission. Within this cluster, cysteine-string protein (CSP) and the heat shock protein Hsc70 were downregulated by morphine. Interestingly, Hsp90, a heat shock protein that normally interacts with CSP and Hsc70, was upregulated by morphine. Moreover, treatment with the selective Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, decreased the somatic signs of naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal, suggesting that Hsp90 upregulation at the presynapse plays a role in the expression of morphine dependence. Thus, integration of proteomics, network analysis, and behavioral studies has provided a greater understanding of morphine-induced alterations in synaptic composition, and identified a potential novel therapeutic target for opiate dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1996053442,"Comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of epigenetic regulation requires identification of molecules bound to genomic regions of interest in vivo. However, non-biased methods to identify molecules bound to specific genomic loci in vivo are limited. Here, we applied insertional chromatin immunoprecipitation (iChIP) to direct identification of components of insulator complexes, which function as boundaries of chromatin domain. We found that the chicken β-globin HS4 (cHS4) insulator complex contains an RNA helicase protein, p68/DDX5; an RNA species, steroid receptor RNA activator 1; and a nuclear matrix protein, Matrin-3, in vivo. Binding of p68 and Matrin-3 to the cHS4 insulator core sequence was mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Thus, our results showed that it is feasible to directly identify proteins and RNA bound to a specific genomic region in vivo by using iChIP."
https://openalex.org/W2071811869,"A highly conserved RNA-motif of yet unknown function, called stem-loop-2-like motif (s2m), has been identified in the 3′ end of the genomes of viruses belonging to different RNA virus families which infect a broad range of mammal and bird species, including Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae and Caliciviridae. Since s2m is such an extremely conserved motif, it is an ideal target for screening for viruses harbouring it. In this study, we have detected and characterized novel viruses harbouring this motif in pigeons by using a s2m-specific amplification. 84% and 67% of the samples from feral pigeons and wood pigeons, respectively, were found to contain a virus harbouring s2m. Four novel viruses were identified and characterized. Two of the new viruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus in the Astroviridae family. We propose two novel species to be included in this genus, Feral pigeon astrovirus and Wood pigeon astrovirus. Two other novel viruses, Pigeon picornavirus A and Pigeon picornavirus B, belong to the Picornaviridae family, presumably to the genus Sapelovirus. Both of the novel picornaviruses harboured two adjacent s2m, called (s2m)2, suggesting a possible increased functional effect of s2m when present in two copies."
https://openalex.org/W2035186696,"Our previous study revealed that human ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) was up-regulated in multidrug-resistant gastric cancer cells and over-expression of RPL6 could protect gastric cancer from drug-induced apoptosis. It was further demonstrated that up-regulation of RPL6 accelerated growth and enhanced in vitro colony forming ability of GES cells while down-regulation of RPL6 exhibited the opposite results. The present study was designed to investigate the potential role of RPL6 in therapy of gastric cancer for clinic. The expression of RPL6 and cyclin E in gastric cancer tissues and normal gastric mucosa was evaluated by immunohistochemisty. It was found that RPL6 and cyclin E were expressed at a higher level in gastric cancer tissues than that in normal gastric mucosa and the two were correlative in gastric cancer. Survival time of postoperative patients was analyzed by Kaplan- Meier analysis and it was found that patients with RPL6 positive expression showed shorter survival time than patients that with RPL6 negative expression. RPL6 was then genetically down-regulated in gastric cancer SGC7901 and AGS cell lines by siRNA. It was demonstrated that down-regulation of RPL6 reduced colony forming ability of gastric cancer cells in vitro and reduced cell growth in vivo. Moreover, down-regulation of RPL6 could suppress G1 to S phase transition in these cells. Further, we evidenced that RPL6 siRNA down-regulated cyclin E expression in SGC7901 and AGS cells. Taken together, these data suggested that RPL6 was over-expressed in human gastric tissues and caused poor prognosis. Down-regulation of RPL6 could suppress cell growth and cell cycle progression at least through down-regulating cyclin E and which might be used as a novel approach to gastric cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1995876221,"Objective To establish whether severe obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) can be identified reliably at or before three months of age. Methods Severe OBPP was defined as neurotmesis or avulsion of spinal nerves C5 and C6 irrespective of additional C7-T1 lesions, assessed during surgery and confirmed by histopathological examination. We first prospectively studied a derivation group of 48 infants with OBPP with a minimal follow-up of two years. Ten dichotomous items concerning active clinical joint movement and needle electromyography of the deltoid, biceps and triceps muscles were gathered at one week, one month and three months of age. Predictors for a severe lesion were identified using a two-step forward logistic regression analysis. The results were validated in two independent cohorts of OBPP infants of 60 and 13 infants. Results Prediction of severe OBPP at one month of age was better than at one week and at three months. The presence of elbow extension, elbow flexion and of motor unit potentials in the biceps muscle correctly predicted whether lesions were mild or severe in 93.6% of infants in the derivation group (sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.88), in 88.3% in the first validation group (sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.76) and in 84.6% in the second group (sensitivity of 1.0, specificity 0.66). Interpretation Infants with OBPP with severe lesions can be identified at one month of age by testing elbow extension, elbow flexion and recording motor unit potentials (MUPs) in the biceps muscle. The decision rule implies that children without active elbow extension at one month should be referred to a specialized center, while children with active elbow extension as well as active flexion should not. When there is active elbow extension, but no active elbow flexion an EMG is needed; absence of MUPs in the biceps muscle is an indication for referral."
https://openalex.org/W2073962137,"Background Informed consent (IC) has been an international standard for decades for the ethical conduct of clinical trials. Yet frequently study participants have incomplete understanding of key issues, a problem exacerbated by language barriers or lack of familiarity with research concepts. Few investigators measure participant comprehension of IC, while even fewer conduct interim assessments once a trial is underway. Methods and Findings We assessed comprehension of IC using a 20-question true/false quiz administered in 6-month intervals in the context of a placebo-controlled, randomized trial for the prevention of tuberculosis among HIV-infected adults in Botswana (2004–2009). Quizzes were offered in both Setswana and English. To enroll in the TB trial, participants were required to have ≥16/20 correct responses. We examined concepts understood and the degree to which understanding changed over three-years. We analyzed 5,555 quizzes from 1,835 participants. The participants' highest education levels were: 28% primary, 59% secondary, 9% tertiary and 7% no formal education. Eighty percent of participants passed the enrollment quiz (Quiz1) on their first attempt and the remainder passed on their second attempt. Those having higher than primary education and those who took the quiz in English were more likely to receive a passing score on their first attempt (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 3.1 (2.4–4.0) and 1.5 (1.2, 1.9), respectively). The trial's purpose or procedures were understood by 90–100% of participants, while 44–77% understood randomization, placebos, or risks. Participants who failed Quiz1 on their initial attempt were more likely to fail quizzes later in the trial. Pass rates improved with quiz re-administration in subsequent years. Conclusions Administration of a comprehension quiz at enrollment and during follow-up was feasible in a large, international collaboration and efficiently determined IC comprehension by trial participants. Strategies to improve understanding of concepts like placebos and randomization are needed. Comprehension assessments throughout a study may reinforce key concepts."
https://openalex.org/W2069253401,"This paper illustrates the use of a combined neural network model based on Stacked Generalization method for classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. In conventional Stacked Generalization method, the combiner learns to map the base classifiers' outputs to the target data. We claim adding the input pattern to the base classifiers' outputs helps the combiner to obtain knowledge about the input space and as the result, performs better on the same task. Experimental results support our claim that the additional knowledge according to the input space, improves the performance of the proposed method which is called Modified Stacked Generalization. In particular, for classification of 14966 ECG beats that were not previously seen during training phase, the Modified Stacked Generalization method reduced the error rate for 12.41% in comparison with the best of ten popular classifier fusion methods including Max, Min, Average, Product, Majority Voting, Borda Count, Decision Templates, Weighted Averaging based on Particle Swarm Optimization and Stacked Generalization."
https://openalex.org/W1987282023,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were identified several years ago and are key in controlling autoimmune diseases and limiting immune responses to foreign antigens, including alloantigens. In vivo imaging techniques including intravital microscopy as well as whole body imaging using bioluminescence probes have contributed to the understanding of in vivo Treg function, their mechanisms of action and target cells. Imaging of the human sodium/iodide symporter via Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) has been used to image various cell types in vivo. It has several advantages over the aforementioned imaging techniques including high sensitivity, it allows non-invasive whole body studies of viable cell migration and localisation of cells over time and lastly it may offer the possibility to be translated to the clinic. This study addresses whether SPECT/CT imaging can be used to visualise the migratory pattern of Tregs in vivo. Treg lines derived from CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells were retrovirally transduced with a construct encoding for the human Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) and the fluorescent protein mCherry and stimulated with autologous DCs. NIS expressing self-specific Tregs were specifically radiolabelled in vitro with Technetium-99m pertechnetate (99mTcO4−) and exposure of these cells to radioactivity did not affect cell viability, phenotype or function. In addition adoptively transferred Treg-NIS cells were imaged in vivo in C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice by SPECT/CT using 99mTcO4−. After 24 hours NIS expressing Tregs were observed in the spleen and their localisation was further confirmed by organ biodistribution studies and flow cytometry analysis. The data presented here suggests that SPECT/CT imaging can be utilised in preclinical imaging studies of adoptively transferred Tregs without affecting Treg function and viability thereby allowing longitudinal studies within disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2023047498,"Collagens, the most abundant proteins in animals, are modified by hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues and by glycosylation of hydroxylysine. Dedicated prolyl hydroxylase, lysyl hydroxylase, and collagen glycosyltransferase enzymes localized in the endoplasmic reticulum mediate these modifications prior to the formation of the collagen triple helix. Whereas collagen-like proteins have been described in some fungi, bacteria, and viruses, the post-translational machinery modifying collagens has never been described outside of animals. We demonstrate that the L230 open reading frame of the giant virus Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus encodes an enzyme that has distinct lysyl hydroxylase and collagen glycosyltransferase domains.

Mainly linear proteins, collagens are characterized by domains composed of Gly-X-Y repeats with Pro and Lys often present at positions X and Y. Nascent procollagen polypeptides are post-translationally modified beginning with the hydroxylation of selected Pro (2Mizuno K. Hayashi T. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Some hydroxylysine (Hyl) 2The abbreviations used are: HylhydroxylysineHyp4-hydroxyprolineColGlcTcollagen glucosyltransferaseLBlysogeny brothFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. residues are subsequently modified by addition of carbohydrates, forming the disaccharide Glc-α1,2-Gal-β1,O-Hyl (4Spiro R.G.

The extent of glycosylation can vary with tissue distribution and the type of collagen. The presence of 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) is essential for collagen triple helix formation and thermal stability (6Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Lys hydroxylation produces substrates for glycosylation reactions and is also important for the cross-linking of collagen fibrils. The biological significance of collagen post-translational modifications is reflected in the diseases associated with defective collagen modifications. Mutation of the lysyl hydroxylase genes PLOD1, PLOD2, and PLOD3 cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI (7Hyland J. Ala-Kokko L. Royce P. Steinmann B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Nat.

Interestingly, non-fibrillar proteins with collagen domains such as the hormone adiponectin (12Richards A.A. Stephens T. Charlton H.K. Jones A. Macdonald G.A. Prins J.B. Whitehead J.P. Mol.

The collagen domains of these proteins are involved in protein folding and oligomerization, making it likely that the glycan chains are involved in this process as well.Collagens and collagen-like proteins are not confined to animals. Some fungi such as Metarhizium anisopliae (15Wang C. St Leger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Little is known about collagen-like proteins in bacteria, fungi, and phages, and none of these proteins have been characterized for the common collagen post-translational modifications that are necessary for proper triple helix formation. The first evidence suggesting that viruses might code for their own glycosyltransferase genes rather than relying solely on host cell machinery was described in the Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (21Wang I.N.

This is the first report of a collagen-glycosylating enzyme in viruses and of hydroxylysine outside of animals. It is interesting to note that an animal collagen glucosyltransferase activity has been reported for human lysyl hydroxylase 3 (34Heikkinen J. Risteli M. Wang C. Latvala J. Rossi M. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36158-36163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Importantly, the description of mimivirus L230 activity reveals a novel type of collagen core glycosylation in nature.The seven mimivirus collagen proteins are dominated by Gly-X-Y repeats but are poor in proline content in contrast to mammalian collagens. The in vitro activity of a viral prolyl hydroxylase toward peptide substrates has been reported in P. bursaria chlorella virus-1 (35Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the presence of hydroxyproline in viral proteins has not yet been established nor is it known whether this viral enzyme is a collagen-modifying hydroxylase. Although Hyp is generally required for thermal stability of animal collagen (36Shoulders M.D. Raines R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 929-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), there are instances such as in worms from deep sea hydrothermal vents where the typical role of Hyp is replaced by glycosylated Thr (37Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether or not mimivirus collagens form triple helices and whether triple helix formation is Hyp-dependent or is dependent on some other residue type is as yet unknown. Additionally, the role of collagen in mimivirus biology remains an open question. It seems reasonable to speculate that there is a structural function for these proteins, possibly contributing to the dense layer of fibrils reported to cover the viral capsid (39Xiao C. Chipman P.R. Battisti A.J. Bowman V.D. Renesto P. Raoult D. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These fibrils could play a role in providing the virus resistance to the environment where viral interaction with host cells may be an infrequent occurrence.The apparent ease with which giant viruses accumulate and potentially disseminate genes from various organisms (40Benarroch D. Claverie J.M. Raoult D. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Filée J. Pouget N. Chandler M. BMC Evol.

La Scola B. Raoult D. Virus Res. 2006; 117: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) begs the question of what role mimivirus may have played in the evolution of collagen biology. The presence of collagens in animals and the near absence in other organisms suggests that collagen biology was an animal adaptation. The disparity between animal collagen sequences and typical mimivirus sequences, including a paucity of Pro in the viral collagens, raises potential questions about the origin of collagen biology. The possibility exists that collagens did not originate with animals but first emerged from a microbial source earlier in evolution. Nevertheless, the ability of viruses such as mimivirus to transfer genes from one organism to another signifies a potential role in the evolution of collagen biology irrespective of the ultimate origins of collagens in nature.There are other potential glycosyltransferase enzymes in the mimivirus genome, including L137, L193, and L363, which are homologous to bacterial glycosyltransferases. The L179 ORF is homologous to an Archaea glycosyltransferase, and the L373, R654, and R655 ORFs are homologous to animal glycosyltransferases (24Raoult D. Audic S. Robert C. Abergel C. Renesto P.

J. 2011; 8: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whether or not the Glc residue on Hyl in mimivirus collagens is further elongated possibly by one of these enzymes is still an unanswered question. Indeed, our analysis did not identify Glc-O-Hyl in mimivirus protein extracts, whereas Hyl was readily detectable. It was reported recently that mimivirus experiences a significant reduction in genome size after 150 passages through an amoebal host (48Boyer M. Azza S. Barrassi L. Klose T. Campocasso A. Pagnier I. Fournous G. Borg A. Robert C. Zhang X. Desnues C. Henrissat B. Rossmann M.G. La Scola B. Raoult D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 10296-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the ORFs of several putative mimivirus glycosyltransferases and one of the collagen genes were either deleted or disrupted in this reduced genome, L230 was maintained as were the remaining six collagen genes.Mimivirus ColGlcT is the very first microbial collagen glycosyltransferase described. It is also the first viral protein shown to be a bifunctional enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. This work confirms the presence of post-translationally modified collagen domains in proteins outside the three currently accepted domains of life.

DISCUSSIONWe have shown that mimivirus L230 is a bifunctional lysyl hydroxylase and glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. This is the first report of a collagen-glycosylating enzyme in viruses and of hydroxylysine outside of animals. It is interesting to note that an animal collagen glucosyltransferase activity has been reported for human lysyl hydroxylase 3 (34Heikkinen J. Risteli M. Wang C. Latvala J. Rossi M. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36158-36163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Importantly, the description of mimivirus L230 activity reveals a novel type of collagen core glycosylation in nature.The seven mimivirus collagen proteins are dominated by Gly-X-Y repeats but are poor in proline content in contrast to mammalian collagens. The in vitro activity of a viral prolyl hydroxylase toward peptide substrates has been reported in P. bursaria chlorella virus-1 (35Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the presence of hydroxyproline in viral proteins has not yet been established nor is it known whether this viral enzyme is a collagen-modifying hydroxylase. Although Hyp is generally required for thermal stability of animal collagen (36Shoulders M.D. Raines R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 929-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), there are instances such as in worms from deep sea hydrothermal vents where the typical role of Hyp is replaced by glycosylated Thr (37Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether or not mimivirus collagens form triple helices and whether triple helix formation is Hyp-dependent or is dependent on some other residue type is as yet unknown. Additionally, the role of collagen in mimivirus biology remains an open question. It seems reasonable to speculate that there is a structural function for these proteins, possibly contributing to the dense layer of fibrils reported to cover the viral capsid (39Xiao C. Chipman P.R. Battisti A.J. Bowman V.D. Renesto P. Raoult D. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These fibrils could play a role in providing the virus resistance to the environment where viral interaction with host cells may be an infrequent occurrence.The apparent ease with which giant viruses accumulate and potentially disseminate genes from various organisms (40Benarroch D.

La Scola B. Raoult D. Virus Res. 2006; 117: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) begs the question of what role mimivirus may have played in the evolution of collagen biology. The presence of collagens in animals and the near absence in other organisms suggests that collagen biology was an animal adaptation. The disparity between animal collagen sequences and typical mimivirus sequences, including a paucity of Pro in the viral collagens, raises potential questions about the origin of collagen biology. The possibility exists that collagens did not originate with animals but first emerged from a microbial source earlier in evolution. Nevertheless, the ability of viruses such as mimivirus to transfer genes from one organism to another signifies a potential role in the evolution of collagen biology irrespective of the ultimate origins of collagens in nature.There are other potential glycosyltransferase enzymes in the mimivirus genome, including L137, L193, and L363, which are homologous to bacterial glycosyltransferases. The L179 ORF is homologous to an Archaea glycosyltransferase, and the L373, R654, and R655 ORFs are homologous to animal glycosyltransferases (24Raoult D. Audic S. Robert C. Abergel C. Renesto P.

J. 2011; 8: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whether or not the Glc residue on Hyl in mimivirus collagens is further elongated possibly by one of these enzymes is still an unanswered question. Indeed, our analysis did not identify Glc-O-Hyl in mimivirus protein extracts, whereas Hyl was readily detectable. It was reported recently that mimivirus experiences a significant reduction in genome size after 150 passages through an amoebal host (48Boyer M. Azza S. Barrassi L. Klose T. Campocasso A. Pagnier I. Fournous G. Borg A. Robert C. Zhang X. Desnues C. Henrissat B. Rossmann M.G. La Scola B. Raoult D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 10296-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the ORFs of several putative mimivirus glycosyltransferases and one of the collagen genes were either deleted or disrupted in this reduced genome, L230 was maintained as were the remaining six collagen genes.Mimivirus ColGlcT is the very first microbial collagen glycosyltransferase described. It is also the first viral protein shown to be a bifunctional enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. This work confirms the presence of post-translationally modified collagen domains in proteins outside the three currently accepted domains of life. We have shown that mimivirus L230 is a bifunctional lysyl hydroxylase and glycosyltransferase enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen.

It was reported recently that mimivirus experiences a significant reduction in genome size after 150 passages through an amoebal host (48Boyer M. Azza S. Barrassi L. Klose T. Campocasso A. Pagnier I.

Although the ORFs of several putative mimivirus glycosyltransferases and one of the collagen genes were either deleted or disrupted in this reduced genome, L230 was maintained as were the remaining six collagen genes. Mimivirus ColGlcT is the very first microbial collagen glycosyltransferase described. It is also the first viral protein shown to be a bifunctional enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. This work confirms the presence of post-translationally modified collagen domains in proteins outside the three currently accepted domains of life.

This study describes newly-diagnosed HIV cases and characterizes correlates associated with infection.A consecutive sample of persons presenting for HIV VCT at the municipal sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic from 2004 to 2006 (N = 9,868) were evaluated by standard enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA). HIV antibody-positive specimens were characterized as recent infections using a less-sensitive EIA. HIV-RNA pooled testing was performed on HIV antibody-negative specimens to identify acute infections. HIV antibody-positive and acute infection specimens were evaluated for drug resistance by sequence analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate associations. The 380 newly-diagnosed HIV cases included 29 acute infections, 128 recent infections, and 47 drug-resistant cases, with no significant increases or decreases in prevalence over the three years studied. HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 11.0% in 2004, 13.4% in 2005 and 14.9% in 2006 (p = 0.36). Resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the most common pattern detected, present in 28 cases of resistance (59.6%). Among MSM, recent infection was associated with amphetamine use (AOR = 2.67; p<0.001), unprotected anal intercourse (AOR = 2.27; p<0.001), sex with a known HIV-infected partner (AOR = 1.64; p = 0.02), and history of gonorrhea (AOR = 1.62; p = 0.03).New HIV diagnoses, recent infections, acute infections and transmitted drug resistance prevalence remained stable between 2004 and 2006. Resistance to NNRTI comprised more than half of the drug-resistant cases, a worrisome finding given its role as the backbone of first-line antiretroviral therapy in San Francisco as well as worldwide. The integration of HIV-1 drug resistance, recent infection, and acute infection testing should be considered for existing HIV/STI surveillance and prevention activities, particularly in an era of enhanced efforts for early diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2074856198,"Terrorist use of a radiological dispersal device (RDD, or ""dirty bomb""), which combines a conventional explosive device with radiological materials, is among the National Planning Scenarios of the United States government. Understanding employee willingness to respond is critical for planning experts. Previous research has demonstrated that perception of threat and efficacy is key in the assessing willingness to respond to a RDD event.An anonymous online survey was used to evaluate the willingness of hospital employees to respond to a RDD event. Agreement with a series of belief statements was assessed, following a methodology validated in previous work. The survey was available online to all 18,612 employees of the Johns Hopkins Hospital from January to March 2009.Surveys were completed by 3426 employees (18.4%), whose demographic distribution was similar to overall hospital staff. 39% of hospital workers were not willing to respond to a RDD scenario if asked but not required to do so. Only 11% more were willing if required. Workers who were hesitant to agree to work additional hours when required were 20 times less likely to report during a RDD emergency. Respondents who perceived their peers as likely to report to work in a RDD emergency were 17 times more likely to respond during a RDD event if asked. Only 27.9% of the hospital employees with a perception of low efficacy declared willingness to respond to a severe RDD event. Perception of threat had little impact on willingness to respond among hospital workers.Radiological scenarios such as RDDs are among the most dreaded emergency events yet studied. Several attitudinal indicators can help to identify hospital employees unlikely to respond. These risk-perception modifiers must then be addressed through training to enable effective hospital response to a RDD event."
https://openalex.org/W2053966287,"In the South American abelisaurids Carnotaurus sastrei, Aucasaurus garridoi, and, to a lesser extent Skorpiovenator bustingorryi, the anterior caudal ribs project at a high dorsolateral inclination and have interlocking lateral tips. This unique morphology facilitated the expansion of the caudal hypaxial musculature at the expense of the epaxial musculature. Distinct ridges on the ventrolateral surfaces of the caudal ribs of Aucasaurus garridoi are interpreted as attachment scars from the intra caudofemoralis/ilio-ischiocaudalis septa, and confirm that the M. caudofemoralis of advanced South American abelisaurids originated from a portion of the caudal ribs. Digital muscle models indicate that, relative to its overall body size, Carnotaurus sastrei had a substantially larger M. caudofemoralis than any other theropod yet studied. In most non-avian theropods, as in many extant sauropsids, the M. caudofemoralis served as the primary femoral retractor muscle during the locomotive power stroke. This large investment in the M. caudofemoralis suggests that Carnotaurus sastrei had the potential for great cursorial abilities, particularly short-burst sprinting. However, the tightly interlocking morphology of the anterior caudal vertebrae implies a reduced ability to make tight turns. Examination of these vertebral traits in evolutionary context reveals a progressive sequence of increasing caudofemoral mass and tail rigidity among the Abelisauridae of South America."
https://openalex.org/W1990323915,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a pleiotropic cytokine originally identified for its role in erythropoiesis. In addition, in various preclinical models EPO exhibited protective activity against tissue injury. There is an urgent need for potent treatments of autoimmune driven disorders of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), such as the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a disabling autoimmune disease associated with relevant morbidity and mortality. To test the therapeutic potential of EPO in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) - an animal model of human GBS – immunological and clinical effects were investigated in a preventive and a therapeutic paradigm. Treatment with EPO reduced clinical disease severity and if given therapeutically also shortened the recovery phase of EAN. Clinical findings were mirrored by decreased inflammation within the peripheral nerve, and myelin was well maintained in treated animals. In contrast, EPO increased the number of macrophages especially in later stages of the experimental disease phase. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta was upregulated in the treated cohorts. In vitro experiments revealed less proliferation of T cells in the presence of EPO and TGF-beta was moderately induced, while the secretion of other cytokines was almost not altered by EPO. Our data suggest that EPO revealed its beneficial properties by the induction of beneficial macrophages and the modulation of the immune system towards anti-inflammatory responses in the PNS. Further studies are warranted to elaborate the clinical usefulness of EPO for treating immune-mediated neuropathies in affected patients."

Mutations in the gene encoding the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette half-transporter, adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP), are the primary cause of X-ALD. To gain a better understanding of ALDP dysfunction, we searched for interaction partners of ALDP and identified binary interactions to proteins with functions in fatty acid synthesis (ACLY, FASN, and ACC) and activation (FATP4), constituting a thus far unknown fatty acid synthesis-transport machinery at the cytoplasmic side of the peroxisomal membrane. This machinery adds to the knowledge of the complex mechanisms of peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism at a molecular level and elucidates potential epigenetic mechanisms as regulatory processes in the pathogenesis and thus the clinical course of X-ALD."
https://openalex.org/W2159921485,"The Pi-ta gene in rice has been effectively used to control rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae worldwide. Despite a number of studies that reported the Pi-ta gene in domesticated rice and wild species, little is known about how the Pi-ta gene has evolved in US weedy rice, a major weed of rice. To investigate the genome organization of the Pi-ta gene in weedy rice and its relationship to gene flow between cultivated and weedy rice in the US, we analyzed nucleotide sequence variation at the Pi-ta gene and its surrounding 2 Mb region in 156 weedy, domesticated and wild rice relatives. We found that the region at and around the Pi-ta gene shows very low genetic diversity in US weedy rice. The patterns of molecular diversity in weeds are more similar to cultivated rice (indica and aus), which have never been cultivated in the US, rather than the wild rice species, Oryza rufipogon. In addition, the resistant Pi-ta allele (Pi-ta) found in the majority of US weedy rice belongs to the weedy group strawhull awnless (SH), suggesting a single source of origin for Pi-ta. Weeds with Pi-ta were resistant to two M. oryzae races, IC17 and IB49, except for three accessions, suggesting that component(s) required for the Pi-ta mediated resistance may be missing in these accessions. Signatures of flanking sequences of the Pi-ta gene and SSR markers on chromosome 12 suggest that the susceptible pi-ta allele (pi-ta), not Pi-ta, has been introgressed from cultivated to weedy rice by out-crossing."

https://openalex.org/W2021165802,"Phytochromes are widely distributed biliprotein photoreceptors with a conserved N-terminal chromophore-binding domain. Most phytochromes bear a light-regulated C-terminal His kinase or His kinase-like region. We investigated the effects of light and temperature on the His kinase activity of the phytochrome Agp1 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. As in earlier studies, the phosphorylation activity of the holoprotein after far-red irradiation (where the red-light absorbing Pr form dominates) was stronger than that of the holoprotein after red irradiation (where the far red-absorbing Pfr form dominates). Phosphorylation activities of the apoprotein, far red-irradiated holoprotein, and red-irradiated holoprotein decreased when the temperature increased from 25°C to 35°C; at 40°C, almost no kinase activity was detected. The activity of a holoprotein sample incubated at 40°C was nearly completely restored when the temperature returned to 25°C. UV/visible spectroscopy indicated that the protein was not denatured up to 45°C. At 50°C, however, Pfr denatured faster than the dark-adapted sample containing the Pr form of Agp1. The Pr visible spectrum was unaffected by temperatures of 20–45°C, whereas irradiated samples exhibited a clear temperature effect in the 30–40°C range in which prolonged irradiation resulted in the photoconversion of Pfr into a new spectral species termed Prx. Pfr to Prx photoconversion was dependent on the His-kinase module of Agp1; normal photoconversion occurred at 40°C in the mutant Agp1-M15, which lacks the C-terminal His-kinase module, and in a domain-swap mutant in which the His-kinase module of Agp1 is replaced by the His-kinase/response regulator module of the other A. tumefaciens phytochrome, Agp2. The temperature-dependent kinase activity and spectral properties in the physiological temperature range suggest that Agp1 serves as an integrated light and temperature sensor in A. tumefaciens."

Yeast cells lacking UFD2 exhibit altered chromosome stability and several spindle-related phenotypes, expanding the biological function of Ufd2.

https://openalex.org/W2052834908,"Human N-Myc downstream regulated gene2 (NDRG2), a novel gene has been cloned and shown to be related to a number of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, stress, and apoptosis. NDRG2 has also been linked to age-related Alzheimer's disease. Since the role of this gene in senescence is limited, we have investigated the potential role of NDRG2 in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs), a paradigm implicated in age-related cataract.Cultured HLECs (SRA01/04) were subjected to prolonged exposure to low dose of H(2)O(2) to simulate senescence. After being exposed to 50 µM H(2)O(2) for 2 weeks, HLECs senescent-morphological changes appeared, cell viability decreased dramatically, cell proliferation reduced from 37.4% to 16.1%, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity increased from 0 to 90.3%. Ndrg2 protein expression was also significantly increased in these senescent cells. To induce overexpression of NDRG2, SRA01/04 cells were infected with the adenoviral vector of NDRG2. In these cells, overexpression of NDRG2 resulted in a fibroblast-like appearance and the cell viability decreased about 20%. In addition, the NDRG2-overexpression cells demonstrated 20% lower viability when exposed to 50-200 µM H(2)O(2) for acute oxidative stress. Furthermore, the expression of NDRG2 from age-related cataracts was up-regulated 2-fold at both mRNA and protein levels compared with the clear lenses.NDRG2 is up regulated not only in the ageing process of HLECs in vitro but also in the cells from human age-related cortical cataract in vivo. Up-regulation of NDRG2 induces cell morphological changes, reduces cell viability, and especially lowers cellular resistance to oxidative stress. NDRG2-mediated affects in HLECs may associate with age-related cataract formation."
https://openalex.org/W1973686370,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes differentiation into filamentous-like forms and invades the growth medium as a foraging response to nutrient and environmental stresses. These developmental responses are under the downstream control of effectors regulated by the cAMP/PKA and MAPK pathways. However, the upstream sensors and signals that induce filamentous growth through these signaling pathways are not fully understood. Herein, through a biochemical purification of the yeast TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1), we identify several proteins implicated in yeast filamentous growth that directly associate with the TORC1 and investigate their roles in nitrogen starvation-dependent or independent differentiation in yeast.We isolated the endogenous TORC1 by purifying tagged, endogenous Kog1p, and identified associated proteins by mass spectrometry. We established invasive and pseudohyphal growth conditions in two S. cerevisiae genetic backgrounds (Σ1278b and CEN.PK). Using wild type and mutant strains from these genetic backgrounds, we investigated the roles of TORC1 and associated proteins in nitrogen starvation-dependent diploid pseudohyphal growth as well as nitrogen starvation-independent haploid invasive growth.We show that several proteins identified as associated with the TORC1 are important for nitrogen starvation-dependent diploid pseudohyphal growth. In contrast, invasive growth due to other nutritional stresses was generally not affected in mutant strains of these TORC1-associated proteins. Our studies suggest a role for TORC1 in yeast differentiation upon nitrogen starvation. Our studies also suggest the CEN.PK strain background of S. cerevisiae may be particularly useful for investigations of nitrogen starvation-induced diploid pseudohyphal growth."
https://openalex.org/W1993094865,"Cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways involving STAT3 are frequently constitutively activated in many human primary tumors, and are known for the transcriptional role they play in controlling cell growth and cell cycle progression. However, the extent of STAT3's reach on transcriptional control of the genome as a whole remains an important question. We predicted that this persistent STAT3 signaling affects a wide variety of cellular functions, many of which still remain to be characterized. We took a broad approach to identify novel STAT3 regulated genes by examining changes in the genome-wide gene expression profile by microarray, using cells expressing constitutively-activated STAT3. Using computational analysis, we were able to define the gene expression profiles of cells containing activated STAT3 and identify candidate target genes with a wide range of biological functions. Among these genes we identified Necdin, a negative growth regulator, as a novel STAT3 target gene, whose expression is down-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels when STAT3 is constitutively active. This repression is STAT3 dependent, since inhibition of STAT3 using siRNA restores Necdin expression. A STAT3 DNA-binding site was identified in the Necdin promoter and both EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirm binding of STAT3 to this region. Necdin expression has previously been shown to be down-regulated in a melanoma and a drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell line. Further analysis of Necdin expression demonstrated repression in a STAT3-dependent manner in human melanoma, prostate and breast cancer cell lines. These results suggest that STAT3 coordinates expression of genes involved in multiple metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, integrating signals that lead to global transcriptional changes and oncogenesis. STAT3 may exert its oncogenic effect by up-regulating transcription of genes involved in promoting growth and proliferation, but also by down-regulating expression of negative regulators of the same cellular processes, such as Necdin."

In this report, we demonstrate how the interactions between PKC and inhibitors change PKC activation kinetics. A substrate competitive inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I, targets activated PKC and stabilizes PKC in the activated conformation. This leads to transient activation and prolonged deactivation of PKC in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide I. In contrast, an uncompetitive substrate inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide IV, targets quiescent PKC and stabilizes PKC in the quiescent conformation, which generates slower activation and suppressed translocation upon activation of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W2018660021,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulate diverse cellular functions by their activity of cleaving ubiquitin from specific protein substrates. Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 46 (USP46) has recently been identified as a quantitative trait gene responsible for immobility in the tail suspension test and forced swimming test in mice. Mice with a lysine codon (Lys 92) deletion in USP46 exhibited loss of ‘behavioral despair’ under inescapable stresses in addition to abnormalities in circadian behavioral rhythms and the GABAergic system. However, whether this deletion affects enzyme activity is unknown. Here we show that USP46 has deubiquitinating enzyme activity detected by USP cleavage assay using GST-Ub52 as a model substrate. Interestingly, compared to wild type, the Lys 92 deletion mutant resulted in a decreased deubiquitinating enzyme activity of 27.04%. We also determined the relative expression levels of Usp46 in rat tissues using real-time RT-PCR. Usp46 mRNA was expressed in various tissues examined including brain, with the highest expression in spleen. In addition, like rat USP46, both human and mouse USP46 are active toward to the model substrate, indicating the USP cleavage assay is a simple method for testing the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of USP46. These results suggest that the Lys 92 deletion of USP46 could influence enzyme activity and thereby provide a molecular clue how the enzyme regulating the pathogenesis of mental illnesses."
https://openalex.org/W2064222565,"Fluorescent Cell Barcoding (FCB) is a flow cytometric technique which has been used for assessing signaling proteins. This FCB technique has the potential to be applied in other multiparameter analyses. Since data on antigen (Ag)-specific T-cell immune responses, like intracellular cytokine production, are still lacking in infants because limited blood volumes can be obtained for analysis, the FCB technique could be very useful for this purpose. The objectives of this study were to modify the FCB method to be able to measure multiple Ag-specific cytokine reponses in T-cells upon simultaneous stimulation by various antigens and mitogens in small amounts of blood and to investigate the cytokine pattern of T-cell subsets in healthy infants aged six and twelve months. Blood samples, collected from 20 healthy infants aged six and twelve months, were stimulated in vitro with the antigens: phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA), purified-protein-derivative (PPD), Tetanus-toxoid (TT), Staphylococcal-enterotoxin-B (SEB), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Each stimulus was barcoded by labelling with different intensities of fluorescent cell barcoding (FCB) markers. Intracellular production of interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured simultaneously in just one blood sample of 600 µl whole blood. Significant age-related differences in cytokine production were shown for PMA, PHA, and TT in CD4+ T-cells, and for PMA, PHA, SEB, and TT in CD8+ T-cells. The intracellular cytokine production by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was higher at twelve months compared to six months of age for all antigens, except for PMA, which was lower at the age of twelve months. Based on the consistency in both T-cell subsets, we conclude that the new FCB method is a promising tool to investigate the age-related development of intracellular cytokine production in infants."

Meningococcal penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and particularly PBP2 are involved in bacterial resistance to β-lactams. Here we describe a novel function for PBP2 that activates human and mouse dendritic cells (DC) in a time and dose-dependent manner. PBP2 induces MHC II (LOGEC50 = 4.7 µg/ml ± 0.1), CD80 (LOGEC50 = 4.88 µg/ml ± 0.15) and CD86 (LOGEC50 = 5.36 µg/ml ± 0.1). This effect was abolished when DCs were co-treated with anti-PBP2 antibodies. PBP2-treated DCs displayed enhanced immunogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, proteins co-purified with PBP2 showed no effect on DC maturation. We show through different in vivo and in vitro approaches that this effect is not due to endotoxin contamination. At the mechanistic level, PBP2 induces nuclear localization of p65 NF-kB of 70.7 ± 5.1% cells versus 12 ± 2.6% in untreated DCs and needs TLR4 expression to mature DCs. Immunoprecipitation and blocking experiments showed thatPBP2 binds TLR4. In conclusion, we describe a novel function of meningococcal PBP2 as a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) at the host-pathogen interface that could be recognized by the immune system as a danger signal, promoting the development of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2037185256,"Homer proteins are a family of multifaceted scaffolding proteins that participate in the organization of signaling complexes at the post-synaptic density and in a variety of tissues including striated muscle. Homer isoforms form multimers via their C-terminal coiled coil domains, which allows for the formation of a polymeric network in combination with other scaffolding proteins. We hypothesized that the ability of Homer isoforms to serve as scaffolds would be influenced by oxidative stress. We have found by standard SDS-PAGE of lysates from adult mouse skeletal muscle exposed to air oxidation that Homer migrates as both a dimer and monomer in the absence of reducing agents and solely as a monomer in the presence of a reducing agent, suggesting that Homer dimers exposed to oxidation could be modified by the presence of an inter-molecular disulfide bond. Analysis of the peptide sequence of Homer 1b revealed the presence of only two cysteine residues located adjacent to the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. HEK 293 cells were transfected with wild-type and cysteine mutant forms of Homer 1b and exposed to oxidative stress by addition of menadione, which resulted in the formation of disulfide bonds except in the double mutant (C246G, C365G). Exposure of myofibers from adult mice to oxidative stress resulted in decreased solubility of endogenous Homer isoforms. This change in solubility was dependent on disulfide bond formation. In vitro binding assays revealed that cross-linking of Homer dimers enhanced the ability of Homer 1b to bind Drebrin, a known interacting partner. Our results show that oxidative stress results in disulfide cross-linking of Homer isoforms and loss of solubility of Homer scaffolds. This suggests that disulfide cross-linking of a Homer polymeric network may contribute to the pathophysiology seen in neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies characterized by oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2056424791,"Background Diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity are diseases caused by pathological angiogenesis in the retina as a consequence of local hypoxia. The underlying mechanism for epiretinal neovascularization (tuft formation), which contributes to blindness, has yet to be identified. Neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is expressed by Müller cells and astrocytes, which are in close contact with the retinal vasculature, during normal developmental angiogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Notably, during oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) N-CAM accumulated on astrocytes surrounding the epiretinal tufts. Here, we show that N-CAM ablation results in reduced vascular tuft formation due to reduced endothelial cell proliferation despite an elevation in VEGFA mRNA expression, whereas retinal developmental angiogenesis was unaffected. Conclusion/Significance We conclude that N-CAM exhibits a regulatory function in pathological angiogenesis in OIR. This is a novel finding that can be of clinical relevance in diseases associated with proliferative vasculopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1984536173,"Clathrin interactor 1 [CLINT1] (also called enthoprotin/EpsinR) is an Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain-containing adaptor protein that functions in anterograde and retrograde clathrin-mediated trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and the endosome. Removal of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs, Ent3p and Ent5p, result in yeast that are viable, but that display a cold-sensitive growth phenotype and mistrafficking of various vacuolar proteins. Similarly, either knock-down or overexpression of vertebrate CLINT1 in cell culture causes mistrafficking of proteins. Here, we have characterized Drosophila CLINT1, liquid-facets Related (lqfR). LqfR is ubiquitously expressed throughout development and is localized to the Golgi and endosome. Strong hypomorphic mutants generated by imprecise P-element excision exhibit extra macrochaetae, rough eyes and are female sterile. Although essentially no eggs are laid, the ovaries do contain late-stage egg chambers that exhibit abnormal morphology. Germline clones reveal that LqfR expression in the somatic follicle cells is sufficient to rescue the oogenesis defects. Clones of mutant lqfR follicle cells have a decreased cell size consistent with a downregulation of Akt1. We find that while total Akt1 levels are increased there is also a significant decrease in activated phosphorylated Akt1. Taken together, these results show that LqfR function is required to regulate follicle cell size and signaling during Drosophila oogenesis."

It is known that p21Cip1 increases during terminal differentiation of cardiomyocytes, but its expression control and biological roles are not fully understood. Here, we show that the p21Cip1 protein is stabilized in cardiomyocytes after mitogenic stimulation, due to its increased CDK2 binding and inhibition of ubiquitylation. The APC/CCdc20 complex is shown to be an E3 ligase mediating ubiquitylation of p21Cip1 at the N terminus. CDK2, but not CDC2, suppressed the interaction of p21Cip1 with Cdc20, thereby leading to inhibition of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its activator Cdc20 (APC/CCdc20)-mediated p21Cip1 ubiquitylation. It was further demonstrated that p21Cip1 accumulation caused G2 arrest of cardiomyocytes that were forced to re-enter the cell cycle.

Taken together, these data show that the stability of the p21Cip1 protein is actively regulated in terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes and plays a role in inhibiting their uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Our study provides a novel insight on the control of p21Cip1 by ubiquitin-mediated degradation and its implication in cell cycle arrest in terminal differentiation."

The mechanism of this depletion is poorly understood but constitutes a key event with implications for progression. We assessed gene expression of purified T cells in Rhesus Macaques during acute SIVmac239 infection in order to define mechanisms of pathogenesis. We observe a general transcriptional program of over 1,600 interferon-stimulated genes induced in all T cells by the infection. Furthermore, we identify 113 transcriptional changes that are specific to virally infected cells. A striking downregulation of several key cell cycle regulator genes was observed and shared promotor-region E2F binding sites in downregulated genes suggested a targeted transcriptional control of an E2F regulated cell cycle program. In addition, the upregulation of the gene for the fundamental regulator of RNA polymerase II, TAF7, demonstrates that viral interference with the cell cycle and transcriptional regulation programs may be critical components during the establishment of a pathogenic infection in vivo."
