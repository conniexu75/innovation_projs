The term lymphotoxins (previously termed lymphocyte cytotoxic factor) is applied here to the toxic factor(s). We report that lymphocytes from several animal species, including man, can be stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin in vitro to release lymphotoxin-like materials."

https://openalex.org/W2012232677,"THE continued use of bone marrow transplantation1 in disease states and after accidental or therapeutic exposure to radiation has led to an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo studies of the viability of human and animal bone marrow. Among the more recent methods for quantitative studies of animal marrow is the mouse spleen colony technique. Till and McCulloch2 were the first to show that syngeneic mouse bone marrow, when injected into animals which had received a lethal dose of radiation, will cause the formation of macroscopic spleen nodules in a number directly proportional to the number of injected cells. These discrete colonies are assumed to arise from single marrow cells, which are generally described as colony forming units (CFU) and are often equated with the marrow stem cell. This method of studying colony formation has been used to study stem cell kinetics3, cellular radiation sensitivity2, immune reactions4, anaemic mutants5, and various phases of haematopoietic repopulation in the normal and post-irradiation states."

Among the widely cited investigations are those on the development and larval forms of Echinodermata1 and the publications that describe gamete production in the crinoid Comanthus japonicus2 and its correlation with the declination of the Moon3."
