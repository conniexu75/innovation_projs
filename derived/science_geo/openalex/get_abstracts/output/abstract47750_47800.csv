https://openalex.org/W1573798987,"The mineralized matrix of osseous tissue harbors abundant mitogenic activity which is extractable by demineralizing solvents. In bovine bone powder free of blood and cartilage contamination, the volume concentration of mitogens is up to 20 times greater than in serum. Growth factor activity in bone extracts was quantitated on quiescent mouse BALB/c/3T3 fibroblasts, where [3H]thymidine incorporation for 48 h was stimulated up to 200-fold in a linear, dose-dependent manner. Six distinct bone-derived growth factors (BDGFs) have been resolved and partially purified (up to 44,000-fold) on heparin-Sepharose using NaCl gradient elution. Provisionally named by the NaCl molarity at which they elute, these BDGFs include BDGF-0.45 (25% of total activity). This factor is heat-stable and sensitive to dithiothreitol, and displaces 125I-labelled bovine platelet-derived growth factor in a radioreceptor assay. BDGF-0.45 (approximately 50 ng/g of bone) is closely related or identical to bovine platelet-derived growth factor. BDGF-1.1 (10%) has a pI of 5.2 and shows a 16,600-dalton doublet on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western blots stained with antiserum to bovine anionic fibroblast growth factor. Two activities with high heparin affinity resemble cationic forms of fibroblast growth factor. BDGF-1.5 is the dominant factor in fetal membranous bone (50%), but is less abundant in adult bone (20%). BDGF-1.7, a 17,500-18,400-dalton triplet, is virtually absent in fetal bone (7%) but abundant (30%) in adult bone and may be related to cartilage derived growth factor. Two minor activities, BDGF-0.1 (10%) and BDGF-2.0 (7%) have not been characterized. Proliferation of bovine capillary endothelial cells was strongly supported by BDGFs 1.1, 1.5, and 1.7, but not by 0.45. These four purified BDGFs and the crude bone extract were also strongly mitogenic for rat osteoblasts while depressing alkaline phosphatase specific activity by 2-3-fold. Bone exhibits the most complex spectrum of growth factor activities of any tissue yet described. Bone cells and other indigenous cell types must be considered as possible sources of the BDGFs, in addition to sequestration from blood. Mechanisms for unmasking or release of BDGFs from the mineralized matrix resulting in local action on target cells are undoubtedly important for the development and maintenance of bone tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2165181073,"An auxiliary protein which affects the ability of calf thymus DNA polymerase-delta to utilize template/primers containing long stretches of single-stranded template has been purified to homogeneity from the same tissue. The auxiliary protein coelutes with DNA polymerase-delta on DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-agarose chromatography but is separated from the polymerase on phosphocellulose chromatography. The physical and functional properties of the auxiliary protein strongly resemble those of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. A molecular weight of 75,000 has been calculated from a sedimentation coefficient of 5.0 s and a Stokes radius of 36.5 A. A single band of 37,000 daltons is seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the protein exists as a dimer of identical subunits. The purified protein has no detectable DNA polymerase, primase, ATPase, or nuclease activity. The ability of DNA polymerase-delta to replicate gapped duplex DNA is relatively unaffected by the presence of the auxiliary protein, however, it is required to replicate templates with low primer/template ratios, e.g. poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (20:1), primed M13 DNA, and denatured calf thymus DNA. The auxiliary protein is specific for DNA polymerase-delta; it has no effect on the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha or the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I with primed homopolymer templates. Although the auxiliary protein does not bind to either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, it does increase the binding of DNA polymerase-delta to poly(dA)/oligo(dT), suggesting that the auxiliary protein interacts with the polymerase in the presence of template/primer, stabilizing the polymerase-template/primer complex."
https://openalex.org/W1557948809,"The oxidative capacity of mammalian striated muscles can vary markedly over a nearly 10-fold range, reflecting major differences in the expression of genes that encode enzymes of oxidative metabolism, including genes located exclusively within mitochondrial DNA. To clarify the regulatory events that govern expression of mitochondrial genes in striated muscle, nucleic acid hybridization procedures employing cloned segments of mitochondrial DNA as probes were utilized to determine the concentrations of mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, and cytochrome b mRNA (a mitochondrial gene product) in rabbit striated muscles of markedly different oxidative capacities. When cardiac muscle and Type I (red, oxidative) skeletal muscle were compared to Type II (white, glycolytic) skeletal muscle, mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, and cytochrome b mRNA, each increased in direct proportion to increases in oxidative capacity. Furthermore, when the phenotypic characteristics of Type II skeletal muscle were altered by electrical stimulation in vivo, mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial rRNA, and cytochrome b mRNA also increased proportionately with increases in oxidative capacity. These results indicate that the expression of mitochondrial genes in mammalian striated muscle is proportionate to their copy number, and support the hypothesis that amplification of the mitochondrial genome relative to chromosomal DNA is an important feature underlying enhanced expression of mitochondrial genes in highly oxidative tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1552806232,"Factors affecting the balance between pro- and antioxidant effects of ascorbic acid and glutathione were studied in soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomes challenged with Fe2+/H2O2. Effective antioxidant protection by alpha-tocopherol appeared to be due to efficient reaction with lipid oxy-radicals in the bilayer rather than to interception of initiating oxygen radicals. At concentrations above a threshold level of approximately 0.2 mol % (based on phospholipid content), alpha-tocopherol completely suppressed lipid oxy-radical propagation, which was measured as malondialdehyde production. Both ascorbic acid and glutathione, alone or in combination, enhanced lipid oxy-radical propagation. Alpha-Tocopherol, incorporated into liposomes at concentrations above its threshold protective level, reversed the pro-oxidant effects of 0.1-1.0 mM ascorbic acid but not those of glutathione. Ascorbic acid also prevented alpha-tocopherol depletion. The combination of ascorbic acid and subthreshold levels of alpha-tocopherol only temporarily suppressed lipid oxy-radical propagation and did not maintain the alpha-tocopherol level. Glutathione antagonized the antioxidant action of the alpha-tocopherol/ascorbic acid combination regardless of alpha-tocopherol concentration. These observations indicate that membrane alpha-tocopherol status can control the balance between pro- and antioxidant effects of ascorbic acid. The data also provide the most direct evidence to date that ascorbic acid interacts directly with components of the phospholipid bilayer."

https://openalex.org/W1589739980,"Isogenic variants resistant to alkylating agents have been isolated from the human lymphoblast cell line TK6. The cell lines may be divided into four classes on the basis of resistance to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). The sensitive TK6 parental line shows a 37% survival after 45-min exposure to 0.04 microM MNNG; the three classes of more resistant mutants show 37% survival after 45-min exposure to 2 microM (MF lines), 6 microM (MT lines), and greater than or equal to 10 microM (MX line) MNNG. A representative MF line, MF1, is resistant to both killing and mutation by MNNG or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. An MT clone, MT1, is highly resistant to killing but hypermutable by MNNG. The MT1 line, like the parental TK6, does not remove O6-methylguanine adducts from the DNA. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the MT1 line possesses a nonexcision pathway of defense against killing by alkylating agents. Rather than preventing alkylation of DNA or removing alkylated adducts, the MT1 cells appear to be tolerant of the adducts that are not removed from the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1994127068,"The tight junction (zonula occludens) links epithelial cells into a monolayer by forming a continuous belt of sealing contacts around the apex of each cell. They appear in thin sections as if they were 'fusions' between the apposed plasma membranes and in freeze-fracture replicas as patterns of complementary strands and furrows. These images have led to the proposal that the core of the tight junction is formed by a hexagonal cylinder of lipids. In this model, the cytoplasmic leaflet of the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains would be continuous, whereas the exoplasmic leaflets of the two plasma membrane domains of the same cell would be separated at the tight junction and are instead predicted to be continuous between the plasma membranes of neighbouring cells. We demonstrate here that this prediction does not hold true. An endogenous glycolipid (Forssman antigen), present in the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane of MDCK strain II cells, is unable to pass to MDCK strain I cells (which lack this glycolipid) under conditions where these cells are connected by tight junctions. In addition, fluorescent lipids which have been fused into the plasma membrane of one MDCK cell do not diffuse to neighbouring cells while the tight junctions between the cells are intact."

https://openalex.org/W1543139083,"The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei has a glycolipid covalently attached to its C terminus. This glycolipid, which anchors the protein to the cell membrane, is attached to the VSG polypeptide within 1 min after translation (Bangs, J. D. Hereld, D., Krakow, J.L., Hart, G. W., and Englund, P. T. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3207-3211). This rapid processing suggests that, prior to incorporation, the glycolipid may exist in the cell as a preformed precursor which is transferred to the VSG polypeptide en bloc. We have isolated a molecule which has properties consistent with it being a VSG glycolipid precursor. It is highly polar and can be labeled by [3H] myristate but not by [3H]palmitate. It reaches steady state during continuous labeling with [3H]myristate and shows rapid turnover in pulse-chase experiments, suggesting that it is a metabolic intermediate rather than an end product. When treated with HNO2 it liberates phosphatidylinositol, as does VSG (Ferguson, M. A. J., Low, M. G., and Cross, G. A. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14547-14555). Also, like VSG, it releases a compound which co-migrates on thin layer chromatography with dimyristylglycerol when treated with the purified endogenous phospholipase C from trypanosomes. After treatment with this lipase, the putative precursor can be immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against the C-terminal cross-reactive antigenic determinant of the VSG. These data provide strong evidence that this glycolipid is a VSG precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1505374435,"We used a fluorescence method to measure the rate constants for the elongation of pyrene-labeled actin filaments in a number of different solvents. The absolute values of the rate constants were established by electron microscopy. Using glycerol, sucrose, or ethylene glycol to vary the solution viscosity, the association rate constant (k+) was 10(7) M-1 s-1 viscosity-1 (in centipoise). Consequently, plots of 1/k+ versus viscosity are linear and extrapolate to near the origin as expected for a diffusion-limited reaction where the rate constant approaches infinity at zero viscosity. By electron microscopy, we found that this inhibitory effect of glycerol is almost entirely at the fast growing, barbed end. For the pointed end, plots of 1/k+ versus viscosity extrapolate to a maximum rate of about 10(6) M-1 s-1 at zero viscosity, so that elongation at the pointed is not limited by diffusion. In contrast to these small molecules, polyethylene glycol, dextran, and ovalbumin all cause a concentration (and therefore viscosity)-dependent increase in k+. At any given viscosity, their effects are similar to each other. For example, at 3 centipoise, k+ = 2.2 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. We presume that this is due to an excluded volume effect that causes an increase in the thermodynamic activity of the actin. If the proteins in the cytoplasmic matrix have a similar effect, the association reactions of actin in cells may be much faster than expected from experiments done in dilute buffers."

https://openalex.org/W1522946066,"Proliferation of normally quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells plays a major role in the development of an atherosclerotic lesion. Since cellular homologues of oncogenes have been implicated in the control of normal cell proliferation, we have analyzed the regulation of expression of two proto-oncogenes (c-fos and c-myc) in primary cultures of calf aortic smooth muscle cells during the transition from quiescence to proliferation. Quiescent (serum-deprived) smooth muscle cells were stimulated to proliferative by serum addition. DNA synthesis began 12 h post-serum addition and peaked between 16 and 20 h. Following addition of serum, c-fos mRNA levels increased rapidly from an undetectable amount to the maximal level at 30 min after serum addition and then rapidly returned to the levels found in quiescent cells. Changes in the rate of c-fos gene transcription, as measured by nuclear runoff assays, paralleled the alterations in mRNA levels, indicating that regulation of c-fos was at the level of mRNA synthesis. The mRNA for the c-myc oncogene was expressed at a detectable level in quiescent cells, peaked in abundance at approximately 2 h after stimulation, and then returned to the level found in quiescent cells. No significant change in the rate of c-myc gene transcription was detectable over the time course. The rate of decay of c-myc mRNA following the inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D was measured at the 1- and 4-h time points and in exponentially growing cells. There was a transient stabilization of the normally labile c-myc mRNA at 1 h after serum stimulation. Thus c-myc gene expression was regulated at the level of mRNA turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1583037972,"Fibrin and hyaluronic acid (HA) are macromolecules whose concentrations are elevated at the same time in the extracellular space of damaged tissues. We have investigated whether HA can bind to fibrinogen using solid phase and soluble assays. Purified human fibrinogen specifically bound to HA-Sepharose to a greater extent (greater than 5-fold) than did alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, DNaseI, ovalbumin, haptoglobin, or lysozyme. Fibrinogen did not bind to ethanolamine-Sepharose, a control chromatographic support. Treatment of HA-Sepharose containing bound 125I-fibrinogen with ovine testicular hyaluronidase released 44% of the 125I radioactivity, indicating that fibrinogen was specifically bound to HA. Moreover, 125I-fibrinogen bound to HA-Sepharose could be displaced by free HA but not by either of the monosaccharide components of this polymer, glucuronic acid, or N-acetylglucosamine. Chondroitin sulfate and polygalacturonic acid competed only weakly for bound 125I-fibrinogen. Bound 125I-fibrinogen was also not released by high concentrations of NaCl (up to 4 M), indicating that the interaction is not simply ionic. The apparent affinity of fibrinogen for HA covaried with the molecular weight of the HA. Small HA oligosaccharides (Mr = 3900) were only 50% as effective as larger HA (Mr = 8 X 10(5)) in eluting bound 125I-fibrinogen from HA-Sepharose. The optimal oligosaccharide size for displacement of bound 125I-fibrinogen was greater than or equal to 200 monosaccharides. Additionally, the amount of 125I-fibrinogen bound to HA-Sepharose was directly related to the size of the HA-amine linked to the affinity support. The affinity constant for fibrinogen binding to 125I-HA (approximately 150 monosaccharides) is estimated to be at least 2 X 10(7) M-1. These results demonstrate for the first time a specific, reversible binding between HA and fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1579588798,"We have tested the possibility that regulation of cardiac muscarinic receptor function may involve receptor phosphorylation. Chick heart muscarinic receptors were purified from relatively small amounts of tissue to near homogeneity using a three-step chromatographic procedure that utilized the affinity chromatography procedure of Haga and Haga (Haga, K., and Haga, T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13575-13579). The purified preparations contained a single major peptide which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with an apparent Mr of 79,000. When receptors were purified from 32P-bathed hearts, a single major phosphopeptide eluted from the affinity column and comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with the band of stained receptor. Treatment of hearts with the agonist carbachol led to marked increases (10-12-fold) in the phosphorylation of the receptor. The results show that the muscarinic receptor is a phosphoprotein in cardiac tissue and that treatment with a receptor agonist regulates its phosphorylation in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1555693922,"Hepatic transport studies with amatoxins, toxic bicyclic octapeptides from poisonous mushrooms of the genus Amanita were performed, using [(6'-O,1'-N-di[3H]methyl)trp4]-alpha-amanitin and [(6'-O,1'-N-di-methyl)trp4]-[4-[3H]desmethyl)hyi3]-gamma-ama nitin. Uptake into hepatocytes from rat liver was inhibited by taurocholate and antamanide. Photoaffinity labeling studies with isolated hepatocytes and basolateral plasma membranes, using the sodium salt of (7,7-azo-3 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-[3 beta-3H]cholan-24-oyl)-2- aminoethanesulfonic acid demonstrated that the presence of alpha-amanitin decreased the labeling of the two sinusoidal bile salt-binding membrane polypeptides with the apparent molecular weights of 54,000 and 48,000. In basolateral plasma membrane vesicles amanitin uptake was temperature-dependent and could be stimulated 1.5 to 2-fold by an out to in Na+ gradient as compared to a K+ gradient or sucrose and 2 to 2.5-fold as compared to amanitin equilibration (overshoot). Kinetic studies proved saturability of amanitin uptake in the presence and absence of a Na+ gradient. Membrane transport could be inhibited by taurocholate, antamanide, phalloidin, prednisolone, and silybin, but not by penicillin G or thioctic acid. Hepatic uptake of amatoxins is mediated by the sinusoidal bile salt-transport systems which are also involved in the uptake of antamanide and phalloidin. This supports the concept of a multispecificity of hepatic transport systems for a wide variety of amphipathic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2170626348,"We have measured the rate of accumulation of amino acid residues in human erythrocyte membrane and cytosolic proteins which give D-aspartic acid upon acid hydrolysis. These residues would include D-aspartic acid, D-asparagine, as well as the beta-transpeptidation product, D-isoaspartic acid. Measurements made using age (density) fractionated cells indicate that racemization at these residues occurs on membrane proteins with a t1% (the time required to convert 1% to the D configuration) of about 38.6 days. Fractionation of membrane components revealed a faster rate of racemization for intrinsic proteins than for extrinsic proteins. On the other hand, significant age-dependent racemization was not detected for cytosolic proteins, and the calculated t1% value for these proteins is at least 4 times larger. These results suggest that in the 120-day life span of an erythrocyte, significant racemization of membrane (but not cytosolic) proteins can occur. We have also determined that the rates of accumulation of these residues for erythrocyte membrane and cytosolic proteins incubated in vitro are similar to those observed in vivo. These observations are discussed in terms of the possible cellular metabolism of racemized proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1547252610,"Ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase associates with thylakoid membranes into two pools of different binding strength that are experimentally distinguished on the basis of resistance to removal by washes in low ionic strength media. The nondenaturing zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid is uniquely able to remove the more tightly bound pool of enzyme, without solubilization of major membrane proteins. The reconstitution of reductase onto depleted thylakoid membranes requires available membrane binding sites and cations, in order of effectiveness trivalent greater than divalent greater than monovalent. The hetero/bifunctional 125I-iodinated Denny-Jaffe cross-linking reagent yields a 54-kDa, covalently cross-linked adduct between ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase and a component of the thylakoid membrane. Our results show that the more tightly bound pool of enzyme is associated with the 17.5-kDa reductase-binding protein (Vallejos, R. H., Ceccarelli, E., and Chan, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8048-8051)."
https://openalex.org/W2467498902,"Honeybee prepromelittin is correctly processed and imported by dog pancreas microsomes. Membrane insertion of prepromelittin, assayed as signal sequence removal by signal peptidase, is not dependent on signal recognition particle and docking protein. However, a previously uncharacterized proteinaceous component of the microsomal membrane is required for completion of membrane transfer of promelittin. Furthermore, membrane insertion of prepromelittin is not coupled to translation. These data suggest the signal sequence, in addition to its role in membrane recognition, has a more general function for membrane insertion, cotranslational import of proteins is not an intrinsic feature of microsomes, and at least in certain cases, proteinaceous membrane components are involved in membrane transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1559579726,"We report here the detailed structure of a human beta-crystallin gene, designated Hu beta A3/A1, which was isolated and characterized using homologous mouse and bovine beta-crystallin cDNAs. Hu beta A3/A1 consists of six exons, spanning approximately 8 kilobases. The first two exons code for an N-terminal extension of 32 amino acid residues, while the other four encode the four similar structural motifs of the predicted polypeptide. Sequence homologies among the latter four exons and their intron-exon junctions support a model of gene evolution based on two successive exon duplications. Transcription of Hu beta A3/A1 in the eye lens initiates 24 base pairs downstream of a putative TATA box and just 7 nucleotides upstream of a potential initiation codon, generating a single mRNA of approximately 1 kilobase. Comparison of Hu beta A3/A1 with the homologous bovine cDNA and the translation products of the corresponding bovine gene suggests that translation of Hu beta A3/A1 commences at either of two potential initiation codons located in the first and second exons. Differential use of these two codons predicts two polypeptides differing by the presence or absence of 17 amino acid residues at their N-termini."
https://openalex.org/W1671367959,"The kinetics of in vitro fibril assembly of Type I collagen preparations that contain different amounts of covalently cross-linked oligomers was studied with turbidimetry. Fibril formation showed a lag phase with no solution turbidity and a growth phase with a sigmoidal increase in the solution turbidity. The length of the lag phase was inversely related to both the total collagen concentration and the amount of covalently cross-linked oligomers in the solution. Double logarithmic plots of t1/4, the amount of time it takes for 1/4 of the collagen to assemble into fibrils, versus the total collagen concentration were linear but the slope decreased from -0.84 to -2.3 with decreasing amounts of covalently cross-linked oligomers in the samples. Electron microscopy showed the formation of unbanded microfibrils with diameters in the range of 3-15 nm early in the lag phase and larger diameter banded fibrils coexisting with the microfibrils near the end of the lag phase. Centrifugation of the solution at the lag phase prolonged the lag time, presumably by removal of microfibrils, but subsequent growth of the fibrils was unaffected. The results suggest a cooperative nucleation-growth mechanism for the in vitro assembly of collagen fibrils which is consistent with the results of an equilibrium study of the fibril assembly reaction we reported earlier (Na, G. C., Butz, L. J., Bailey, D. G., and Carroll, R. J. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 958-966)."

CBS 3 consists of two protein components, a red-brown iron-sulfur protein (component A) which functions as dioxygenase and an orange-colored reductase (component B). Component B was purified by a five-step procedure. Criterion of purity was sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which also showed that the protein consists of one polypeptide species with a molecular weight of 35,000. With gel chromatography on Sephadex G-100 also, a molecular weight of 35,000 was found for the native enzyme, suggesting a monomeric structure for the reductase enzyme. The isoelectric point was determined as pH 4.8. The visible absorption spectrum of the homogeneous protein exhibits maxima at 336, 394, and 458 nm. One mol of FMN, 2.1 mol of iron, and 1.7 mol of acid-labile sulfide were found in one mol of component B. The EPR-spectrum of the reduced form of the enzyme (with NADH) showed two types of signals. The signal at g values of 2.03, 1.94, and 1.90 was assigned to an iron-sulfur cluster of the [2Fe-2S]-type. The properties of the other signal type at g = 2.004 are characteristic of flavosemiquinone radical which does not show coupling to an other paramagnetic center. The apparent Km values for 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, cytochrome c, and NADH were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots as 6.3, 2.3, and 32 microM, respectively. Inhibitors of the reductase are metal-chelating reagents and sulfhydryl-inhibiting compounds. Component B reduces several redox compounds: 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, potassium hexacyanoferrat III, cytochrome c, methylene blue, and nitro blue tetrazolium."
https://openalex.org/W1621733768,"We have previously shown that immunologically detectable cell surface asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptors are decreased or absent in proliferating in vivo hepatocytes, such as in developing, regenerating, preneoplastic, and neoplastic liver samples. We now show that this decrease is the result of a post-transcriptional mechanism(s), since specific ASGP receptor transcripts are quantitatively unaltered in the above samples based on Northern blot analysis using a specific cDNA ASGP receptor probe. In primary hepatomas, the major, minor, or both ASGP receptor transcripts are translated into functional protein since specific binding of I125 asialoorsomucoid to total hepatoma homogenates is identical to normal liver. However, Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed against the ASGP receptor indicated that peptides corresponding to RHL-2 and RHL-3 are present at increased levels in the cytosol fraction of primary hepatoma cells, whereas the RHL-1 species is not detectable in either the plasma membrane, microsomal, or cytosol fractions of these cells. We also show that ASGP receptor activity can be modulated by transcriptional mechanisms, since primary rat hepatocytes cultured for 24 h have decreased ASGP receptor transcripts. In addition, Morris hepatoma 7777 cells, either in culture or growing as a transplantable tumor in vivo, have no detectable ASGP receptor transcripts, while still retaining the ASGP receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W165633160,"Unmodified chicken gizzard tropomyosin (TM) has been fractionated into its two major isoforms beta and gamma, by chromatofocussing in the presence of 9 M urea and dithiothrieitol. Treatment of the native protein with several bifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide esters gave the beta gamma-heterodimer as the major cross-linked product. A comparison of the thermal transition profiles of the two homodimers and of the native unfractionated TM also indicated the predominance of the beta gamma-heterodimer in the native protein. This conclusion is consistent with the absence of excimer fluorescence in pyrene-labeled gizzard TM and the relative resistance of the molecule to intramolecular disulfide formation (Lehrer, S.S., Betteridge, D.R., Graceffa, P., Wong, S., and Seidel, J. C. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1591-1595) since the single cysteines on each of the two isoforms are widely separated. We conclude that further experimental evidence is required to assess the possibility that the gizzard TM is more rigid in its conformation than are those of the skeletal and cardiac proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2472496806,"Rabbit reticulocyte eukaryotic initiation factor 2 was phosphorylated with the heme-regulated alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 kinase, and then the individual subunits were resolved by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the alpha subunit also were well resolved. The NH2-terminal sequences of intact alpha and gamma subunits were determined. No sequence was obtained from the beta subunit, suggesting that it may have a blocked NH2-terminus. Overlapping tryptic and chymotryptic phosphopeptides from the NH2-terminal sequence of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 were used to establish the order of amino acids 1-52 and localized the phosphorylation site within the sequence: -Leu-Leu-Ser48-Glu-Leu-Ser51-.

https://openalex.org/W1554331870,"Inhibition of K+/H+ antiport by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in Mg2+ depleted mitochondria follows first order kinetics, exhibiting a half-time of 13 min when mitochondria are incubated with 50 nmol/mg inhibitor at 0 degrees C. 14C radiolabeled N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binds to the 82,000-dalton protein, and the second order rate constant for binding is found to be approximately the same as the second order rate constant for inhibition. These findings provide additional confirmation of the identification of this porter with the 82,000-dalton protein and permit us to estimate that rat liver mitochondria contain about 8 pmol/mg of K+/H+ antiporter with a turnover number of 700 s-1. The K+/H+ antiporter of rat liver mitochondria is protected from N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibition and binding by quinine and by endogenous Mg2+. An 82,000-dalton, [14C]N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein is also observed in rat liver submitochondrial particles, establishing this as an integral protein of the inner membrane. Submitochondrial particles, presumed to be inverted in membrane orientation, are protected from radiolabeling by external Mg2+, supporting the contention that the Mg2+ binding site is localized to the matrix side of the K+/H+ antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1520052960,"Calsequestrin has been precipitated with calcium into five different crystal forms: cruciform twins, flat rectangles, thin needles, bipyramids, rectangular prisms, and a sixth precrystalline form, spheres. Raman spectra of the spheres and the cruciform twins are the same. The Raman spectrum of a physiological concentration (10%) of calsequestrin in calcium-free solution is the same as the spectrum of calcium precipitated calsequestrin in the amide I region, and in the C-C stretching region, but these spectra are different in the amide III region. The Raman spectrum of unfolded calsequestrin in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride is quite different from the other spectra, but it is not similar to the spectra of other unfolded proteins. Estimates of secondary structure from the amide I region indicate that calsequestrin in calcium-free solution and calcium-precipitated forms has 40 +/- 5% helix, 30 +/- 4% beta-strand, and 18 +/- 2% reverse turn. Secondary structure estimates calculated from the amide III region are not significantly different. They indicate 41 +/- 5% helix and 36 +/- 6% beta-strand for the precipitated forms, and 32 +/- 5% helix and 39 +/- 6% beta-strand for solutions. Calsequestrin unfolded in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride at 100 mg/ml gives 24 +/- 5% helix and 48 +/- 6% beta-strand."
https://openalex.org/W184802904,"The interactions of the phage SPO1-encoded Type II DNA-binding protein, transcription factor 1 (TF1), with one of its preferred binding sites in SPO1 DNA have been analyzed in detail. The results suggest that TF1 recognizes a high-affinity binding site and that additional protein moieties can accrue to either side of the occupied core site to form higher order complexes. Close contacts between TF1 and the core binding site as well as some of the steric requirements for recognition of the core site were determined. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of several preferred binding sites for TF1 reveals a striking lack of precise homology but does show common features."
https://openalex.org/W1500523379,"The formation of covalent binary complexes of thymidylate synthase and its nucleotide substrate dUMP, product dTMP, and inhibitor, 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) was investigated using the trichloroacetic acid precipitation method. It was observed that, in addition to FdUMP, both dUMP and dTMP were capable of covalent interactions with the enzyme in the absence of added folates. The presence of folate, dihydrofolate, or tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) was found to produce substantial enhancements in the covalent binding of both FdUMP and dUMP to the enzyme with H4folate being the most effective agent. Further, covalent binary complexes of the enzyme with the three radiolabeled nucleotides were isolated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and subjected to CNBr cleavage. The active-site CNBr peptide was isolated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the first five N-terminal amino acid residues were sequenced by the dansyl-Edman procedure. Each active site peptide obtained from the covalent binary complexes as well as that from the covalent inhibitory ternary complex formed from enzyme, FdUMP, and 5,10-methylene-H4folate exhibited an identical sequence of Ala-Leu-Pro-Pro-(X)-, and the 5th amino acid was found to be associated with radiolabeled nucleotide ligand. Dansyl-Edman sequence analysis of the active site CNBr peptide, derived from enzyme which had been treated with iodoacetic acid, gave a sequence of Ala-Leu-Pro-Pro-CmCys (where CmCys is carboxymethylcysteine), thus confirming the fact that the fifth residue from the N terminus is Cys-198. In all the cases, the active site Cys-198 residue was found to be covalently linked to the nucleotides. These results provide unequivocal proof that the covalent binary complexes of enzyme with dUMP and dTMP predicted in the catalytic reaction mechanism actually exist."
https://openalex.org/W1427856235,"Measurements of NMR relaxation rates of 23Na, 39K, 25Mg and 43Ca were used to evaluate the extent of cation binding in solution to bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycans, hog mucosal heparin, and Ficoll (Pharmacia). The two most important factors determining relaxation rates in the presence of the polymers examined were polymer concentration and charge density. We found that proteoglycans did not bind monovalent cations but did bind divalent cations to a relatively small extent. Heparin bound monovalent and divalent cations to a much greater extent. Assembly of glycosaminoglycan chains into proteoglycan aggregates had no effect on the extent of cation binding."
https://openalex.org/W1524942423,"An antiserum was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 95-117 of bovine proenkephalin, and a sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed. Comparison of the reactivities of the synthetic peptide, its specific cleavage products, and other synthetic peptides showed that the important immunological determinant was contained within residues 101-109 of bovine proenkephalin (-Gly-Gly-Glu-Val-Leu-Gly-Lys-Arg-Tyr-). Radioimmunoassay of fractions after gel filtration of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granule lysate showed three pools of immunoreactivity: pool 1 (Mr 20,000-30,000), pool 2 (Mr 10,000-20,000), and pool 3 (Mr approximately 5,000). Further characterization by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting showed that the antiserum recognized 27-, 20.5-, 16.5-, and 5.6-kilodalton enkephalin-containing proteins. The radioimmunoassay was also used to detect proenkephalin-like material in extracts of rat adrenal and regions of rat brain and spinal cord following gel filtration. Immunoreactivity from the rat adrenal chromatographed predominantly as high molecular weight material (Mr 31,500-43,500), whereas material in regions of rat brain showed a broader molecular weight distribution (Mr 4,000-43,500). This indicated differences in the processing of proenkephalin between rat adrenal and brain tissue. Differences were also seen in the molecular weight profile of immunoreactivity in different brain regions, most noticeable in the case of striatum and hypothalamus, suggesting regional differences in processing. Based on quantitation of higher molecular weight immunoreactive proenkephalin-like material and free Met-enkephalin immunoreactivity in different brain regions, it was apparent that extensive processing of proenkephalin occurs in brain. We concluded that antisera against proenkephalin-(95-117) recognize a wide range of intermediates in the processing of proenkephalin in both bovine adrenal medulla and rat adrenal, brain, and spinal cord, making it a useful tool for further studies concerned with the expression and post-translational processing of proenkephalin."
https://openalex.org/W1601385853,"Metabolism of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid has been found to occur in rabbits and humans, species that cannot 7 alpha-hydroxylate lithocholic acid. This novel pathway for chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis from 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid led to a reinvestigation of the pathway for chenodeoxycholic acid from 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid in the hamster. Simultaneous infusion of equimolar [1,2-3H]lithocholic acid and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-[14C]cholenoic acid indicated that the 14C enrichment of chenodeoxycholic acid was much greater than that of lithocholic acid. Thus, in all these species, a novel 7 alpha-hydroxylation pathway exists that prevents the deleterious biologic effects of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1592090217,"Cytoskeletal interactions which contribute to the assembly of the postsynaptic density (PSD) were investigated. PSDs bound 125I-tubulin specifically with an apparent Km of 2 X 10(-7) M and a Bmax of about 1 nmol/mg of protein. 125I-Tubulin blots revealed that a group of polypeptides between Mr 135,000 and 147,000 (P-140) was a major tubulin-binding PSD component. The P-140 polypeptides were highly enriched in the PSD fraction of purified synaptosomes and could not be detected in crude brain cytoplasm preparations. These polypeptides were subject to phosphorylation by endogenous calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II, with a concomitant reduction in 125I-tubulin binding. The tubulin-binding polypeptides could also associate with the radiolabeled alpha- and beta-subunits of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. These observations are consistent with a role for the P-140 polypeptides in organizing the molecular structure of the PSD. The data also suggest that this structure may be modified by Ca2+-sensitive phosphorylation, thus permitting neuronal activity to modulate the cytoskeletal interactions of the PSD."
https://openalex.org/W1499723617,"10-Thiastearic acid is a specific inhibitor of the biosynthesis of dihydrosterculic acid (9,10-methyleneoctadecanoic acid) in the trypanosomatid protozoan Crithidia fasciculata. A 50% inhibition of the biosynthesis of dihydrosterculate is observed in the presence of 4 microM 10-thiastearate in the protozoan growth medium, but little effect is seen on the distribution of the other fatty acids. In addition, the growth of the protozoa is slowed by the presence of 10-thiastearate, with 50% growth inhibition produced at about 10 microM. A possible mechanism of this inhibition and the implication of this result with regard to the design of antiprotozoal agents are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1573515255,"The tumor-localizing photosensitizer hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) is shown to undergo a simultaneous two-photon excitation into the near-ultraviolet Soret band system upon intense laser irradiation at 750 nm, a spectral region where there is no significant HPD one-photon absorbance in aqueous solution. Subsequent to this excitation, internal conversion and vibrational relaxation occur, resulting in the population of the vibrationless level of the first electronically excited singlet state. This state relaxes by two channels, the emission of fluorescence in the spectral region 600-700 nm and intersystem crossing into the triplet manifold, followed by near-resonant electronic energy transfer with surrounding oxygen to result in the generation of highly reactive singlet molecular oxygen (1 delta g). Evidence for the two-photon excitation consists in the observation both of the HPD fluorescence spectrum in the region of 615 nm as a result of 750 nm excitation and the quadratic dependence of this fluorescence emission intensity upon the excitation laser intensity. Since, in general, the penetration depth of ultraviolet and visible light into tissue varies directly with wavelength (red penetrating more deeply than blue), these studies suggest the possibility that two-photon-induced localization of tumor-bound HPD might facilitate the detection of deeper lying tumors than allowed by the current one-photon photolocalization method."
https://openalex.org/W192167990,"Transcription of mouse rDNA in vitro proceeds by an ordered mechanism of at least three steps. The first reaction involves formation of stable preinitiation complexes (Wandelt, C., and Grummt, I., (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 3795-3809; Cizewski, V., and Sollner-Webb, B. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 7043-7056). Such complexes form at reduced temperature and in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates. The data presented here identify a second intermediate in the process of initiatio. This intermediate, called the convertible complex, forms slowly or not at all at 10 degrees C. Formation of the convertible complex requires the presence of ATP plus CTP or the dinucleotide ApC. ATP may be replaced with 5'-adenylyl imidotriphosphate. It is concluded that formation of the convertible complex is associated with formation of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent pre-rRNA. In the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates, the convertible complex undergoes conversion to an elongation complex. This represents the third discernible step in the transcription process. The elongation complex is distinguished from the convertible complex by virtue of the observation that formation of the latter is inhibited by heparin, Sarkosyl, and 150 mM KCl. The elongation complex is not significantly affected by any of these substances. Moreover, formation of the convertible complex requires the glucocorticoid-regulated initiation factor designated TFIC."
https://openalex.org/W1505533897,"Evidence is presented that in increasing concentrations of methanol the structure of the subfragment 1 is perturbed in such a way that the Mr = 50,000 central portion of the associated heavy chain is preferentially unfolded. This unfolding is accompanied by the loss in ATPase function where the rate of inactivation can be correlated with the loss in the amount of the Mr = 50,000 fragment generated under standard tryptic digestion conditions. The residual protein appears to be a soluble aggregate of a complex of the Mr = 27,000, 21,000, and light chain with no intact Mr = 50,000 fragment. Tryptic digestions in the presence of MgATP are restricted to the usual linker regions and the Mr = 50,000 fragment is completely protected from attack. Binding of actin to subfragment 1 also results in the protection of the Mr = 50,000 segment and of the Mr = 50,000/21,000 junction from tryptic attack. The data suggest that, in terms of methanolic perturbation, the subfragment 1 appears to be comprised of two domains with differential stability. One domain appears to be the central Mr = 50,000 segment of the heavy chain which is preferentially unfolded by methanol and requires the presence of MgATP or of actin for stabilization. The other domain is more stable and appears to consist of the interacting Mr = 27,000, 21,000, and light chain. The results also suggest that the integrity of the Mr = 50,000 segment is essential for the ATPase function of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1535925652,"A two-step affinity chromatography procedure, using 2',5'-ADP-agarose and adrenodoxin-Sepharose 4B affinity supports, was used to purify mitochondrial ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.18.1.2, formerly EC 1.6.7.1) from pig kidney. The 450:270 nm absorbance ratio of the enzyme was 0.128, and it had a specific activity of 16,305 nmol/min/mg for the reduction of cytochrome c. The mitochondrial enzyme was a monomer which contained one molecule of FAD and had calculated molecular masses of 51,500 and 48,000 daltons when determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography gel exclusion chromatography, respectively. The porcine enzyme had a Km for NADPH of 0.94 microM and it expressed maximal activity when coupled with its homologous ferredoxin, although it was also active with the heterologous ferredoxin from bovine adrenal. The purified ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase supported the in vitro reduction of membrane-bound adrenal mitochondrial P-450, and it was demonstrated from immunologic studies that the enzyme shares some common epitopes with bovine adrenodoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1501746628,"The ovoperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of iodide has been investigated as a function of pH for the homogeneous enzyme and for ovoperoxidase incorporated into several forms of the egg fertilization membrane. The pH dependent hysteresis previously observed in purified ovoperoxidase (Deits, T. L., Shapiro, B. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7882-7888) is entirely absent in ovoperoxidase incorporated into the mature fertilization membrane, where the enzyme is bound noncovalently in vivo. The pH activity profile of ovoperoxidase incorporated into the mature fertilization membrane closely resembles the profile observed only transiently in purified ovoperoxidase subjected to a rapid downward pH shift. These observations can be accounted for by our previously presented mechanism for ovoperoxidase hysteresis (ibid.). We hypothesize that ovoperoxidase, upon incorporation into the fertilization membrane, is restricted to a limited subset of the conformational states available to the purified enzyme. This matrix-dependent conformational restriction is a novel control mechanism that serves to enhance the catalytic activity of ovoperoxidase upon its assembly into the fertilization membrane and thereby modulates ovoperoxidase catalysis in the vicinity of the developing egg."
https://openalex.org/W1590737921,"alpha-Chymotrypsin was used to probe accessible hydrophobic amino acid residues in nucleosome cores. Small amounts of chymotrypsin rapidly and selectively cleaved at leucine 20 of histone H3. Cleavage at this site caused partial unfolding of the nucleosome core at low ionic strengths indicated by a small decrease in sedimentation coefficient and increase in circular dichroism in the 265-285-nm range. Unfolding did not occur at moderate ionic strengths, probably because of more effective electrolyte screening of residual negative charge on the nucleosome core. More extensive treatment with chymotrypsin partially degraded other core histones in nucleosome cores at similar rates. The primary sites of cleavage were assigned to Leu115 of H2a, Val18 or Gln22 of H2b, and Leu10 plus Leu22 of H4. We conclude that these primary sites of chymotrypsin cleavage of the four core histones lie on or near the nucleosome core surface, while the large number of other hydrophobic histone residues located in more central sequences must be inaccessible. Extensive chymotrypsin treatment yielded a set of products approximately 80-100 residues long that were similar to the limit products of trypsin digestion. Sedimentation coefficients and circular dichroism spectra of nucleosome cores treated to near limits with chymotrypsin or chymotrypsin followed by trypsin were not consistent with significant unfolding of the proteolyzed cores at moderate ionic strength. These results indicate that the amino-terminal 20-30 residues of H2b, H3, and H4 and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal approximately 12 residues of H2a, in toto, interact weakly if at all with DNA of isolated nucleosome cores. These histone termini stabilize less than two turns and perhaps only one turn on each DNA terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2444470526,"The bacteriophage SPO1-encoded Type II DNA-binding protein, transcription factor 1 (TF1), forms complexes with specific sites in SPO1 DNA. We have investigated the binding of TF1 to one of its preferred sites in which the normal 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmUra) of SPO1 DNA has been replaced by thymine and have also investigated the binding of a bacterial Type II DNA-binding protein (from Bacillus stearothermophilus) to the hmUra- and thymine-containing forms of the same DNA segment. Our results show that TF1 binds selectively to this high affinity binding site only in hmUra-containing DNA and that the bacterial Type II DNA-binding protein interacts nonspecifically with both forms of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1502235800,"The oxygen binding properties of human hemoglobin are appreciably altered by the nicotinamide dinucleotides NADH, NADP+, and NADPH. These cofactors are important in the control of many metabolic pathways and in providing reductive potential for a number of enzymatic reactions, including in vivo reduction of methemoglobin. Specific binding of these cofactors to hemoglobin and their potential for acting as allosteric modifiers of hemoglobin function have not been previously recognized. Detailed oxygen binding studies utilizing a thin-layer method suggest that the nicotinamide dinucleotides bind with high affinity to the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer at the beta chain anion-binding site and stabilize the low affinity T-state conformation. Stripped Hb A in 0.05 M N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer, pH 6.5, at 20 degrees C is half-saturated at a pO2 of 1.6 mm Hg. In the presence of 0.5 mM NADH, NADP+, or NADPH, the P50 is raised to 3.8, 7.1, and 12.5 mm Hg, respectively. The Bohr factor for stripped Hb A in 0.05 M HEPES buffer is sensitive to these effectors and is raised from 0.25 to about 0.65 by the addition of NADPH. The data suggest that routine use of these effectors in studies of human hemoglobin variants or the allosteric mechanism of Hb A be considered carefully. The relatively low intraerythrocytic levels of the nicotinamide dinucleotides in relation to hemoglobin dictate that these cofactors cannot significantly affect in vivo oxygen delivery. However, the converse is theoretically possible. The binding of the cofactors to hemoglobin and the preferential binding of their reduced forms may affect cofactor-dependent metabolic processes in red blood cells."

https://openalex.org/W1752096533,"Oxalate, a metabolic end product, forms calcium oxalate deposits in the tissues under a variety of pathological conditions. In order to determine whether oxalate is able to penetrate the mitochondrial matrix, the uptake of oxalate by rat liver and kidney cortical mitochondria was characterized. Mitochondria did not swell in an iso-osmotic medium of ammonium oxalate unless a small amount of phosphate was provided. This phosphate-induced swelling was prevented by N-ethylmaleimide. The uptake of [14C]oxalate by liver and kidney mitochondria followed first order kinetics and was inhibited by mersalyl an inhibitor of the phosphate and dicarboxylate carriers. Accumulation of [14C]oxalate at equilibrium was significantly higher by mitochondria energized with succinate than by rotenone-inhibited mitochondria due to higher matrix pH as determined by the [14C]5,5'-dimethyloxazolidine-2, 4-dione distribution ratio. The velocity of oxalate accumulation by mitochondria was temperature dependent. The activation energy was 81.5 and 86.5 J/mol for liver and kidney mitochondria, respectively. In both types of mitochondria, the rate of oxalate uptake was hyperbolic with respect to the concentration of oxalate. The apparent Km was 28.8 +/- 0.6 and 13.4 +/- 1.2 mM and the Vmax 87.1 +/- 1.1 and 66.1 +/- 3.1 nmol X mg-1 X min-1 at 12 degrees C for liver and kidney mitochondria, respectively. Phenylsuccinate exhibited mixed inhibition of the rate of oxalate uptake. Oxalate exhibited also a mixed inhibition of the uptake and oxidation of malate by mitochondria. The data obtained provide evidence that oxalate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane by a phosphate-linked, carrier-mediated system similar to or identical to the dicarboxylate transporter."
