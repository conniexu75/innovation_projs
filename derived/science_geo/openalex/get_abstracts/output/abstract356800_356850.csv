https://openalex.org/W2104827888,"Brown fat can increase energy expenditure and protect against obesity through a specialized program of uncoupled respiration. Here we show by in vivo fate mapping that brown, but not white, fat cells arise from precursors that express Myf5, a gene previously thought to be expressed only in the myogenic lineage. We also demonstrate that the transcriptional regulator PRDM16 (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain containing 16) controls a bidirectional cell fate switch between skeletal myoblasts and brown fat cells. Loss of PRDM16 from brown fat precursors causes a loss of brown fat characteristics and promotes muscle differentiation. Conversely, ectopic expression of PRDM16 in myoblasts induces their differentiation into brown fat cells. PRDM16 stimulates brown adipogenesis by binding to PPAR-gamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma) and activating its transcriptional function. Finally, Prdm16-deficient brown fat displays an abnormal morphology, reduced thermogenic gene expression and elevated expression of muscle-specific genes. Taken together, these data indicate that PRDM16 specifies the brown fat lineage from a progenitor that expresses myoblast markers and is not involved in white adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1528695685,"The geological evolution of the Tibetan plateau is best viewed in a context broader than the India-Eurasia collision zone. After collision about 50 million years ago, crust was shortened in western and central Tibet, while large fragments of lithosphere moved from the collision zone toward areas of trench rollback in the western Pacific and Indonesia. Cessation of rapid Pacific trench migration (∼15 to 20 million years ago) coincided with a slowing of fragment extrusion beyond the plateau and probably contributed to the onset of rapid surface uplift and crustal thickening in eastern Tibet. The latter appear to result from rapid eastward flow of the deep crust, probably within crustal channels imaged seismically beneath eastern Tibet. These events mark a transition to the modern structural system that currently accommodates deformation within Tibet."

https://openalex.org/W1981525131,"Adipose tissue is central to the regulation of energy balance. Two functionally different types of fat are present in mammals: white adipose tissue, the primary site of triglyceride storage, and brown adipose tissue, which is specialized in energy expenditure and can counteract obesity. Factors that specify the developmental fate and function of white and brown adipose tissue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that whereas some members of the family of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) support white adipocyte differentiation, BMP7 singularly promotes differentiation of brown preadipocytes even in the absence of the normally required hormonal induction cocktail. BMP7 activates a full program of brown adipogenesis including induction of early regulators of brown fat fate PRDM16 (PR-domain-containing 16; ref. 4) and PGC-1alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1alpha; ref. 5), increased expression of the brown-fat-defining marker uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and adipogenic transcription factors PPARgamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), and induction of mitochondrial biogenesis via p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-(also known as Mapk14) and PGC-1-dependent pathways. Moreover, BMP7 triggers commitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells to a brown adipocyte lineage, and implantation of these cells into nude mice results in development of adipose tissue containing mostly brown adipocytes. Bmp7 knockout embryos show a marked paucity of brown fat and an almost complete absence of UCP1. Adenoviral-mediated expression of BMP7 in mice results in a significant increase in brown, but not white, fat mass and leads to an increase in energy expenditure and a reduction in weight gain. These data reveal an important role of BMP7 in promoting brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and provide a potential new therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2041612616,"As arguably the simplest free-living animals, placozoans may represent a primitive metazoan form, yet their biology is poorly understood. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the ∼98 million base pair nuclear genome of the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis suggests that placozoans belong to a ‘eumetazoan’ clade that includes cnidarians and bilaterians, with sponges as the earliest diverging animals. The compact genome shows conserved gene content, gene structure and synteny in relation to the human and other complex eumetazoan genomes. Despite the apparent cellular and organismal simplicity of Trichoplax, its genome encodes a rich array of transcription factor and signalling pathway genes that are typically associated with diverse cell types and developmental processes in eumetazoans, motivating further searches for cryptic cellular complexity and/or as yet unobserved life history stages. Often touted as the 'simplest' free-living animal alive, Trichoplax is central to the debate on early animal origins. It is a disk-shaped placozoan (meaning a 'flat animal') about a millimetre across and was first observed growing on the walls of an aquarium. Now the genome of Trichoplax adhaerens has been sequenced and analysed. The organism retains many features of the last common ancestor with cnidarians and bilaterians, calculated to have existed more than 600 million years ago. But Trichoplax also contains genes for developmental patterns and cell types which have never been seen in this animal, suggesting that there may be stages in its life cycle that have not yet been observed. The genome sequence for Trichoplax adhaerens is analysed, and it is reported that the organism retains many features of the last common ancestor with cnidarians and bilaterians, estimated to be over 600 million years ago. However, T. adhaerens also contains genes for developmental patterns and cell types which have never been seen in this animal, suggesting that we might still not know the full story."

https://openalex.org/W2023184347,"Many bacterial pathogens rely on a conserved membrane histidine sensor kinase, QseC, to respond to host adrenergic signaling molecules and bacterial signals in order to promote the expression of virulence factors. Using a high-throughput screen, we identified a small molecule, LED209, that inhibits the binding of signals to QseC, preventing its autophosphorylation and consequently inhibiting QseC-mediated activation of virulence gene expression. LED209 is not toxic and does not inhibit pathogen growth; however, this compound markedly inhibits the virulence of several pathogens in vitro and in vivo in animals. Inhibition of signaling offers a strategy for the development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2065518020,"The nearly 600 proteases in the human genome regulate a diversity of biological processes, including programmed cell death. Comprehensive characterization of protease signaling in complex biological samples is limited by available proteomic methods. We have developed a general approach for global identification of proteolytic cleavage sites using an engineered enzyme to selectively biotinylate free protein N termini for positive enrichment of corresponding N-terminal peptides. Using this method to study apoptosis, we have sequenced 333 caspase-like cleavage sites distributed among 292 protein substrates. These sites are generally not predicted by in vitro caspase substrate specificity but can be used to predict other physiological caspase cleavage sites. Structural bioinformatic studies show that caspase cleavage sites often appear in surface-accessible loops and even occasionally in helical regions. Strikingly, we also find that a disproportionate number of caspase substrates physically interact, suggesting that these dimeric proteases target protein complexes and networks to elicit apoptosis.

Strikingly, we also find that a disproportionate number of caspase substrates physically interact, suggesting that these dimeric proteases target protein complexes and networks to elicit apoptosis. Apoptosis is a noninflammatory form of cell death that regulates tissue differentiation and homeostasis in higher eukaryotes (for a review, see Taylor et al., 2008Taylor R. Cullen S. Martin S. Apoptosis: Controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Since apoptotic turnover of cells lies in direct opposition to the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells, a strong link exists between apoptosis and cancer. Indeed, the terminal cellular effect of most chemotherapeutic compounds is induction of apoptosis (Kaufmann and Earnshaw, 2000Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Induction of apoptosis by cancer chemotherapy.Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The widespread intracellular proteolysis that is a hallmark of apoptosis is predominantly mediated by a family of dimeric aspartate-specific proteases termed caspases. Apoptosis can be induced by extracellular death ligands, such as Fas ligand, TNF-α, or TRAIL, via the extrinsic pathway to activate caspase-8. It can also be induced by agents such as cytotoxic compounds, radiation, and other environmental stresses via the intrinsic pathway with release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria to activate caspase-9. Initiator caspases-8 and -9 in turn activate executioner caspases, among them caspases-3 and -7. Caspases then catalyze a multitude of proteolytic events to inactivate prosurvival and/or antiapoptotic proteins and activate antisurvival and/or proapoptotic proteins. This proteolysis results in apoptotic cell death and clearance of apoptotic bodies by phagocytes. Because the study of apoptotic pathways has ramifications for development of therapies for treatment of cancer, there is significant interest in gaining a better understanding of caspase activity during apoptosis. For example, identification of new targets of proteolysis in apoptosis can lead to the discovery of prosurvival and/or antiapoptotic factors, which can lead to identification of chemotherapeutic targets. Over 300 publications describing a wide variety of cell types and apoptotic inducers have reported the proteolysis of approximately 360 human proteins in apoptosis (Lüthi and Martin, 2007Lüthi A.U. Martin S.J. The CASBAH: A searchable database of caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Adding to this complexity, the nature of the apoptotic response varies widely in a cell-dependent and stimulus-dependent manner that cannot be easily predicted (Fulda et al., 2001Fulda S. Meyer E. Friesen C. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Debatin K.M. Cell type specific involvement of death receptor and mitochondrial pathways in drug-induced apoptosis.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Stepczynska et al., 2001Stepczynska A. Lauber K. Engels I.H. Janssen O. Kabelitz D. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Staurosporine and conventional anticancer drugs induce overlapping, yet distinct pathways of apoptosis and caspase activation.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Wiegand et al., 2001Wiegand U.K. Corbach S. Prescott A.R. Savill J. Spruce B.A. The trigger to cell death determines the efficiency with which dying cells are cleared by neighbours.Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, combined data sets of caspase substrates from studies using varied inducers and cell types have limited use for understanding how a single inducer can cause apoptosis in a particular cell type. We have developed an enzymatic approach for global profiling of proteolysis and sequencing of cleavage sites in complex mixtures that is based on positive selection of protein fragments containing unblocked α-amines, characteristically produced in proteolysis. This positive selection is enabled by use of an engineered peptide ligase termed subtiligase to selectively biotinylate unblocked protein α-amines with absolute selectivity over ɛ-amines of lysine side chains. We have used this method to sequence 333 cleavage sites in 292 different protein substrates targeted by caspase-like proteolysis in Jurkat cells after intrinsic induction of apoptosis with the classic chemotherapeutic etoposide. In profiling the proteolysis that is induced by a single agent in a single cell line, this work reveals the vastness of caspase-like proteolysis that takes place during apoptosis, sheds light on determinants of specificity for this activity in a cellular context, and demonstrates the utility of a powerful degradomic technology to study proteolysis in biological samples. Direct and selective labeling of protein α-amines or α-carboxylates is a powerful approach for profiling proteolysis in complex mixtures since it permits direct identification of cleavage sites in protein substrates. Approximately 80% of mammalian proteins are known to be N-terminally acetylated (Brown and Roberts, 1976Brown J.L. Roberts W.K. Evidence that approximately eighty per cent of the soluble proteins from Ehrlich ascites cells are Nalpha-acetylated.J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1009-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, greater signal over background can be achieved through N-terminal instead of C-terminal labeling. However, such labeling must still be extremely selective for α-amines over lysine ɛ-amines, which are approximately 25 times more abundant in an average protein. To achieve this selectivity, we have adopted an enzymological approach that makes use of the rationally designed protein ligase subtiligase. This engineered enzyme exhibits absolute selectivity for modification of α-amines (Abrahmsén et al., 1991Abrahmsén L. Tom J. Burnier J. Butcher K.A. Kossiakoff A. Wells J.A. Engineering subtilisin and its substrates for efficient ligation of peptide bonds in aqueous solution.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4151-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, Chang et al., 1994Chang T.K. Jackson D.Y. Burnier J.P. Wells J.A. Subtiligase: A tool for semisynthesis of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 12544-12548Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have developed a proteomic method utilizing subtiligase that enables capture and sequencing of N-terminal peptides found in complex biochemical mixtures (Figure 1A). Proteins in biological samples are N-terminally biotinylated by treatment with subtiligase and a peptide glycolate ester substrate specially tailored to our proteomic workflow (Figure 1B). Biotinylated samples are exhaustively digested with trypsin, and N-terminal peptides are captured with avidin affinity media. The peptide ester substrate contains a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site to permit facile recovery of captured peptides. An important aspect of our workflow is that recovered peptides retain an N-terminal SY-dipeptide modification, providing a key hallmark to distinguish labeled peptides from contaminating unlabeled peptides with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). In standard protease nomenclature, substrates are cleaved between the P1 (N-terminal) and P1′ (C-terminal) residues, with Pn and Pn′ residues increasing in count by one in both directions away from the scissile bond (Schechter and Berger, 1968Schechter I. Berger A. On the active site of proteases. 3. Mapping the active site of papain; specific peptide inhibitors of papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, the Pn′ residues of a cleavage site correspond to N-terminal residues of the labeled peptide identified, whereas the Pn residues of a cleavage site can be inferred from the protein sequence preceding the identified peptide. As a validation of this method, we analyzed endogenous N termini in nonapoptotic Jurkat cells in two small-scale experiments using one-dimensional reversed-phase (1D) LC/MS/MS and two large-scale experiments using two-dimensional strong cation exchange/reversed-phase (2D) LC/MS/MS (summarized in Tables S1 and S2 available online). Comparison of data obtained in both types of experiments is informative since 1D LC/MS/MS typically results in identification of abundant N termini, whereas the increased proteomic coverage afforded by 2D LC/MS/MS results in additional identification of lower-abundance N termini. Of the combined 131 unique N termini identified in small-scale experiments, 72% are either annotated in Swiss-Prot as native protein N termini or correspond to cleavages within the first 50 residues of proteins, as would be expected for N-terminal signal or transit peptide processing (Figure S1A). The remaining 28% correspond to cleavages outside of the first 50 residues, arising from additional processing or constitutive protein degradation. In support of this notion, 51% of the combined 661 unique N termini identified in large-scale experiments correspond to cleavages outside of the first 50 residues (Figure S1A). The increased frequency of such N termini in large-scale experiments is consistent with the expected lower abundance for products of constitutive protein degradation. For analysis of apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we conducted several small-scale (1D) and large-scale (2D) LC/MS/MS experiments (representatives are summarized in Tables S3 and S4) with cells treated with the topoisomerase II poison etoposide. The experiments with untreated cells described above serve as respective controls for the small- and large-scale experiments with apoptotic cells, in which a combined 244 and 733 unique N termini, respectively, were identified. Combined data sets of all N-terminal peptides identified in untreated and apoptotic Jurkat cells, respectively, are included as supplemental data (Tables S5 and S6). Caspases are known to exhibit strict substrate specificity for aspartate at P1, and for glycine > serine > alanine at P1′ (Schilling and Overall, 2008Schilling O. Overall C.M. Proteome-derived, database-searchable peptide libraries for identifying protease cleavage sites.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, Stennicke et al., 2000Stennicke H.R. Renatus M. Meldal M. Salvesen G.S. Internally quenched fluorescent peptide substrates disclose the subsite preferences of human caspases 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8.Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In small-scale experiments, 43% of N termini identified in apoptotic cells were derived from P1 aspartate cleavages, in contrast to less than 1% in untreated cells (Figure 2A). In large-scale experiments, 43% of N termini identified in apoptotic cells were derived from P1 aspartate cleavages, in contrast to 3% in untreated cells (Figure 2B). An increased frequency of glycine at the first position of N termini is also observed in apoptotic cells relative to untreated cells at both experimental scales (Figures 2A and 2B). The N termini uniquely identified in apoptotic Jurkat cells are thus consistent with induction of caspase-like activity. Of the 3% P1 aspartate N termini detected in large-scale experiments with untreated cells (Figure 2B), 55% correspond to reported caspase substrates (Lüthi and Martin, 2007Lüthi A.U. Martin S.J. The CASBAH: A searchable database of caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that these originate from the small number of apoptotic cells typically present in untreated cultures. The detection of 3% P1 aspartate N termini in large-scale experiments with untreated cells and less than 1% in small-scale experiments is consistent with the low abundance of such N termini in cultures of normal cells. Additionally, if one considers that N termini annotated in Swiss-Prot are representative of native N termini in healthy cells, it is notable that less than 1% are derived from proteolytic processing after an aspartate residue (Figure S2). In apoptotic samples, we find that the increased frequency of N termini located beyond the first 50 residues is solely attributable to P1 aspartate cleavages (Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, the vast majority of proteolysis we observe in apoptosis is attributable to caspases or proteases with caspase-like substrate specificity. Among the total 1099 SY-labeled peptides identified in etoposide-treated Jurkat cells, 418 follow aspartate in corresponding protein sequences (Tables S4 and S6). These peptides correspond to 333 P1 aspartate N termini and caspase-like cleavage sites (identified cleavage sites are listed in Table S7). In turn, these cleavage sites map to 282 unique substrates and ten additional others that cannot be distinguished from homologs containing the same identified N terminus (identified substrates are listed in Table S8). The average overlap between data sets obtained in separate experiments is 55% at the peptide level and 58% at the protein level (Figures S3A and S3B). Similar overlap levels (∼67%) have been previously observed for replicate analyses of complex mixtures of peptides with LC/MS/MS (Elias et al., 2005Elias J.E. Haas W. Faherty B. Gygi S. Comparative evaluation of mass spectrometry platforms used in large-scale proteomics investigations.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We have verified 16 of the proteins identified as caspase substrates in our studies to be cleaved during apoptosis, using immunoblotting (representative examples are included as Figure S4A). We have also determined that the proteolysis of a representative set of substrates is blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk, consistent with this proteolysis being caspase dependent (Figure S4B). The most frequent residues at the P4, P3, P2, and P1′ positions of the caspase-like cleavage sites identified in apoptotic Jurkat cells are aspartate, glutamate, valine, and glycine, respectively (Figure 3A). Thus, an averaged composite of these cleavage sites indicates that the most common caspase activity in apoptotic cells exhibits a specificity that is most similar to the substrate specificity of executioner caspases-3 and -7, as determined with peptide substrates (Figure 3B) (Thornberry et al., 1997Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. et al.A combinatorial approach defines specificities of members of the caspase family and granzyme B. Functional relationships established for key mediators of apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). However, there are significant differences between the cellular cleavage sites and the in vitro specificity profiles. Notably, the canonical DEVD cleavage site motif is found in less than 1% of the caspase-like cleavage sites observed in apoptotic Jurkat cells, and the broader DXXD motif is still only found in 22% of the identified cleavage sites (Figure 3D). A distinct difference in the composite cellular profile is the high frequency of serine and threonine residues at P4, P3, and P2, which is not observed in vitro for any of the caspases (Figure S5). Interestingly, a composite of all reported human capase cleavage sites and human orthologs of reported rodent caspase cleavage sites (Lüthi and Martin, 2007Lüthi A.U. Martin S.J. The CASBAH: A searchable database of caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) is very similar to the Jurkat cellular profile reported here (Figure 3C). These observations suggest that caspase substrate specificity determined with peptide substrates has limited value as a predictor of physiological caspase cleavage sites. To investigate the predictive value of a large set of known physiological caspase cleavage sites, we constructed three profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) using the cleavage sites identified in our studies, previously reported cleavage sites, and the union of these two data sets (a detailed description of this analysis is found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The accuracy of these HMMs was estimated via jackknifing and plotted in a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot, showing the true-positive rate versus the false-positive rate at different HMM score thresholds. Although all three HMMs predict caspase cleavage sites relatively accurately, the HMM built from the merged substrate set performed slightly better than those built from the individual sets (Figure 3E). Its true-positive rate was 0.86 at the false-positive rate of 0.15, compared to the average true-positive rate of 0.84 at the false-positive rate of 0.17 for the other two HMMs. The combined data set of the 333 caspase cleavage sites identified in our work and the approximately 300 previously identified caspase cleavage sites (Lüthi and Martin, 2007Lüthi A.U. Martin S.J. The CASBAH: A searchable database of caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) allows an opportunity to expand our understanding of caspase substrate specificity from primary structure to the level of secondary and higher-order structures. To accomplish this goal, we mapped the known caspase cleavage sites onto experimentally determined atomic structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2002Berman H.M. Battistuz T. Bhat T.N. Bluhm W.F. Bourne P.E. Burkhardt K. Feng Z. Gilliland G.L. Iype L. Jain S. et al.The Protein Data Bank.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar), as well as comparative protein structure models in the ModBase database (Pieper et al., 2006Pieper U. Eswar N. Davis F.P. Braberg H. Madhusudhan M.S. Rossi A. Marti-Renom M. Karchin R. Webb B.M. Eramian D. et al.MODBASE: A database of annotated comparative protein structure models and associated resources.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D291-D295Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Stringent filters were applied so that only models likely to be sufficiently accurate for the analysis were used. We identified 18 cleavage sites in known structures and 116 sites in comparative models. Depending on P4 through P4′ position, between 60% to 80% of cleavage site residues are solvent accessible, as defined by solvent exposure of greater than 33% total surface area (Figure 4A). Averaged across P4 through P4′, cleavage site residues are 76% more exposed than a reference control of all octapeptide sequences in the PDB containing an aspartate residue at the fourth position. The type of secondary structure was assigned using DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983Kabsch W. Sander C. Dictionary of protein secondary structure: Pattern recognition of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features.Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11505) Google Scholar) for P4 through P4′ positions. The frequency of secondary structure types at each position reveals that caspases most frequently cleave protein substrates at loops relative to the octapeptide reference control described above (Figure 4B). Surprisingly, proteolysis at α-helical regions is not uncommon. Binning of cleavage sites into secondary structure motifs reveals that although an all-loop motif is the most common secondary structure motif, the second most common one is an all-helix motif (Figure 4C). The finding that some cleavages occur at solvent inaccessible and α-helical regions likely reflects structural dynamics of these regions. Structural examples of cleavages identified in our studies are included as supplemental data (Figure S6). Analysis of the location of cleavage sites in caspase substrates annotated in the Pfam database (Finn et al., 2006Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Böckler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. et al.Pfam: Clans, web tools and services.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) indicates that 46% of them are located within an annotated functional domain, 38% are located between annotated domains, and 16% are located at protein termini, either before the first annotated domain or after the last (Figure 4D). This distribution is relatively similar to the distribution of a reference control of all octapeptide sequences in the human Swiss-Prot database containing an aspartate residue at the fourth position. Thus, caspases do not exhibit a strong preference for cleavage of substrates either inside or outside functional domains. Caspase cleavage sites are also evenly distributed over the length of protein substrates (data not shown). Upon inspection of the entire data set of caspase substrates, we noted a number of instances where multiple proteins along a single biochemical pathway, or in a single protein complex, are targeted by caspases. For a more systematic analysis of this property, we utilized data from three different protein interaction databases (HPRD, IntAct, and MINT) to create a network of caspase substrate protein interactors (Chatr-aryamontri et al., 2007Chatr-aryamontri A. Ceol A. Palazzi L.M. Nardelli G. Schneider M.V. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G.

This network is made up solely of the substrates identified in our studies, reported human capase substrates, and human orthologs of reported rodent caspase substrates (Lüthi and Martin, 2007Lüthi A.U. Martin S.J. The CASBAH: A searchable database of caspase substrates.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) but excludes the caspases themselves (binary interactions constituting this network are listed in Table S9). A total of 415 interactors and 1253 interactions were found among the merged human caspase substrate data set of 602 proteins, for an average of 2.1 intra-data set interactions per caspase substrate. Ten data sets of 602 randomly chosen proteins from the protein interaction databases had an average of 0.2 intra-data set interactions per protein. This indicates a 10-fold enrichment in protein interactions between caspase substrates relative to randomly interacting proteins (Figure 5A) (a detailed description of this analysis is found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To determine which biological processes are preferentially targeted by caspases during apoptosis, we used the BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005Maere S. Heymans K. Kuiper M. BiNGO: A Cytoscape plugin to assess overrepresentation of gene ontology categories in biological networks.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3448-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar) plugin of Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003Shannon P.

Cytoscape: A software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (18630) Google Scholar) to find GO biological process terms that are overrepresented relative to the complete human GO annotation. We then focused on the 132 terms in the three deepest levels of the GO hierarchy to find the ten most overrepresented GO terms and the substrates annotated to those terms. This analysis yielded subnetworks of substrates involved in regulation of transcription, transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, DNA repair, antiapoptosis, induction of apoptosis, apoptotic mitochondrial changes, regulation of translational initiation, DNA unwinding during replication, endocytosis, and cell division (Figures 5B–5K). The regulation of transcription GO term yielded the densest subnetwork, with 188 edges among 93 nodes (Figure 5B). In sharp contrast to the other nine GO terms, the cell division GO term barely yielded a network at all, with only two edges among 20 nodes (Figure 5K). To analyze whether multiple cleavages along a pathway or in a complex occur at physiologically relevant rates, we focused on the portion of the regulation of transcription subnetwork representing N-CoR/SMRT transcriptional corepressor complex components and interactors (Figures 6A and 6B). This complex is involved in the recruitment of histone deacetylase activity to chromatin, which leads to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Our studies identified N-CoR/SMRT complex resident components N-CoR and TBLR1 (Karagianni and Wong, 2007Karagianni P. Wong J.

We probed for cleavage of these proteins during etoposide-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells by immunoblot in order to qualitatively determine extent of proteolysis in each case. N-CoR, TBLR1, HDAC7, and SHARP were all fully cleaved at rates similar to those observed for hallmark substrates procaspase-3 and DFF45 (Figures 6C and 6D). This proteolysis also tracked reasonably well with the time course for DNA fragmentation. In contrast, only partial proteolysis of RBBP7 was observed, suggesting it to be a possible bystander substrate (Figure 6D). Although not detected in our proteomic studies, we predicted the N-CoR homolog SMRT (Karagianni and Wong, 2007Karagianni P. Wong J. HDAC3: Taking the SMRT-N-CoRrect road to repression.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5439-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) to also be a caspase substrate on the basis of high sequence similarity to N-CoR cleavage sites.

In our experiment, we create a translationally ultracold, dense quantum gas of molecules bound by more than 1000 wave numbers in the electronic ground state. Specifically, we stimulate with 80% efficiency, a two-photon transfer of molecules associated on a Feshbach resonance from a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. In the process, the initial loose, long-range electrostatic bond of the Feshbach molecule is coherently transformed into a tight chemical bond. We demonstrate coherence of the transfer in a Ramsey-type experiment and show that the molecular sample is not heated during the transfer. Our results show that the preparation of a quantum gas of molecules in specific rovibrational states is possible and that the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules in their rovibronic ground state is within reach."

By introducing nanometer-scale twin defects into copper grains, we show that we can change the grain-boundary structure and atomic-diffusion behavior along the boundary. Using in situ ultrahigh-vacuum and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we observed electromigration-induced atomic diffusion in the twin-modified grain boundaries. The triple point where a twin boundary meets a grain boundary was found to slow down grain-boundary and surface electromigration by one order of magnitude. We propose that this occurs because of the incubation time of nucleation of a new step at the triple points. The long incubation time slows down the overall rate of atomic transport."
https://openalex.org/W2063131697,"In T cells, the stochasticity of protein expression could contribute to the useful diversification of biological functions within a clonal population or interfere with accurate antigen discrimination. Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, we examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T cell activation. We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity. These findings reveal how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled manner."

Magnetic order and superconductivity have been found to coexist in a number of magnetically mediated superconductors, but these order parameters generally compete. We report that close to the upper critical field, CeCoIn 5 adopts a multicomponent ground state that simultaneously carries cooperating magnetic and superconducting orders. Suppressing superconductivity in a first-order transition at the upper critical field leads to the simultaneous collapse of the magnetic order, showing that superconductivity is necessary for the magnetic order. A symmetry analysis of the coupling between the magnetic order and the superconducting gap function suggests a form of superconductivity that is associated with a nonvanishing momentum."

This unveils a rich structure in the theory of quantum communications, implying that the quantum capacity does not completely specify a channel's ability to transmit quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W2018341322,"The mechanisms by which quiescent cells, including adult stem cells, preserve their ability to resume proliferation after weeks or even years of cell cycle arrest are not known. We report that reversibility is not a passive property of nondividing cells, because enforced cell cycle arrest for a period as brief as 4 days initiates spontaneous, premature, and irreversible senescence. Increased expression of the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix protein HES1 was required for quiescence to be reversible, because HES1 prevented both premature senescence and inappropriate differentiation in quiescent fibroblasts. In some human tumors, the HES1 pathway was activated, which allowed these cells to evade differentiation and irreversible cell cycle arrest. We conclude that HES1 safeguards against irreversible cell cycle exit both during normal cellular quiescence and pathologically in the setting of tumorigenesis."

However, the mechanism of this metabolic switch remains largely unknown. Herein, we reported that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3 (PDK3) expression leading to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Promoter activity assay, small interference RNA knockdown assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that hypoxia-induced PDK3 gene activity was regulated by HIF-1 at the transcriptional level. Forced expression of PDK3 in cancer cells resulted in increased lactic acid accumulation and drugs resistance, whereas knocking down PDK3 inhibited hypoxia-induced cytoplasmic glycolysis and cell survival. These data demonstrated that increased PDK3 expression due to elevated HIF-1alpha in cancer cells may play critical roles in metabolic switch during cancer progression and chemoresistance in cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1963851622,"Adenovirus e1a induces quiescent human cells to replicate. We found that e1a causes global relocalization of the RB (retinoblastoma) proteins (RB, p130, and p107) and p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases on promoters, the effect of which is to restrict the acetylation of histone 3 lysine-18 (H3K18ac) to a limited set of genes, thereby stimulating cell cycling and inhibiting antiviral responses and cellular differentiation. Soon after expression, e1a binds transiently to promoters of cell cycle and growth genes, causing enrichment of p300/CBP, PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), and H3K18ac; depletion of RB proteins; and transcriptional activation. e1a also associates transiently with promoters of antiviral genes, causing enrichment for RB, p130, and H4K16ac; increased nucleosome density; and transcriptional repression. At later times, e1a and p107 bind mainly to promoters of development and differentiation genes, repressing transcription. The temporal order of e1a binding requires its interactions with p300/CBP and RB proteins. Our data uncover a defined epigenetic reprogramming leading to cellular transformation."

On the basis of recent insights about unconscious influences on information processing, we tested whether automatic mental associations of undecided individuals bias future choices in a manner such that these choices reflect the evaluations implied by earlier automatic associations. With the use of a computer-based, speeded categorization task to assess automatic mental associations (i.e., associations that are activated unintentionally, difficult to control, and not necessarily endorsed at a conscious level) and self-report measures to assess consciously endorsed beliefs and choice preferences, automatic associations of undecided participants predicted changes in consciously reported beliefs and future choices over a period of 1 week. Conversely, for decided participants, consciously reported beliefs predicted changes in automatic associations and future choices over the same period. These results indicate that decision-makers sometimes have already made up their mind at an unconscious level, even when they consciously indicate that they are still undecided."
https://openalex.org/W2045650289,"Adenovirus small early region 1a (e1a) protein drives cells into S phase by binding RB family proteins and the closely related histone acetyl transferases p300 and CBP. The interaction with RB proteins displaces them from DNA-bound E2F transcription factors, reversing their repression of cell cycle genes. However, it has been unclear how the e1a interaction with p300 and CBP promotes passage through the cell cycle. We show that this interaction causes a threefold reduction in total cellular histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac). CBP and p300 are required for acetylation at this site because their knockdown causes specific hypoacetylation at H3K18. SV40 T antigen also induces H3K18 hypoacetylation. Because global hypoacetylation at this site is observed in prostate carcinomas with poor prognosis, this suggests that processes resulting in global H3K18 hypoacetylation may be linked to oncogenic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2091470727,"The centromere is essential for the inheritance of genetic information on eukaryotic chromosomes. Epigenetic regulation of centromere identity has been implicated in genome stability, karyotype evolution, and speciation. However, little is known regarding the manner in which centromere dysfunction affects the chromosomal architectures. Here we show that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , the conditional deletion of the centromere produces survivors that carry either a neocentromere-acquired chromosome at the subtelomeric region or an acentric chromosome rescued by intertelomere fusion with either of the remaining chromosomes. The ratio of neocentromere formation to telomere fusion is considerably decreased by the inactivation of genes involved in RNA interference–dependent heterochromatin formation. By affecting the modes of chromosomal reorganization, the genomic distribution of heterochromatin may influence the fate of karyotype evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2088759305,"Sildenafil, a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) induces powerful protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. PDE-5 inhibition increases cGMP levels that activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). However, the cause and effect relationship of PKG in sildenafil-induced cardioprotection and the downstream targets of PKG remain unclear. Adult ventricular myocytes were treated with sildenafil and subjected to simulated ischemia and reoxygenation. Sildenafil treatment significantly decreased cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis. The PKG inhibitors, KT5823, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio) (R(p)-8-pCPT-cGMPs), or DT-2 blocked the anti-necrotic and anti-apoptotic effect of sildenafil. Selective knockdown of PKG in cardiomyocytes with adenoviral vector containing short hairpin RNA of PKG also abolished sildenafil-induced protection. Furthermore, intra-coronary infusion of sildenafil in Langendorff-isolated mouse hearts prior to ischemia-reperfusion significantly reduced myocardial infarct size after 20 min ischemia and 30 min reperfusion, which was abrogated by KT5823. Sildenafil significantly increased PKG activity in intact hearts and cardiomyocytes. Sildenafil also enhanced the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. All these changes (except Akt phosphorylation) were significantly blocked by KT5823 and short hairpin RNA of PKG. These studies provide the first evidence for an essential role of PKG in sildenafil-induced cardioprotection. Moreover, our results demonstrate that sildenafil activates a PKG-dependent novel signaling cascade that involves activation of ERK and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta leading to cytoprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2062726384,"The rate, polarity, and symmetry of the flow of the plant hormone auxin are determined by the polar cellular localization of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers. Flavonoids, a class of secondary plant metabolites, have been suspected to modulate auxin transport and tropic responses. Nevertheless, the identity of specific flavonoid compounds involved and their molecular function and targets <i>in vivo</i> are essentially unknown. Here we show that the root elongation zone of agravitropic <i>pin2</i>/<i>eir1</i>/<i>wav6</i>/<i>agr1</i> has an altered pattern and amount of flavonol glycosides. Application of nanomolar concentrations of flavonols to <i>pin2</i> roots is sufficient to partially restore root gravitropism. By employing a quantitative cell biological approach, we demonstrate that flavonoids partially restore the formation of lateral auxin gradients in the absence of PIN2. Chemical complementation by flavonoids correlates with an asymmetric distribution of the PIN1 protein. <i>pin2</i> complementation probably does not result from inhibition of auxin efflux, as supply of the auxin transport inhibitor <i>N</i>-1-naphthylphthalamic acid failed to restore <i>pin2</i> gravitropism. We propose that flavonoids promote asymmetric PIN shifts during gravity stimulation, thus redirecting basipetal auxin streams necessary for root bending."

Species such as fish, insects, and mammals signal danger to conspecifics by releasing volatile alarm molecules. Thus far, neither the chemicals, their bodily source, nor the sensory system involved in their detection have been isolated or identified in mammals. We found that APs are recognized by the Grueneberg ganglion (GG), a recently discovered olfactory subsystem. We showed with electron microscopy that GG neurons bear primary cilia, with cell bodies ensheathed by glial cells. APs evoked calcium responses in GG neurons in vitro and induced freezing behavior in vivo, which completely disappeared when the GG degenerated after axotomy. We conclude that mice detect APs through the activation of olfactory GG neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2032293292,"The presence of young massive stars orbiting on eccentric rings within a few tenths of a parsec of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center is challenging for theories of star formation. The high tidal shear from the black hole should tear apart the molecular clouds that form stars elsewhere in the Galaxy, and transport of stars to the galactic center also appears unlikely during their lifetimes. We conducted numerical simulations of the infall of a giant molecular cloud that interacts with the black hole. The transfer of energy during closest approach allows part of the cloud to become bound to the black hole, forming an eccentric disk that quickly fragments to form stars. Compressional heating due to the black hole raises the temperature of the gas up to several hundred to several thousand kelvin, ensuring that the fragmentation produces relatively high stellar masses. These stars retain the eccentricity of the disk and, for a sufficiently massive initial cloud, produce an extremely top-heavy distribution of stellar masses. This potentially repetitive process may explain the presence of multiple eccentric rings of young stars in the presence of a supermassive black hole."

The filaments are dragged out from the centre of the galaxy by radio-emitting ‘bubbles’ rising buoyantly in the hot intracluster gas4, before later falling back. They act as markers of the feedback process by which energy is transferred from the central massive black hole to the surrounding gas. The mechanism by which the filaments are stabilized against tidal shear and dissipation into the surrounding extremely hot (4 × 107 K) gas has been unclear. Here we report observations that resolve thread-like structures in the filaments. Some threads extend over 6 kpc, yet are only 70 pc wide. We conclude that magnetic fields in the threads, in pressure balance with the surrounding gas, stabilize the filaments, so allowing a large mass of cold gas to accumulate and delay star formation."

Here, we show that the total mass transport by the circulation is twice as large when averaged on moist isentropes than when averaged on dry isentropes. The additional mass transport on moist isentropes corresponds to a poleward flow of warm moist air near Earth's surface that rises into the upper troposphere within mid-latitudes and accounts for up to half of the air in the upper troposphere in polar regions."

Anterior migration of the mesoderm and endoderm has largely been interpreted to result from epiboly and convergent-extension movements that drive body elongation. We show that the chemokine Cxcl12b and its receptor Cxcr4a restrict anterior migration of the endoderm during zebrafish gastrulation, thereby coordinating its movements with those of the mesoderm. Depletion of either gene product causes disruption of integrin-dependent cell adhesion, resulting in separation of the endoderm from the mesoderm; the endoderm then migrates farther anteriorly than it normally would, resulting in bilateral duplication of endodermal organs. This process may have relevance to human gastrointestinal bifurcations and other organ defects."

Paradoxically, patients with MCPH1 mutations do not present with dramatic sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, premature aging, or cancer predisposition, which is often a characteristic of other cancer susceptibility syndromes caused by mutations in the DNA damage response pathway (18O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). One unique characteristic of cells derived from MCPH1 patients is the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) 4The abbreviations used are: PCC, premature chromosome condensation; SMC, structural maintenance of chromosome; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; HR, homologous recombination; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 4The abbreviations used are: PCC, premature chromosome condensation; SMC, structural maintenance of chromosome; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; HR, homologous recombination; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein. phenotype observed in a subset of these patient cells (∼15%) (3Jackson A.P.

These cells display an aberrant morphology under routine chromosome spreads with highly compacted, condensed DNA. Consequently, MCPH1 mutations were also discovered in a family with PCC syndrome, which shared the dramatic reduction in head size seen in primary microcephaly (8Trimborn M. Bell S.M. Felix C. Rashid Y. Jafri H. Griffiths P.D. Neumann L.M. Krebs A. Reis A. Sperling K. Neitzel H. Jackson A.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 75: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Despite these strong cell biology data, a mechanistic link between MCPH1 and chromosome condensation remains to be identified. Chromosome condensation is an important step in the cell cycle especially when cells are preparing to enter mitosis. In humans and other eukaryotes, there are several protein complexes that regulate chromosome condensation and segregation. These include cohesin, SMC5-SMC6-NseI, Condensin I, and Condensin II (19Hirano T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These protein complexes share many similarities, especially the core domains of these multiprotein subunit complexes, which consist of Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) proteins, which are large ATPases, and their unique subunits, which contain HEAT or kleisin protein domains. Cohesin consists of an SMC heterodimer composed of SMC1/SMC3 and two specific subunits Scc1 and Scc3, and functions in sister chromatid cohesion (19Hirano T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The SMC5/6-NseI complex again shares a core SMC heterodimer and then 4 specific subunits (NseI, -II, -III, and -IV) and has been shown to function in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints (20Strom L. Sjogren C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Condensin I and Condensin II have a common SMC heterodimer (SMC2/SMC4) that associate to form a characteristic V-shape and also three distinct specific subunits (21Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R265-R275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Together, each SMC protein forms an arm through self-folding of anti-parallel coiled-coil sequences forming a hinge domain at one end that is responsible for the association of the two molecules, and at the other end an ATPase “head” of the N- and C-terminal sequences that can engage ATP, which when hydrolyzed allows for movement of DNA. However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear (21Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R265-R275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Either Condensin I or II are large molecules, with each arm about ∼50 nm in size, which is equivalent to 150 bp of dsDNA. Conceivably, this distance is big enough to wrap around and access nucleosomes. However, the mechanism by which Condensin I or II regulates chromosome condensation is still largely unknown (21Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R265-R275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Condensin I and II share the SMC2/SMC4 core heterodimer and three other subunits, CAP-D2, CAP-G, and CAP-H in the Condensin I complex, and CAP-D3, CAP-G2 and CAP-H2 in Condensin II. CAP-D2, CAP-D3, CAP-G, and CAP-G2 proteins contain HEAT repeats while CAP-H and CAP-H2 are members of the kleisin family, γ and β, respectively. Recent in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that each complex has an identical subunit organization; CAP-H and CAP-H2 bind to the SMC2/4 heterodimer through their N and C terminus; thus, forming a closed ring and also function as a platform for the association of the other HEAT repeat containing subunits (22Onn I. Aono N. Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1024-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While having similar subunit and complex architecture, Condensin I and Condensin II have different cellular localization patterns. During interphase, Condensin I remains in the cytoplasm while Condensin II localizes in the nucleus (23Ono T. Fang Y. Spector D.L. Hirano T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3296-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis and the breakdown of the nuclear envelope Condensin I is believed to act together with Condensin II and function in compacting chromosomes preparing for mitosis (21Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R265-R275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This condensation ability has been demonstrated in vitro since Condensin I can form positive super-coils using a DNA substrate (24Takemoto A. Kimura K. Yokoyama S. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4551-4559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Strick T.R. Kawaguchi T. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 874-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, exactly how Condensin I or II works in vivo and what other processes it may function remains a mystery. At present, MCPH1 appears to function in diverse pathways regulating cell cycle control, DNA damage and chromosome biology. To fully understand how MCPH1 participates in these events, we have purified MCPH1-containing complexes and identified several MCPH1 associated proteins. Surprisingly, the Condensin II complex was isolated as a major binding partner of MCPH1. Subsequent experiments indicate that both MCPH1 and Condensin II are involved in homologous recombination repair, providing the first evidence supporting a role of Condensin II in DNA damage repair. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Antibodies—HeLa and 293T cells were purchased from American Tissue Type Culture (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 C in 5% CO2 (v/v). Microcephalin/BRIT1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from E14.5 embryos, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MEFs were immortalized with SV40. Deletion mutants of MCPH1 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pDNR-MCPH1 as template and then cloned into an EF1A HA-FLAG vector. All deletions were verified by sequencing. Primer sequences are available upon request. Condensin II subunits hCAP-D3, hCAP-G2, and hCAP-H2 cDNA was obtained from OpenBiosystems, and cloned into the pDONOR201 gateway vector. MCPH1 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with MBP fusions of the middle and C-BRCT domains of MCPH1. The antibody was purified using the AminoLink Immobilization kit (Pierce). Antibodies specifically for pH2AX, 53BP1, MDC1 have been described previously (15Wood J.L. Singh N. Mer G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35416-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CAPG2, CAPD3 antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories, and anti-SMC2, SMC4 were purchased from Novus Biologicals. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2 antibody were obtained, respectively, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Sigma. Transfection and Infection—Plasmid transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA transfection was carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The coding strand for the control was UCCAGUGAAUCCUUGAGGUdTdT, and for CAPD3 was CUGGAUUUCACAGAGACUGTTdTdT. All siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. Full-length MCPH1 or its deletions was cloned into pEF1A-HA/FLAG retroviral vector using the gateway system. pEF1A-MCPH1 and its deletions were co-transfected with pCL-Amphobac in BOSC23-packaging cell lines to produce virus. Viral particles were collected 48 and 72 h after transfection and subsequently used to infect MEF cell lines. 48 h after the last infection, MEFs were irradiated as indicated, and immunofluoresence staining was performed. Alternatively, cells were selected in puromycin-containing media for establishing stable clones. Tandem Affinity Purification of MCPH1 and MS Analysis—293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding SFB-tagged MCPH1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were split at the 1:10 ratio and cultured in the medium containing puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 3 weeks. The individual puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and screened by Western blotting. 293T cells stably expressing MCPH1 were lysed with NETN buffer on ice for 20 min. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants were incubated with 300 μl of streptavidin-conjugated beads (Amer-sham Biosciences). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with NETN buffer, and then bead-bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of NETN buffer containing 1 mg/ml biotin (Sigma). The eluted supernatant was incubated with 80 μl of S protein beads (Novagen). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with NETN buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were excised, digested, and the peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Taplin Mass Spec Facility at Harvard. Immunofluoresence, Western Blotting, and FACS Analysis—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min, rinsed 1× with PBS, and then permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then washed and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% goat serum at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed again 1× in PBS, and then secondary antibodies either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were counterstained with DAPI, washed with PBS, and then mounted onto slides with anti-Fade. Images were taken using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 microscope. For PCC quantification using DAPI-staining positive cells were scored that had the representative condensed DNA seen in Fig. 3A, top left panel, bottom, and scored negative if the DAPI pattern was that of normal cells (Fig. 3A, top left panel, top). For Western blotting, cells were lysed with NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice and then rocked for 10 min at 4 °C. Crude cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and cleared lysates were collected. Samples were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TBST and then probed with antibodies as indicated. For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized, washed twice in cold PBS, then resuspended in 300 μl of cold PBS and fixed with 700 μl of ice-cold 100% ethanol. Cells were incubated in RNase A in sodium citrate buffer (100 units/sample) for 30 min, before stained with propidium iodide (PI, 50 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cell cycle analysis was performed using FACScan. Chromosome Spreads—Metaphase chromosome spreads were performed as described before (26Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Franco S. Gostissa M. Rivera M.A. Celeste A. Manis J.P. van Deursen J. Nussenzweig A. Paull T.T. Alt F.W. Chen J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 187-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with colcemid for 4 h and then harvested. After treatment with 0.075 m KCl, cells were fixed in fresh methanol/acetone (3:1) solution and dropped from 10 cm onto coverslips. Cell were allowed to air dry on coverslips, stained with giemsa, and visualized under the microscope. For quantification, 100 metaphase spreads were counted for each cell line in three independent experiments. For Fig. 3, representative spreads are shown for +/+ and -/- cells and were scored positive if they possessed condensed chromosomes. For Fig. 4, representative examples are shown in Fig. 4D, left panel. Spreads were scored positive if they possessed the condensed chromosome pattern as that of MCPH1-/- cells. Homologous Recombination Assays—The HR assay was done using the DR-GFP/I-sceI system as previously described (27Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Briefly, after siRNA treatment, cells were electroporated with 16 μg of pCBASce. 24 h later, cells were collected and analyzed for GFP expression by FACS. All data are the average of three independent experiments and bars are S.D. Isolation of Condensin II as an MCPH1-associated Protein—Because it is still uncertain as exactly how MCPH1 functions in DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint control, we sought to identify MCPH1-associated proteins to further elucidate the function of MCPH1. To do this, we generated a 293T cell line stably expressing a triple-tagged (S-FLAG-strepavidin-binding peptide) MCPH1. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) was performed, and the purified complex underwent mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Our results revealed several MCPH1-associated proteins; however, the major associated proteins appeared to be members of the Condensin II complex, which is involved in chromosome condensation (19Hirano T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 21Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R265-R275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This is exciting because a previous study has reported a possible link between the abnormal chromosome condensation observed in patients with MCPH1 mutations with Condensin II misregulation (29Trimborn M. Schindler D. Neitzel H. Hirano T. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MCPH1 Forms a Complex in Vivo with Condensin II—To explore this possible interaction further, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. The CAP-D3 and CAP-G2 subunits were detected in the MCPH1 IP but not in a control IgG IP. In parallel, MCPH1 was detected in Condensin II IPs, but not in the immunoprecipitates of CAP-D2 or CAP-G IPs, which are members of the Condensin I complex (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that MCPH1 associates specifically with Condensin II but not Condensin I, which agrees with our purification data, because we did not recover any peptides derived from Condensin I-specific subunits. A Region within the Middle Domain (MD) of MCPH1 Is Required for Condensin II Binding—We co-overexpressed the Condensin II subunits together with MCPH1 and found a strong interaction between MCPH1 and CAP-G2 (Fig. 2A), implying that the interaction between MCPH1 and Condensin II may be mediated by this specific subunit of Condensin II. Next we wanted to determine which domain of MCPH1 mediates its interaction with Condensin II. MCPH1 contains 3 BRCT domains, which are known phosphoprotein binding domains. We generated a series of deletion mutations spanning the entire coding region of MCPH1. Surprisingly, the region required for MCPH1 binding was not the N- or C-terminal BRCT domains, but an uncharacterized region in the middle domain (residues 376-485) of MCPH1 (Fig. 2B). When we performed a data base search, we found that this region contains a highly conserved stretch of residues but does not have any similarity with known protein domains (Fig. 2C), indicating that the interaction between MCPH1 and Condensin II may be conserved and thus play an important role throughout evolution. MCPH1-/- MEFs Display PCC—Patients that harbor mutations within MCPH1 have primary microcephaly characterized by a drastic reduction in head size, and cell lines derived from these patients have a population of cells with abnormally condensed chromosomes. In order to generate a model for primary microcephaly and also confirm the cellular phenotypes observed in MCPH1-deficient patients, MCPH1 knock-out mice were generated. 5Y. Liang, H. Gao, S.-Y., Lin, P., Zhang, C., Zhu, O., Benjamin, A. S., Multani, S., Chang, J. A., Goss, F. C., Brunicardi, and K., Li, submitted manuscript. What is very noticeable in these MCPH1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is that they also recapitulate a similar premature condensed chromosome phenotype present in MCPH1 mutant human cells (Fig. 3A). Wild-type MEFs stained with DAPI show normal nuclear DNA with several bright dots indicative of heterochromatin regions; however, in the MCPH1-/- MEFs we discovered a population of cells that displayed a pattern of intense DAPI staining, with unstained spaces in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). This was not due to an overabundance of mitotic cells; staining with phospho-H3 S10 as a mitotic marker showed only ∼2 to 2.5% of cells in mitosis in MCPH1-/- MEFs, slightly higher than in the MCPH1+/+ cells (Fig. 3A). The percentage of cells with this intense DAPI staining pattern was between 30 and 35% in MCPH1-deficient cells, but only 2 or 3% in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). To determine if this nuclear staining phenotype represented abnormally condensed chromosomes, we prepared metaphase chromosome spreads to determine their morphology. As shown in Fig. 3B, MCPH1+/+ cells showed normal chromosome architecture; however, chromosomes from MCPH1-/- cells were abnormally condensed. When scored under the microscope, ∼40% of MCPH1-deficient cells had condensed chromosomes. This number is similar to the percentage of cells with intense DAPI staining (Fig. 3A), suggesting that these two are related phenotypes, resulting from MCPH1 deficiency. The N-BRCT, but Not the Condensin II Binding Region, Is Required to Rescue PCC—MCPH-/- cells recapitulate the chromosome condensation phenotype observed in cells derived from human patients. Our next question was what is the underlying mechanism responsible for this defect. We reconstituted MCPH1-/- MEFs with wild-type or MCPH1 deletion mutants to find which regions of MCPH1 were responsible for this defect. Reconstitution with wild-type MCPH1 fully rescued the chromosome condensation defect because we observed normal DAPI staining and chromosome spreads in these cells (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, when we tested the series of MCPH1 deletions, the region that is important for Condensin II binding (deleted in the Δ2-2 mutant) is not required for the rescue of the chromosome condensation defect, instead the N terminus of MCPH1 is (Fig. 4, A-C). Deletion of the N-BRCT domain alone or deletion of the N-BRCT domain plus a 150-amino acid region immediately after it failed to rescue the chromosome condensation defect as measured by DAPI staining (Fig. 4, A-C). We also performed metaphase spreads for wildtype, MCPH1-deficient, and reconstituted cells. In agreement with the DAPI assay, expression of wild-type MCPH1 rescued the chromosome condensation defect measured by this assay, the N-terminal deletion mutant failed to do so (Fig. 4D). Again, the Δ2-2 mutant, which cannot bind Condensin II, is still capable of rescuing the chromosome condensation defect as measured by metaphase spreads. Collectively, our data implicate that the N terminus including the N-BRCT domain is necessary for rescue of the PCC defect in MCPH1-/- cells; however the Condensin II binding domain appears to be dispensable for this function. Condensin II Participates in Homologous Recombination Repair—If the interaction between MCPH1 and Condensin II is not essential for its function in regulating chromosome condensation, then what is the significance of this interaction? The only other known function of MCPH1 is its involvement in the DNA damage response. To test whether Condensin II would also take part in DNA damage checkpoint or DNA repair, we depleted CAP-D3, a subunit of the Condensin II complex, in HeLa cells using CAP-D3-specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 5A, depletion of CAP-D3 had no effect on the G2/M checkpoint as the number of mitotic cells decreased similar to the control cells after IR treatment (Fig. 4A). Next, we investigated whether Condensin II may be important for DNA repair, as Condensin I has been shown to participate in nucleotide excision repair (30Heale J.T. Ball Jr., A.R. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.S. Kong X. Zhou S. Hudson D.F. Earnshaw W.C. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 837-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the SMC5/6 complex regulates DNA repair through recruitment of cohesin (31Potts P.R. Porteus M.H. Yu H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3377-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We assayed for homologous recombination repair efficiency using a GFP reporter system (27Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, CAP-D3 depleted caused a 2.5-3-fold reduction in HR repair efficiency. Consistent with this observation, MCPH1-/- MEFs also displayed a 2.2-fold decrease in HR repair, which could be rescued by the expression of wild-type MCPH1 and the N-terminal BRCT domain deletion mutant of MCPH1 (ΔNBRCT) in these cells (Fig. 5B). However, the Δ2-2 mutant of MCPH1, which abrogates Condensin II binding, failed to rescue this HR defect. Taken together, our data suggest that not only MCPH1 and Condensin II, but also an interaction between MCPH1 and Condensin II are important for efficient HR repair. Despite intense scrutiny on how MCPH1 functions in cell cycle control and the DNA damage response, the exact role of this protein in these processes remains unclear. Here we describe the purification of Condensin II complex as MCPH1-associated proteins. In this study, we showed that this association is not required for checkpoint control, but participates in homologous recombination repair. Mammalian cells contain two related Condensin complexes: Condensin I and II. It is possible that higher eukaryotes evolved more than one Condensin complex to perform functions other than chromosome condensation. Indeed, Condensin I and II have different localization patterns in interphase cells, with Condensin II mainly localizes in the nucleus and Condensin I confines in the cytoplasm (23Ono T. Fang Y. Spector D.L. Hirano T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3296-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We speculate that this nuclear localization of Condensin II allows Condensin II to perform its role in HR repair with MCPH1 during interphase and then switch to its role in condensation with Condensin I during mitosis. Exactly how Condensin II may function in HR repair is still unknown, but studies from bacterial Condensin provides some interesting hypotheses. A recent report has shown that MukB, the bacterial Condensin, forms clusters on DNA and that these clusters can interact and bring distant DNA ends together (32Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that Condensin II in humans might also display this activity and function in a certain step in HR repair that would require this ability. Besides the HR deficiency, we also observed abnormal chromosome condensation in MCPH1-/- MEFs, which can be rescued by the introduction of wild-type MCPH1. The condensation defect observed in MCPH1-/- MEFs recapitulates the defect observed in MCPH1 patient cell lines. Moreover, two recent reports on Drosophila MCPH1 also described these characteristics of the human syndrome with prematurely condensed DNA (33Brunk K. Vernay B. Griffith E. Reynolds N.L. Strutt D. Ingham P.W. Jackson A.P. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3578-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Rickmyre J.L. Dasgupta S. Ooi D.L. Keel J. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Waddell S. Lee L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3565-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These and our study underline the importance of using genetic models to gain more insight into human disease. Interestingly, the MCPH1 mutant (Δ2-2), which is defective in Condensin II binding, is fully functional in restoring the chromosome condensation defect. On the other hand, the N terminus of MCPH1, especially the N-terminal BRCT domain of MCPH1, is required for rescuing this condensation defect. Given that BRCT domain is a protein-protein interaction domain, it is reasonable to speculate that the N terminus of MCPH1 may associate with another yet-to-be identified protein and thus participate in chromosome condensation. We believe that this function of MCPH1 may somehow be related to the function of Condensin II, but the detailed mechanism can only be worked out once this additional player is identified. We thank all present and past members of the Chen laboratory, especially Ja-Eun Kim and Zhenkun Lou for helpful discussions and technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2093520483,"Landau-Fermi liquid theory, with its pivotal assertion that electrons in metals can be simply understood as independent particles with effective masses replacing the free electron mass, has been astonishingly successful. This is true despite the Coulomb interactions an electron experiences from the host crystal lattice, lattice defects and the other approximately 10(22) cm(-3) electrons. An important extension to the theory accounts for the behaviour of doped semiconductors. Because little in the vast literature on materials contradicts Fermi liquid theory and its extensions, exceptions have attracted great attention, and they include the high-temperature superconductors, silicon-based field-effect transistors that host two-dimensional metals, and certain rare-earth compounds at the threshold of magnetism. The origin of the non-Fermi liquid behaviour in all of these systems remains controversial. Here we report that an entirely different and exceedingly simple class of materials-doped small-bandgap semiconductors near a metal-insulator transition-can also display a non-Fermi liquid state. Remarkably, a modest magnetic field functions as a switch which restores the ordinary disordered Fermi liquid. Our data suggest that we have found a physical realization of the only mathematically rigorous route to a non-Fermi liquid, namely the 'undercompensated Kondo effect', where there are too few mobile electrons to compensate for the spins of unpaired electrons localized on impurity atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2089003221,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a prevalent phosphoinositide in cell membranes, with important functions in cell signaling and activation. A large fraction of PIP2 associates with the detergent-resistant membrane “raft” fraction, but the functional significance of this association remains controversial. To measure the properties of raft and nonraft PIP2 in cell signaling, we targeted the PIP2-specific phosphatase Inp54p to either the raft or nonraft membrane fraction using minimal membrane anchors. Interestingly, we observed that targeting Inp54p to the nonraft fraction resulted in an enrichment of raft-associated PIP2 and striking changes in cell morphology, including a wortmannin-sensitive increase in cell filopodia and cell spreading. In contrast, raft-targeted Inp54p depleted the raft pool of PIP2 and produced smooth T cells void of membrane ruffling and filopodia. Furthermore, raft-targeted Inp54p inhibited capping in T cells stimulated by cross-linking the T cell receptor, but without affecting the T cell receptor-dependent Ca2+ flux. Altogether, these results provide evidence of compartmentalization of PIP2-dependent signaling in cell membranes such as predicted by the membrane raft model.

The lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 2The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; DiIC16, 1,1′-dihexadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TCR, T cell receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PH, pleckstrin homology. is important for cell growth and viability (1Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar), exemplified by its role as the precursor for the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate (PIP3) (2Majerus P.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). PIP2 is also a cofactor for activation of select membrane proteins (4McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar); this includes proteins that function in tethering actin filaments to the plasma membrane, such as the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) proteins (5Ilani T. Khanna C. Zhou M. Veenstra T.D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the filamins (6Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Other PIP2-regulated membrane proteins include WASP and WAVE, which serve as effectors for the Rho GTPases in actin polymerization (7Takenawa T. Suetsugu S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Altogether, the properties of PIP2 in regulating actin-associated membrane proteins underlie its important role in establishing interactions between the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton (8Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The diverse and important functions of PIP2 underscore the importance of maintaining proper regulation of this lipid. As cell membranes are structurally heterogeneous (9Engelman D.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), spatially concentrating PIP2 in discrete domains could be one mechanism for regulating PIP2 functions. Notably, a significant pool of the PIP2 associates with the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction postulated to represent cholesterol-dependent membrane domains, or membrane “rafts” (10Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 11Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). As membrane rafts serve as “reaction vessels” in the plasma membrane (13Tian T. Harding A. Inder K. Plowman S. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), enrichment of PIP2 in rafts may augment PIP2-dependent pathways and production of second messengers. Alternatively, rafts may function in regulating PIP2 signaling by sequestering it from activators in steady-state conditions, such as evidenced with certain membrane-associated kinases (14Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Young R.M. Zheng X. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1230-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Membrane domains such as rafts are often below the resolution of light microscopy, making direct observation of these structures difficult. Accordingly, many of the properties of the rafts have been deciphered from measurements of DRMs. One shortcoming with this approach is that the detergents used to prepare the DRMs also perturb the physical properties of the bilayer. Accordingly, it has been suggested the detergent-insoluble membranes are an artifact of sample preparation and not representative of domains in intact membranes (16Heerklotz H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 17Heerklotz H. Szadkowska H. Anderson T. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies of rafts often utilize cholesterol-depleting agents such as methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and these compounds can cause nonspecific changes in membrane structure and function (16Heerklotz H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 17Heerklotz H. Szadkowska H. Anderson T. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Pizzo P. Giurisato E. Tassi M. Benedetti A. Pozzan T. Viola A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In one example, it was shown that treating cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin alters the membrane distribution of PIP2 and its availability to PIP2-binding proteins (19Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this property represents a cholesterol-dependent property of PIP2 functions or a nonspecific effect from the drug treatment. Notably, other data show that DRMs are in fact representative of discrete membrane domains (20Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). For example, imaging studies measuring the plasma membrane distribution of labeled proteins and lipids show a specific clustering of DRM-associated molecules. In one recent study, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we showed a specific cholesterol-dependent co-clustering of reporter molecules in the plasma membrane by membrane-anchoring signals that target fluorescent proteins to DRMs (21Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One example was the N-terminal membrane-anchoring signal of the Src family kinase Lck. However, an alternative membrane-anchoring signal from Src, which does not target molecules to DRMs, also did not cause a cholesterol-dependent clustering of fluorescent proteins. In total, results from imaging studies show that membrane rafts are heterogeneous in nature, ranging in size from nanoclusters that are on the order of a few nanometers in size to nanodomains that have a diameter of ∼50 nm and to micron-size macrodomains (22Rodgers W. Farris D. Mishra S. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 97-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Jacobson K. Mouritsen O.G. Anderson R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Imaging experiments have also shown colocalization of PIP2 with raft markers in both the plasma membrane and intracellular trafficking vesicles (24Parmryd I. Adler J. Patel R. Magee A.I. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Huang S. Lifshitz L. Patki-Kamath V. Tuft R. Fogarty K. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9102-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Golub T. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), thus consistent with the notion that PIP2 is enriched in rafts. Although both membrane fractionation experiments and imaging studies show that PIP2 is enriched in rafts, the biological significance of its raft association is poorly understood. A useful approach to measuring PIP2 functions in cells while avoiding chemical treatments is to alter membrane PIP2 levels using membrane-targeted PIP2-specific phosphatases (1Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). One example has been targeting the catalytic domain of the yeast PIP2-specific phosphatase Inp54p to the plasma membrane using the membrane-anchoring signal of the Src family kinase Lyn (Lyn-Inp54p) (8Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 28Wiradjaja F. Ooms L.M. Whisstock J.C. McColl B. Helfenbaum L. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7643-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Expression of membrane-anchored Inp54p has demonstrated a role for PIP2 in maintaining interactions between the plasma membrane and underlying actin cytoskeleton (8Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the membrane-anchoring signal of Lyn, which consists of myristoylation of an N-terminal glycine and palmitoylation of an adjacent cysteine, is also an effective raft-targeting sequence (29Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 30Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the discrete phenotypes evidenced by expression of Lyn-Inp54p may reflect changes specific to the raft-associated pool of PIP2. Using membrane-targeting sequences from separate Src family kinases to target Inp54p to cell membranes, we observed that raft- and nonraft-targeted Inp54p caused distinct changes in the membrane pools of PIP2 and cell phenotype. For example, enrichment of the raft pool of PIP2 by nonraft Inp54p increased membrane ruffling and cell spreading, and depletion of this pool by raft-targeted Inp54p inhibited the ruffling as well as capping in stimulated T cells. Altogether, our findings provide evidence of sequestering of PIP2-dependent functions between separate membrane fractions in a manner consistent with the membrane raft model but while avoiding artifacts associated with detergent treatments of cell membranes. Gene Construction and Expression—The Inp54p constructs each contained a minimal membrane-anchoring signal, followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) and finally the soluble domain of Inp54p (residues 1–331) that included its active site (see Fig. 1A). The membrane anchors were either the first 10 amino acids of Lck (L10) or the first 15 amino acids of c-Src (S15) (31Rodgers W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used for amplifying the DNA sequence encoding Inp54p: 5′-ACATCAGAATTCAACAACAACAACAACAAAACGAATTGGAAGGT (sense) and 5′-TCTAGTCTCGAGTTACGGCACTGGCGTCCCTGTAG (antisense). The L10-GFP and S15-GFP coding sequences were amplified from previously described genes (31Rodgers W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-ACATCAGCATCCAGAATGGGGAGCAAGAGCAA (S15, sense), 5′-ACATCACCGCGGAGAATGGGCTGTGTCTGCAGC (L10, sense), and 5′-GCTAGTAAGCTTCTTGTAACAGCTCGTCCAT (GFP, antisense). The underlined nucleotides identify the restriction sites for EcoRI, XhoI, BamHI, SacII, and HindIII, respectively, which were used for directional cloning in pLenti (Invitrogen). The genes were subcloned into pLenti and oriented for control of expression by a 5′-long terminal repeat. Cell Cultures and Transfections—Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotics. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with antibiotics. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. For gene expression, 293T cells were transfected by CaPO4 (Invitrogen) using 10 μg of plasmid DNA for a 50% confluent 6-cm plate. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation as described (32Jordan S. Rodgers W. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Following transfection, Jurkat cells were cultured in AIM V medium (Invitrogen) for 48 h and then harvested for experimentation. Membrane Fractionation—Approximately 107 cells were lysed by incubation at 4 °C for 20–30 min with 750 μl of 1% Triton X-100. Next, the samples were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (eight strokes) and centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm (Eppendorf Model 5417C, Brinkmann Instruments). The supernatant was collected, and the raft and nonraft membrane fractions were separated by equilibrium centrifugation using a discontinuous sucrose gradient (14Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated from the top. PIP2 Measurement—Phosphoinositide extraction was performed as described (33Pettitt T.R. Dove S.K. Lubben A. Calaminus S.D. Wakelam M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1588-1596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with minor adjustments. In brief, 3 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol/HCl (2:4:0.1) was added to the pooled gradient fractions corresponding to the raft (gradient fractions 2–4) (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 21Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and nonraft (gradient fractions 7–10) (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 21Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) membrane fractions. The samples were mixed vigorously for 30 s and then incubated on ice for 15 min. To induce a phase separation, 1 ml of ice-cold chloroform was added with 1 ml of 1.76% KCl, 100 mm citric acid, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate. Samples were mixed for 30 s and incubated on ice for 5 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g. After centrifugation, the organic phase (bottom) was collected, dried, and resuspended in a minimal volume (∼10 μl) of solvent (4:3:1 chloroform/methanol/water). Samples were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad dot blot vacuum manifold. PIP2 was detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, followed by a biotinylated secondary antibody. The final step was horseradish peroxidase conjugated to streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The membrane was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and detected with a Lumi-Imager F1 workstation (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Cell Labeling and Imaging—Imaging was performed using either a Zeiss LSM510 microscope or a Zeiss Axioplan 2i upright fluorescence microscope (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Cell Imaging Core Facility). The images were collected using a 100× oil objective (1.4 numerical aperture). Three-dimensional projection images were generated from confocal stacks that were collected by optically sectioning along the z axis at an interval of 0.24 μm. Before three-dimensional reconstruction, the confocal stacks were deconvolved using AutoDeblur (AutoQuant Imaging, Inc., Watervliet, NY). The projection images were produced using iVision (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA). All other image processing and quantitation were performed using iVision. For imaging of T cell capping, cells were stimulated using OKT3-coated polystyrene beads as described (34Rodgers W. Zavzavadjian J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, the samples were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. F-actin was labeled by incubation with 0.1 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30–45 min at 37 °C. Capping was quantitated by dividing the average fluorescence intensity of the plasma membrane in contact with the OKT3-coated bead by the average fluorescence intensity of the remaining plasma membrane. Cells were scored positive for capping if the ratio was 1.5 or greater. Histograms of relative fluorescence enrichment in the caps were prepared using IGOR Pro software (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Ca2+ Flux Measurements—For detection of Ca2+ during stimulation, Jurkat T cells were labeled by incubation for 30 min in 2 μm Indo-1 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Following labeling, the cells were suspended in 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. The Ca2+ flux was measured by flow cytometry (MOFLO, DakoCytomation, Fort Collins, CO) based on the change in the fluorescence emission at 475 and 400 nm. Excitation for Indo-1 was at 390 nm. To limit the measurements to transfected cells, the samples were gated on those expressing GFP. GFP was detected using 488 nm excitation with a green band-pass filter centered at 530 nm for emission. The temperature of the instrument was maintained at 37 °C, and the flow rate was maintained by a base sheath pressure of 60 ± 1 p.s.i. A base line was achieved by passing the cells for ∼1 min prior to addition of OKT3. After the OKT3-dependent flux was complete, ionomycin was added to determine the maximal flux capacity of the cells. Store-operated channel Ca2+ flux was measured in the same manner as the total flux, except the buffer contained 0.05 μm EGTA rather than CaCl2. Following the initial flux from release of intracellular stores, Ca2+ (1 mm stock) was added back to the sample to a final concentration of 10 mm. Membrane Raft- and Nonraft-targeted Inp54p Molecules Cause Distinct Changes in PIP2 Membrane Pools—The membrane-targeted Inp54p molecules used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1A. Specifically, we targeted Inp54p to cell membranes using either the N-terminal 10 residues of Lck (L10) or the N-terminal 15 residues of Src (S15). We have described the L10 and S15 membrane-anchoring signals previously (31Rodgers W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and showed that the L10 sequence efficiently targets peptides to the DRM raft fraction and that the S15 sequence limits peptides to the detergent-soluble nonraft fraction. As a control to identify changes in the PIP2 pools and cell phenotype that were specific to the phosphatase activity, we expressed a third construct containing the L10 anchor and GFP but no Inp54p (L10-GFP). To determine the effect of the targeted Inp54p molecules on the raft and nonraft pools of PIP2, we measured the PIP2 present in each membrane fraction after expressing L10-Inp54p, S15-Inp54p, or L10-GFP. For this experiment, we extracted the lipids of the raft and nonraft fractions following separation of the membrane fractions by sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation (see “Materials and Methods”). In Fig. 1B is an immunoblot measuring the PIP2 present in each membrane fraction of transfected cells, and in Fig. 1C are the results from quantitating the blot. These data show that expression of L10-Inp54p decreased the raft-associated pool of PIP2, whereas S15-Inp54p both increased the amount of raft PIP2 and decreased the PIP2 in the nonraft fraction. Furthermore, the changes in raft and nonraft PIP2 by S15-Inp54p were specific to the Inp54p domain because expression of a GFP molecule containing the S15 anchor alone (S15-GFP) demonstrated similar levels of PIP2 in each fraction as L10-GFP (Fig. 1, D and E). By averaging the results from several trials, we determined that L10-Inp54p decreased by 10% the fraction of total PIP2 that was raft-associated, whereas S15-Inp54p increased this ratio by 2-fold (Fig. 1E). Notably, neither Inp54p construct caused a statistically significant change in the total PIP2 levels of the cells (Fig. 1F). T Cells Demonstrate Distinct Morphologies and Cell Spreading Based on Targeted Inp54p Expression—In T cells, PIP2 and its effectors are necessary for cell activation (35Penninger J.M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Acuto O. Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 37Villalba M. Bi K. Rodriguez F. Tanaka Y. Schoenberger S. Altman A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To determine whether raft and nonraft pools of PIP2 in T cells are functionally distinct, we measured Jurkat T cells expressing L10-Inp54p, S15-Inp54p, or control L10-GFP. Interestingly, we observed distinct morphologies from expression of the separate Inp54p molecules (Fig. 2A). For example, T cells that expressed raft-targeted L10-Inp54p (Fig. 2A, left panel) often exhibited a smooth morphology that was void of the membrane ruffles and filopodia that occurred in control cells that expressed L10-GFP (right panel). We also observed membrane blebs in the L10-Inp54p samples (Fig. 2C), similar to those described for cells expressing Lyn-Inp54p (8Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The blebs represent regions of the plasma membrane that bubble outward and can be due to poor association of the membrane with the underlying actin cytoskeleton (38Charras G.T. Hu C.K. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In contrast to L10-Inp54p, T cells that expressed S15-Inp54p exhibited a striking morphology that contained numerous filopodia and extensive membrane folding compared with that of the control samples (Fig. 2A, middle panel). We quantitated the effects of each Inp54p construct on cell morphology by counting the number of filopodia in T cells expressing either L10-Inp54p or S15-Inp54p. As controls, we expressed either L10-GFP or S15-GFP. These measurements showed an increase in filopodial number upon S15-Inp54p expression, whereas L10-Inp54p caused a decrease in filopodial number relative to the control samples (Fig. 2B). The increase in cell filopodia upon S15-Inp54p expression coincided with an increase in raft-associated PIP2 (Fig. 1), suggesting that the filopodia may contain raft-enriched membrane. To test this hypothesis, we stained T cells expressing S15-Inp54p with biotinylated cholera toxin B subunit and secondary streptavidin conjugated to Texas Red. In Fig. 2D is an example showing labeling of filopodia by Texas Red-conjugated cholera toxin. Interestingly, we often noted that Texas Red-conjugated cholera toxin appeared as puncta localized along the processes, suggestive of rafts localized on the filopodia. We also detected staining of the filopodia with the raft marker DiIC16 (Fig. 2E), although in this case, the labeling was not enriched in puncta. Furthermore, in some cases, we observed efficient labeling of filopodia by DiIC16 that were barely detectable with the S15-Inp54p label (Fig. 2E, white arrowheads). This finding is again suggestive of enrichment of raft membranes in the cell processes. We conclude from these data that the filopodia in cells that expressed S15-Inp54p contained membrane rafts, and this may reflect enrichment of PIP2 in membrane rafts upon S15-Inp54p expression. S15-Inp54p-dependent Changes in Cell Morphology Are Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)-dependent—An important effector of PIP2 signaling in membrane-actin interactions is the PI3K product PIP3 (3Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). To determine whether the T cell morphology upon S15-Inp54p expression was PIP3-dependent, we measured cells expressing S15-Inp54p and treated with wortmannin. Cell imaging showed that wortmannin inhibited the membrane ruffling and filopodia that occurred in the untreated cells (Fig. 3A), and quantitation showed that wortmannin reduced the average number of filopodia by 10-fold (Fig. 3B). We also observed that washing away the wortmannin following drug treatment resulted in a return of the membrane ruffling and filopodia 2 h later (Fig. 3A, right panel), albeit not to the number measured in untreated cells (Fig. 3B). We interpret these data as evidence that the cell morphologies that occurred upon S15-Inp54p expression were PI3K-dependent. Altered Cell Spreading by Targeted Inp54p Expression—Cell spreading occurs by activation of surface adhesion molecules, many of which are PIP2-dependent (39Caroni P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4332-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed in T cells expressing S15-Inp54p an increase in cell spreading on poly-l-lysine, often represented by an extension of a thin sheet of membrane from the cell body (Fig. 4A, arrowheads). We quantitated the cell spreading by measuring the area of the cell where it contacted the substratum, and this showed that S15-Inp54p caused a 2–3-fold increase in the cell area over that of cells expressing either L10-GFP or L10-Inp54p. Furthermore, wortmannin inhibited the S15-Inp54p-dependent spreading (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the increased spreading from S15-Inp54p expression was also a PI3K-dependent property. Raft-targeted Inp54p Inhibits T Cell Capping following Stimulation—T cells stimulated by cross-linking the T cell receptor (TCR) generate actin-rich membrane caps at the site of receptor cross-linking (40Roelants G. Forni L. Pernis B. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 1060-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the membrane-targeted Inp54p molecules on membrane capping, transfected T cells were stimulated using 6-μm polystyrene beads coated with an antibody specific to human CD3 (OKT3). To detect the capping, samples were fixed and stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin and measured by confocal microscopy. In Fig. 5A are representative images of bead-cell conjugates that show an inhibition of capping by L10-Inp54p expression. For example, the cells that expressed either S15-Inp54p or control L10-GFP exhibited a 2–3-fold enrichment of F-actin at the bead-cell interface, but the cells that expressed L10-Inp54p demonstrated no such capping. Furthermore, pretreating cells expressing L10-GFP with neomycin to sequester PIP2 (41Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys.

IntroductionThe biological membrane at its simplest is a lipid bilayer that divides cellular contents from the exterior medium. Yet the bilayer performs more than a simple barrier function as it plays host to a wide variety of integral membrane proteins that perform transport, sensing, motility, biosynthesis, energy generation (in the form of ATP), as well as energy harvesting in the case of phototrophic organisms. We have structural information about the membrane proteins involved in photosynthesis, e.g. the bacterial reaction center (1Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the peripheral light-harvesting complex (2McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J.

However, there is a need now to gain information upon the organization of these proteins within the membrane in vivo. The use of AFM 2The abbreviations used are: AFM, atomic force microscopy; RC, reaction center; LH, light harvesting; WT, wild type; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; β-DDM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside. to directly visualize membrane proteins in situ allows us to make precise measurements of the disposition of any protein within the membrane (8Muller D.J. Engel A. Matthey U. Meier T. Dimroth P. Suda K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) under nearly native conditions. We have demonstrated that the comparatively disordered intracytoplasmic membrane from the model photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides can be successfully imaged by AFM (9Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. van der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Otto C. Hunter C.N.

Scheuring and co-workers have also produced high resolution images of the photosynthetic membranes of Blastochloris viridis (10Scheuring S. Seguin J. Marco S. Levy D. Robert B. Rigaud J.L. Proc.

Niederman R.A. Photosyn. Res. 2008; 95: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).It has been observed by Scheuring and Sturgis (15Scheuring S. Sturgis J.N. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 3707-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the presence of RC-LH1 core complexes affects the packing of the peripheral, LH2, complexes in native membranes of R. photometricum. The availability of a wide array of genetic tools for R. sphaeroides (16Jones M.R. Fowler G.J.S. Gibson L.C.D. Grief G.G. Olsen J.D. Crielaard W. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) can be exploited for AFM studies of membrane organization, because it allows control to be exerted over the composition of the proteins present in the membrane. Mutants of R. sphaeroides, which form highly ordered tubular membranes containing only RC-LH1-PufX dimers, have been used to study the organization of complexes by electron microscopy (17Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and similar techniques have been applied to photosynthetic proteins reconstituted into two-dimensional crystals (19Walz T.

Biol. 2003; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, because the purification process removes the native lipids, and, in the case of R. sphaeroides, reconstitutes the complexes in an alternating, and therefore nonbiological, “up-down-up” topology, such work is unsuitable for examining the native organization of the complexes.In this paper we present data on membranes of a R. sphaeroides deletion strain that contain only the peripheral light-harvesting complex, LH2, thus eliminating the core complex and its effect upon long range membrane protein packing in the membrane. This simple system can be used as a model for studying the packing of integral membrane proteins in a curved membrane. The R. sphaeroides WT photosynthetic membrane is curved into spherical intracytoplasmic vesicles by the LH2 and RC-LH1-PufX complexes embedded within it (22Hunter C.N. Pennoyer J.D. Sturgis J.N. Farrelly D. Niederman R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3459-3467Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Qian P. Bullough P. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14002-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has not been possible to image the LH complexes in such highly curved, ∼60-nm diameter (24Lommen M.A. Takemoto J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 730-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), flexible membranes, and limited exposure to a mild detergent is utilized to generate opened vesicles that flatten when they are adsorbed onto mica for AFM imaging (9Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. van der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Otto C. Hunter C.N. Nature. 2004; 430: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The lateral dimensions of these patches vary from 50 to 120 nm and present a challenge to image at high resolution; early attempts to use contact mode AFM resulted in displacement of the patches from the mica. The use of tapping mode AFM at low amplitudes has allowed us to image large numbers of patches to locate examples that are well adsorbed and sufficiently flat for collection of high resolution data. The adsorption process leads to the regular vertical displacement of the LH2 molecules within the membrane patches such that they form a series of “zigzag” corrugations. Quantification of these displacements by AFM reveals that the corrugations in the newly flattened membrane arise from the vertical displacement of ∼1 nm of the LH2 complexes in the upper versus the lower lines. An intriguing observation is that within these zigzag corrugations pairs of LH2 complexes are apparent, suggesting a close association possibly involving maximal protein-to-protein contacts at the mutual interface. The average center-to-center distance between LH2 complexes in the membrane patches is 8.5 nm, and the average angle subtended by three complexes is 112°, consistent with a hexagonal organization.Recently there has been a substantive effort to construct detailed structural models of the intracytoplasmic membrane vesicles of R. sphaeroides as prototypes of membrane protein organization, both for the wild type membrane (25Sener M.K. Olsen J.D. Hunter C.N. Schulten K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 104: 15273-15278Google Scholar) and for an LH2-minus mutant that assembles tubular membranes formed from helical arrays of RC-LH1-PufX core dimers (23Qian P. Bullough P. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14002-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The AFM data in the present work show that a typical flattened membrane patch is likely to be the product of a single intracytoplasmic vesicle of between 47 and 60 nm in diameter, containing between 100 and 160 LH2 complexes. From these data we have constructed a model of the organization of the LH2 complexes within the native curved membrane that is consistent with the known excitation energy transfer times and that could have implications for quinone diffusion through the native membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe R. sphaeroides deletion strain DPF2G (16Jones M.R.

Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and further treated with the detergent β-DDM (Glycon Biochemistry, GmbH Biotechnology, Germany), at 0.005 and 0.01% (w/v) concentration, following the protocol of Bahatyrova et al. (9Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. Olsen J.D. van der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Otto C. Hunter C.N. Nature. 2004; 430: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The membrane patches were adsorbed onto freshly cleaved mica (Agar Scientific) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NiCl2 for an hour at room temperature. The sample was then washed twice with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl recording buffer. Standard Olympus TR800PSA SiN cantilevers (Atomic Force GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), spring constant 0.15 n/m were used in a standard tapping mode liquid cell at operating frequencies of ∼8.5 KHz, using a Nanoscope IV AFM and E scanner (VEECO). The images were recorded at scan frequencies of 0.5–1 Hz.The images were processed using the software supplied with the microscope (VEECO) and SPIP (Image Metrology). All of the distances, angles, and areas were measured using ImageJ (open source software). The model vesicle was prepared using Chimera (27Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26778) Google Scholar) (open source software).RESULTSGeneral Vesicle Morphology—Previous work to obtain high resolution AFM images of native membranes of R. sphaeroides used the mild detergent β-DDM; however, for the membranes of the deletion strain DPF2G, we attempted to record data on nondetergent-treated membranes as well as those prepared by existing methodologies. We observed that areas of empty lipid, designated on the basis of their height, were present in both the nondetergent-prepared membrane patches and those at 0.005 and 0.01% β-DDM. In the nondetergent preparations the empty lipid patches can be seen occurring randomly in the images and occasionally appear to be associated with vesicles. Qualitatively there did not seem to be much difference in the occurrence of regions of empty lipid in the 0.005 and 0.01% samples (see supplemental data).The intact spherical vesicles generated by disruption in a French pressure cell, but not treated with β-DDM, do not adhere strongly to the mica surface because of the limited surface-to-surface contact zone. However, using low tapping amplitudes and slow scan rates, we have been able to gain an estimate of the size range of membrane vesicles and record images showing a limited amount of surface detail (Fig. 1). The DPF2G vesicles collapse onto the mica surface and flatten to a greater extent than the WT vesicles (32.1 ± 8.4 nm and 37.5 ± 4.1 nm high, respectively). An extreme example of this tendency to deform is shown in Fig. 1B, which illustrates a collapsed vesicle with a deep central depression. At its lowest point this vesicle is only ∼10 nm thick, which would equate to the height of two closely appressed lipid bilayers containing LH2 complexes. This level of deformation, which was not observed for WT vesicles, indicates that the LH2-only membranes are more flexible than WT membranes comprising both the RC-LH1-PufX and LH2 complexes.The most gentle detergent treatment, 0.005% β-DDM, did not result in any patches of membrane that could be imaged to high resolution; moreover, the presence of large intact vesicles suggests that there was insufficient detergent present to open them out. In consequence only images of the 0.01% β-DDM-treated samples are shown in this work. It should be noted that although the vesicles were treated with 0.01% β-DDM, the final concentration of detergent was 0.001% or lower because the samples were always diluted with nondetergent buffer by a minimum of 1:10 prior to adsorption onto the mica surface.Composition and Morphology of Membrane Patches Containing Only LH2 Complexes—The first noteworthy feature of the AFM images of the membrane patches is that not all of them lie completely flat upon the mica surface, and some display significant curvature, similar to the native nearly spherical condition (Fig. 2). Sections 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 illustrate the varying degrees of membrane patch curvature; section 1 is taken across a flat piece of membrane, whereas section 2 is across a highly curved patch that causes the AFM difficulty in tracking the surface topology. The flat patch in the image was chosen as a possible flattened vesicle. The program ImageJ (open source software) was used to measure the total area within the selected patch; this was found to be 9045 nm2, which equates to a vesicle diameter of 54 nm, in good agreement with the dimensions of WT intracytoplasmic membrane vesicles (also known as chromatophores) of 64 ± 16 nm, measured by dynamic light scattering (28Timpmann K. Woodbury N.W. Freiberg A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 9769-9771Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In other images where the membrane patches have also effectively flattened out onto the mica, it is possible to estimate the number of vertically translated LH2 complexes and thus assess the number in the original vesicle. A total of nine patches was examined where a reasonable estimate of the number of LH2 complexes could be made. In Fig. 3, each patch is distinguished from the others by the orientation of the zigzag lines of LH2 complexes; one example is outlined. For each patch the total area was measured, and the area that could be accounted for solely by LH2 complexes was estimated, based upon a diameter of 8 nm for the LH2 complex from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila (2McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2475) Google Scholar). The data, summarized in Table 1, show that the average vesicle surface area was 9065 nm2, corresponding to an average vesicle diameter of 53 nm, of which only 6729 nm2 could be accounted for by the 134 LH2 complexes present. The difference between these two figures is ∼26% of the total surface area of the vesicle and is likely to represent the lipid surface area, not including the lipid sequestered inside the LH2 rings.FIGURE 2Height and amplitude AFM topographs of flattened membrane patches. A, a height image of three membrane pieces. Section 1 shows that the upper left patch is essentially flat and well adsorbed to the mica with the contours of LH2 complexes defined in the trace, whereas section 2 across the lower patch has significantly more vertical topology yet still demonstrates the zigzag lines of complexes, which are clear in the amplitude image (B).

This visual assignment of dimers was tested by measuring the center-to-center distance of a representative pool of complexes in two different membrane pieces; the results are summarized in Table 2. These data show that LH2 complexes within a pair are closer together than they are to adjacent complexes, having center-to-center distances of 7.7 ± 0.5 nm (n = 22) and 9.2 ± 0.4 nm (n = 23), respectively. Based upon the R. acidophila LH2 structure, the shorter of these two distances can be accommodated if the two complexes pack closely together. It seems likely that in these adsorbed membranes there is protein-to-protein contact between the LH2 complexes in a dimer but that there is lipid between the adjacent LH2 complexes between dimers. The average angle subtended by the dimers in the zigzags is 112.1 ± 7.0° (n = 20) (Fig. 5D), which is consistent with a hexagonal packing, rather than a cubic packing arrangement, which has been observed in reconstituted two-dimensional crystals of LH2 (19Walz T.

An additional feature of the paired LH2 complexes is that they are tilted with respect to each other in a variety of orientations, which is likely to reflect steric imperatives in the interfacial packing zone.FIGURE 4High resolution AFM topographs showing highly ordered zigzag lines of LH2 complexes.

The LH2 complex is depicted as a smooth cylinder for the sake of clarity, but it is widely accepted that the R. sphaeroides LH2 causes membrane curvature because of its shape. This may be due to an effectively conical profile of the complex or the complex plus bound lipids having a conical shape. A, initial adsorption can only take place at the rim of the membrane; this binding effectively sets the maximum horizontal surface area that the membrane can occupy once flattened. B, more of the membrane adsorbs onto the surface, thus increasing the pressure within the remainder, which squeezes the lipids from between the LH2 complexes allowing limited contact of the complexes. In a hexagonally packed organization the 9-fold symmetric LH2 complexes will preferentially “contact” two of their six neighbors; ramification of this selective contact across the membrane patch causes the formation of the zigzag lines. Further compression of the membrane pushes the rows up and down to pack them more closely together. C, as the hydrophobic core becomes partially exposed by the vertical displacement the LH2 complexes form dimers in close protein-to-protein contact, tilting to pack the interface as close as possible. The lipids will flow around the complexes to fill any voids opened by the displacements of the complexes. Light gray circles are the raised complexes, and the dark gray circles are the complexes that are lower and most likely in contact with the mica surface. D, the flattening process is completed, but the patch is rarely totally flat when it is imaged, which is likely to reflect local disorder in the membrane when irregularly packed LH2 complexes are forced into a roughly hexagonal packing order. The final packing order in C is seen in the three-dimensional representation of AFM data, which illustrates the close packed dimers and the angle subtended by the complexes in the zigzag lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The organized zigzag lines that appear upon adsorption onto mica are also seen in the topograph in Fig. 4B that was acquired from a patch of WT photosynthetic membrane prepared without any detergent. The LH2-rich area (boxed in Fig. 4B) displays the same zigzag architecture as occurs in the LH2-only membrane patches. These patterns were analyzed for their center-to-center distance (7.8 ± 0.5 nm; n = 11) and angle subtended by three complexes (119 ± 8.7°; n = 12). The images were not sufficiently well resolved to assign distances to intra- or interdimer; thus the 7.8 nm represents the average of these two distances.DISCUSSIONGeneral Vesicle Morphology—The presence of empty areas of lipid in the AFM images, whether as isolated patches or intimately associated with LH2-containing membrane patches, appears to be a normal phenomenon because we have observed them in preparations of membranes that were never exposed to detergent as well as those treated with β-DDM (see supplemental data).

We have now studied mice depleted of PPARγ within the pancreas (PANC PPARγ-/-) created by a Cre/loxP recombinase system, with Cre driven by the pdx-1 promoter. Male PANC PPARγ-/- mice were hyperglycemic at 8 weeks of age (8.1 ± 0.2 mm versus 6.4 ± 0.3 mm, p = 0.009) with islet cytoarchitecture and pancreatic mass of islet β-cells that were indistinguishable from the controls. Islet PDX-1 mRNA (p = 0.001) and protein levels (p = 0.003) were lowered 60 and 40%, respectively, in tandem with impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion and loss of thiazolidinedione-induced increase in PDX-1 expression. We next identified a putative PPAR-response element (PPRE) in the mouse pdx-1 promoter with substantial homology to the corresponding region of the human PDX-1 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays with nuclear extracts from β-cell lines and mouse islets, also in vitro translated PPARγ and retinoid X receptor, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated specific binding of PPARγ and retinoid X receptor to the human and mouse pdx-1 × PPREs. Transient transfection assays of β-cells with reporter constructs of mutated PPREs showed dramatically reduced pdx-1 promoter activity. In summary, we have presented in vivo and in vitro evidence showing PPARγ regulation of pdx-1 transcription in β-cells, plus our results support an important regulatory role for PPARγ in β-cell physiology and thiazolidinedione pharmacology of type 2 diabetes.

PPARγ regulates transcriptional activity of target genes by forming a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and binding to a specific PPARγ response element sequence (PPRE) within the promoter region (5Kliewer S.A.

The PPRE consists of two hexamer repeats (DR1 and DR2) separated by a single nucleotide, with PPARγ and RXR occupying the 5′- and 3′-half-sites, respectively (7Ijpenberg A. Jeannin E. Wahli W.

Thiazolidinediones are PPARγ agonists used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes based on insulin-sensitizing effects in adipose tissue and muscle (9Yki-Jarvinen H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 1106-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). However, a recent finding is PPARγ-mediated anti-proliferation and pro-survival of islet β-cells (10Ohtani K.I. Shimizu H. Sato N. Mori M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Rosen E.D. Kulkarni R.N. Sarraf P. Ozcan U. Okada T. Hsu G.H. Eisenman D. Magnuson M.A. Gonzalez F.J.

Med. 2006; 355: 2427-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) have usually been interpreted that the insulin sensitization effect unloads overstimulated insulin secretion, so-called “β-cell rest.” On the other hand, the possibility of direct PPARγ regulatory effects in islet β-cells is controversial, as a β-cell-specific PPARγ knock-out mouse was normoglycemic basally and after fat feeding (11Rosen E.D. Kulkarni R.N. Sarraf P. Ozcan U. Okada T. Hsu G.H. Eisenman D. Magnuson M.A. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7222-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Also little is known about PPARγ target genes in β-cells. PPARγ regulates the function and survival of tissues by acting through a triad of effects as follows: anti-proliferation, prosurvival, and pro-differentiation (18Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Because PPARγ-mediated pro-survival and anti-proliferation had been reported for β-cells (10Ohtani K.I. Shimizu H. Sato N. Mori M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Rosen E.D. Kulkarni R.N. Sarraf P. Ozcan U. Okada T. Hsu G.H. Eisenman D. Magnuson M.A. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R.

Our group has studied a model of β-cell adaptation to a loss of β-cell mass, 60% pancreatectomy (Px) Sprague-Dawley rats. They are normoglycemic because of partial β-cell regeneration during the 1st week post-Px (19Liu Y.Q. Montanya E. Leahy J.L. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Jetton T.L. Liu Y.Q. Trotman W.E. Nevin P.W. Sun X.-J. Leahy J.L.

J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E68-E73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the transition phase, 14 days post-Px, to determine how these events are coordinated, and we found increased nuclear PPARγ expression in isolated islets at mRNA and protein levels (22Moibi J.A. Gupta D. Jetton T.L. Peshavaria M. Desai R. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We also noted increased nuclear expression of pancreatic duodenal homeobox (PDX)-1 that is an essential regulator of the function and survival of mature β-cells (23Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L.

We then studied INS-1 β-cells following RNAi-induced 75% knockdown of PPARγ, finding PDX-1 mRNA and protein levels were lowered 80 and 60%, respectively. Based on these collective results, we proposed that pdx-1 is a physiologically regulated target gene for PPARγ in β-cells (22Moibi J.A. Gupta D. Jetton T.L. Peshavaria M. Desai R. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We now set out to verify these findings in vivo by studying mice with a pancreas-specific ablation of PPARγ based on a Cre/loxP recombinase system with Cre driven by the pdx-1 promoter (29Ivashchenko C.Y. Duan S.Z. Usher M.G. Mortensen R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: G319-G326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our findings confirmed the expected reduction of PDX-1 expression in isolated islets. Moreover, these mice were characterized by glucose intolerance, impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, and loss of the pharmacological effect of thiazolidinediones to up-regulate PDX-1 expression. In addition, we have identified and characterized a novel functional PPRE within the mouse and human pdx-1 promoter regions. Animal Studies—Mice with PPARγ deficiency restricted to pancreatic islets, ducts, and acini (PANC PPARγ-/-) were generated from crossing pdx-1-Cre mice (original source D. A. Melton, described in Ref. 30Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mice with two floxed PPARγ alleles as detailed previously (29Ivashchenko C.Y. Duan S.Z. Usher M.G. Mortensen R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: G319-G326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Controls were littermate Cre negative PPARγ floxed mice. All protocols were in accordance with the principles of laboratory animal care and were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Vermont. At 8 weeks of age, tail vein blood sampling for blood glucose (Freestyle glucose monitor) was performed from nonanesthetized normally fed mice. Some animals underwent an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test that consisted of an intraperitoneal injection of 2 g/kg glucose with blood glucose measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Islets were isolated by pancreas duct infiltration with collagenase, Histopaque gradient separation, and hand picking. Tissue Immunoblots for PPARγ—Mouse tissues (liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, hypothalamus, heart, small intestine, and islets) were homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sucrose, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium EGTA, 2 mm sodium EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cell culture (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein aliquots (60 μg) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) that were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal PPARγ antibody (Chemicon) and then with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was by chemiluminescence using HyperFilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped and reprobed to establish equivalent loading using anti-β-actin (Sigma). Pancreas Histology and Morphometrics—Pancreata were rapidly excised, cleared of fat and lymph nodes, and blotted before immersion-fixing overnight in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mm phosphate buffer at 4 °C. After washing in several changes of phosphate-buffered saline, tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Pancreas sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in antibody mixtures of sheep anti-amylase (Biogenesis), guinea pig anti-insulin (Linco), and rabbit anti-glucagon (Linco). β-Cell mass was quantified using a computerized planimetric method and β-cell proliferation frequency using Ki-67 as the cell cycle marker, using methods detailed previously (31Jetton T.L. Lausier J. LaRock K. Trotman W.E. Larmie B. Habibovic A. Peshavaria M. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2294-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Islet Insulin Secretion—Freshly isolated islets were incubated 1 h in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 11.1 mm glucose, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Duplicate batches of 15–25 islets were preincubated in 12-well plates for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium at 2.8 mm glucose and then 1 h in KRBH plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.8 mm glucose. Insulin secretion was assessed during a subsequent 1-h incubation in KRBH, 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose at 37 °C, followed by ultrasensitive mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia) of the medium. Islet insulin content was measured after acid-ethanol (0.2 mm HCl in 75% ethanol) extraction, and the insulin secretion results were normalized to the total insulin content. Islet Culture with Troglitazone—Isolated islets were incubated in culture media supplemented with 10 μm troglitazone or vehicle (DMSO) for 72 h with the media changed each 24 h. After the incubation period, islets were lysed and immunoblots were performed (20 μg) using the technique described above, with rabbit anti-PDX-1 (Chris Wright, Vanderbilt University) followed by reprobing with anti-β-actin (Sigma). Islet PCR and Immunoblots—Islet total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro kit plus single step on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). cDNAs were synthesized using 500 ng of extracted RNA with ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega), dNTPs, and random hexamer primers. PCR analyses were carried out in a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research) using the cDNAs together with TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) and primer combinations (sequences available on request). The thermal cycle program was denaturing step at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles for PPARγ, PPARα, and glucagon or 25 cycles for PDX-1, GLUT2, INS-1, and INS-2, at 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, with extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. α-Tubulin and cyclophilin A were used as internal controls. Gel images were captured using the Gel Doc EQ documentation system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), with the results expressed relative to the control genes. PDX-1 and β-actin immunoblots were performed as detailed previously. Immunoblot and PCR results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from three pairs of littermate floxed control and PANC PPARγ-/- mice. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Tissue Culture—INS-1 (832/13) cells (gift from Christopher Newgard, Duke University) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 8.3 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm l-glutamine, 50 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. βTC6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.15% sodium bicarbonate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from INS-1 cells, mouse islets, and βTC6 cells were prepared using the NucBuster kit (Novagen). In vitro transcription/translation of PPARγ (plasmid pcDNA-PPARγ, Addgene) and retinoid X receptor-α (RXR-α, plasmid pSVsport-RXR-α, Addgene) was performed using the T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase-specific TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation kits (Promega), respectively. PAGE purified oligos against the mouse pdx-1 × PPRE (FW 5′-AGCTGAGGCAGGGTACCTCCAGTATCA-3′; REV 5′-GATCTGATACTGGAGGTACCCTGCCTC-3′), human PDX-1 × PPRE (FW 5′-AGCTGCCGGCAAGGACCTCCAGTATCA-3′; REV 5′-GATCTGATACTGGAGGTCCTTGCCGGC-3′), and acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE (FW 5′-CCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCC-3′; REV 5′-AGCTGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTT-3′) were synthesized (IDT), annealed, labeled by end-filling with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Science), and purified using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). DNA binding reaction was performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing EMSA buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and 500 ng of solicited salmon sperm DNA, 0.01 unit of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of nuclear extract, 60,000 cpm of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ds probe, and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Overnight cast 6% nondenaturing DNA retardation gels (29:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide) were pre-run for 30 min in EMSA running buffer in 0.5 m Tris, then loaded with reaction mixture (18 μl of DNA·protein complex mix, 2 μl of 6× DNA loading dye), and samples separated by electrophoresis for 2.5 h at 100 V. For competition studies, DNA binding reaction mixtures were preincubated with unlabeled ds DNA oligos of the mouse wild type pdx-1 × PPRE or mutant sequences (Mut 1, FW 5′-AGCTGAGGCAGGGTACCTAAAATATCA-3′; REV 5′-GATCTGATATTTTAGGTACCCTGCCTC-3′; Mut 2, FW 5′-AGCTGAGGCAAAATAACTCCAGTATCA-3′; REV 5′-GATCTGATACTGGAGTTATTTTGCCTC-3′; Mut 3, FW 5′-AGCTGAGGCAAAATAACTAAAATATCA-3′; REV 5′-GATCTGATATTTTAGTTATTTTGCCTC-3′). Alternatively, unlabeled acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE was used to compete with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ds mouse wild type pdx-1 × PPRE probe. For supershift gel retardation assay, binding reactions were followed by addition of PPARγ-specific antibody (Biomol) for another 20 min before resolving the DNA·protein complex on a nondenaturing gel. When in vitro translated PPARγ/RXR-α proteins (2.5 μl) were used, binding reactions were preincubated with PPARγ, pan-RXR, or RXR-α antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice followed by 30 min of room temperature incubation after addition of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ds PPRE probes for mouse pdx-1, human PDX-1, or acyl-CoA oxidase PPREs. Site-directed Mutagenesis—One-kb mouse pdx-1 promoter sequence (-2916 to −1920) containing the putative PPARγ-binding site (-2720 to −2708) was subcloned in pTAL luciferase reporter gene vector (Clontech). Mutation of the wild type pdx-1 fragment was carried out using QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, using PAGE-purified mutagenic primer pairs: SDM-1 FW 5′-GGA AGA GAG GCA GGG TAC CTA AAA TAT CAG GGA GGA CTA TCA G-3′; SDM-1 REV 5′-CTG ATA GTC CTC CCT GAT ATT TTA GGT ACC CTG CCT CTC TTC C-3′; SDM-2 FW 5′-GGA AGA GAG GCA AAA TAA CTC CAG TAT CAG GGA GGA CTA TCA G-3′; SDM-2 REV 5′-CTG ATA GTC CTC CCT GAT ACT GGA GTT ATT TTG CCT CTC TTC C-3′, and pTAL × PPRE × pdx promoter plasmid as template, PCR was performed with the following cycles: 95 °C for 1 min; 18 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 6 min. Parental DNA was digested using DpnI (10 units). XL10 gold ultracompetent cells were transformed with the mutagenic PCR product, and after plasmid preparation, incorporation of the mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing (University of Vermont, DNA core facility). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed with mouse-derived βTC6 cells using ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif). Cells were fixed using formaldehyde solution, and the chromatin was sheared by enzymatic digestion according to the instruction manual to DNA fragments that averaged 300–500 bp in length. Mouse monoclonal antibody against PPARγ (E8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to aliquots of precleared chromatin and incubated overnight, with parallel samples incubated with the negative-control IgG provided with the kit. Protein G-agarose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After reversing the cross-links, DNA was isolated, and PCRs were performed with primers for the mouse pdx-1 promoter region PPRE (GenBank™ accession number AF192495). Primer sequences were as follows: FW 5′-ACACACTCACTCACTCACTCATTGGG-3′; REV 5′-CTGAGATACCCAGCCATTAGGCAAGA-3′ (expected PCR product 312 bp). A second primer pair was as follows: FW 5′-CAATCTAGTCCAAACCAGCCTTTGGC-3′; REV 5′-TGAGATACCCAGCCATTAGGCAAGAG-3′ (expected PCR product 265 bp). As negative control, a primer pair (FW 5′-GCGCTGAGTTCTGCAAGCATTTCT-3′; REV 5′-CGCGAACACCTGCACTTGTTTCAA-3′) was selected that amplified a stretch of 450 bp of DNA 2.56 kb downstream of the mouse pdx-1 × PPRE. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min, 39 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min. A mouse-specific positive control for appropriate shearing of DNA and co-immunoprecipitation was performed using a kit (Active Motif) based on binding of transcription factor EFI-α by anti-RNA pol II. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—80–90% confluent INS-1 cells in a 6-well format were incubated overnight in antibiotic-free media. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of pTAL empty vector (firefly luciferase vector) or equivalent wild type or mutated pTAL × PPRE pdx-1 promoter vector. Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega) was included (0.05 μg) in all transfections as internal control. Twenty four h post-transfection, cells were incubated another 24 h with 10 μm troglitazone or DMSO, and the luciferase assay performed in a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turners Design) using dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla luciferase and expressed as relative luciferase activity. Each experimental condition was performed in triplicate with the results calculated as relative (%) luciferase value of the wild type PPRE controls. PANC PPARγ-/- Mice—We studied mice with PPARγ deficiency within the pancreas created by a Cre/loxP recombinase system, with Cre driven by the pdx-1 promoter (29Ivashchenko C.Y. Duan S.Z. Usher M.G. Mortensen R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: G319-G326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PDX-1 is highly expressed in all pancreatic epithelial cells during embryogenesis, with continued high expression in β-cells postnatally as opposed to a marked reduction in other pancreatic tissues (32Gannon M. Herrera P.-L. Wright C.V.E. Genesis. 2000; 26: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the pdx-1-driven Cre creates a PPARγ knock-out in β-cells although there remains the possibility of additional effects related to PPARγ deletion in ducts, acini, and other islet cells. The original description of these mice reported increased pancreas weight, with larger islets and normal pancreas histology by gross inspection, compared with control mice (29Ivashchenko C.Y. Duan S.Z. Usher M.G. Mortensen R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: G319-G326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We studied 8–10-week-old male animals and confirmed the pancreas specificity of the PPARγ deletion (Fig. 1A). We also found no abnormal pancreas histological features, as islet cytoarchitecture and insulin and glucagon immunostaining intensities were indistinguishable from the controls (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there was no difference in pancreas weight, β-cell mass, or β-cell proliferation rate between the PANC PPARγ-/- and the floxed control mice (Fig. 1C). PANC PPARγ-/- mice had the same body weight (29 ± 1 g versus 28 ± 1 g, n = 7) as the controls, but unexpectedly, nonfasting glucose values were higher (8.1 ± 0.2 mm versus 6.4 ± 0.3 mm, n = 4, p = 0.009) and there was glucose intolerance during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (Fig. 1D). Isolated Islet Studies—Analysis of mRNA levels from isolated islets confirmed the ablation of PPARγ expression (p < 0.001) as opposed to PPARα that was unaffected, demonstrating the specificity of the gene inactivation (Fig. 2A). As predicted, islet PDX-1 mRNA (43 ± 6% of control islets, n = 3, p = 0.001) and protein levels (58 ± 2% of control islets, n = 3, p = 0.003) were markedly lowered in the PANC PPARγ-/- mice compared with the controls (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). GLUT2 mRNA also was lowered (p = 0.006) as opposed to no change in glucagon, insulin 1, or insulin 2 mRNA levels. Functional assessment showed a near-total absence of glucose-induced insulin secretion in the PPARγ-/- islets, based on no statistical difference in the in vitro insulin response to 16.7 mm glucose versus 2.8 mm glucose (1.3 ± 0.1-fold), compared with a 2.5 ± 0.3-fold increase in the control islets (Fig. 2C). Also, control islets cultured for 3 days with troglitazone had a near-doubling of Pdx-1 levels. In contrast, troglitazone induced no change of the lowered PDX-1 level in PPARγ-/- islets (Fig. 3). PPRE Sequence on Mouse and Human pdx-1 Promoters—We next investigated the molecular basis for PPARγ regulation of pdx-1 transcription. A PPRE consists of hexamer repeats (DR1 and DR2) separated by one nucleotide, with the consensus sequence being RGGTCA-A-AGGTCA. However, a characteristic feature is a high degree of homology for the 3′-half-site but substantial variance for the 5′-half-site (33Lemay D.G. Hwang D.H. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1583-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), reflecting highly efficient RXR binding to the 3′ DR2 half-site as part of the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer as compared with PPARγ binding to the 5′ DR1 half-site (34Temple K.A.

As such, we searched for a PPRE on the mouse pdx-1 promoter using the DR2 consensus sequence to probe for a homologous area within the 4.531-kb mouse pdx-1 promoter region (GenBank™ accession number AF192495). A putative PPRE consisting of GGGTAC-C-TCCAGT was identified at positions −2716/-2698 relative to the transcription initiation site in area 1 of the mouse pdx-1 promoter (Table 1A) as characterized by Gerrish et al. (35Gerrish K. Gannon M. Shih D. Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3485-3492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The identified DR2 element was fully homologous to the consensus sequence. In contrast, we compiled a data base of known PPREs (data not shown), and we noted the DR1 sequence was unique from reported PPREs. Comparison of the putative mouse pdx-1 × PPRE with the analogous human PDX-1 promoter sequence revealed partial homology (a three-nucleotide mismatch) for the DR-1 element and full homology for the DR-2 (Table 1, part B).TABLE 1PPRE within the mouse and human pdx-1 promotersA,partial sequence of the mouse pdx-1 promoter region (GenBank™ accession number AF192495).

https://openalex.org/W1993446851,"AlaXp is a widely distributed (from bacteria to humans) genome-encoded homolog of the editing domain of alanyl-tRNA synthetases. Editing repairs the confusion of serine and glycine for alanine through clearance of mischarged (with Ser or Gly) tRNA(Ala). Because genome-encoded fragments of editing domains of other synthetases are scarce, the AlaXp redundancy of the editing domain of alanyl-tRNA synthetase is thought to reflect an unusual sensitivity of cells to mistranslation at codons for Ala. Indeed, a small defect in the editing activity of alanyl-tRNA synthetase is causally linked to neurodegeneration in the mouse. Although limited earlier studies demonstrated that AlaXp deacylated mischarged tRNA(Ala) in vitro, the significance of this activity in vivo has not been clear. Here we describe a bacterial system specifically designed to investigate activity of AlaXp in vivo. Serine toxicity, experienced by a strain harboring an editing-defective alanyl-tRNA synthetase, was rescued by an AlaXp-encoding transgene. Rescue was dependent on amino acid residues in AlaXp that are needed for its in vitro catalytic activity. Thus, the editing activity per se of AlaXp was essential for suppressing mistranslation. The results support the idea that the unique widespread distribution of AlaXp arises from the singular difficulties, for translation, poised by alanine."
https://openalex.org/W2104391960,"Isolated chondrocytes form aggregates in suspension culture that maintain chondrocyte phenotype in a physiological pericellular environment. The molecular mechanisms involved in chondrocyte aggregation have not been previously identified. Using this novel suspension culture system, we performed mRNA and protein expression analysis along with immunohistochemistry for potential cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix integrin ligands. Inhibition of aggregation assays were performed using specific blocking agents. We found that: (i) direct cell-cell interactions were not involved in chondrocyte aggregation, (ii) chondrocytes in aggregates were surrounded by a matrix rich in collagen II and cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP), (iii) aggregation depends on a beta1-integrin, which binds a triple helical GFOGER sequence found in collagens, (iv) integrin alpha10-subunit is the most highly expressed alpha-subunit among those tested, including alpha5, in aggregating chondrocytes. Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that the main molecular interaction involved in aggregation of phenotypically stable chondrocytes is the alpha10beta1-collagen II interaction."

Using a combination of flow cytometry, patch clamp recording, endoglycosidase H digestion, brefeldin A treatment, and analytic centrifugation, we identified a highly conserved aspartate residue at the boundary of the M3-M4 loop and the M4 domain that was required for binary and ternary γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor surface expression. Mutation of this residue caused mutant and partnering subunits to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, reflecting impaired forward trafficking.

Unfortunately because the structural and cellular determinants of receptor biogenesis are poorly understood, development of effective treatment strategies remains a significant challenge. A wealth of evidence suggests that Cys-loop receptors are assembled as heteropentamers from a large repertoire of neuronal subunits (7Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 8Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Millar N.S.

Subunits share a similar topology that includes an extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains, three loops including a large cytoplasmic loop, and a variable length extracellular C-terminal tail (7Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 11Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Receptor assembly is thought to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following glycosylation and folding of de novo synthesized subunits (12Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol.

Assembly is closely monitored by ER quality control machinery, and consequently subunits that fail to assemble properly are retained and degraded (15Gallagher M.J. Ding L. Maheshwari A.

Ehya N. Fuchs K. Furtmuller R. Mayer B. Huck S. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9124-9133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hales T.G. Tang H. Bollan K.A. Johnson S.J. King D.P. McDonald N.A. Cheng A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), recent studies in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) suggest that C-terminal motifs may also play a role (20Roccamo A.M. Barrantes F.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors are the most abundant Cys-loop receptor in the mammalian brain and are responsible for the majority of fast inhibitory neurotransmission. Like other Cys-loop superfamily receptors, they are pentamers assembled from combinations of 16 subunit subtypes (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ϵ, θ, and π) (7Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). The β2 subunit, in particular, is an essential component of several widely distributed GABAA receptor isoforms (21McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) and is known to interact directly with several cellular regulatory proteins via its intracellular M3-M4 loop. For instance, it interacts with brefeldin A-inhibited GDP/GTP exchange factor 2 (BIG2) and GABAA receptor-interacting factor-1 (GRIF-1), which promote forward trafficking of GABAA receptors (22Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H.L. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Charych E.I. Yu W. Miralles C.P. Serwanski D.R. Li X. Rubio M. De Blas A.L. J.

Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand how C-terminal motifs regulate Cys-loop receptor biogenesis, the role of the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop was evaluated in GABAA receptor oligomerization, assembly, and forward trafficking. Using a combination of segmental deletions of the M3-M4 loop and multiple sequence alignment of Cys-loop receptor subunits, we identified a highly conserved aspartate residue at the boundary of the M3-M4 loop and M4 domain in the GABAA receptor α1, β2, and γ2 subunits that was required for binary and ternary receptor surface expression. Results from endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion, brefeldin A treatment, and analytic centrifugation revealed that mutation of this aspartate residue caused mutant and partnering subunits to be retained in the ER, the result of impaired higher order oligomerization. Our data thus provide evidence that C-terminal motifs are also important for receptor assembly. Preparation of Complementary DNA (cDNA) Constructs—cDNAs encoding human α1, β2, and γ2S subunit polypeptides including their signal peptides were inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector as described previously (17Gallagher M.J. Shen W. Song L. Macdonald R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37995-38004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the FLAG peptide, DYKDDDDK, was introduced between the 8th and 9th amino acids of the mature α1 subunit and the 4th and 5th amino acids of the mature β2 and γ2S subunits. Of note, murine β2 and γ2 subunits (which have sequences identical to their human counterparts) containing FLAG tags at the same position have been demonstrated previously to form receptors that are functionally indistinguishable from wild type receptors (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated that insertion of the FLAG tag between the 8th and 9th amino acids of the human α1 subunit did not alter GABAA receptor current amplitude, GABA EC50, or surface expression (supplemental Fig. 1). M3-M4 loop deletions, point mutations, and restriction enzyme site insertions and removals were performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To swap the M3-M4 loop between α1 and β2 subunits, the AgeI and AscI restriction enzyme sites were introduced into subunit cDNAs before the codons encoding the N-terminal portions of the M3-M4 loop and the M4 domain. The boundaries of the M3-M4 loops were predicted based on the UniProt Knowledgebase (GBRA1_HUMAN for the α1 subunit and GBRB2_HUMAN for the β2 subunit). The α1 subunit M3-M4 loop was excised by double digestion with AgeI and AscI and ligated into the β2 subunit that had been doubly digested with the same enzymes (and vice versa). Finally the restriction enzyme sites were deleted. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were purchased from ATCC (CRL-11268). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For binary subunit coexpression, cells were cotransfected with equal amounts (by weight) of α1 and β2 subunit cDNAs using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) (6 μl of reagent/2 μg of cDNA/60-mm-diameter culture dish), and for ternary subunit coexpression, cells were transfected with equal amounts of α1, β2, and γ2S subunit cDNAs (9 μl of reagent/3 μg of cDNA at a 1:1:1 cDNA ratio/60-mm culture dish). The cDNA-FuGENE 6 mixture volumes were scaled up or down proportionally to the surface areas of different sized cell culture dishes. Forty-eight hours later, transfected cells were subjected to the following experiments. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were obtained at room temperature from lifted HEK293T cells bathed in an external solution composed of 142 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 6 mm MgCl2, 8 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, 330 mosm). Recording electrodes were pulled using a P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments), fire-polished on an MF-9 microforge (Narishige), and filled with an internal solution consisting of 153 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgATP, and 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.3, 310 mosm). This combination of internal and external solutions produced a chloride equilibrium potential near 0 mV. Open tip resistances of the recording electrodes were typically 1.0–2.0 megaohms. Currents were recorded under voltage clamp mode at –20 mV using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low pass-filtered at 2 kHz using the internal four-pole Bessel filter of the amplifier, digitized with the Digidata 1322A data acquisition system (Molecular Devices), and stored for off-line analysis. GABA (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as a stock solution. Working solutions were made on the day of the experiment by diluting stock solutions with external solution. GABA was applied with a rapid perfusion system consisting of pulled multibarrel square glass tubing connected to a Warner Perfusion Fast-Step system (Warner Instruments) (25Hinkle D.J. Bianchi M.T. Macdonald R.L. BioTechniques. 2003; 35 (476): 472-474PubMed Google Scholar). The 10–90% rise times of open electrode tip liquid junction currents were consistently <1.0 ms. Consecutive drug applications were separated by at least 45 s in external solution to allow for complete GABA unbinding. Peak amplitudes of GABA-evoked currents were analyzed using Clampfit 9.0 (Molecular Devices). GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad) was used to fit the concentration-response results to a sigmoidal function using the equation I = Imax/{1 + ([EC50]/[A])Hill slope}, where I is the peak current at a given GABA concentration, [A], and Imax is the maximal peak current. Numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4. Flow Cytometry—To collect cells for flow cytometry analysis, monolayer cultures of HEK293T cells were dissociated by 37 °C trypsin (Invitrogen) for 2 min. Trypsinization then was stopped in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% sodium azide (FACS buffer). Although trypsin could cleave the extracellular N-terminal domain, thereby removing the FLAG epitope, the relative surface expression profile of FLAG-tagged subunits from cells dissociated by trypsin was similar to that of cells dissociated by protease-free cell detaching solution (2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) (data not shown). Following washes with FACS buffer, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG IgG directly conjugated with R-phycoerythrin (1:50 dilution; Martek) for 1 h. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer again and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were run on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur system equipped with 488 nm argon ion and 635 nm red diode lasers. For each staining condition, 50,000 cells were analyzed. Nonviable cells were excluded from analysis based on forward and side scatter profiles (not shown) as determined by staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D (Invitrogen), which was excited using the 488 nm laser and detected with a 670-nm long pass filter (FL3). The R-phycoerythrin fluorophore was excited using the 488 nm laser and detected with a 585/42 bandpass filter (FL2). Data were acquired using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and analyzed off line using FlowJo 7.1 (Treestar, Inc.). For each sample, the fluorescence index was calculated by determining the percentage of positively transfected cells (i.e. cells with a fluorescence intensity greater than 99% of mock-transfected cells) and multiplying this value by the mean fluorescence intensity of those cells. The fluorescence index of each experimental condition was then normalized to that of the control condition (i.e. α1FLAGβ2 or α1β2FLAG) for comparison. Unless otherwise specified, a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-test was used to determine whether there were significant differences in surface levels among transfection conditions. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Multiple Sequence Alignment—45 polypeptide sequences of human Cys-loop superfamily receptor subunits were aligned using Multalin software (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). Penalties (subtractions of alignment scores) were applied to insertion and extension of internal gaps and also to terminal gaps. This was required for proper alignment of C-terminal domains. Immunoblotting—Membrane proteins in transfected cells were extracted in modified radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffers containing 10–50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1–2% Nonidet P-40, 0.25–0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were cleaned by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were subjected to further experiments or directly to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). Monoclonal anti-GABAA receptor α1 subunit antibodies (final concentration, 5 μg/ml; clone BD24, Chemicon) and monoclonal anti-GABAA receptor β2/3 antibodies (4 μg/ml; clone 62-3G1, Upstate) were used to detect wild type or modified human α1 and β2 subunits, respectively. Anti-Na+/K+-ATPase antibodies (0.2 μg/ml; clone ab7671, Abcam) were used to check loading variability. Following incubation with primary antibodies, secondary goat anti-mouse IgG heavy and light chain antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used at 1:10,000× dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for the visualization of specific bands in the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were collected in a digital ChemImager (Alpha Innotech). The integrated density volumes (IDVs; pixel intensity × mm2) were then calculated using the FluorChem 5500 software. To compare the expression levels between the same subtype subunits with different mutations, we normalized adjusted IDVs (normalized to loading control Na+/K+-ATPase IDVs) to those of control conditions (coexpression of wild type α1 and β2 subunits). Glycosidase Digestion—Whole cell lysates obtained from 10 mm-Tris RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) extraction were subjected to endo H and peptide N-glycosidase-F digestion (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The digestion reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h and terminated by addition of sample buffer. Brefeldin A Treatment—The forward trafficking of fully assembled GABAA receptors is a slow process. Although pentamer formation peaks 6 h after de novo synthesis, appreciable surface expression is not detected until 8 h after subunit synthesis (27Gorrie G.H. Vallis Y. Stephenson A. Whitfield J. Browning B. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6587-6596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to block fully assembled receptor pentamers from trafficking beyond the ER and being expressed on the cell surface, HEK293T cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) 6 h after transfection, and 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested. The surface and total cellular protein levels were then measured using flow cytometry and immunoblots, respectively. Analytic Centrifugation—The use of sucrose density gradient fractionation to analyze the size of GABAA receptor subunit protein complexes has been described previously (28Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were extracted using high detergent RIPA buffer, which consisted of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Supernatants were loaded on a 5–20% sucrose density gradient in high detergent RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. To calibrate each gradient, bovine serum albumin was added as a control marker (sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S). Endogenous aldolase was used as a second marker (sedimentation coefficient of 7.4 S). To separate protein complexes of different sizes, gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 33,500 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C. Each gradient was then manually fractionated at 500-μl intervals. The distributions of GABAA receptor subunits and protein markers within the sucrose density gradients were analyzed by Western blot. Immunoprecipitation—Protein complexes containing FLAG-tagged GABAA receptor subunits were immunoprecipitated using EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with extracting RIPA buffer, protein complexes were eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The presence of GABAA receptor subunits was determined by Western blot. The β2 Subunit M3-M4 Loop Was Important for α1β2 Receptor Surface Expression—The β2 subunit cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop contains several important protein binding motifs (Fig. 1) (22Beck M. Brickley K.

Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how these motifs influenced GABAA receptor surface expression, a β2 subunit construct lacking the majority of the M3-M4 loop (β2K339–R451) was generated (β2(loopΔ)). Twelve amino acids at the N terminus of the loop, β2N327–Q338, were retained to link the M3 and M4 domains. To monitor surface expression of the α1, β2, and β2(loopΔ) subunits, the FLAG epitope was inserted into each subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”). FLAG-tagged subunits were then coexpressed with untagged partnering subunits (e.g. α1FLAG with β2 or β2(loopΔ) subunits and α1 with β2FLAG or β2(loopΔ)FLAG subunits), and surface FLAG levels were measured using flow cytometry (Fig. 2). For comparison, surface FLAG levels in each experimental condition (i.e. α1FLAGβ2(loopΔ) or α1β2(loopΔ)FLAG) were expressed as a percentage of surface FLAG levels in the corresponding “control” condition (i.e. α1FLAGβ2 or α1β2FLAG, respectively). Note that the α1FLAG and the β2FLAG subunits in the control conditions will subsequently be referred to as control subunits.FIGURE 2Deletion of the β2 subunit M3-M4 loop, β2K339-R451Δ, substantially reduced α1β2 receptor surface expression. A1, representative distributions of R-phycoerythrin (PE) fluorescence intensities for cells coexpressing α1FLAGβ2(left panel) or α1FLAGβ2(loopΔ)(right panel) subunits and stained with a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2 clone) were plotted as frequency histograms. The x axis indicates the fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units (note the log scale), and the y axis indicates the percentage of the maximum cell count. Representative distributions obtained from mock-transfected cells (unfilled histograms) are overlaid with each experimental distribution (filled histograms).

Relative to mock expression (unfilled histogram), the fluorescence intensity histograms obtained with control subunit coexpression (filled histogram) were substantially right-shifted (Fig. 2, A1 and B1, left panels). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity histograms obtained with α1β2(loopΔ) subunit coexpression (Fig. 2, A1 and B1, right panels) were less right-shifted. Quantifying the flow cytometry data (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrated that coexpression of α1 and β2(loopΔ) subunits yielded only 4 and 2% of control subunits, respectively (n = 5). This suggested that motifs or residues in the deleted portions of the β2 subunit M3-M4 loop, β2K339–R451, were required for GABAA receptor surface expression. Insertion of the α1 Subunit M3-M4 Loop into the β2(loopΔ) Subunit Partially Restored α1β2 Receptor Surface Expression—Based on evidence that N-terminal domains are sufficient to mediate receptor oligomerization (18Klausberger T. Sarto I. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Furtmuller R. Mayer B. Huck S. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9124-9133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hales T.G. Tang H. Bollan K.A. Johnson S.J. King D.P. McDonald N.A. Cheng A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it was assumed that α1β2 pentamer assembly was not affected by the β2 subunit loop deletion. We thus hypothesized that the basis for the absence of α1β2-(loopΔ) receptor surface expression was that the β2 subunit M3-M4 loops contained a motif required for receptor forward trafficking. To test this hypothesis, the β2 subunit M3-M4 loop, β2N327–R451, was introduced into the α1 subunit (α1β2 construct), and this chimeric subunit was coexpressed with the β2(loopΔ) subunit. However, surface levels in this condition were not different from those observed with α1β2(loopΔ) subunit coexpression (for both α1 and β2 subunits, surface levels were 2% of control subunits, p < 0.001, n = 5; Fig. 3B). Therefore, failure to express surface α1β2(loopΔ) receptors was not due to absence of a forward trafficking motif in the β2 subunit M3-M4 loops. Interestingly coexpression of the β2α1 (the β2 subunit containing the α1 subunit M3-M4 loop, α1N335–R421) and α1 subunits led to surface levels that were intermediate between control and α1β2(loopΔ) surface levels (α1 and β2α1 levels were 62 and 64% of control subunits, respectively; Fig. 3B). This indicated that the α1 subunit M3-M4 loop alone could support receptor surface expression and suggested that α1 and β2 subunits shared a motif that was essential for receptor surface expression. To determine how receptor surface levels correlated with channel function, GABA (1 mm) was applied for 2 s to cells coexpressing control, α1β2(loopΔ), α1β2β2(loopΔ), or α1β2α1 subunits. As shown previously, rapidly desensitizing currents with an average peak amplitude of 644 pA were evoked by GABA from cells coexpressing α1 and β2 subunits (Fig. 3C) (30Lagrange A.H. Botzolakis E.J. Macdonald R.L. J. Physiol. 2007; 578: 655-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, GABA-evoked currents were not detected from cells coexpressing α1β2(loopΔ) or α1β2β2(loopΔ) subunits, a finding consistent with measurements of subunit surface levels using flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). However, the average amplitude of currents obtained from cells expressing α1β2α1 subunits (34 pA) was only 5% of that obtained from cells expressing control receptors. Given that α1β2α1 receptor surface levels were approximately half of control receptor levels, this suggested that the β2 subunit M3-M4 loop contained motifs important for channel function and, importantly, demonstrated that changes in surface expression do not always correlate with current amplitudes. Although this finding was of interest, our primary goal was to understand the role of the M3-M4 loop in regulating receptor biogenesis, and we thus deferred further functional characterization. Fourteen Amino Acids at the Distal End of the β2 Subunit M3-M4 Loop Were Required for α1β2 Receptor Surface Expression—To determine the molecular mechanism for the β2(loopΔ) subunit-induced reduction of α1β2 receptor surface expression, constructs were generated with smaller portions of the β2 subunit M3-M4 loop deleted (Fig. 4A).

We previously reported that DHEA has opposing actions in endothelial cells to stimulate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric-oxide synthase leading to increased production of nitric oxide while simultaneously stimulating MAPK-dependent secretion of the vasoconstrictor ET-1. In the present study we hypothesized that DHEA may stimulate PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of FoxO1 in endothelial cells to help regulate endothelial function.

In this study, 15d-PGJ2 was found to increase p53 levels of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells by stabilizing p53. Both 15d-PGJ2-induced apoptosis and the induction of p21Waf1 and Bax can be abolished by p53 small interfering RNA but not by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ inhibitors. Moreover, 15d-PGJ2 activated JNK and p38 MAPK while inducing p53 phosphorylation at sites responsible for p53 activity. JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) pretreatment attenuated 15d-PGJ2-mediated apoptosis and suppressed the p21Waf1 and Bax expressions without affecting p53 protein accumulation. Pretreatment with SP600125 partially prevented the phosphorylation of p53 at serines 33 and 392 induced by 15d-PGJ2. 15d-PGJ2 was also found to induce reactive oxygen species generation and partially blocked nuclear factor-κB activity. Pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented the p53 accumulation, the phosphorylations of JNK and p38 MAPK, the inhibition of NF-κB activity, as well as the apoptosis induced by 15d-PGJ2. Using a mouse model of corneal neovascularization, it was demonstrated in vivo that 15d-PGJ2 induced reactive oxygen species generation, activated JNK and p38 MAPK, induced p53 accumulation/phosphorylation, and induced vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, which could be abolished by N-acetylcysteine, SP600125, SB203580, or a virus-derived amphipathic peptides-based p53 small interfering RNA.

Ma J.X. Prog. Retin Eye Res. 2006; 26: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is thus a target of therapy, and there is an active search for agents capable of arresting both new vessel growth in vivo and the proliferation of vessel endothelial cells (EC) in vitro. Among these agents is 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). 15d-PGJ2 has been reported to act as an anti-angiogenic factor by inducing EC apoptosis (2Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. J. Biol.

An earlier study reported that the rat corneal neovascularization induced by VEGF can be significantly suppressed by co-implanted 15d-PGJ2 (3Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9116-9121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it remains unclear whether 15d-PGJ2 can suppress the progression of existing neovessels. In this regard, the apoptotic-inducing capacity of 15d-PGJ2 in vivo is also unclear.15d-PGJ2 is a member of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins and is synthesized in many cell types in response to extrinsic stimuli (8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kuwata H. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 is an end product of the cyclooxygenase pathways, in which 15d-PGJ2 is produced by dehydration of prostaglandin D2 (9Fukushima M. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to other prostaglandins that have specific transmembrane receptors, no specific 15d-PGJ2 cell surface receptor has been identified to date. 15d-PGJ2 has been shown to act through direct interactions with its intracellular targets; for example, it is known to be a ligand of the nuclear transcriptional factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (10Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 11Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). PPARγ binding to 15d-PGJ2 allows translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to regulate a variety of genes involved in cell differentiation, lipid biosynthesis, glucose metabolism, immune response, and vasculature (12Rizzo G. Fiorucci S. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Duan S.Z. Usher M.G. Mortensen R.M. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Notably, the cyclopentenone moiety of 15d-PGJ2 contains an electrophilic carbon that can react covalently with nucleophiles such as the free sulfhydryls of GSH and cysteine residues in cellular proteins (14Uchida K. Shibata T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2007; 21: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Most PPARγ ligands lack the electrophilic cyclopentenone. 15d-PGJ2 thus induces some PPARγ-independent biological actions through its electrophilic activity, such as inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling through covalent modifications of critical cysteine residues in IκB kinase and the DNA-binding domains of NF-κB subunits (15Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar).The induction of apoptosis in proliferating ECs is an available strategy in the treatment of diseases relative to neovascularization. The mechanism of 15d-PGJ2 induction of EC apoptosis has been suggested to be through the activation of PPARγ (2Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17042-17048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 6Dong Y.G. Chen D.D. He J.G. Guan Y.Y. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, our recent study on pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) identified the sequential activation of PPARγ and p53 as a signaling mechanism of EC apoptosis (16Ho T.C. Chen S.L. Yang Y.C. Liao C.L. Cheng H.C. Tsao Y.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PPARγ is thus a potential mechanism for 15d-PGJ2-induced apoptosis. However, a recent study indicates that 15d-PGJ2-induced HUVEC apoptosis is PPARγ-independent (7Erl W. Weber C. Zernecke A. Neuzil J. Vosseler C.A. Kim H.J. Weber P.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The PPARγ-independent effect is also supported by evidence that the cyclopentenone ring alone can dose-dependently induce HUVEC apoptosis (5Vosseler C.A. Erl W. Weber P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, several pro-apoptotic signals induced by 15d-PGJ2 have been shown to be independent of PPARγ in cell types other than ECs. These include accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (17Kondo M. Shibata T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S. Iwata M. Noguchi N. Uchida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7367-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human articular chondrocytes (18Shan Z.Z. Masuko-Hongo K.

Pancreas. 2004; 28: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on this conflicting information, the involvement of PPARγ remains to be clarified. Unlike PPARγ, the involvement of p53 in EC apoptosis induced by 15d-PGJ2 is more plausible. p53 is a well established pro-apoptotic protein. p53 is involved in the apoptosis or cell cycle arrest of ECs induced by PEDF (16Ho T.C. Chen S.L. Yang Y.C. Liao C.L. Cheng H.C. Tsao Y.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer (20Teodoro J.G. Parker A.E. Zhu X. Green M.R. Science. 2006; 313: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and paclitaxel (Taxol) (21Pasquier E. Carré M. Pourroy B. Camoin L. Rebaï O. Briand C. Braguer D. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1301-1310PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 protein expression is induced by 15d-PGJ2 (6Dong Y.G. Chen D.D. He J.G. Guan Y.Y. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kondo M. Shibata T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S. Iwata M. Noguchi N. Uchida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7367-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the necessity of p53 in 15d-PGJ2-induced EC apoptosis has never been established.MAPKs, including stress-activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), have been found to respond to a variety of extracellular stimuli and to determine cell fate under stress (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar, 23Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence indicates that 15d-PGJ2 can activate MAPKs in ECs. For example, 15d-PGJ2 can enhance DNA binding of AP-1 by inducing c-Jun phosphorylation via JNK activation (4Zernecke A. Erl W. Fraemohs L. Lietz M. Weber C. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1099-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Chen N.G. Han X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 has also been shown to activate p38 MAPK in ECV304 cells (6Dong Y.G. Chen D.D. He J.G. Guan Y.Y. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential involvement of these kinases in the EC apoptosis induced by 15d-PGJ2 has not been established. Here we demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 induces apoptosis of HUVECs and ECs in chemical burn-induced vessels on mouse cornea through the signaling of p53 and that p53 activation is achieved by JNK and p38 MAPK-mediated modulation of p53 phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment—HUVECs (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) were grown in Medium 200 with Low Serum Growth Supplement (LSGS kit, supplement contains 1.9% fetal bovine serum, 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 10 μg/ml heparin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor). Culture plates were coated with 2% gelatin. Cells (passages 4-8) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. To prepare 15d-PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), the original solvent methyl acetate was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and then it was redissolved in PBS before adding to the medium. Treatments with 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm, unless specified), recombinant PEDF derived from Escherichia coli (25Tsao Y.P. Ho T.C. Chen S.L. Cheng H.C. Life Sci. 2006; 79: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), MAPKs inhibitors, PPARγ antagonists, NF-κB inhibitors (Calbiochem), or NAC (Sigma) were performed 4 h after seeding (5 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plate) in LSGS medium.Animals and Treatment—BALB/c mice, weighing 25-35 g, were anesthetized with injections of ketamine. An alkaline burn was created by touching the cornea for 20 s with a 3-mm-diameter disk containing 1 n NaOH. The ocular surface was then irrigated with 20 ml of physiological saline. At 3 days after the injury, the mice were randomly divided into the 15d-PGJ2 treatment group and control group, with 10 mice per group. For treatment, 20 μl of 20 μm 15d-PGJ2 or 15d-PGJ2 in combination with 80 μm MAPKs inhibitors was dropped onto the cornea, two times at an interval of 4 h. For NAC treatment, corneas were covered with 20 μl of 10 mm NAC for 30 min, before treatment with 15d-PGJ2. The control group received 20 μl of saline eye drops. For evaluation of apoptosis, the corneas were treated twice at an interval of 4 h, and corneas were harvested 24 h after the second treatment. At the end of the treatment, corneas with iris intact were dissected from the eyes for evaluation of ROS generation or apoptosis without fixation. Corneas designated for immunofluorescent assay were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.Evaluation of Apoptosis—The percentage of HUVEC apoptosis was calculated using TACS annexin V-FITC kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Beckman) as described previously (16Ho T.C. Chen S.L. Yang Y.C. Liao C.L. Cheng H.C. Tsao Y.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The percentage of annexin V-positive cells was also confirmed by in situ staining according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cell number was monitored by counterstaining with Hoechst 33342. The nuclei were calculated in 10 randomly selected fields of the three different chambers (∼7200 cells). Specimens were examined and photographed on a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (×40, 10 fields/sample). Pictures were recorded on Zeiss software.To determine whether 15d-PGJ2 has any apoptotic effect on vascular ECs, the corneas were incubated with 10% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C and then double-labeled with annexin V-FITC (R & D Systems) and PECAM-1 (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following labeling, the cornea was washed twice in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cornea was incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature, and cell nuclei were monitored by counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 for 2 min. After final washes and mounting, apoptotic cells were counted in randomly selected fields using a Leica confocal microscope (×40, 10 fields/cornea).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were scraped into lysis buffer (150 μl/35-mm well) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples containing 20 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and processed for immunoblot analysis. Antibodies used in this study were for active p38 MAPK and active JNK (Promega, Madison, WI), p38 MAPK/SAPK2, JNK (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), p53 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), phospho-p53, phospho-NF-κB, p65 (Ser-536), c-Jun, ATF2, NF-κB, p65, phospho-IκB-α (Ser-32/36), IκB-α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA), cleaved caspase-3 (Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK), and β-actin (Sigma). Proteins of interest were detected using the appropriate IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). X-ray films were scanned on the model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Labworks 4.0 software. For quantification, blots of at least three independent experiments were used.p53 Small Interfering RNA Treatment—Human and mouse p53 and control siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For the transfection procedure, HUVECs were grown to 70% confluence, and siRNA was transfected using INTERFERin siRNA transfection reagent (PolyPlus-Transfection, San Marcos, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of siRNA was 10 nm. By 8 h after siRNA transfection, HUVECs were resuspended in new culture media with recovery for 36 h and then treated with 15d-PGJ2.Transfection of p53 siRNA into endothelial cell on mouse cornea was achieved by using the DeliverX Plus siRNA transfection kit (Panomics, Fremont, CA), a virus-derived amphipathic peptides-based kit following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 5 μmol/liter working stock of mouse p53 siRNA or control siRNA was mixed with sonicated transfection reagent and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to generate the working siRNA transfection complex. The final concentration of siRNA was 100 nm. Next, each mouse cornea was eye-dropped with 20 μl of sonicated siRNA transfection reagent alone (mock control) or siRNA transfection complex twice at an interval of 4 h, and recovery was for a further 24 h before 15d-PGJ2 treatment. The transfection efficiency was determined, in separated experiments, using a FITC-labeled nonsilencing control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Results revealed that almost all of vascular ECs and epithelial cells of cornea can be transfected and still maintain normal morphologies. No green fluorescence can be detected without using the transfection reagent.Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Synthesis of cDNA was performed with 1 μg of total RNA at 50 °C for 50 min, using oligo(dT) primers and reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen). The amplification mixture (final volume, 20 μl) contained 1× Taq polymerase buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm primer pair, and 0.5 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). cDNA was equalized in an 18-26 cycle amplification reaction with PPARγ primers 5′-CAGGAGCAGAGCAAAGAGGTG-3′ (forward)/5′-CAAACTCAAACTTGGGCTCCA-3′ (reverse) or p53 primers 5′-GCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATC-3′ (forward)/5′-TGAGTCAGGCCCTTCTGTCT-3′ (reverse) yielding 300- and 330-bp products, respectively. The number of cycles for the primer sets (denaturation, 30 s, 94 °C; annealing, 30 s, 61 °C; and polymerization, 30 s, 72 °C) was chosen to be in the linear range of amplification. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, and the DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide under ultraviolet irradiation. The intensities of the PCR products were quantified by densitometrically using a FUJI LAS-3000 system and multigauge version 1.01 software (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan).Immunofluorescent—Mouse corneas were treated at 4 °C with methanol for 2 min and blocked with 10% goat serum and 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Corneas were stained with antibodies to monoclonal anti-mouse eNOS antibody (1:200; Pharmingen), active p38 MAPK or active JNK (1:500; Promega), or phospho-p53 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), or p53 (1:500, ab4060; Abcam Ltd.), or NF-κB p65 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with both rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were located by counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 for 20 min. After final washes and mounting, corneas were examined using a Leica confocal microscope (×40). p-p53 (Ser-392)-positive cells were counted in randomly selected fields (×40, 10 fields/cornea).Detection of ROS by H2DCFDA—The intracellular ROS generation was assayed using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), and when oxidized by ROS it releases the green fluorescent compound 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF).To detect ROS by spectrofluorometric assay, 1.2 × 104 cells were seeded in a 2% gelatin-coated 96-well plate and incubated for a further 4 h. After 15d-PGJ2 treatment, cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and then incubated with fresh medium containing 5 μm H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the dark for 15 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm) was measured with a SpectraMAX GEMINI Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The background fluorescence from control wells without the addition of H2DCFDA was subtracted from experimental readings.For monitoring the DCF fluorescence in HUVECs, cells were plated on 2% gelatin-coated plate in LSGS medium. After 15d-PGJ2 treatment and H2DCFDA exposure as described above, cells were washed two times with LSGS medium and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Fluorescence images were taken with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Melville, NY).For detection of ROS in vascular ECs, after 15d-PGJ2 treatment for 1 h, corneas were dissected from animal eyes and transferred into a 12-well plate. Individual cornea was then incubated with 1 ml of LSGS medium containing 5 μm H2DCFDA for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed two times with LSGS medium. Corneas were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with Hoechst 33342. Fluorescence images were taken with a Leica confocal microscope (10 fields/cornea).Determination of NF-κB Activation—NF-κB p50/p65 transcription factor colorimetric assay (SGT510, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was used to measure the active NF-κB in nuclear extracts by following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nuclear extracts from 5 × 105 HUVECs were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). Double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence for NF-κB binding (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) were mixed with nuclear extract and assay buffer. After incubation, the mixture was transferred to the streptavidin-coated ELISA kit processed following the manufacturer's instruction and read at 450 nm using a SpectraMAX GEMINI Reader (Molecular Devices). For each experiment, triplicate samples were measured for statistical significance. The specificity of binding was confirmed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides.Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of three to five independent experiments. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine statistically significant differences. p values <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTS15d-PGJ2 Dose-dependently Induces Apoptosis and Increases Protein Levels of p53 and PPARγ—Exposure of HUVECs to 10 μm or greater 15d-PGJ2 for 16 h increased the percentage of annexin V-positive apoptotic cells to 40% (Fig. 1A). Using 10 μm or greater 15d-PGJ2 markedly induced PPARγ and p53 protein accumulation at all time periods studied (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR showed that the levels of p53 mRNA were similar to untreated cells at all time periods studied, suggesting that transcription of p53 is not activated (Fig. 1C). Because the half-life of p53 protein is short in most primary cells, further experiments were performed to investigate whether 15d-PGJ2 can enhance the protein stability of p53 and showed that 15d-PGJ2 prolonged the half-life of p53 in HUVECs (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, the level of PPARγ mRNA was increased at 4-8 h, as compared with control (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment with actinomycin D for 3 h prior to 15d-PGJ2 exposure suppressed the PPARγ mRNA level, suggesting that the increase of PPARγ mRNA is transcription-dependent.p53 Is Critical for 15d-PGJ2-mediated Apoptosis of HUVECs and Vascular ECs on Mouse Cornea—To investigate whether p53 protein is required for 15d-PGJ2-mediated apoptosis, HUVECs were transfected with p53-specific siRNA before 15d-PGJ2 treatment. Western blotting verified that the p53 induction was specifically and significantly reduced by the cognate p53 siRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, compared with either mock or control siRNA transfections, p53 siRNA significantly reduced 15d-PGJ2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2C) as well as Bax and p21Waf1 expressions and procaspase-3 cleavages (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2p53 siRNA suppresses the 15d-PGJ2-induced Bax and p21Waf1 expression and procaspase-3 cleavage and reduces the 15d-PGJ2-induced HUVEC apoptosis. A, HUVECs were transfected with p53 siRNA or control siRNA for 8 h and allowed to recover for a further 36 h. Cells were treated with 15d-PGJ2 for an additional 10 h, and cell lysate was then isolated for Western blot analysis of p53, Bax, and p21Waf1. Parts of the 15d-PGJ2-treated cells were harvested after treatment for 16 h for detecting the cleaved caspase-3 (17 kDa). “Mock (M)” indicates that cells were treated with transfection reagent.

As shown in Fig. 3, immunofluorescent assay showed that there is a base-line p53 (green) in both vascular ECs and epithelial cells of cornea. The identity of ECs was confirmed by an endothelial cell antigen (eNOS; Fig. 3, red). Treatment of cornea with 15d-PGJ2 for 8 h specifically enhanced p53 protein in the vascular ECs but not in the corneal epithelium (Fig. 3, panel b). The induced p53 was localized at both of the cytoplasms as the distribution of eNOS (Fig. 3, yellow) and the nucleus (pale blue).FIGURE 315d-PGJ2 induces p53 protein expression in vascular ECs. Mouse corneas were subjected to alkali trauma and at 3 days later treated with either mock transfection reagent (virus-derived amphipathic peptide alone), control siRNA, or p53 siRNA transfection mixture. After recovery for a further 24 h, the corneas were treated with PBS or 20 μm 15d-PGJ2 for a further 8 h. The corneas wer"
https://openalex.org/W2049170668,"HYAL-1 (hyaluronoglucosaminidase-1) belongs to the hyaluronidase family of enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid. HYAL-1 is a marker for cancer diagnosis and a molecular determinant of tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis. The regulation of HYAL-1 expression is unknown. Real time reverse transcription-PCR using 11 bladder and prostate cancer cells and 69 bladder tissues showed that HYAL-1 mRNA levels are elevated 10-30-fold in cells/tissues that express high hyaluronidase activity. Although multiple transcription start sites (TSS) for HYAL-1 mRNA were detected in various tissues, the major TSS in many tissues, including bladder and prostate, was at nucleotide 27274 in the cosmid clone LUCA13 (AC002455). By analyzing the 1532 base sequence 5' to this TSS, using cloning and luciferase reporter assays, we identified a TACAAA sequence at position -31 and the minimal promoter region between nucleotides -93 and -38. Mutational analysis identified that nucleotides -73 to -50 (which include overlapping binding consensus sites for SP1, Egr-1, and AP-2), bases C(-71) and C(-59), and an NFkappaB-binding site (at position -15) are necessary for promoter activity. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified that Egr-1, AP-2, and NFkappaB bind to the promoter in HYAL-1-expressing cells, whereas SP1 binds to the promoter in non-HYAL-1-expressing cells. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, bisulfite DNA sequencing, and methylation-specific PCR revealed that HYAL-1 expression is regulated by methylation at C(-71) and C(-59); both Cs are part of the SP1/Egr-1-binding sites. Thus, HYAL-1 expression is epigenetically regulated by the binding of different transcription factors to the methylated and unmethylated HYAL-1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1967368467,"The import of PTS1 proteins into the glycosome or peroxisome requires binding of a PTS1-laden PEX5 receptor to the membrane-associated protein PEX14 to facilitate translocation of PTS1 proteins into the lumen of these organelles. Quaternary structure analysis of protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani PEX14 (LdPEX14) revealed that this protein forms a homomeric complex with a size >670 kDa. Moreover, deletion mapping indicated that disruption of LdPEX14 oligomerization correlated with the elimination of the hydrophobic region and coiled-coil motif present in LdPEX14. Analysis of the LdPEX5-LdPEX14 interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a molar binding stoichiometry of 1:4 (LdPEX5: LdPEX14) and an in-solution dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼74 nm. Calorimetry, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that binding of LdPEX5 resulted in a dramatic conformational change in the LdPEX14 oligomeric complex that involved the reorganization of the hydrophobic segment in LdPEX14. Finally, limited tryptic proteolysis assays established that in the presence of LdPEX5, LdPEX14 became more susceptible to proteolytic degradation consistent with this protein interaction triggering a significant conformational change in the recombinant and native LdPEX14 structures.

Consequently, these organisms have retained a myriad of unique metabolic, biochemical, and structural features that are distinctive from other eukaryotic cells. Prominent among these features is the glycosome, an organelle that is distantly related to the peroxisomes in mammalian, yeast, fungi, and plant cells (4Michels P.A. Moyersoen J. Krazy H. Galland N.

Numerous studies in phylogenetically diverse organisms have demonstrated that PEX14 is a membrane-associated protein; however, the nature of this interaction and the topology of PEX14 in the peroxisomal and glycosomal membranes, as assessed by physiochemical techniques, seem to vary. In mammalian cells, Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris, and Trypanosoma brucei (24Shimizu N. Itoh R. Hirono Y. Otera H. Ghaedi K. Tateishi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Harano T. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. J.

Using similar biochemical approaches, the Leishmania PEX14 has been shown to be a peripheral membrane protein that associates tightly with the cytosolic surface of the glycosomal membrane (39Jardim A.

However, little is known about the structural changes induced in PEX14 upon binding its receptor PEX5. Here we reported the use of a number of biophysical techniques that include size exclusion chromatography, intrinsic fluorescence, CD, analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, and limited proteolysis to examine the LdPEX14 structural and conformational changes triggered in the LdPEX14 complex following LdPEX5 binding. Material—All restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Cell Culture—Leishmania donovani promastigotes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Leishmania medium supplemented with hemin, xanthine, and fetal bovine serum as described (43Pilar A.V.C. Madrid K.P. Jardim A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 158: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). LdPEX5 and LdPEX14 Expression and Purification—The open reading frames encoding the full-length LdPEX14 or mutant proteins encompassing residues 1–321 (ldpex14-(1–321)), 1–254 (ldpex14-(1–254)), 1–200 (ldpex14-(1–200)), 1–148 (ldpex14-(1–148)), or 1–120 (ldpex14-(1–120)) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the pET30b(+) expression vector as described previously (39Jardim A. Rager N. Liu W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44Madrid K.P. Jardim A. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The open reading frame for the ldpex14 fragment encompassing residues 1–75 (ldpex14-(1–75)) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET15b(+). The internal deletion mutants ldpex14-(Δ149–179) and ldpex14-(Δ270–321N) were generated by PCR mutagenesis using the template pET30b(+)-His6/S-LdPEX14 and the primer pairs 5′-CTGGCTAATGAGCGGACGCAGACGACAGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCTGTCGTCTGCGTCCGCTCATTAGCCAG-3′, and 5′-GAGCGGCAGACGAAGGAATTTCGTCGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGCGACGAAATTCCTTCGTCTGCCGCTC-3′, respectively. The LdPEX14 N-terminal truncation was generated as described previously (44Madrid K.P. Jardim A. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recombinant LdPEX14 proteins expressed using pET30b(+) contained an N-terminal hexahistidine and S-tag. Proteins expressed using the pET15b(+) only contain a hexahistidine affinity tag. LdPEX5 and ldpex5-(203–391) and ldpex5-(203–391) W3F were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pTYB12 expression vector (45Madrid K.P. De Crescenzo G. Wang S. Jardim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7331-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The three tryptophan residues (Trp-246, Trp-293, and Trp-361) in ldpex5-(203–391) were sequentially mutated to phenylalanine residues using PCR QuikChange protocol to generated the ldpex5-(203–391) W3F. The sequence of this tryptophanless mutant was validated by DNA sequence analysis. Intrinsic fluorescence analysis of ldpex5-(203–391) W3F excited at 295 nm showed no notable fluorescence emission between 305 and 400 nm, diagnostic of this protein being devoid of a tryptophan residue. Binding studies performed with ldpex5-(203–391) W3F using either pulldown assays or ELISA (39Jardim A. Rager N. Liu W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44Madrid K.P. Jardim A. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that this fragment exhibited LdPEX14 binding characteristics similar to ldpex5-(203–391) (data not shown). E. coli ER2566 cells transformed with pTYB12-LdPEX5, pTYB12-ldpex5-(203–391), or pTYB12-ldpex5-(203–391) W3F (45Madrid K.P. De Crescenzo G. Wang S. Jardim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7331-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were grown to an A600 of 1.2 at 37 °C then shifted to 20 °C for protein expression. Protein expression was induced for 4 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a chitin column (1 × 3 cm), and the column was washed with 100 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in TB buffer. LdPEX5 and ldpex5-(203–391) were cleaved by incubating the column matrix with 5 ml of 50 mm dithiothreitol in TB buffer for 40 h at 4 °C. Recombinant LdPEX14/ldpex14 proteins were overexpressed in E. coli ER2566 strain and purified as described previously (39Jardim A. Rager N. Liu W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For analytical centrifugation and tryptic digest experiments the LdPEX5-LdPEX14 complex was isolated from E. coli ER2566 cells co-transformed with the pTYB12-LdPEX5 and pET30b-His6/S-LdPEX14. Clarified cells lysates were applied onto a Ni2+-NTA column (1 × 5 cm), and the bound proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (PBS). The eluates were then applied to a chitin column (1 × 3 cm) to capture complexes containing the chitin-LdPEX5 fusion protein. The column was washed with 50 ml of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and the LdPEX5-LdPEX14 complex was eluted by incubating the column matrix with 5.0 ml of 50 mm dithiothreitol in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 40 h at 4 °C. All recombinant proteins were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged for 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl using a Biomax 5K NMWL centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (48Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar). Tryptic Analysis of LdPEX14 and LdPEX14-LdPEX5 Complex—LdPEX14 (∼100 μg) or LdPEX5-LdPEX14 (125 μg) complex in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) was incubated with 0.3 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 20 °C. Alternatively, purified glycosomes (50 μg of total protein) from wild type L. donovani promastigotes (43Pilar A.V.C. Madrid K.P. Jardim A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 158: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were incubated with recombinant LdPEX5 or bovine serum albumen (15 μg) and LdXPRT (50 μg) for 20 min at 20 °C prior to the addition of 0.3 μg of sequencing trypsin in 150 μl of TBS. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 60, and 180 min and mixed with 4 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (1 mini-tablet/ml distilled H2O) to inactivate the trypsin prior to addition SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Membranes were blocked with 3% skimmed milk powder in PBS and then probed with anti-Ni2+-NTA-HRP in PBS (1:2,000, Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario) and anti-LdPEX14 (1:16,000) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:10,000). Quaternary Structure Analysis—Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Beckman-Coulter system Gold equipped with a Superdex 200 column (GE HealthCare) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples containing 50–200 μg of protein in buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol were injected, and the column was developed at 0.5 ml/min while monitoring the column effluent at 280 nm. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and proteins precipitated with trichloroacetic acid for SDS-PAGE analysis. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated using thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine IgG (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa) (Bio-Rad). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed on a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). For the forward reaction, a 292 μm solution of LdPEX14 was loaded into the syringe and titrated into an 8 μm solution of LdPEX5 present in the ITC cell (1.42 ml). Alternatively, the syringe was loaded with a 1.0 mm solution of ldpex14-(1–120), which was titrated into a 29 μm solution of ldpex5-(203–391) in the ITC cell. For the reverse titrations, the ITC syringe was loaded with a 149 μm LdPEX5 solution, and the ITC cell was charged with a 40 μm LdPEX14 solution. Alternatively, the syringe was loaded with 397 μm solution of ldpex5-(203–391) and was titrated into a 145 μm ldpex14-(1–120) solution in the ITC cell. All reactions were performed at a constant temperature of 303 K, and protein solutions were dialyzed against the same batch of 40 mm sodium phosphate, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer to minimize heat of dilution effects. For all experiments, the contents of the cell were mixed at 300 rpm, and an equilibration time of 6 min between injections was used. The first injection used a 2-μl aliquot, and the 20–30 subsequent injections were performed using 10 μl volumes over a duration of 10 s. The experimental titration curves were corrected for the heat of dilution, and the initial 2-μl injections were typically omitted from the data set, and the curve fitting was performed using the Microcal Origin software 7.0 assuming a one-site model. The binding constants (Kd = 1/Ka) and the enthalpy (ΔH) were determined from the isotherm and the Gibbs free energy (ΔG), and entropy (ΔS) was calculated using the equation ΔG =ΔH – TΔS =–RT lnKa. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-I (Fullerton, CA) analytical ultracentrifuge using an An 55 AL aluminum rotor. Samples containing 250 μg/ml LdPEX14 or LdPEX5-LdPEX14 (molar ratio of 1:4) were loaded into double-sector cell with aluminum-filled Epon centerpieces. LdPEX14 and LdPEX5-LdPEX14 complex and ldpex14 deletion mutants were analyzed at rotor speeds of 26,000 and 30,000 rpm, respectively. UV scans were obtained at 230/280 nm and analyzed by the van Holde-Weischet method (49van Holde K. Weischet W. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The G/g(S) integral distribution attained with this method was determined using the XL-I UltraScan II version 9.7 sedimentation data analysis software (B. Demeler, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescent measurements were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Palo Alto, CA) at 25 °C using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 400 nm using a scan rate of 120 nm/min with excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm. A solution of recombinant LdPEX14 (40 μm) in 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was titrated with ldpex5-(203–391) W3F to a final concentration of 0–40 μm. Dilution effects were corrected by titrating LdPEX14 with buffer alone. For the chemical denaturation experiment, 20 μm of LdPEX14 was diluted into a 4.5 m solution of guanidinium hydrochloride in 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. Fluorescence spectra were recorded as indicated above. For quenching experiments, a 5 m acrylamide solution was titrated into a mixture containing 40 μm LdPEX14 or LdPEX14-ldpex5-(203–391) W3F mixture (40:10 μm) in 75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1. Circular Dichroism (CD)—Purified proteins were exhaustively dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and the protein concentration was measured by the method of Pace et al. (48Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar). CD measurements were performed on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C, using a cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length at a scan rate of 50 nm/min. Five spectra were collected and averaged per sample. For all samples, data were collected at wavelengths between 250 and 190 nm. LdPEX14 was diluted in dialysis buffer to a concentration of 3.1 μm, and ldpex5-(203–391) was added to a final concentration of 0.8 μm to obtain a 4:1 molar ratio of LdPEX14:ldpex5-(203–391). Cross-linking Studies—L. donovani promastigotes (5 × 108 cells/ml PBS) were permeabilized for 5 min at 20 °C with 15 μg/ml digitonin, and aliquots (100 μl) were incubated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0–1.5 mm) for 20 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed three times with 1.0 ml of PBS to remove excess cross-linking agent, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 6 m urea. Purified recombinant LdPEX14 (2 μg/50 μl PBS) was subjected to glutaraldehyde cross-linking using the above conditions. The reaction was terminated by adding Tris-HCl to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the mixtures were resolved on a 5–10% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Western blots were probed with rabbit anti-LdPEX14 (1:10,000) (39Jardim A. Rager N. Liu W. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or rabbit anti-L. donovani adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (LdAPRT) (1:1,000) antibodies. For cross-linking reactions with ldpex5-(203–391) and ldpex14-(1–120), proteins were reduced for 3 h at 20 °C with 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to reduce potential disulfide bonds prior to cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (0–3.2 mm). Cross-linked complexes were characterized by Western blots probed with anti-LdPEX5 and anti-LdPEX14 antisera. LdPEX14 Quaternary Structure—Native LdPEX14 extracted from glycosomes was previously demonstrated to migrate on a sucrose density gradient predominantly as a macromolecular structure of ∼800 kDa. 4K. P. Madrid, M. Nyisztor, A. V. Pilar, H. Banerjee, and A. Jardim, manuscript in preparation. To further validate oligomeric structure of LdPEX14 on the glycosome surface, chemical cross-linking was used to trap these complexes. Western blot analysis of digitonin-permeabilized L. donovani promastigotes treated with glutaraldehyde showed a concentration-dependent accumulation of a cross-linked complex that SDS-PAGE was estimated to have an apparent mass of >250 kDa (Fig. 1). A comparable complex was also observed when the cross-linking reaction was performed with zero length cross-linking agent ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (data not shown). Western blots of glutaraldehyde cross-linked reactions probed with antisera against adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, a 26-kDa cytosolic protein (50Allen T. Hwang H.-Y. Wilson K. Hanson S. Jardim A.

However, there are several CaV1.1 residues that are both identical in six species and are non-conservatively changed from the corresponding CaV1.2 residues, including three of the “IQ motif.” To investigate the functional significance of these residue differences, we used native gel electrophoresis and expression in intact myotubes to compare the binding of CaM to extended regions (up to 300 residues) of the C termini of CaV1.1 and CaV1.2. We found that in the presence of Ca2+ (either millimolar or that in resting myotubes), CaM bound strongly to C termini of CaV1.2 but not of CaV1.1. Furthermore, replacement of two residues (Tyr1657 and Lys1662) within the IQ motif of a C-terminal CaV1.2 construct with the divergent residues of CaV1.1 (His1532 and Met1537) led to a weakening of CaM binding (native gels), whereas the reciprocal substitution in CaV1.1 caused a gain of CaM binding. In full-length CaV1.2, substitution of these same two divergent residues with those of CaV1.1 (Y1657H, K1662M) eliminated calcium-dependent inactivation of the heterologously expressed channel. Thus, our results reveal that a conserved difference between the IQ motifs of CaV1.2 and CaV1.1 has a profound effect on both CaM binding and calcium-dependent inactivation.
