Here we show that the kinase belongs to a new family of protein kinases comprising at least seven mammalian isoforms (DYRK1A, DYRK1B, DYRK1C, DYRK2, DYRK3, DYRK4A, and DYRK4B), the yeast homolog Yak1p, and the Drosophila kinase minibrain (MNB). In rat tissues, DYRK1A is expressed ubiquitously, whereas transcripts for DYRK1B, DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4 were detected predominantly in testes of adult but not prepuberal rats. By fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of DYRK1A was found to accumulate in the nucleus of transfected COS-7 and HEK293 cells, whereas GFP-DYRK2 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm. DYRK1A exhibited a punctate pattern of GFP fluorescence inside the nucleus and was co-purified with the nuclear matrix. Analysis of GFP-DYRK1A deletion constructs showed that the nuclear localization of DYRK1A was mediated by its nuclear targeting signal (amino acids 105–139) but that its characteristic subnuclear distribution depended on additional N-terminal elements (amino acids 1–104). When expressed in Escherichia coli, DYRK1A, DYRK2, DYRK3, MNB, and Yak1p catalyzed their autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. The kinases differed in their substrate specificity in that DYRK2 and DYRK3, but not DYRK1A and MNB, catalyzed phosphorylation of histone H2B. The heterogeneity of their subcellular localization and substrate specificity suggests that the kinases are involved in different cellular functions.

DYRK1 is a dual specificity protein kinase that catalyzes its autophosphorylation on serine/threonine and on tyrosine residues (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C.

The Drosophila homolog of this gene, minibrain,encodes three splicing variants of the protein kinase MNB. Mutant flies with a reduced expression of minibrain have a reduced number of neurons in distinct areas of the adult brain (2Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I.

In addition, mutant minibrain flies show specific behavioral defects (2Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O.

Due to the high sequence similarity of the rat DYRK1 cDNA with a human expressed sequence tag (EST)1 that had previously been mapped to chromosome 21, we were able to localize the gene of a human homolog of DYRK1 to 21q22.2 (1Kentrup H.

By correlation of phenotype with genotype in patients with partial trisomies, this region has been defined as the “Down's syndrome critical region”; its triplication appears to be responsible for many features of Down's syndrome including mental retardation (4McCormick M.K.

Because of its high similarity with Drosophila MNB, DYRK1 is currently considered a candidate gene for the aberrant development of the brain that underlies mental retardation in Down's syndrome. The product of the human DYRK1 gene is nearly identical with rat DYRK1 (3 of 763 amino acids differ). Recently, Smith et al.(12Smith D.J. Stevens M.E. Sudanagunta S.P. Bronson R.T. Makhinson M. Watabe A.M. O'Dell T.J. Fung J. Weier H.-U.G. Cheng J.-F. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) reported that transgenic mice with a 180-kb fragment of human chromosome 21 including the DYRK1 gene exhibit defects in learning tasks. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yak1p is the protein kinase with the highest sequence similarity with MNB and DYRK1. TheYAK1 gene was identified as a functional antagonist of the RAS/protein kinase A pathway and has been characterized as a negative regulator of growth (13Garrett S. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14Garrett S. Menold M.M. Broach J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4045-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These kinases share several sequence motifs in the catalytic domain that distinguish them from all other known protein kinases, e.g. a conserved sequence motif in the activation loop including putative regulatory tyrosine residues. To define the family of DYRK-related kinases further, we report the identification and characterization of new members of the family. Our data indicate that DYRK-related kinases constitute a distinct family of protein kinases characterized by the structural similarity of their kinase domains and their capability to autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues. However, members of the DYRK family have unrelated sequences outside the catalytic domain and differ in their substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and subcellular localization. Total RNA was prepared from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (15Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) and from various rat tissues by the method of Chirgwin et al. (16Chirgwin J.N. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) as primer (First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Partial cDNAs of DYRK-related kinases were amplified by nested PCRs. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding with subdomains VIB and IX of the catalytic domain of serine/threonine kinases were used as primers in the first PCR (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). From the products of this reaction, partial cDNAs for DYRK-related kinases were amplified with the same forward primer and a reverse primer specific for a motif conserved in DYRK1, MNB, and Yak1p (amino acid sequence YIQSRFYR, oligonucleotide sequence 5′-TA(A/G)AA(A/C/G/T)C(G/T)(A/C/G/T)(C/G)(A/T)(C/T)TG(A/C/G/T)AT(A/G)TA-3′). For amplification of DYRK4A cDNA, a gene-specific primer (5′-TCAGCACCATCGTGAGGTCC-3′) was used as the reverse PCR primer. PCR products were cloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced. Cloned PCR products of two novel DYRK-related kinases were used as probes to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene). The sequences of the cDNA inserts were determined with overlapping fragments from both strands. Samples of total RNA (15 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1% agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon or nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond N+ or Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal loading of different samples was ascertained by ethidium bromide staining. Partial cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming to specific activities of 0.5–1 × 109 cpm/μg (17Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). The following cDNA sequences were used as probes: DYRK1A, bp 125–1680 of the rat cDNA clone (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); DYRK2, bp 1344–2154 of the human cDNA depicted in Fig. 2; DYRK3, complete human cDNA clone (Fig. 3). For DYRK1B and DYRK4A, the cloned murine PCR products were used (Fig. 1). Membranes were hybridized at 42 °C in 50% formamide at a probe concentration of 0.5–1 × 107 cpm/ml and subsequently washed three times at 55 °C in 120 mm NaCl, 12 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS. This degree of stringency was chosen to prevent cross-hybridization between cDNA probes and transcripts of DYRK1, DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4 whose mRNA sequences are 58–72% identical. Cross-reaction between DYRK1A/DYRK1B and DYRK4A/DYRK4B was not excluded.Figure 3Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of the cDNA of human DYRK3. The catalytic domain isboxed.

PCR products from murine 3T3-L1 cells. Partial cDNAs of DYRK-related kinases were amplified in two successive PCRs with nested degenerate primers and cloned as described under “Materials and Methods.” The sequence of a previously described partial murine cDNA clone (accession number U49952) was designated DYRK1C on the basis of this comparison. The degree of identity with DYRK1A is indicated behind the sequences. Residues identical with the corresponding amino acid in DYRK1 are designated by periods. For DYRK1B, DYRK1C, and DYRK4B, only nucleotides differing from the sequences of DYRK1A and DYRK4A, respectively, are given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression plasmids for GST-DYRK1A and its mutated version GST-DYRK1A-K188R have been previously described (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To create a GST-DYRK2 expression vector, a BamHI site was introduced at the presumed initiator codon of human DYRK2 cDNA by PCR. The modified DYRK2 cDNA (bp 386–3499) was then ligated into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) via the engineered BamHI site and a HindIII site in the 3′-untranslated region. For expression of DYRK3, aBspHI/EcoRI fragment of the cDNA (bp 252–2070) was inserted into the SmaI site of pGEX-2TK. For expression of Yak1p, a fragment of the YAK1 gene encoding the catalytic domain (amino acids 338–713 (13Garrett S. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)) was amplified with specific primers from yeast genomic DNA. Restriction sites (BamHI and EcoRI) for cloning into pGEX-2TK were introduced by appropriate design of the PCR primers. An MBP-MNB fusion clone was prepared by DNA amplification with the MNB isoform B cDNA (2Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) as the template. With the 5′-end primer (5′-CACCGGGATATCATGGACC-3′), a single mutation (A/G) was introduced in front of the initial ATG codon to create an EcoRV site, and an EcoRV-EcoRI fragment of the amplified MNB cDNA was cloned into the pMAL-c plasmid (New England Biolabs) digested with StuI and EcoRI. The cloned PCR products of DYRK2, Yak1p, and MNB were verified by sequencing. Transformants of Escherichia coli DH5α were induced with 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 2–3 h at 37 °C (GST-DYRK1, GST-DYRK2, GST-DYRK3, and MBP-MNB) or for 16 h at room temperature (GST-Yak1p) and lysed by sonication. Recombinant GST and MBP fusion proteins were purified by affinity adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and amylose-resin (New England Biolabs), respectively. cDNAs with full open reading frames for rat DYRK1A and human DYRK2 were inserted into the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to generate the respective N-terminal fusion of the kinase with GFP. Deletion constructs of GFP-DYRK1A as shown in Fig. 7 A were created by subcloning of cDNA fragments with the help of natural or PCR-generated restriction sites. All constructs were sequenced to ensure the accuracy of the reading frames and to verify the fidelity of the PCR. For microscopic analysis, COS-7 and HEK293 cells were seeded on coverslips and transiently transfected either with the help of commercially available transfection reagents (lipofection with DAC-30 from Eurogentec, Belgium; non-liposomal transfection with FuGENE 6, Boehringer Mannheim) or by calcium phosphate precipitation. No effect of the transfection method on the subcellular localization of the GFP fusion proteins was observed. 24 h after transfection (48 h for GFP-DYRK11–104), cells were washed 2× with phosphate-buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.6 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), fixed 20–30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed again 2× with phosphate-buffered saline and 1× with H2O, embedded in fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates), and visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot equipped for epifluorescence. 2–5 independent transfections were performed with each fusion construct, and at least two different samples were evaluated microscopically in each experiment. For subcellular fractionation, COS-7 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (18Wandel S. Schürmann A. Becker W. Summers S.A. Shanahan M.F. Joost H.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 3 days after transfection, cells were washed with cold TMNS buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) and scraped off the culture dishes. Combined cells from two 90-mm plates were resuspended in cold TMNS supplemented with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm vanadate) and disrupted in a Teflon glass potter (720 rpm, 1 min), and nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation (600 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 75 min, resulting in a supernatant of soluble proteins and a pellet containing membranes and any insoluble material that escaped sedimentation in the first centrifugation step, e.g. partially disrupted nuclei. The 600 × g pellet was resuspended in TMNS buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) Tween 20 and layered over a sucrose cushion (1.12 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA); nuclei were then sedimented at 45,000 ×g (4 °C, 60 min). Alternatively, nuclei were fractionated into the insoluble nuclear matrix and a soluble chromatin-containing fraction (19Berezney R. Coffey D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1410-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 20Berezney R. Coffey D.S. Science. 1975; 189: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The 600 × g pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors as above and RNase A and DNase I (each at 100 μg/ml). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 1m (NH4)2SO4 was added dropwise to a final concentration of 230 mm. Nuclear matrices were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g, 4 °C, for 5 min. As estimated by comparison of Coomassie-stained histone bands, 70–90% of the chromatin was extracted from the nuclei by this method. Aliquots of the protein samples corresponding to an equivalent portion of the original cell homogenate were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and probed with a GFP-specific antiserum (CLONTECH). Reacting bands were detected using a peroxidase-based chemiluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Tyrosine autophosphorylation of recombinant fusion proteins was detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories). To normalize for equal loading, the GST fusion proteins were quantified by Western blotting and subsequent immunochemical detection with a GST-specific antibody and125I-labeled protein A. The amount of MBP-MNB loaded onto the gel was adjusted by visual comparison of Coomassie-stained bands. Samples of the recombinant kinases were incubated in phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/ml) for 11 min (GST-DYRK1A and GST-DYRK2) or 30 min (GST-DYRK3 and MBP-MNB) at room temperature. Substrates were added to a final concentration of 8 μm (histones H3 and H2B, Boehringer Mannheim) or 0.25 mg/ml (histone type II-S, catalog number H6005, Sigma; 0.1 mg/ml in assays with DYRK1A and DYRK2). Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE (16% gels) and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. The time of exposure of the x-ray films was adjusted to give comparable band intensities with the different kinases. Based on a comparison of DYRK1, MNB, and Yak1p, a PCR cloning approach was designed to identify related kinases. Partial cDNAs of DYRK-related kinases were amplified from murine 3T3-L1 cells in two successive PCRs with nested primers. In the first PCR, degenerate oligonucleotide primers matching subdomains VIB and IX of protein serine/threonine kinases were used. In the second PCR, the same forward primer matching subdomain VIB was combined with a reverse primer corresponding with the YIQSRFYR motif before subdomain VIII that is fully conserved in DYRK1, MNB, and Yak1p (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, a reverse primer corresponding with the sequence of a human EST was used (GenBankTM accession number T93981). PCR products were cloned and characterized by sequencing. As illustrated in Fig. 1, cDNA sequences encoding seven different DYRK-related kinases were cloned. Six of the cDNAs encoded protein kinases with a sequence motif specific for DYRK-related kinases (DYRK, MNB, and Yak1p),i.e. the amino acids “Ser-Ser-Cys” following subdomain VII. The designation of the kinases was based on the different degree of similarity among the sequences. Four kinases that shared less than 70% identical amino acids in this region were designated DYRK1, DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4. Two pairs of closely related sequences (more than 95% of identical amino acids) were classified as isoenzymes (DYRK1A/B and DYRK4A/B). DYRK1A corresponds with the rat and murine “DYRK” as described previously (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Song W.-J. Sternberg L.R. Kasten-Sportès van Keuren M.L. Chung S.-H. Slack A.C. Miller D.E. Glover T.W. Chiang P.-W. Lou L. Kurnit D.M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of DYRK1B is identical with DYRK1A in this region, whereas the cDNA sequences are only 78% identical. In addition to DYRK1A and DYRK1B, the partial sequence of a third murine DYRK1 isoform was identified in a data base search (DYRK1C, GenBankTM accession number U49952). This cDNA sequence is 80% identical to DYRK1A and 88% identical to DYRK1B. Except for this data base entry, we found no sequence encoding a DYRK-related kinase that was not detected in our screen. One of the cloned kinases differed from DYRK1–4 in the length of the spacer between subdomain VIB and VII and did not contain the characteristic Ser-Ser-Cys motif. Except for one amino acid exchange, its sequence is identical with that of a human protein kinase, PKY, expressed in multidrug-resistant cell lines (21Begley D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Sampson K.E. Abraham I. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By sequence similarity of their catalytic domains, DYRK-related kinases are the closest relatives of PKY (37–40% of identity). However, PKY lacks some characteristic features of DYRK, MNB and Yak1p, e.g. a cysteine in subdomain VIB and the Tyr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop. Cloned PCR products of DYRK2 and DYRK3 were used to isolate full-length cDNA clones from a human fetal brain cDNA library. Seven cDNA clones of DYRK2 differing in the length of the 3′-untranslated region were isolated. In three clones, the poly(A) tail began only 184 bases after the stop codon (Fig. 2), whereas 4 of the cDNAs contained 1461 additional nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region. The existence of additional transcripts with an even longer 3′-untranslated region can be predicted from the sequences of four ESTs that were identified in the data base (GenBankTM accession numbers R63190, R63622, R25341, and Z25301). Furthermore, of three cDNA clones that contained the 5′-end of the transcript, one differed from the others by the presence of a 149-bp insertion (Fig. 2). Due to the shift of the reading frame, the protein encoded by this cDNA clone may start at a different initiator codon and thus contain 73 additional amino acids at its N terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence of DYRK2 appears to be identical with a human kinase that has previously been presented as a partial sequence (PSK-H2) in an alignment of catalytic domains of kinases (22Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Differences of 5 amino acids may represent errors in the sequence of PSK-H2. However, in the absence of information on the nucleotide sequence of PSK-H2, it cannot be excluded that PSK-H2 is encoded by a different gene than DYRK2. A 2170-bp cDNA clone of DYRK3 was isolated that comprised an open reading frame of 550 codons and a poly(A)-tail (Fig. 3). There is no in-frame stop codon before the first ATG codon. However, the sequence preceding this putative initiator codon appears “non-coding” as judged from the unusually high proportion of rare codons when compared with “average” human proteins. According to the codon usage table for human proteins (23Wada, K., Wada, Y., Doi, H., Ishibashi, F., Gojobori, T. & Ikemura, T. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. 19, (suppl.) 1981–1983Google Scholar), 9 codons (11%) in the first 252 nucleotides were considered “rare,” in contrast to only 20 in the 550 codons of the open reading frame starting with nucleotide 253 (3.6%; rare codon threshold 0.1). We therefore conclude that one of the two consecutive ATG codons at nucleotides 253–258 (Fig. 3) is most likely the initiator codon of DYRK3. Recently, a partial cDNA sequence of human DYRK3 was published as a data base entry (GenBankTMaccession number U69558). This clone contains an insertion of 95 nucleotides relative to the clone presented in Fig. 3 and most probably represents an alternatively spliced version of the transcript. This longer transcript contains an ATG codon that initiates an open reading frame encoding 15 additional N-terminal amino acids relative to the sequence shown in Fig. 3. Both DYRK2 and DYRK3 contain a canonical kinase domain (22Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) that is located between a large N-terminal domain (149 and 173 amino acids, respectively) and a short C-terminal extension (66 amino acids). The sequences exhibit the specific features of DYRK-related kinases (DYRK1, MNB, and Yak1p), including the motif Ser-Ser-Cys (SSC) in subdomain VII, a cysteine residue in subdomain VIB, and the conserved sequence in the activation loop (YXYIQSRFY, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). DYRK2 and DYRK3 are related over their entire sequences except for the first 100 amino acids of the N-terminal region (72% of identical amino acids). In contrast, their similarity with DYRK1 is restricted to the catalytic domain (46 and 43% of identity, respectively) and a small region of 20 amino acids immediately preceding the catalytic domain. DYRK2 and DYRK3 lack the striking sequence motifs that were identified in DYRK1, e.g. a nuclear targeting sequence, a PEST region, and a stretch of 13 consecutive histidine residues (1Kentrup H.

Targeting of integral membrane proteins to compartments of the endosomal-lysosomal system and to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells is largely dependent upon sorting signals contained within the cytosolic domains of the proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Mellman I.

The signals consist of short, degenerate sequences that conform to any of several consensus motifs. One of the most extensively characterized motifs contains a critical tyrosine residue within the canonical sequence YXXØ (Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and Ø is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain (leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, valine)) (Refs. 4Canfield W.M.

YXXØ-adaptor interactions result in selective incorporation of the integral membrane proteins into coated vesicles that carry proteins to different destinations within the cell. AP-1 is responsible for the delivery of proteins from thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 to the endosomal-lysosomal system, whereas AP-2 mediates rapid internalization of endocytic receptors from the plasma membrane (1Mellman I.

Recent studies suggest that AP-3 is involved in an alternative pathway of protein transport from the TGN or endosomes to lysosomal compartments (18Ooi C.E. Moreira J.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Poy G.

It has been proposed that YXXØ signals are not all functionally equivalent but may be recognized with a characteristic fine specificity by each adaptor complex (2Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of tyrosine-based signals have suggested that this is indeed the case, as both the identity of the X and Ø residues and the position of the signal within the cytosolic domain are important determinants of interactions with different adaptor medium subunits (8Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, targeted mutagenesis has proven too limited an approach for defining the requirements for specific recognition of tyrosine-based signals by adaptor medium subunits. A potentially more powerful approach is the screening of combinatorial libraries. This method has permitted a detailed analysis of associations between phosphotyrosine-containing sequences and protein interaction modules such as SH2 and PTB domains (23Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we performed an analysis of μ2 binding specificity by screening a combinatorial XXXXtetrapeptide library using the yeast two-hybrid system. All the tetrapeptides selected by μ2 conformed to the consensus sequence YXXØ, with YXRL tetrapeptides exhibiting the highest apparent affinity (11Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, attempts to use theXXXX library to characterize the sequence preferences of μ1, μ3A, and μ3B were unsuccessful because of the presence of unfavorable amino acid residues (i.e. two alanines) amino-terminal to the tyrosine residue (8Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the selectivity for interaction of tyrosine-based sorting signals with μ1, μ2, μ3A, and μ3B through screening of a new combinatorial XXXYXXØ library using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results of these analyses revealed that each medium subunit binds YXXØ signals with distinct sequence preferences, although there is also a considerable degree of specificity overlap. A DNA fragment encoding the 33-amino acid cytosolic tail of TGN38 (25Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) was engineered to delete codons for the last 12 amino acids and to add an EagI site by introduction of silent mutations in place of the codons for Arg21 and Pro22 (AGGCCA to CGGCCG). This construct was made by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: CGGAATTCCACAACAAACGA-AAGATTAT and CCGCTCGAGCGGCCGTCTAGTGACTTTGGATCT. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into theEcoRI and SalI sites of pGBT9(TRP1) (CLONTECH) to yield the plasmid pGBT9-TGNΔ-EagI. A random oligonucleotide library of sequence CCCGGCCGAAGNNNNNNNNNTACNNNNNNNT(C/G)TGACTGCAGTC was annealed via a palindromic sequence at the 3′ end containing the restriction sites EagI and PstI (underlined). After conversion to double-stranded DNA by mutually primed synthesis, the oligonucleotide was digested with EagI and PstI and ligated into pGBT9-TGNΔ-EagI cut withEagI and PstI. Competent Escherichia coli cells (Max Efficiency DH5α, Life Technologies, Inc.) were transformed with the resulting plasmids to yield a combinatorial DNA library with 1.3 × 107 transformants. The amino acid sequence encoded by the resulting clones was HNKRKIIAFALEGKRSKVTRRPKXXXYXXØ. The critical tyrosine residue was fixed because it has been shown that tyrosine is essential for interaction with the adaptor medium subunits (8Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 10Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Fixing the tyrosine residue had the added advantage of reducing the complexity of the library. For the same reasons, the last amino acid was restricted to Leu, Ile, Phe, Met, or Val. The theoretical complexity of the library was 8.6 × 109 different amino acid sequences. Ten library clones were selected at random and their nucleotide sequences determined. The frequencies of the four nucleotides at the N positions of this random sample were as follows: G, 20; A, 40; T, 75; and C, 25. Based on these data, the expected frequencies for each amino acid at the X positions were as follows: Ala and Asp, 1.95%; Cys, 3.66%; Glu, 1.17%; Phe, 13.73%; Gly, 1.56%; His and Pro, 2.44%; Ile, 10.25%; Lys, 2.34%; Leu, 15.56%; Met and Gln, 1.46%; Asn and Thr, 3.91%; Arg, 3.13%; Ser, 9.28%; Val, 5.86%; Trp, 0.73%; Tyr, 7.32%; and stop codons, 5.86%. The expected frequencies at position Y+3 (Ø) were as follows: Phe, 26.04%; Ile, 13.89%; Leu, 36.46%; Met, 11.11%; and Val, 12.50%. The yeast strain HF7c (MATa) (CLONTECH) was first transformed with GAL4ad-μ1, -μ2, -μ3A, or -μ3B (all in the pACTII(LEU2) plasmid) and plated onto yeast dropout agar plates lacking leucine as described in the protocol for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). The μ2 construct used in the initial screening of the library was GAL4ad-3M2 (10Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). This construct lacks four nucleotides at the 3′ end of the coding sequence and thus displays a weaker affinity for tyrosine-based sorting signals. Use of this weakened μ2 construct resulted in the selection of only those signals that displayed the strongest affinity for μ2. Subsequent analyses of interactions of all of the isolated signals with μ2 were done using GAL4ad-μ2+E5 (26Ohno H. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 2: 187-193Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) encoding full-length μ2; this construct exhibits stronger binding affinity for YXXØ signals. Transformants containing the different medium subunit constructs were retransformed with the combinatorial DNA library and selected on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan for selection of cotransformants and histidine for selection of interacting clones; colonies that grew on these plates were tested for β-galactosidase activity. Colonies expressing β-galactosidase were cultured in dropout medium containing leucine but lacking tryptophan to obtain cells carrying only the library plasmid and not the medium subunit plasmid. The resulting cells were then mated with the yeast strain Y187 (MATα) transformed with each of the GAL4ad-μ constructs or with pTD1–1 (SV40 large-T antigen cDNA in pACTII; negative control for histidine auxotrophy and β-galactosidase activity) to test the binding specificity of library clones. Quantitative assays for growth in the presence of varying concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT, Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) and β-galactosidase chemiluminescence assays were performed as described (14Aguilar R.C. Ohno H. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27160-27166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on the sequences selected by each adaptor medium subunit from the combinatorial library, an experimental (observed) frequency was calculated for each residue at each position of the XXXYXXØ sequence. Preferences were evaluated by calculating the difference between the observed and the expected frequencies (ΔF) divided by the standard error of the difference (SED). SED values were calculated according to the following error propagation formula, SED=(SEFO2+SEFE2)1/2(Eq. 1) in which SEF represents the standard error of the frequencies (O, observed; E, expected) (27Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). SEF was calculated according to the formula SEF=[f(1−f)/n]1/2(Eq. 2) in which f is the residue frequency and nis the number of sequences analyzed (27Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). We considered to be significantly different from 0 (random) any ΔF/SED value above 2 (i.e. favored) or below −2 (i.e. disfavored). In some cases, we lowered the stringency of the statistical analyses and considered as significant values of ΔF/SED higher than 1 or lower than −1. A combinatorial plasmid library encoding the sequence XXXYXXØ fused to the carboxyl terminus of GAL4bd was coexpressed with GAL4ad-μ1, -μ2, -μ3A, or -μ3B plasmid constructs into the appropriate yeast strain. Library clones that conferred the ability to grow in medium lacking histidine and that exhibited β-galactosidase activity when expressed in combination with either of the medium subunits were isolated for further analyses. The total numbers of clones isolated for each medium subunit were as follows: 36 for μ1, 33 for μ2, 52 for μ3A, and 14 for μ3B. The amino acid sequences of the isolated XXXYXXØ clones, as inferred from DNA sequencing, are listed in Fig. 1. Each of these clones was tested for interaction with μ1, μ2, μ3A, or μ3B using yeast two-hybrid plate assays (Fig. 1). The frequencies with which specific amino acid residues appeared at each of the X and Ø positions (i.e. observed frequencies) were compared to the random frequencies predicted from the nucleotide composition of the library (i.e. expected frequencies) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of these analyses for each of the medium subunits are shown in Fig. 2. Positive or negative ΔF/SED values correspond to residues that were favored or disfavored, respectively. Residues with ΔF/SED values >2 or <−2, considered to be the most significant, are shown in Table I. Also shown in Table I are some residues with values of 1<ΔF/SED<2 or −1>ΔF/SED>−2, which were judged to be significant with a lower level of stringency. The most salient features of the signals revealed by these analyses are discussed in the following sections.Figure 2Statistical analysis of favored and disfavored residues. The preferences for residues within theXXXYXXØ sequence were inferred from ΔF/SED values (y axis, see “Experimental Procedures” for details) at each position.

The combinatorial analyses reported here confirmed this characteristic of YXXØ signals at the level of interactions with the adaptor medium subunits. The results showed that there was no absolute requirement for the presence of specific residues at any of the X or Ø positions. This contrasted with the critical tyrosine (Tyr) residue that could not be substituted by any other residue without a dramatic decrease in sorting activity (2Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T.

Also of note is the fact that none of the sequences isolated in the combinatorial screens conformed to the NPXY motif, another consensus sequence for tyrosine-based endocytic signals (28Chen J.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could be due to the presence of unfavorable residues upstream of the first X residue of the library or to an intrinsically lower binding affinity of NPXY motifs for the medium subunits. Another possibility is that NPXY signals are not recognized by the adaptor medium subunits but by other components of clathrin coats. Although many different residues were tolerated at theX and Ø positions of YXXØ signals, each medium subunit exhibited characteristic preferences for certain sets of residues, as discussed below.Table IIYXX∅-type signals involved in internalization and lysosomal targetingProteinsTyrosine-based signalsInternalization signals Transferrin receptor (human)PLSYTRF Asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 (human)TKEYQDL CI Man 6-P receptor (bovine)SYKYSKV CD Man 6-P receptor (bovine)PAAYRGV CD1b (human)RRSYQNI Poly-Ig receptor (mouse)DMAYSAF HIV gp41RQGYSPL Igα (human)ENLYEGL EGF receptor (human)SNFYRAL CTLA-4 (human)TGVYVKM Furin (mouse)LISYKGL TGN38 (rat)ASDYQRLLysosomal targeting signals Lamp-1 (mouse)HAGYQTI Lamp-2a (mouse)HTGYEQF Lamp-2a (chicken)NTGYEQF Lamp-2b (chicken)RTGYQSV Lamp-2c (chicken)YAGYQTL Macrosialin (mouse)QSTYQPL CD63 (mouse)RSGYEVM Acid phosphatase (human)PPGYRHV CD3-γ (mouse)EQVYQPL HLA-DM (human)HSSYTPL GMP-17 (mouse)RAEYETL GMP-17 (human)RPGYETL TRP-2 (mouse)RKGYAPL Cystinosin (human)RPGYDQLSequences were obtained from either the GenBank or Swissprot databases.

Some of the internalization signals may also participate in transport to late endosomal compartments, the TGN, or the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells. All medium subunits displayed a clear preference for proline at Y+2 (Fig. 2 and Table I). In addition, μ1, μ3A, and μ3B, but not μ2, preferred arginine at Y−3 (Fig. 2 and Table I). In general, residues with hydrophobic side chains were disfavored at the X positions (Table I). μ1 was found to prefer arginine at Y−3, serine at Y−2, leucine or aspartic acid at Y−1, proline at Y+2, and leucine at Y+3 (Ø) (Fig. 2 and Table I). Disfavored residues were phenylalanine, leucine, or isoleucine at Y−3, leucine at Y−2, isoleucine at Y−1 and Y+2, and phenylalanine, methionine, or valine at Y+3 (Ø) (Fig. 2 and Table I). Interestingly, the sequences RSLYRPL and RSLYLPL were independently isolated four and five times, respectively (Fig. 1). The high frequency of these sequences may be due to the fact that they contain all the residues identified as favorable for interactions with μ1 (Table I). Preferences for μ2 were glycine at Y−3, phenylalanine at Y−2, proline at Y−1, proline or arginine at Y+2, and leucine at Y+3 (Ø) (Fig. 2 and Table I). The preferences for arginine at Y+2 and leucine at Y+3 (Ø) are in agreement with the results from our previous screening of an XXXX combinatorial library (11Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Disfavored residues were phenylalanine at Y+2 and valine at Y+3 (Fig. 2 and Table I). μ3A preferred arginine at Y−3, aspartic or glutamic acid at Y−1, glutamic acid at Y+1, proline at Y+2, and isoleucine at Y+3 (Ø) (Fig. 2 and Table I). With a lower level of statistical significance, glycine was also favored at Y−1. Disfavored residues were isoleucine at Y−3, serine at Y+1, phenylalanine or leucine at Y+2, and phenylalanine, methionine, or valine at the Y+3 (Ø) position (Fig. 2 and Table I). μ3B is a closely related homolog of μ3A (84% identity in primary sequence), which is expressed only in cells of neuronal origin (29Pevsner J. Volknandt W. Wong B.R. Scheller R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our laboratory previously demonstrated that μ3B binds YXXØ signals with relatively low affinity in the yeast two-hybrid system (12Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the number of YXXØ clones isolated for μ3B was smaller than those isolated for μ1, μ2, and μ3A (Fig. 1). Moreover, even the sequences that were selected by μ3B interacted better with μ1, μ2, or μ3A (Fig. 1). μ3B preferred arginine at Y−3 and glutamic acid at Y+1. With a lower level of statistical significance, μ3B also displayed preferences for serine at Y−2, aspartic acid at Y−1, and proline or glutamic acid at Y+2 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Phenylalanine was disfavored at Y+3 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Overall, μ3B preferences more closely resembled those of μ3A (Table I), as would have been expected from their high degree of sequence identity. The description of preferences summarized in Table I does not reflect the fact that some combinations of amino acid residues within the same sequence were found at a frequency that was severalfold higher than that expected from the observed frequencies of the individual amino acids. For example, the sequence XXGYXXF was selected by μ2 with a frequency that was 8-fold higher than that calculated from the observed frequencies of glycine at Y−1 and phenylalanine at Y+3. This means that, even though glycine or phenylalanine were not individually favored at those positions (Fig. 2and Table I), they were preferred when present in combination. In contrast, t"

Cationic liposome complexation to DNA is a powerful method for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. Formation of cationic liposome-DNA complexes (CLDC)1 protects the DNA and provides a vehicle that delivers the DNA into cells (1Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M.

However, studies of in vivo cationic liposome-mediated gene delivery by intravenous injection have shown that some tissues are better transfected than others, e.g. lung and heart (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endothelial cells and resident macrophages seem to be transfected preferentially over other cell types (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These indications of specificity pose both possibilities and problems in expressing biologically relevant genes in appropriate cells in vivo. Understanding the mechanism of CLDC delivery into cells is important for controlling both the efficiency and the sites of gene transfer and expression. Electron microscopy studies have described some of the events of gene transfer by lipopolylysine or cationic liposome complexes (10Zhou X. Huang L. Biochim. Biophys.

A major step toward elucidating the mechanism of CLDC delivery in cells is to identify the proteins and molecules on the cell surface responsible for uptake of CLDC. Knowledge of the functional molecules mediating CLDC uptake may result in strategies that allow efficient transfection of more tissue or cell types in vivo. Alternatively, understanding the mechanism of CLDC uptake may lead to more efficient protocols for transfecting greater numbers of cells within a given tissue. Finally, definition of the cell surface markers that bind to CLDC is essential before methods for targeting genes to specific tissues and cell types may be designed. In this paper, we focus on identifying molecules on the cell surface involved in the delivery of CLDC bearing a net positive charge across the plasma membrane both in transfected cells and following systemic delivery in animals. Proteoglycans perform a wide variety of functions (for reviews, see Refs. 15Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin.

Proteoglycans also function in the binding and entry of many viruses into cells (see Ref.22Sawitzky D. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 184: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar for review), including herpes simplex virus (23WuDunn D. Spear P. J.

Norcross M.A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans can also act as reservoirs for growth factors (26Gallagher J.T. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 32: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nietfeld J.J. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 456-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Imai K. Hiramatsu A. Fukushima D.

Illustrating the diversity of functions encompassed by these proteins, proteoglycans are also involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism (32Mahley R.W. Israel J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 414-429PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ji Z.-S. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans have been shown to mediate gene transfer into cultured cells by methods relying on polylysine or cationic liposomes (35Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that cell surface proteoglycans may play a role in the uptake of CLDC in vivo. However, it has also been shown that soluble heparin sulfate can release DNA from CLDC in vitro, suggesting that glycosaminoglycan-bearing proteoglycans present in serum or interstitial fluids may block CLDC-based transfection by releasing DNA from CLDC and preventing internalization of the DNA (36Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 37Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11493-11498Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The role of proteoglycans in mediating CLDC-based gene delivery in vivo is, therefore, unknown. We present evidence that proteoglycans play a significant role in CLDC-mediated delivery and expression of heterologous genes bothin vitro and in vivo. The proteoglycan syndecan-1 is, in particular, implicated as a mediator of gene transfer in vitro. Heparinase I pretreatment in vivo demonstrates the specific importance of heparan sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans in CLDC-based, intravenous transfection in mice. The mechanism of inhibition of gene transfer and expression by pretreatment with either polysaccharides (fucoidan or heparin) or heparinasein vivo is by limiting the uptake of CLDC by cells, suggesting that proteoglycans on the cell surface play a crucial role in uptake of CLDC in vivo. The construction of p4241 has been described (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat.

For CLDC transfections in vitro, 1–2 × 105 cells were plated per well in 12- or 24-well plates. Cell types used were hamster CHO cells, mouse B16 melanoma cells, the human prostate cancer lines PPC-1 and DU-145, the human breast cancer line MDA-435, Raji cells, and Raji cells stably transfected with syndecan-1. CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). B16 and PPC-1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 with 5% and 10% FBS, respectively. DU-145 and MDA-435 were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution plus 10% FBS and Liebovitz's L15 plus 10% FBS, respectively. Raji wild type and syndecan-1 stably transfected Raji (S1-Raji) cells were a generous gift of A. Rapraeger (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS, supplemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B for S1-Raji. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2, with the exception of MDA-435, which was grown without CO2. Cells were transfected as described previously (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Prior to CLDC transfection, cells were treated with fucoidan (50,000 M r), dextran (40,000 M r), or dextran sulfate (500,000M r) purchased from Sigma. Heparin was purchased from SoloPak Laboratories, Inc. (Elk Grove Village, IL). All luciferase assays were performed as described (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D.

Calcium phosphate transfections were performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Adenoviral infection of PPC-1 cells was performed as described previously (44Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Biotech. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Each mouse received 50 μg of p4241 complexed to rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine-DOTIM:cholesterol MLV at a ratio of 1:16 (μg of DNA/nmol of total lipid). ICR female mice weighing approximately 25 g each (Simonson, Gilroy, CA) received 200 μl of CLDC intravenously by tail vein injection. Pretreatments of mice were also by intravenous tail vein injections. Fucoidan, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, was pre-injected at a dosage of 500 μg/mouse in a volume of 100 μl at 0, 1, 2, 10, 24, or 48 h prior to CLDC injection. Heparinase I and III (Sigma) were dissolved in 0.15 m sodium chloride at a concentration of 75 units/100 μl, and 100 μl/mouse were injected 15 min prior to injection of CLDC. Control mice were preinjected at appropriate times with either phosphate-buffered saline or 0.15 m sodium chloride. As an additional control, heparinase I was boiled for 10 min to denature and deactivate the enzyme prior to pre-injection. Mice were harvested 24 h after CLDC injection, and pieces of lung, liver, heart, and spleen were placed in 1× lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) on ice for luciferase assays (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C.

Two hundred nanograms of DNA per lane were fractionated on 1% agarose, 1× TAE gels overnight. Blotting onto Hybond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), prehybridization, hybridization, and washes were performed as described (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 1.2-kilobase pairHindIII/EcoRV gel-purified fragment of luciferase from p4241 was radioactively labeled using the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Nuclei were isolated from 2 × 106 B16 cells as described (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar), and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Nuclear DNA was isolated from washed nuclei using the same technique as for total DNA isolation (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Pellets of B16 melanoma nuclei were generated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min in 15-ml plastic conical centrifuge tubes. The supernatant was carefully aspirated from the pellet, which was fixed by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature. The fixed pellet was rinsed with phosphate buffer, and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After postfixing, the pellet was rinsed in phosphate buffer, and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions (35% v/v, 50% v/v, 70% v/v, 80% v/v for 5 min each; 95% v/v, and three changes of 100% v/v for 10 min each.) After dehydration, the pellet was infiltrated with unaccelerated Durcupan ACM epoxy resin (components A/M, B, D; Fluka Chemie AG, Switzerland) for 2 h at 60 °C, then exchanged with accelerated Durcupan ACM (components A/M, B, C, D), and polymerized for 36 h at 70 °C. Samples were sectioned on a Reichert-Jung ultra-microtome. Sections (80 nm) were collected and placed on 300-mesh, thin bar copper grids (EMS, Fort Washington, PA), which were then post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (10 and 15 min, respectively) at 60 °C. Sections were viewed, and micrographs taken, on a Philips CM120 STEM electron microscope at 60 kV. One ml of CLDC was made at a DNA to lipid ratio of 1:8, such that the final concentration of DNA was 2 μg/100 μl. CLDC were made with either DOTIM:DOPE SUV or DOTAP:DOPE SUV. One hundred microliters of the resulting complex was treated with 1 μm fucoidan or 1 μm dextran sulfate for 10 min or left untreated, and then subjected to DNase I digestion with 10–20 units of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for periods of 5, 30, or 90 min. Two micrograms of DNA in 100 μl, uncomplexed to liposomes, were treated with 10–20 units of DNase I for 5 and 30 min alone or in the presence of 1 μm fucoidan or dextran sulfate. CLDC and naked DNA were made in 5% dextrose with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.9 mm manganese chloride to mimic the reaction conditions of DNase I treatment. No evidence of either precipitation or microaggregation of liposome-DNA complexes was observed under these conditions. One hundred microliters of each sample were extracted once with phenol:chloroform (1:1) and extracted twice with chloroform, and 50 μl were loaded on 1% agarose gels in 1× TAE for a load of 1 μg of DNA/well. Raji cells stably expressing syndecan-1 were transfectable by CLDC in a manner dependent on the net positive charge of the complex (Fig. 1), indicating that the syndecan-1 proteoglycan functions in the uptake of CLDC in vitro. Wild type Raji cells were essentially untransfectable by CLDC (Fig. 1). However, wild type Raji cells that had been stably transfected with the syndecan-1 gene were more efficiently transfected by CLDC (Fig. 1). Furthermore, CLDC-mediated transfection of syndecan-1-bearing cells increased significantly as the complex became more positive in net charge (Fig. 1). Cells were transfected with CLDC made at ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6 (μg of DNA/nmol of total lipid), and the greatest difference in CLDC-transfection efficiency between wild type and syndecan-1 stable transfectants was seen with CLDC made at a ratio of 1:6. These data showed that, in Raji cell culture, proteoglycan expression is critical for efficient CLDC-mediated transfection. Because the positive cationic head group of CLDC interacting with a negatively charged cell surface molecule appeared to be the mechanism of CLDC uptake, pretreatment with a polyanionic compound could interfere with transfection. Pretreatment of cells with fucoidan, heparin, or dextran sulfate, all polysulfated polysaccharides, largely blocked CLDC transfection in vitro (Fig. 2 A). Both heparin and heparan sulfate have previously been reported to block transfection mediated by polylysine-DNA complexes (35Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Concentrations of fucoidan, heparin, or dextran sulfate as low as 100 nm were sufficient to inhibit transfection of murine B16 cells (Fig. 2 A). Dextran sulfate, which blocked transfection at 10 nm, was the most efficient inhibitor of CLDC transfection. The charge of the polysaccharide appeared to be the significant factor in inhibiting CLDC transfection. Uncharged dextran, with a molecular weight similar to that of the fucoidan, failed to inhibit transfection, and even caused a significant elevation of transfection at high concentrations (Fig. 2 A). Similar levels of inhibition of CLDC-mediated transfection by fucoidan was observed in PPC-1, MDA-435, DU-145, and CHO cells as well (data not shown). A concentration of fucoidan (10 nm) that has little effect on CLDC-mediated transfection was, nevertheless, more effective at inhibiting transfection when pretreatment with fucoidan was performed on CLDC rather than on cells (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, fucoidan inhibited the transfection of cells primarily when using methods relying on positive charge, i.e. CLDC and calcium phosphate. The 1 μm level of fucoidan, which inhibited CLDC and calcium-mediated transfection, did not interfere with adenoviral or electroporation methods of transfection in vitro (Fig. 2 C). Fucoidan inhibited CLDC-mediated transfection in vitro by blocking DNA uptake by cells. Nuclei were isolated from cells untreated or pretreated with fucoidan and subsequently transfected with CLDC, and nuclear DNA was assayed for the presence of the luciferase plasmid used in making the complex. The nuclei of cells untreated with fucoidan contained luciferase plasmid (Fig. 3), as expected from the high levels of luciferase activity observed in untreated cells (see Fig. 2 A). Therefore, DNA did traverse the cell membranes of untreated cells (Fig. 3). In comparison, cells pretreated for 30 min with 1 μm fucoidan did not express luciferase (see Fig. 2 A) and had no luciferase DNA in their nuclei (Fig. 3). Southern analysis of total DNA from whole cell extracts failed to show evidence of any DNA crossing the cell membranes of cultured cells pretreated with fucoidan (Fig. 3). Electron microscopy showed that nuclei preparations were free of plasma membrane, indicating that extranuclear DNA bound to membranes was not a source of contaminating DNA (Fig. 3 B). DOPE or cholesterol containing cationic liposomes were capable of protecting DNA from digestion, even in the presence of fucoidan, making it unlikely that disruption of the CLDC is the mechanism by which fucoidan inhibits both DNA uptake and subsequent reporter gene expression in cells. Previously, dextran sulfate has been shown to disrupt DNA complexed to liposomes composed purely of cationic lipid (36Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 37Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11493-11498Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether DNA was also released from CLDC prepared from a 1:1 cationic lipid:DOPE mixture, CLDC were incubated for 10 min with 1 μm fucoidan and subjected to nuclease digestion for 5, 30, and 90 min. Virtually no degradation of DNA was observed in CLDC pretreated with fucoidan at any time point (Fig. 4). Similar liposome-mediated protection of DNA was observed when CLDC were preincubated with dextran sulfate (Fig. 4). Conversely, DNA unprotected by complexing to liposomes was readily degraded by a 90-min exposure to DNase I (Fig. 4). Digestion of DNA by DNase I was complete by 5 min in the presence of fucoidan or dextran sulfate (Fig. 4), indicating that these polysaccharides did not inhibit DNase I activity under the conditions tested. Multilamellar vesicles of DOTIM:cholesterol were equally capable of protecting DNA in complexes from DNase I digestion (data not shown). However, CLDC made with pure cationic lipid (DOTAP alone) did not protect DNA from DNase I digestion whether with or without fucoidan pretreatment (data not shown), as previously reported (36Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 37Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11493-11498Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although it is not always true that in vitro observations are repeated in vivo (38Solodin I. Brown C.S. Bruno M. Chow C. Jang E.-H. Debs R. Heath T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13537-13544Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 39Thierry A.R. Rabinovich P. Peng B. Mahan L.C. Bryant J.L. Gallo R.C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), fucoidan also inhibited luciferase expression levels in mice injected with CLDC. Mice were pretreated with fucoidan for various time periods before intravenous injection of CLDC. Twenty-four hours after CLDC injection, tissues were assayed for luciferase activity and compared with the level of luciferase expression in tissues from mice not pretreated with fucoidan. Lung and heart tissues, the tissues most efficiently transfected by intravenous injection of CLDC containing DOTIM:cholesterol MLV (9Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), showed drastic reductions in luciferase activity after mice were pretreated for 1 h with fucoidan (Fig. 5 A). Longer pretreatments with fucoidan resulted in less significant effects on CLDC-mediated transfection efficiency, presumably due to ongoing clearance of the highly negatively charged fucoidan from the circulation. The magnitude of luciferase depression in tissues pretreated for 1 h with fucoidan in vivo is similar to that seen in vitro, i.e. approximately 100-fold. Southern analysis of total DNA from mouse lungs and livers showed decreased levels of p4241 plasmid in the tissues of animals pretreated with fucoidan for 1 h (Table I). Nuclear DNA isolated from lungs also showed a 3-fold decrease in p4241 plasmid present in fucoidan treated animals compared with untreated animals (Table I). A 1-h pretreatment with fucoidan also resulted in significantly decreased levels of rhodamine-lipid found in the lung and liver (data not shown), as assayed by extraction of total lipids from tissues and fluorometric quantitation of the rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine MLV. Thesein vivo data concur with our in vitroobservations in which fucoidan pretreatment resulted in lowered levels of DNA delivered into cells by CLDC, leading to significantly reduced luciferase expression.Table IFucoidan or heparinase I treatment inhibits DNA uptake by tissues in vivoSampleTotal DNAp valueNuclear DNAp valueLungs CLDC only2,441,875897,394 1 h fucoidan534,435≤0.025*293,069≤0.005* 2 h fucoidan1,619,559<0.375402,747≤0.01* 10 h fucoidan1,753,617≤0.3751,040,976≤0.375 Saline/CLDC544,635 Boiled heparinase659,029≤0.375ND Heparinase338,342≤0.01*Livers CLDC only633,324 1 h fucoidan618,629>0.4 2 h fucoidan438,449≤0.375ND 10 h fucoidan656,217>0.4 Saline/CLDC583,882 Boiled heparinase330,028≤0.1ND Heparinase450,161≤0.375Quantitation of DNA isolated from tissues was performed by phosphorimaging of a Southern blot hybridized by a luciferase probe.

Obesity is the result of an imbalance in energy intake and expenditure. This condition is associated with a number of pathological conditions, including non-insulin-dependent diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and insulin resistance, that are characterized typically by inappropriately elevated plasma levels of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and lipoproteins. Homeostatic mechanisms that coordinate the storage and use of energy from the constituents of a meal are disturbed in this condition, leading to exaggerated adipose tissue deposition. As a result there is a commensurate increase in the synthesis and secretion of the adipose tissue hormone leptin, a recently discovered factor that acts on the hypothalamus to inhibit food intake and increase energy expenditure (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar). The importance of leptin in the regulation of energy balance is accentuated by the profound early onset obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance exhibited by obese (ob/ob) mice, the genetic strain that lacks functional leptin (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar). Upon administration of the recombinant hormone to these mice, they, and to a lesser extent their lean littermates, exhibit a marked reduction in weight and a lowering of plasma insulin and glucose concentrations (2Campfield L.A.

A phenotypically similar strain, the diabetic (db/db) mouse, has a defect in the leptin receptor and has been shown to be unresponsive to leptin in a number of in vivo and in vitro experiments (4Chen H.

Although seemingly rare, examples of leptin deficiency in humans demonstrate that the hormone plays a similar role in humans as it does in rodents (9Montague C.T. Farooqi I.S. Whitehead J.P.

Nature. 1997; 387: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). However, the parallel elevation of leptin levels with increased adiposity observed in the majority of rodent obesity models and obese humans implicates a leptin resistance mechanism rather than leptin deficiency as a likely defect contributing to obesity. The leptin receptor (OB-R)1(10Tartaglia L.A. Dembeki M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sankey S. Moriaty A. Moore K.J. Smutko J.S.

Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Class I cytokine receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and are activated by ligand-induced receptor homo- or heterodimerization or oligomerization before the activation of receptor-associated kinases of the Janus family. The leptin receptor oligomerizes with itself (12Baumann H. Morella K.K. White D.W. Dembski M. Barton P.S. Kim H. Lai C.-H. Tartaglia L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8374-8378Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Multiple OB-R isoforms exist, of which at least two, OB-Ra and OB-Rb, are generated by alternative splicing (4Chen H. Churfat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Wang X. Ellis S.J. Lukey N.D. Culpepper J. Moore K.J. Breitbart L.F. Duyk G.M. Tepper R.L. Morgenstern J.P.

One soluble isoform exists, OB-Re, which lacks the transmembrane domain. The OB-Rb isoform contains a full-length cytosolic domain of 302 amino acids that includes binding motifs required for activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway. A point mutation (Gly→Thr) in the mouse diabetes (db) gene results in a novel splice donor site and a premature translation termination (4Chen H. Churfat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Wang X.

The truncated OB-R(db) lacks the sequence motifs required for the interaction with JAK and STAT, and evidence from the db/db mouse model suggests that OB-Rb is the sole receptor that can mediate JAK/STAT activation and leptin-mediated effects on food intake and cell proliferation (4Chen H.

It has been demonstrated that leptin can activate the JAK/STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways in a variety of in vitro systems (7Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A.

To date, leptin signaling in vivo has been restricted to a STAT3-mediated satiety mechanism in the ob/ob mouse hypothalamus (15Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence, however, points to expression of the signaling-competent leptin receptor in peripheral tissues that can mediate functional responses to leptin (8Emilsson V. Liu Y.-L. Cawthorne M.A. Morton N.M. Davenport M. Diabetes. 1997; 4: 17-22Google Scholar, 16Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Recent work has also shown that leptin administration can reduce circulating triglyceride levels in +/+ and ob/ob mice (17Hamann A. Busing B. Kausch C. Ertl J. Preibisch G. Greten H. Matthaei S. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe OB-Rb expression in discrete regions of the mouse gastrointestinal tract associated with nutrient absorption and lipid uptake and in a human model of small intestinal epithelium, CACO-2 cells. Administration of leptin rapidly induced nuclear STAT5 DNA binding activity in +/+ and ob/ob jejunum but had no effect in the OB-Rb-deficient db/db mouse. Leptin administration results in a 2-fold reduction in apolipoprotein AIV (APO-AIV) transcript levels 90 min after a fat load. Thus, leptin can mediate, through an OB-Rb and a STAT5 mechanism, a negative-feedback signal to a primary site of lipid handling. Lack of leptin or resistance to direct leptin action in this site may contribute to elevated triglyceride and lipoprotein levels observed in obesity and its related syndromes. Six-week-old female wild-type and ob/ob mice of the Aston strain were bred in house and were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and laboratory chow (Beekay rat and mouse toxicology diet; Bantin and Kingman, Hull, UK). The in vivo effects of leptin (5 mg/kg) were assessed using recombinant leptin (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) that was given intravenously via the tail vein. Ten micromolar Tris, which was the diluent, was administered to controls. For studies on the effect of leptin on APO-AIV transcript levels, mice were fasted for 5 h and then given an oral dose (750 μl/mouse) of pure vegetable oil (energy per 100 g, 3700 kJ/900 kcal) containing 8% saturates, 61% monounsaturates, and 31% polyunsaturates. Leptin (5 mg/kg, intravenously) was given 15 min before the administration of pure vegetable oil. Mice were killed at intervals by cervical dislocation, and tissues were dissected, cleaned, and washed in ice-cold saline. Tissues were taken fresh for extraction of nuclear proteins as described below or snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Human CACO-2 Caucasian colon epithelial cells (European Animal Cell Culture, Porton Down, UK) were received at confluency and cultivated in Earles minimal essential medium including 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/air cabinet for 3–4 days before experiments. Cells were preincubated for 24 h in serum-free supplemented Earles minimal essential medium with 0.1% BSA. Cells were then incubated in basal Earles minimal essential medium with 0.1% BSA with or without leptin at given concentrations or the Tris control vehicle. Enterocytes from jejunum were isolated, using a slightly modified version of the low-temperature method as described by Flintet al. (18Flint N. Cove F.L. Evans G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 331-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus jejunum was everted, divided into 2–3-mm lengths, and washed in a ice-cold, oxygenated Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.5 mm dithiothreitol and RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sections were then suspended in ice-cold calcium chelate buffer (27 mmNa-citrate, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 96 mm NaCl, 8 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm KCl, 20 mmd-sorbitol, 20 mm sucrose, 2 mm glutamine, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, and RNase inhibitor) with constant stirring on ice for 20 min. Enterocytes were collected by gentle centrifugation for RNA isolation. This method yields pure villus cells representing fully differentiated enterocytes. Microscopic studies were performed to confirm the purity of isolated villus fractions as described previously (18Flint N. Cove F.L. Evans G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 331-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cells using an RNaid plus kit (BIO 101, La Jolla, CA) and treated immediately with DNase I (Life Technologies). Approximately 4 μg of RNA were used to generate cDNA with first-strand cDNA beads (Pharmacia Biotech) and oligo (dT)12–18 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The integrity and loading of the RNA was studied by detection scanning of ribosomal rRNA bands (28 and 18 S) in agarose gels. Potential contamination from fat was studied using leptin-specific primers (Table I) in an RT-PCR amplification. RT-PCR detection of the multiple OB-R transcript isoforms in the mouse gut as well as the OB-Rb transcript in the CACO-2 cells was performed using oligonucleotide primers listed in Table I. All PCR amplifications were performed using AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer) at 95 °C, 45 s denaturation, 57 °C, 45 s annealing, and 72 °C, 45 s extension (except that for the long OB-Rb isoform extension, which was for 1 min) in a Progene thermal cycler (Techne, Cambridge, UK). PCR products were then cloned directly into a pCR-TRAP cloning system (GeneHunter Corp., Nashville, TN), and the identity of PCR products was confirmed by sequencing using a ThermoSequenase terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For quantitative PCR, cDNA samples from +/+ and ob/ob mice were serially diluted, and PCR was performed at a fixed number of cycles (37 for OB-R and 30 for β-actin), as described previously (19Liu Y.-L.

Ltd., Dorset, UK), and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim), and the protein lysates were used for a protein assay (Sigma) and standard Western analysis. Approximately 20 μg of protein were mixed with gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. For monolayers of CACO-2 cells, protein was extracted by addition of gel loading buffer to the flasks. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membranes by electrotransfer; immunoblots were performed by blocking in 2% BSA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% and Tween 20; the OB-R was detected with M-18 or N-20 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biothechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and STAT proteins were detected with STAT5 (C-17; Santa Cruz Biothechnology) and STAT1, -2, -3, and -6 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) antibodies. Bands were visualized using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CACO-2 cells were immediately placed on ice after treatment, and the medium was removed. Cells were quickly washed with ice-cold PBS and then PBS with 5 mm NaF, 10 mm NaMoO4, and 1 mm activated Na3VO4. Cells were lysed with a hypotonic buffer (400 μl/25 cm2) containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaMoO4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.125 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml AEBSF, and 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630 detergent by cell scraping and gentle trituration. The lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min, and the nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation for 20 s at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclei were gently resuspended in 100 μl of high-salt buffer (hypotonic buffer plus 200 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol). Nuclear protein was extracted by rotating the tubes for 30 min at 4 °C, and the debris was pelleted by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Nuclear extracts were aliquoted and then snap-frozen in liquid N2before gel mobility shift assay (see below). Tissues were dissected, washed in ice-cold saline, minced, and then homogenized in 1:10 (w/v) hypotonic lysis buffer, and nuclear extracts were obtained essentially as described for CACO-2 cells. Five microliters of nuclear extract were used for DNA binding studies with 100 ng/reaction [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled probe in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 1 μg/ml polydeoxyinosine/cytidine (Pharmacia)) to block nonspecific binding. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then resolved on a 4% native PAGE gel. Supershift experiments involved a further 15-min incubation with the appropriate antibody. The oligonucleotide probes were the mutated high-affinity human SIS inducible element (m67 SIE), 5′-cat ttc ccg taa atc at-3′, from the c-fos promoter and a rat β-casein promoter element sequence, 5′-gga ctt ctt gga att aag gga-3′. Complementary oligonucleotide strands (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) were annealed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl to a final concentration of 200 ng/μl by heating the mixture to 90 °C for 10 min and then allowing it to cool slowly to room temperature. Probes were labeled with 3 units/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tissues and CACO-2 cells treated for 30 min with or without leptin were immediately snap-frozen in liquid N2and RNA extracted as described above. Standard Northern blot hybridization was performed using digoxygenin-labeled cDNA probes to determine c-fos and APO-AIV mRNA levels in vivo. Bound probes were detected by the anti-digoxygenin detection system using a polyclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) with the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star (Tropix, Bedford, MA), and finally bands were quantitated by scanning laser densitometry. Expression of the immediate-early genes c-fos, c-jun, junB, and junD in response to leptin was established by quantitative PCR, using primers listed in Table I. The multiple OB-R mRNA isoforms were detected, using RT-PCR, in discrete full-thickness segments of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 1 A). The different short isoforms, OB-Ra, OB-Rc, OB-Rd, and OB-Re, are expressed throughout the gut. In contrast, the functional long OB-Rb mRNA is found to be predominantly expressed in jejunum (Fig. 1 A). Using leptin-specific primers, RT-PCR amplification of cDNA samples from jejunum of +/+ and ob/ob mice resulted in negative detection, whereas PCR amplification of a common extracellular domain of the OB-R in the same samples was readily obtained (Fig. 1 B). This suggests that the OB-R mRNA expression presented in Fig. 1 A is neither a result of contamination from fat tissues nor a result of illegitimate transcription. Enterocytes were isolated from the tunica mucosa of jejunum, and RT-PCR amplification was performed. The functional leptin receptor OB-Rb transcript was readily detected in purified enterocytes isolated from jejunum (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, expression of the functional leptin receptor OB-Rb mRNA was readily detected in the human model of small intestine epithelium CACO-2 by the use of RT-PCR (Fig. 1 B), confirming the enterocyte as a potential target of leptin action. Western blot analysis of crude protein lysates (20 μg) from full-thickness segments of different sections of the mouse gut was performed using antibodies raised against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the short isoform OB-Ra, a predominant isoform in many tissues (7Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 14Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Iida K.

This resulted in a band with a predicted size of ∼120 kDa, which is predominantly expressed in the small intestine of both +/+ and ob/ob mice (Fig. 2 A). The discrepancy between the results obtained using RT-PCR or Western analysis to detect OB-R expression reflects the difference in the detection limit of these two methods. Accordingly, the Western analysis indicates a difference in the OB-R abundance in different sections of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 2 A). Antibodies raised against the amino-terminal sequence of the common human OB-R receptor detected a ∼120-kDa protein in the CACO-2 cells, which presumably accounts for the predominant short OB-R isoform (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Western blot analysis of the OB-R receptor in the gastrointestinal tract and CACO-2 cells. A, OB-Ra detected in different sections of the tract of both +/+ and ob/ob mice using an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of the short isoform.

Arrows point at an approximate size of a 120-kDa band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relative expression levels of the total OB-R transcript normalized to endogenously expressed β-actin were measured in discrete sections of the gastrointestinal tract using primers that recognize a sequence common to all isoforms encoding the amino terminus of the receptor, using the quantitative PCR assay described previously (19Liu Y.-L. Emilsson V. Cawthorne M.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The ratios of OB-R and β-actin PCR products from optimized linear regions of PCR condition, generated from equal volumes of cDNA, were compared (Fig. 3 A). No differences in OB-R mRNA levels were detected between +/+ and ob/obmouse tissues, but the OB-R transcript was 2–3-fold more abundant in small intestine than in stomach and transverse colon (Fig. 3 B). These results agree well with those observed using the Western analysis of OB-Ra distribution (Fig. 2 A). To address leptin-signaling mechanisms in the region of the small intestine expressing the OB-Rb, we looked for the presence of the STAT proteins known to transmit the leptin signal. Western blot analysis of +/+ and ob/ob jejunum readily detects STAT5 but more weakly detects STAT1 and STAT3 (Fig. 4 A). STAT5 is also well expressed in colon and duodenum (Fig. 4 A). CACO-2 cells also express leptin-responsive STAT isoforms (Fig. 4 B). Overnight fasted +/+ and ob/ob mice were administered 5 mg/kg recombinant murine leptin by tail vein injection. Thirty minutes after injection, mice were killed and the jejunum was removed for preparation of nuclear extracts. We used two selective probes to assess STAT activation by electromobility shift assay analysis. The m67-SIE mutated high-affinity STAT consensus binding element from the c-fospromoter preferentially binds STAT1 and STAT3 but binds STAT5 with low affinity. This probe did not reveal an induction of STAT DNA binding activity in response to leptin treatment in vivo in the mouse gut (data not shown). The rat β-casein promoter STAT DNA binding consensus element was used as a selective probe for STAT5 activity in vivo. Leptin treatment induced a marked activation of DNA binding activity in both +/+ and ob/obmice, and this was not observed in control animals treated with Tris only (Fig. 5). In contrast, the same dose of leptin injected into the db/db mice, which lack the OB-Rb isoform, caused no activation of STAT5 DNA binding in nuclear extracts of jejunum (Fig. 5). The STAT5 DNA binding activity induced in the +/+ and ob/ob jejunum was abolished by a preincubation with specific anti-STAT5a antibody and less markedly with an anti-STAT5b antibody (see results from the ob/ob jejunum in Fig. 5). These results suggest that jejunum is a direct target of leptin action, and this activity is mediated through OB-Rb and a STAT5 mechanism.Figure 5Gel mobility shift analysis of STAT DNA binding in mouse jejunum in response to leptin. An induction of STAT5 DNA binding activity to the β-casein promoter STAT5 consensus element. Nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with32P end-labeled probe and fractionated on a 4% native PAGE gel. Induction was observed in +/+ and ob/ob jejunal nuclear extracts in response to leptin administration (5 mg/kg) after 30 min. Preincubation with anti-STAT5 antibodies reveals that the major complex consists of STAT5a. No induction is observed in nuclear extracts of jejunum from db/db mice or control +/+ and ob/obmice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A 15-min leptin exposure resulted in a dose-dependent activation of STAT DNA binding to the m67-SIE probe in serum-deprived CACO-2 cells. This activity was abolished by an anti-STAT3 antibody, whereas an anti-STAT1 antibody had no effect (Fig. 6). In addition, leptin-treated CACO-2 cells exhibited an activation of DNA binding activity of STAT5 to the β-casein probe, and supershift studies identified STAT5b as the major factor in the complex (Fig. 6). Thus, leptin induces nuclear STAT5 DNA binding activity in both mouse jejunum and CACO-2 cells; however, different isoforms of STAT5 seem to form the protein-DNA complex in these two systems. Leptin administration also produced an induction of the immediate early gene c-fos in the jejunum of ob/ob mice after 30 min (Fig. 7"
https://openalex.org/W2120426937,"The Candida albicans PLB1gene was cloned using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach relying on degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed according to the amino acid sequences of two peptide fragments obtained from a purified candidal enzyme displaying phospholipase activity (Mirbod, F., Banno, Y., Ghannoum, M. A., Ibrahim, A. S., Nakashima, S., Yasuo, K., Cole, G. T., and Nozawa, Y. (1995) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1257, 181–188). Sequence analysis of a 6.7-kilobase pairEcoRI-ClaI genomic clone revealed a single open reading frame of 1818 base pairs that predicts for a pre-protein of 605 residues. Comparison of the putative candidal phospholipase with those of other proteins in data base revealed significant homology to known fungal phospholipase Bs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(45%), Penicillium notatum (42%), Torulaspora delbrueckii (48%), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe(38%). Thus, we have cloned the gene encoding a C. albicans phospholipase B homolog. This gene, designated caPLB1, was mapped to chromosome 6. Disruption experiments revealed that the caplb1 null mutant is viable and displays no obvious phenotype. However, the virulence of strains deleted for caPLB1, as assessed in a murine model for hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, was significantly attenuated compared with the isogenic wild-type parental strain. Although deletion of caPLB1 did not produce any detectable effects on candidal adherence to human endothelial or epithelial cells, the ability of the caplb1 null mutant to penetrate host cells was dramatically reduced. Thus, phospholipase B may well contribute to the pathogenicity of C. albicans by abetting the fungus in damaging and traversing host cell membranes, processes which likely increase the rapidity of disseminated infection."
https://openalex.org/W2001195445,"Three sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2) stimulate transcription of genes involved in synthesis and receptor-mediated uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids. Here, we explore the individual roles of each SREBP by preparing lines of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express graded amounts of nuclear forms of each SREBP (designated nSREBPs) under control of a muristerone-inducible nuclear receptor system. The parental hamster cell line (M19 cells) lacks its own nSREBPs, owing to a deletion in the gene encoding the Site-2 protease, which releases nSREBPs from cell membranes. By varying the concentration of muristerone, we obtained graded expression of individual nSREBPs in the range that restored lipid synthesis to near physiologic levels. The results show that nSREBP-2 produces a higher ratio of synthesis of cholesterol over fatty acids than does nSREBP-1a. This is due in part to a selective ability of low levels of nSREBP-2, but not nSREBP-1a, to activate the promoter for squalene synthase. nSREBP-1a and -2 both activate transcription of the genes encoding stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and -2, thereby markedly enhancing the production of monounsaturated fatty acids. nSREBP-1c was inactive in stimulating any transcription at the concentrations achieved in these studies. The current data support the emerging view that the nSREBPs act in complementary ways to modulate the lipid composition of cell membranes.

Cholesterol and fatty acids, the building blocks of cell membranes, are synthesized by regulated pathways in animal cells. Both pathways are influenced by a single family of transcription factors designated sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs),1 whose concerted actions optimize the lipid content of membranes (reviewed in Brown and Goldstein (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar)). Appropriate to their role in modulating membrane composition, the SREBPs are bound intrinsically to cell membranes. They are synthesized as long precursors of ∼1150 amino acids with three domains. The NH2-terminal domain of ∼480 amino acids is a classic basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor. This is followed by a membrane attachment domain of ∼80 amino acids and a COOH-terminal domain of ∼590 amino acids that performs a regulatory function. The SREBPs are attached to membranes of the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum in a hairpin fashion with their NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains projecting into the cytosol and the membrane attachment domain projecting into the lumen (2Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In order to reach the nucleus, the NH2-terminal domains of the SREBPs must be released from the membranes by proteolysis. This is accomplished by sequential cleavage at two peptide bonds, designated Site-1 and Site-2 (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). The proteolytic release of the SREBP NH2-terminal domains is subject to negative feedback regulation by cholesterol (3Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). When the cholesterol content of the cells declines, the Site-1 protease becomes activated, thereby initiating proteolytic release. When cholesterol builds up in the endoplasmic reticulum, the activity of the Site-1 protease is reduced, and the SREBPs remain bound to the membranes (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 4Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Three SREBPs are known to exist in animal cells. Two of these, designated SREBP-1a and -1c, are synthesized from a single gene through the use of alternate promoters and first exons (5Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 6Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H.

Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). These proteins differ in the length of an acidic sequence at the extreme NH2 terminus that activates transcription. SREBP-1a has a long acidic sequence of 42 amino acids, 12 of which are negatively charged. In SREBP-1c this sequence is reduced to 24 amino acids, of which 6 are acidic (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c was cloned independently in Dallas (5Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and Boston (8Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), where it was designated as ADD1. SREBP-2 is synthesized from a different gene (9Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Overall, it is 47% identical to SREBP-1a, and it also has a long transcription activating domain. The SREBPs can function as homodimers (9Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), although heterodimerization has not been excluded. Tissue culture cells and animal organs generally produce all three SREBPs, but they do so in differing ratios. In most tissue culture cells, the SREBP-1a transcript far exceeds that for SREBP-1c (7Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). However, in most organs of adult animals, including liver and adipose tissue, the SREBP-1c transcript predominates (7Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The SREBP-2 transcript is present in all cells at levels that are approximately equal to the total of SREBP-1a and -1c (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). The reason for the existence of three closely related SREBPs and the reason for their differing ratios in different cell types remain obscure. As far as is currently known, all of the SREBPs activate transcription of the same family of target genes. The identified targets can be divided into two pathways, genes relevant to cholesterol metabolism and those relevant to fatty acid metabolism (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). In the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, the SREBPs directly activate transcription of the genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase (1Brown M.S.

The SREBPs also directly activate transcription of the gene encoding the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which provides cholesterol and fatty acids from external sources (5Yokoyama C. Wang X.

Various cells and tissues have been forced to overproduce nuclear forms of SREBPs as a result of transfection or transgenic expression. Under these conditions many other genes are activated, but it is not known whether this activation is direct or indirect, i.e. as a result of activating other genes. This class includes the genes that encode the isozymes of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), the enzyme that converts saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids. The two closely related isozymes are designated SCD-1 and SCD-2 (18Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The total number of SCD transcripts was markedly elevated in livers of transgenic mice that overexpressed dominant-positive forms of SREBP-1a (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I.

Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), and SREBP-2 (20Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe that was used did not distinguish between the two SCD isoforms. Inasmuch as tissue culture cells produce active forms of all three SREBPs, it is difficult to study the individual role of each factor in isolation from the others. In the current studies, we have sought to overcome this problem through the use of a mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, designated M19 (21Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These cells have a deletion in the gene encoding the protease that cuts SREBPs at Site-2, and they are therefore unable to release any SREBPs from cell membranes (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G.

Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As a result, these cells have an absolute growth requirement for exogenous cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids. We have prepared stable derivatives of the M19 cells that express truncated dominant-positive forms of each SREBP under control of the inducible ecdysone promoter (24No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The encoded SREBPs have a translation stop signal between the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper domain and the membrane anchor. As a result, they are never attached to membranes, and they enter the nucleus directly without a requirement for regulated proteolysis. We have incorporated a common epitope tag into each SREBP so that its level of expression can be quantified by an antibody that reacts with all three proteins in the same fashion. The results indicate that SREBP-1a and -2 activate the same family of genes, but they do so in different proportions. In general, SREBP-2 favors the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, while SREBP-1a has a relatively greater effect on fatty acid biosynthesis. Under the conditions of these studies, SREBP-1c was essentially inactive in both pathways. In addition to elevating the total amount of fatty acid synthesis, SREBP-1a increased the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Thus, SREBP-1a and SREBP-2, acting in concert, modulate the content of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes. Standard molecular biology techniques were used (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed with the dideoxy chain termination method on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer. Fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.215 g/ml) was prepared by ultracentrifugation (26Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was radiolabeled with sodium 125I by the iodine monochloride method (26Goldstein J.L.

All plasmid DNAs for transfection were prepared with Plasmid Maxi kits (Qiagen). A stock solution of 5 mm sodium [1-14C]stearate-albumin complex was prepared as described previously for sodium [1-14C]oleate-albumin (26Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Other reagents were obtained from sources as reported previously (3Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). We used standard methods of PCR and molecular cloning (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) to construct expression vectors for the cleaved nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2 in which expression of these nuclear SREBPs (nSREBPs) is controlled by the ecdysone-inducible promoter (24No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmid pIND-BP2-FLAG encodes amino acids 1–481 of human SREBP-2 (9Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structures of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing all ligation joints. In the case of pIND-BP1c-FLAG, the nSREBP-1c coding region was sequenced in its entirety. M19 cells are a mutant line of CHO-K1 cells that are auxotrophic for cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids (21Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) because they fail to cleave SREBPs at Site-2, owing to a deletion in the S2P gene (22Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Stock cultures of M19 cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C in 9% CO2 in medium A (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate). To obtain stable cell lines of M19 cells expressing either pIND-BP1a-FLAG or pIND-BP1c-FLAG, M19 cells were plated on day 0 at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in medium A and cotransfected on day 1 with 6 μg of pVgRXR (containing the gene conferring Zeocin resistance) and 6 μg of either pIND-BP1a-FLAG or pIND-BP1c-FLAG (each containing a neo gene conferring G418 resistance) using the MBS transfection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the concentration of modified bovine serum was 5% (v/v) rather than 6%. The transfection was carried out at 35 °C for 3 h in 3% CO2, after which each dish was washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and switched to 10 ml of medium A. On day 2, transfectants were switched to medium A supplemented with 750 μg/ml G418 and 500 μg/ml Zeocin. After 14 days, drug-resistant colonies were incubated with 1 μm muristerone A for 24 h and then initially screened for SREBP expression either by visualization of LDL receptor expression using reconstituted fluorescent PMCA oleate-labeled LDL (28Krieger M. Smith L.C. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. Kao Y.J. Pownall H.J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Brown M.S. J. Supramol. Struct. 1979; l0: 467-478Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and/or by immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. Positive colonies were cloned by dilution plating and rescreened by immunoblot analysis with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. To obtain stably transfected M19 cells expressing pIND-BP2-FLAG, the cells were first transfected with pVgRXR and selected with Zeocin. The Zeocin-resistant colonies were screened by transient transfection with pIND/lacZ, and the colony that showed the greatest muristerone A induction was identified by assay of β-galactosidase activity. Cells from this colony were transfected with pIND-BP2-FLAG, selected with G418 and Zeocin, and screened for nSREBP-2 expression as described above. The above stably transfected cell lines, designated N-BP-1a, N-BP-1c, and N-BP-2, were maintained as stock cultures in medium A containing 750 μg/ml G418 and 500 μg/ml Zeocin. Cell monolayers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium EDTA, and 1 mmsodium EGTA supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (3Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was passed through a 22-gauge needle 15 times and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Each pellet from two pooled 60-mm dishes or one 100-mm dish was resuspended in 0.12–0.15 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 0.42 m NaCl, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture, followed by rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifugation at 105 × g in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the nuclear extract. Protein concentration was measured with a BCA kit. Samples of the nuclear extract fractions were mixed with 4× SDS loading buffer (29Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 100Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, and transferred to a Hybond-C membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (v/v) nonfat dry milk, and 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated newborn calf serum. Each membrane was then incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After washing five times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (3 × 106 cpm/ml). The blots were washed at room temperature (four washes; 5 min/wash) with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. They were then exposed to film as indicated in the figure legends. Intact monolayers were incubated with 0.5 mm sodium [14C]acetate (20–29 dpm/pmol) or 0.1 mmsodium [14C]stearate-albumin (6 dpm/pmol) as described in the figure legends. Incorporation into lipids was determined as described previously (30Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Kaneko I. Endo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that each sample received, before saponification, ∼105 dpm [3H]oleic acid as a recovery standard for calculating fatty acid synthesis. The data are expressed as nanomoles of [14C]acetate incorporated into cholesterol or fatty acids per mg of cell protein per h. Receptor-mediated degradation of 125I-LDL by intact cells was measured as described previously (31Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation activity represents the high affinity receptor-dependent rate of proteolysis and is expressed as micrograms of 125I-labeled acid-soluble (non-iodide) material released into the culture medium per mg of total cell protein per 5 h. The protein content of cells was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were incubated with sodium [14C]acetate or sodium [14C]stearate-albumin as described above. Prior to saponification, a recovery standard consisting of ∼105cpm [14C]linoleic acid was added to each sample. After extraction with petroleum ether, the fatty acid fraction was dried under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 0.1 ml of methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters computer-controlled apparatus with a Nova-Pak C18reverse-phase column (3.9 × 150 mm) coupled to a Radiometer Flo-1 radioactive flow detector. Samples (80 μl representing ∼0.3 mg of protein from 0.8 dish of cells) were injected automatically by a WISP injector, and the 14C-labeled fatty acids were resolved by isocratic chromatography with a mixture of 84.9% methanol, 15% water, and 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Each species of fatty acid was identified by comparison of its retention time with that of a known standard. Recoveries of total fatty acids in different experiments ranged from 30 to 47%, as judged by the recovery of the added [14C]linoleic acid. cDNA probes for Chinese hamster SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and HMG-CoA reductase were prepared using the plasmids and restriction enzymes listed in Table I. cDNA probes for nine other Chinese hamster mRNAs were prepared by PCR as follows. First-strand cDNA was prepared from CHO-K1 total RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit primed with random hexadeoxynucleotides. The cDNA was used as template in PCR reactions with the primer pairs listed in Table II. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into either pCR-Blunt (LDL receptor probe) or pNoTA/T7 (all other probes). The fragments were released byEcoRI (LDL receptor, 1-kilobase pair fragment),XbaI (lanosterol demethylase and lanosterol synthase), orBamHI (all other probes) and purified on agarose gels. All cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It II random primer labeling kit.Table IPlasmids used for preparing hamster cDNA probescDNA probePlasmidRestriction enzymeSizeReferencekbSREBP-1pRC-CMV-SREBP-1NotI/SalI3.849Sato R.

Escherichia coli living in the animal gut encounters aromatic compounds such as phenylacetic acid (PA),1 phenylpropionic acid, and their hydroxylated derivatives, as a result of the action of intestinal microflora on plant constituents, the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, fatty acids with a terminal phenyl substituent, and some of their metabolites (1Ferrández A.

Although PA is a common source of carbon and energy for a wide variety of microorganisms, the bacterial catabolism of this natural aromatic compound is still poorly understood (12Miñambres B. Martı́nez-Blanco H. Olivera E.R. Garcı́a B. Dı́ez B. Barredo J.L. Moreno M.A. Schleissner C. Salto F. Luengo J.M. J. Biol.

Earlier reports suggested that aerobic PA catabolism implicated the typical initial attack by hydroxylation of the aromatic ring with the formation of the corresponding 2,5- or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate as intermediates (13Vitovski S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, much of this evidence was circumstantial, and none of the typical aerobic routes that could explain PA degradation were responsible of this catabolism in different PA-degrading bacteria (13Vitovski S.

According to these data, it has been recently shown thatPseudomonas putida U mineralizes PA aerobically through a novel catabolic pathway, which does not follow the conventional routes for the aerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds and whose first step is the activation of PA to phenylacetyl-coenzyme A (PA-CoA) by the action of a PA-CoA ligase (12Miñambres B.

In this sense, the participation of a PA-CoA ligase in the aerobic catabolism of PA has been also inferred from its specific induction during growth on PA of different bacterial strains (13Vitovski S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Velasco A. Alonso S. Garcı́a J.L. Perera J. Dı́az E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present the cloning, genetic characterization, mechanism of regulation, and a partial biochemical characterization of the PA biodegradation pathway from E. coli W. This work reveals that the PA degradation in E. coli follows an unusual route for the aerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds, which involves CoA derivatives. With the molecular characterization of thepaa-encoded pathway, all aromatic catabolic routes so far reported in E. coli are now described at the molecular level.

For cloning and expression purposes we have used two chloramphenicol-resistant low copy number cloning vectors, plasmids pCK01 (1Ferrández A. Garcı́a J.L. Dı́az E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pSJ19Not (like pCK01 but containing the polylinker region from pUC19), as well as pUC18, pUC19 (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) vectors. The promoter-probe pSJ3 vector is a pUJ9 derivative (22de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) bearing a 85-bp SmaI/BamHI fragment that contains the 5′-leader region of IS10transposase (19Jaenecke S. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Dı́az E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To integrate the lacZ fusions into the chromosome, plasmid pUTmini-Tn5Km2 was used (22de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C. When used as carbon sources, PA and/or glycerol were supplied at 5 and 20 mm, respectively, to M63 minimal medium (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing the corresponding necessary nutritional supplements, and the cultures were incubated at 30 °C. Where appropriate, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and rifampicin (50 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was prepared by the rapid alkaline lysis method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli was carried out using the RbCl method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA manipulations and other molecular biology techniques were essentially as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified by using low melting point agarose. Southern blot analyses were performed as previously reported (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using as probes DNA fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of total DNA from E. coli W was carried out as described (24Arrecubieta C. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6375-6383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo-1000M nucleotide synthesizer (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Nucleotide sequences were determined directly from plasmids by using the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). Standard protocols of the manufacturer for Taq DNA polymerase-initiated cycle sequencing reactions with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators (Applied Biosystems Inc.) were used. The sequencing reactions were analyzed using a model 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Sequences were extended by designing primers based on the previously determined sequence. Nucleotide sequence analyses were done with the DNA-Strider 1.2 program. Amino acid sequences were analyzed with the Protein Analysis Tools at the ExPASy World Wide Web molecular biology server of the Geneva University Hospital and the University of Geneva. Nucleotide and protein sequence similarity searches were made by using the BLASTP, BLASTN, and BLASTX programs (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

The Pa 424 promoter region was PCR-amplified from plasmid pAAD by using primers PZ5 (5′-GGGGTGAATCAAACGGCTACG-3′; the sequence corresponds to nucleotides 2402–2420 in Fig. 2) and PA5–1 (5′-CAATCTCGGAATGCGCATG-3′; the sequence corresponds to nucleotides 2885–2867 in Fig. 2). The resulting 495-bp DNA fragment was digested with KpnI and SphI and cloned as a 424-bp fragment into the double-digested KpnI+SphI pSJ3 vector to form plasmid pAFPA1 (Fig. 5). The Pa 255 promoter region was PCR-amplified by using primers PAP (5′-GGTCTAGAGTTATCAAAATAGAGTGCG-3′; the sequence corresponds to nucleotides 2611–2631 in Fig. 2; engineeredXbaI restriction site is underlined) and PA5–1. The resulting 272-bp DNA fragment was digested with XbaI and SphI and cloned as a 255-bp fragment into the double-digested XbaI+SphI pSJ3 vector to form plasmid pAFPA2 (Fig. 5). The Pz promoter region was PCR-amplified by using primers PZ5–1 (5′-GGGGATCCCGGCCAGACTGCCAGGTAC-3′; the sequence corresponds to nucleotides 2423–2443 in Fig. 2; engineeredBamHI restriction site is double-underlined) and PA5–1. The resulting 474-bp DNA fragment was digested with SphI and BamHI and cloned as a 446-bp fragment into the double-digested SphI+BamHI pSJ3 vector to form plasmid pAFPZ (Fig. 5). The Px promoter region was PCR-amplified by using primers 5,5f2 (5′-CCGCATGGATCGCATCAGC-3′; the sequence corresponds to nucleotides 11910–11928 in Fig. 2) and PX5–2 (5′-GGGGATCCGAATCACCATACAGAGAGGAG-3′, the sequence corresponds to nucleotides 12456–12436 in Fig. 2; engineeredBamHI site is double-underlined). The resulting 554-bp DNA fragment was digested with SspI and BamHI, and cloned as a 214-bp fragment into the double-digestedSmaI+BamHI pSJ3 vector to form plasmid pAFPX (Fig. 5).Figure 5Schematic representation of the construction of lacZ translational fusion cassettes.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pAAD plasmid was mutagenized with Tn1000 by selecting for conjugative transfer of this plasmid from the recA F+ donor strain E. coliMG1063 to the F− recipient strain E. coliCC118. Before mating, both parents were grown at 37 °C, without shaking, to an optical density at 600 nm of about 0.5. Two milliliters of donor cells and one milliliter of recipient cells were mixed and incubated at 37 °C without shaking for 2 h. After addition of 12 ml of LB medium and further incubation with vigorous shaking for 3 h, exconjugants were selected on LB medium containing rifampicin and chloramphenicol. The pAAD derivatives bearing Tn1000insertions within the paa genes were further analyzed. The primer Tn5900 (5′-AAAAGGGGAACTGAGAGCTC-3′) that hybridized with the δ terminus of transposon Tn1000 was used to sequence the insertion sites. By means of RP-4 mediated mobilization, the plasmids pAFPA1T and pAFPA2T, which contain mini-Tn5 hybrid transposons expressingPa-lacZ fusions (Fig. 5), were transferred from E. coli S17–1λpir into E. coli AF141. Filter matings were performed as described previously (22de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Exconjugants containing the lacZ translational fusions stably inserted into the chromosome, E. coli AF1411 and E. coliAF1412, were selected for the transposon marker, kanamycin, on rifampicin-containing LB medium. E. coli CC118 cells containing plasmids pAFPA1, pAFPA2, pAFPZ, pAFPX, or pSJ3 (Fig. 5), were grown in minimal medium containing glycerol and PA until the cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm of about 1.0. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA/DNA Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the supplier. Primer extension reactions were carried out with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as described previously (31Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), using primers LAC-57 (5′-CGATTAAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGG-3′, which hybridized at 57 nucleotides downstream of the lacZ start codon) and PA5–4 (5′-CGGGCATCCAGTCCTGTGGCTCG-3′, which hybridized at 55 nucleotides downstream of the paaA start codon). Products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels. E. coli W14 cells harboring different pAAD::Tn1000 derivatives were grown in minimal medium containing glycerol and PA to an optical density at 600 nm of about 0.8. Cell cultures were then centrifuged (3,000 × g, 10 min at 20 °C), and cells were washed and resuspended in a 0.05 volume of minimal medium. The resting cell reactions were performed in a final volume of 5 ml containing 4.5 ml of M63 minimal medium and 0.5 ml of the cell suspension. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm PA, and the tubes were incubated on a rotary shaking platform at a temperature of 30 °C. Samples of 0.5 ml were taken at different times and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min) to remove the cells. To detect the accumulation of intracellular intermediates in PA catabolism, E. coli W14 (pAFK5) and E. coli W14 (pAAD::Tn1000 derivatives) cells were grown in LB medium containing 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and minimal medium containing glycerol and PA, respectively. When the cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm of about 1.0, cells were centrifuged, washed as described above, and resuspended in 0.005 volume of minimal medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μm [1-14C]PA (4 μCi/ml) (Sigma) and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. The following treatments were performed at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged, washed with minimal medium containing 10 mm glucose, and resuspended in 0.01 volume of 0.5 m HClO4. After vortexing vigorously for 1 min, the sample was frozen and thawed once and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min). While the supernatant was collected, the sediment was treated again with 0.01 volume of 0.5 m HClO4. Finally, the two supernatants were mixed, filtered through cellulose-triacetate membrane filters (10,000 M r) (Alltech Associates, Inc.), vacuum-dried, and resuspended in 200 μl of H2O. E. coli W14 cells containing different pAAD derivatives were grown overnight in minimal medium containing glycerol and vitamin B12 (500 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of PA, and then diluted into fresh medium to an optical density of about 0.1. Growth was resumed at 30 °C until the cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm of about 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.05 volume of 0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.2, prior to disruption by passage through a French press (Aminco Corp.) operated at a pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 30 min. The clear supernatant fluid was carefully decanted and used as crude extract. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Phenylacetyl-coenzyme A ligase was assayed as described previously (33Martı́nez-Blanco H. Reglero A. Rodrı́guez-Aparicio L.B. Luengo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7084-7090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the catalytic activity leading to the formation of 1 nmol of phenylacetylhydroxamate in 1 min at 37 °C. β-Galactosidase activities were measured with permeabilized cells from cultures grown to mid-log phase, as described by Miller (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of PaaK was determined by Edman degradation with a model 477A automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The protein was directly electroblotted from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (18Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Dı́az E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The metabolites accumulated in the supernatants of resting cells and in culture supernatants, were analyzed with a Gilson HPLC equipment using a Lichrosphere 5 RP-8 column (150 × 4.6 mm) and an isocratic flow of a 40% methanol-H2O mobile phase pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peaks with retention times of 5.6 and 10.6 min, corresponding to those of authentic standard 2-HPA and PA, respectively, were monitored at 220 nm. The intracellular 14C-labeled metabolites accumulated in resting cell assays were analyzed with the HPLC equipment described above but using an isocratic flow of 0.2 mKH2PO4 (pH 4.2), isopropyl alcohol (92:8, v/v) as mobile phase pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples (400 μl) were collected, and 14C-labeled products were detected in aliquots of the fractions by liquid scintillation counting. Peaks with retention times of 11.2 and 20.2 min, corresponding to those of authentic standard PA and PA-CoA, respectively, were monitored at 220 nm. Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on 0.2-mm Silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck) with chloroform-acetone (2:1, v/v) as solvents. Radiolabeled compounds were visualized by autoradiography. The 2-HPA was extracted from culture supernatants with an equal volume of ethyl acetate and dried with sodium sulfate. Samples were derivatized with N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis as described elsewhere (34Ahrazem O. Prieto A. Leal J.A. Gómez-Miranda B. Domenech J. Jiménez-Barbero J. Bernabé M. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 303: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We had recently reported the isolation of an E. coli W mutant, strain W14, unable to grow on PA and 2-phenylethylamine as the sole carbon and energy source (18Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Dı́az E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A recombinant plasmid, pFA2, which contains a 33.3-kb BamHI DNA insert from the chromosome of the wild-type E. coli W strain (Fig. 1 A), had been also constructed and was able to confer to E. coli W14 the ability to grow on either PA or phenylethylamine as the sole carbon source (18Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Dı́az E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When theHindIII-digested total DNA from E. coli W14 and E. coli C, a strain also unable to grow on PA as the sole carbon source (2Burlingame R. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was analyzed by Southern blot using the 33.3-kbBamHI fragment of pFA2 as probe, no hybridization bands were observed (data not shown). These results indicated that E. coli strains W14 and C have a deletion encompassing at least the 33.3-kb DNA fragment cloned in pFA2, and therefore it is likely that they lack the genes involved in PA catabolism (paa genes). Moreover, we have observed that, whereas the E. coli K-12 strains MV1190, C600, TG1, ET8000, W3110, and MG1655 grew on PA, the K-12 strains HB101, DH1, CC118, DH5α, and JM109 did not grow on this aromatic compound. A Southern blot analysis of theHindIII-digested total DNA from E. coli K-12 PA+ (W3110, MG1655, and C600) and PA− (DH5α, HB101, and DH1) strains revealed the same pattern of hybridization bands, thus suggesting that the PA− phenotype in E. coli K-12, in contrast to that in E. coli W14 and E. coli C, could be produced by point mutations or small deletions or insertions. Interestingly, all E. coliPA− strains were able to grow on this aromatic compound when harboring plasmid pFA2, and the loss of this plasmid after several rounds of cultivation of the recombinant strains in the absence of selective pressure was also accompanied by the loss of the PA+ phenotype. As several aromatic catabolic pathways are encoded by plasmids and E. coli W was shown to host cryptic plasmids (35Prieto M.A. Pérez-Aranda A. Garcı́a J.L. J. Bacteriol."

Phenoloxidase is widespread in animals and plants as well as in fungi; it starts the synthesis of melanin, is involved in defense reactions (19Prota G. Melanins and Melanogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego1992Google Scholar, 20Sugumaran M. Kanost M. Beckage N.E. Thompson S.N. Federici A.B. Parasites and Pathogens of Insects. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 317-342Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and is also crucial for arthropod sclerotization, using N-acetyldopamine (NADA)1 as substrate (21Anderson S.O. Binnington K. Retnakan A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis Sclerotization. 1991: 123-140Google Scholar,22Sugumaran M. Binnington K. Retnakan A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis Sclerotization. 1991: 141-168Google Scholar). Although much is known about the biological functions of phenoloxidase, its molecular mechanism and regulation are not well understood because of the lack of any known structure (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 25-26Crossref Scopus (3161) Google Scholar, 13Sanchez-Ferrer A. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Garcia-Canovas F. Garcia-Carmona F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). o-Diphenoloxidase and monophenoloxidase activity were measured spectrophotometrically by recording the formation of dopachrome, with an absorption maximum at 475 nm. Iterative spectra in the region of 300–600 nm were recorded to exclude other by-products. The assay medium contained 4 mml-dopa in the case of o-diphenol oxidation and 2 mm tyrosine in the case of tyrosinase activity, which includes the monophenoloxidase and o-diphenoloxidase activities, in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 at 20 °C. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5%) and crossed immuno gel electrophoresis were performed according to Lamyet al. (32Lamy J. Lamy J. Weill J. Markl J. Schneider H.-J. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and stained by incubation in 4 mml-dopa, pH 6.8, and 0.1 m potassium phosphate at room temperature. When the protein was to be activated by the staining solution itself, then 1 mg/ml trypsin was also added. After staining, the gels were dried or stored in methanol/acetic acid/water. Limited proteolysis was performed with bovine trypsin and bovine chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 0.1 mTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8 (in the case of the native 24-mer) and pH 9.6 (in the case of subunits) at room temperature. The ratio between hemocyanin and protease varied between 1:1 and 10:1 (w/w). Proteolysis was terminated by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The x-ray structures of subunit II of Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin(Protein Data Bank code 1oxy) and the hexameric hemocyanin of Panulirus interruptus (Protein Data Bank code 1hcy) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Sequence comparison was performed using DNAstar, based on the clustal method. The various peptide sequences were obtained from the Protein Data Bank as indicated previously (28Beintema J.J. Stam W.T. Hazes B. Smidt M.P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar, 29Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Basyoni M. On the Sequence of Subunit b from Tarantula HemocyaninPh.D. thesis. University of Munich, 1990Google Scholar). The hemocyanin of Eurypelma californicum hemolymph was obtained by dorsal puncture of the heart. All samples were immediately diluted 1:2 (v/v) with 0.2 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2 to stabilize the protein. The samples were then centrifuged at low speed for 10 min at room temperature using a table centrifuge to remove blood cells. The hemocyanin was purified by gel filtration (TSK-HW 55 F; 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2 at 20 °C). The large leading peak contained purified 24-meric hemocyanin, as verified by UV spectroscopy and two-dimensional immuno gel electrophoresis. 24-meric hemocyanin was dissociated by dialysis against 0.02 m glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C for 4–5 days. The protein concentration was below 1 mg/ml to avoid reassociation. The native 24-meric hemocyanin of the tarantula E. californicum (23Markl J. Kempter B. Linzen B. Bijlholt M.M.C. van Bruggen E.F.J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Decker H. Sterner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) seems incapable of oxidizingo-diphenols such as l-dopa and monophenols such as l-tyrosine, even after addition of urea or perchlorate at any concentration. An activity similar to phenoloxidase has recently been observed for the hemocyanins from the crustaceans Homarus americanus and Carcinus maenas and from the molluscOctopus vulgaris using catechol (25Zlateva T. di Muro P. Salvato B. Beltramini M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Salvato B., Santamaria, M., Beltramini, M., Alzuet, G., and Casella, L. (1998) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). We have now observed monophenoloxidase activity as well aso-diphenoloxidase activity for a hemocyanin from a chelicerate, the tarantula E. californicum, after limited proteolysis with serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, by following the enzyme-specific formation of dopachrome at 475 nm (Fig. 1, A and B). Monophenoloxidase activity of activated tarantula hemocyanin starts with a long lag phase that is also characteristic for tyrosinases but not well understood (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 25-26Crossref Scopus (3161) Google Scholar, 13Sanchez-Ferrer A. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Garcia-Canovas F. Garcia-Carmona F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The o-diphenoloxidase activity has no lag phase although the active sites are identical for both activities, assessed by means of absorption spectroscopy (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 25-26Crossref Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). Compared with the activity of tyrosinase from mushrooms, the activity of hemocyanin is lower by almost two orders of magnitude (Fig. 1 C). To prove that an oxygen consuming process occurs during phenoloxidase activity, oxygen consumption was followed using protease-treated 24-meric hemocyanin with various o-diphenol derivatives such as l-dopa, dopamine, and NADA (Fig. 1 D). These data represent an absolute measure for comparing the phenoloxidase activity of different substrates. Although dopamine is oxidized at the same rate as l-dopa, NADA is oxidized significantly faster. The phenoloxidase activity of tarantula hemocyanin is not dependent on the quaternary structure of the 24-mer. When investigated on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under conditions where destabilized 24-mers tend to dissociate, pH 8.8, 24-mers are detected as well as various intermediates and monomers (27Savel-Niemann A. Markl J. Linzen B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 24-, the 12-, and the 7-mer dissociation intermediates show phenoloxidase activity after incubation with a phenoloxidase-specific activity staining assay (Fig. 2 panel A). Among the subunits, only the broad band containing the subunit d and heterodimerbc shows phenoloxidase activity. Using crossed immuno gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, panel B) only the heterodimer bc shows phenoloxidase activity. This observation was also confirmed by separating the heterodimerbc from the monomeric subunits a, d, e, f, and g by size-exclusion gel chromatography (TSK HW 55), where again only the heterodimerbc showed phenoloxidase activity. We believe that both theb and c subunits possess enzymic activity. Incubation in 3 and 4 m urea results in a partial dissociation of b and c from the heterodimer (Fig. 2, panel B). At 3 m urea, subunitsb and c are both visible and both show phenoloxidase activity. At higher concentrations of urea, however, all subunits become unstable, in particular subunit c becomes undetectable. This exclusive phenoloxidase activity of the heterodimerbc of tarantula hemocyanin is observed after limited proteoloysis with trypsin as well as with chymotrypsin. Based on sequence alignments (8Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.

On the Sequence of Subunit b from Tarantula HemocyaninPh.D. thesis. University of Munich, 1990Google Scholar) (subunit c is not sequenced yet), and the x-ray structures of L. polyphemus hemocyanin subunit II (chelicerate) and of P. interruptus hemocyanin (crustacean) (6Gaykema W.P.J.

Genet. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), several cleavage positions for chymotrypsin and trypsin have been detected that are located on the surface of a chelicerate hemocyanin subunit. According to the sequence numbering of Limulus subunit II, trypsin may cleave at Arg-81 (subunitb: Arg-68), Lys-130 (subunit b: Lys-0117) and Arg-133 (subunit b: Arg-120). Chymotrypsin may cleave at Phe-83 (subunit b: Tyr-70). The most promising candidate seems to be Arg-120 on subunit b, which corresponds to Arg-176 of the closely related prophenoloxidases of the crustaceanPacifastacus leniusculus (15Aspan A. Huang T.S. Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This enzyme, withM r = 81,000, is activated by trypsin at Arg-176, yielding an active fragment of about 60 kDa. The other tarantula hemocyanin subunits do not have an Arg but a Lys at this position, but surprisingly they are not activated. The prophenoloxidase subunits from the insect Galleria mellonella are of similar sizes toPacifastacus prophenoloxidase, with masses of 80 and 83 kDa. After proteolysis with chymotrypsin, two active fragments with 67 and 50 kDa were found. Phenoloxidase-active Eurypelma hemocyanin fragments also have comparable masses. SDS-gel electrophoretic analysis reveals that the heterodimer bc splits into peptides with two major components of M r ≈ 50,000 and M r ≈ 55,000 after cleavage with chymotrypsin and one major component with M r ≈ 55,000 after cleavage with trypsin (Fig. 2, panel C). However, any procedure to obtain a purified pseudo-native 55-kDa fragment with full enzymatic properties has not been successful so far. In the case of tarantula hemocyanin from E. californicum, the cleavage of an N-terminal peptide including Phe-49 from the two subunits b and c seems to open the entrance to the active site, with its copper atoms, for phenolic substrates. This is independent of the association status of the subunits (Fig. 3). This highly conserved phenylalanine in hemocyanins is at a distance of 3.5 Å from the active site and serves as an allosteric trigger during the oxygenation process (8Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9Magnus K.A. Hazes B. Ton-That H. Bonaventura C. Bonventura J. Hol W.G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We think that Phe-49 may also act as a placeholder for phenolic substrates during the time when hemocyanin is acting only as an oxygen carrier, to conserve the hidden function as a phenoloxidase in the native but uncleaved state. Assuming the same orientation of possible substrates for the phenoloxidase activity as Phe-49, the phenyl ring lies almost perpendicular to the Cu-Cu-O2 plane, with close contact of the ortho position to one of the two oxygen atoms (Fig. 4). In this geometry, the hydroxyl group may bind to the copper atoms to initialize the cleavage of the oxygen molecule (2Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 25-26Crossref Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). The optimal arrangement of the substrate may be sterically hindered by Thr-351 (according to the numbering of L. polyphemus hemocyanin). This would explain the low o-phenoloxidase activity of hemocyanin with respect to other phenoloxidase and tyrosinase.Figure 4The orientation of a hypothetical substrate HO-Phe-49 replacing Phe-49 at the oxygen binding site. The hemocyanin subunit II (L. polyphemus) is used (9Magnus K.A. Hazes B. Ton-That H. Bonaventura C. Bonventura J. Hol W.G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The two copper atoms (blue) are complexed by six histidines. The dioxygen (red) is bound in a μ − η2:η2 coordination. A hypothetical hydroxyl group is added to Phe-49 to design a hypothetical tyrosine. Note that Phe-49 as well as the HO-Phe-49 are closer to the dioxygen and Cu(A) than to Cu(B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, the explanation for the activation of phenoloxidase activity of tarantula hemocyanin by limited proteolysis seems to be based not on a rearrangement of the active site but by providing a free access for various substrates to the active site, following removal of the nonreactive substrate analogue Phe-49. The greater accessibility of the active site of mushroom tyrosinase compared with hemocyanin can also be deduced from kinetic removal of the copper atoms by cyanide in both proteins (31Beltramini M. Salvato B. Santamaria M. Lerch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This hypothesis about a free entrance is supported by a recent study (25Zlateva T. di Muro P. Salvato B. Beltramini M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) which shows that access for catechol to the active site is potentiated by the presence of salts of the Hofmeister series such as high concentrations of perchlorate. The salts increase the low phenoloxidase activity of crustacean hemocyanins (H. americanus and C. maenas) by a factor of two (25Zlateva T. di Muro P. Salvato B. Beltramini M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to induce any significant phenoloxidase activity in the crustacean hemocyanins from P. interruptusor H. americanus by proteolysis, using tyrosine orl-dopa as substrates. This difference in the hemocyanins from Crustacea and Chelicerata may be explained on the basis of their x-ray structures (8Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9Magnus K.A. Hazes B. Ton-That H. Bonaventura C. Bonventura J. Hol W.G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although the active sites are highly conserved, Thr-351 belonging to the active site of Limulushemocyanin is replaced by the larger Phe-371 in Panulirushemocyanin (Fig. 3), which sterically hinders any substrate larger than oxygen from coming close to the active site, even after removal of the N-terminal fragment. Thr-351 is conserved in Chelicerata hemocyanins. In the case of Eurypelma hemocyanin, however, a reason for the exclusive phenoloxidase activity of subunits b and c remains unknown. We may make three significant deductions from our results. First, our findings may explain the high conservation of quaternary structure of the 24-meric tarantula hemocyanin throughout evolution in this ancient animal. Subunits b and c bridge the two structurally identical 2 × 6-meric half-molecules (23Markl J. Kempter B. Linzen B. Bijlholt M.M.C. van Bruggen E.F.J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the case of crustacean hemocyanins, these linker subunit types are not present: only 6-mers and 2 × 6-mers are found in the hemolymph of modern arthropods (3van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Salvato B. Beltramini M. Life Chem. Rep. 1990; 8: 1-47Google Scholar, 5Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, species of two large groups among arthropods, Crustacea and Insecta, have evolved prophenoloxidases, most probably by gene duplication of hemocyanins, which is indicated by the close structural relationship between phenoloxidase and hemocyanin (14Fujimoto K. Okino N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Ohnishi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Aspan A. Huang T.S. Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and consecutive optimization of a physiologically beneficial phenoloxidase activity. Second, evolution seems to have stabilized a double function in the hemocyanin from the ancient tarantula Eurypelma californicum. This is a further example in contrast to the dogma: one gene—one protein—one function with respect to the active site. We suggest that the Eurypelma hemocyanin can develop two different functions consecutively using the same active site. During normal life, the hemocyanins serve as oxygen carriers. At a crucial moment of the life of arthropods, i.e. the growing phase, hemocyanin function may switch to phenoloxidase activity by limitedin vivo proteolysis. Such phenoloxidase activity is known to be necessary to harden the exoskeleton rapidly after molting (i.e. within minutes to hours) for protection against predators. The “new function” of hemocyanin may contribute toward catalyzing the first steps in the sclerotization process, using NADA as the main starter substrate, as is the case for many insect phenoloxidases (21Anderson S.O. Binnington K. Retnakan A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis Sclerotization. 1991: 123-140Google Scholar, 22Sugumaran M. Binnington K. Retnakan A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis Sclerotization. 1991: 141-168Google Scholar). This hypothesis may be supported by the more efficient oxidation rate of NADA compared with l-dopa or dopamine (Fig. 1). The enzymatic activity is low, but it may be compensated for by the extremely high concentration of hemocyanin in the hemolymph of the tarantula, ranging between 5 and 120 g/liter. It should be mentioned that we were not able to detect other phenoloxidase activity in the hemolymph of tarantula under our experimental conditions. We tested fresh hemolymph with intact cells and crude but cell-free hemolymph by gel-electrophoresis but not spectroscopically because of the high turbidity of the samples. However, we did not look for prophenoloxidase activity within any cells. Thus, we cannot exclude the existence of any prophenoloxidase either in the blood cells or in other tissue cells. Experiments to demonstrate the physiological relevance of our experiments in vivo are in progress. Third, prophenoloxidases have been identified in the hemocytes of insects and a crustacean but have not been looked for in chelicerates yet (18Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as cheliceratean hemocyanin are also synthesized in the cytoplasm of hemocytes in contrast to crustacean hemocyanins, which are synthesized in cells of the hepatopancreas (5Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar), we could make the following very tentative hypothesis. In ancestral arthropods, hemocyanin was synthesized in hemocytes and had both functions, the oxygen transport and the oxidation of aromatic compounds after proteolytic cleavage. This ancestral state is still found in the chelicerates. But after divergence of chelicerates from other arthropods like crustaceans and insects, a gene duplication has occurred leading to crustacean hemocyanins and hexamerins (28Beintema J.J. Stam W.T. Hazes B. Smidt M.P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar, 29Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These hemocyanins no longer possess the capability to become phenoloxidases by proteolytic cleavage and become secondary proteins synthesized elsewhere in the body. The other line has lost the capability to form hexamers and to transport oxygen and has become the prophenoloxidases identified presently in insects and crustaceans. Finally, these observations suggest a system whereby one may examine the structural basis of phenoloxidase activity because no crystal structure of any phenoloxidase is available. We thank Drs. F. Tuczek, J. Beintema, and N. Terwilliger for intensive discussions and Dr. K. Miller for reading the manuscript and help with the English language."

In a previous study, we identified two proteins, 53BP1 and 53BP2, that are able to bind to wild type but not to mutant p53 via the DNA-binding domain of p53. We isolated cDNAs expressing a full-length human 53BP1 clone, which predicts a protein of 1972 residues that can be detected in the H358 human lung carcinoma cell line. The 53BP1 and 53BP2 genes were mapped to chromosomes 15q15–21 and 1q41–42, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies showed three types of staining patterns for 53BP1 as follows: both cytoplasmic and nuclear, homogeneous nuclear, and a nuclear dot pattern. In contrast, 53BP2 localized exclusively to the cytoplasm, and this pattern did not change upon coexpression of wild type p53. Although our previous study revealed that p53 is not able to bind simultaneously to either 53BP1 or 53BP2 and to DNA carrying a consensus binding site, both 53BP1 and 53BP2 enhanced p53-mediated transcriptional activation and induced the expression of a p53-dependent protein, suggesting that these proteins might function in signal transduction pathways to promote p53 activity. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that controls cell proliferation by regulating the expression of growth control genes.

However, the signal from p53 to the Gas1 gene product, which can result in a G0 arrest, does not require the trans-activation function of p53 (15Del-Sal G.D. Ruaro E.M. Utrera R. Cole C.N. Levine A.J. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7152-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in some cell types, a mutant p53 that lacks this function can induce apoptosis (22Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify two cellular proteins that bind to wt but not to mutant p53, designated p53-binding protein 1 and 2 (53BP1 and 53BP2) (23Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Both 53BP1 and 53BP2 bind to the central domain of p53 which is required for site-specific DNA binding. Although neither 53BP1 and 53BP2 has extensive homology to other known proteins, recent sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of 53BP1, which is sufficient for binding to p53, has homology both to the C terminus of BRCA1, a tumor suppressor specific for breast and ovarian cancer, and to Rad9, a yeast cell cycle checkpoint protein (24Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This BRCT (BRCA1 C terminus) domain is found in other proteins involved in a checkpoint that responds to DNA damage (25Callebaut I. Mornon J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 26Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may mediate protein-protein interactions involved in this process. 53BP2 has four ankyrin repeats and a single Src homology-3 domain in its C terminus (23Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Structural analysis indicated that 53BP2 binds to wt p53 via its fourth ankyrin repeat and the Src homology-3 domain (27Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). 53BP2 also interacts with BCL2, an apoptosis inhibitor, indicating a possible role for 53BP2 in apoptosis (28Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze further these p53-binding proteins, we have cloned and sequenced a full-length 53BP1 cDNA. Both 53BP1 and 53BP2 have been expressed in mammalian cells, and their cellular localization has been determined. Assaying a transfected p53-dependent reporter gene as well as endogenous p21 expression, we show that both 53BP1 and 53BP2 enhance p53-mediated transcriptional activation. For 53BP2, this effect may be responsible for its partial suppression of oncogene-mediated cell transformation. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments (29Belyavsky A. Vinogradova T.

A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) were carried out using the 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Two antisense primers were used: A7, 5′-CTCGCTCGCCCAGGTTGAACTGCAAAGACTCTTCACTC-3′, and A6, 5′-TGGCAACAGACTCAGCAACAGCAGTAGATCC-3′. These primers hybridize to sites on the sense strand of the reported partial 53BP1cDNA clone, A70 (23Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), 186 and 249 bases downstream from the 5′ end, respectively, of this clone (Fig. 1 A). Human skeletal muscle mRNA (CLONTECH) was used to generate cDNA with primer A6. After the mRNA was hydrolyzed with 0.375m NaOH, an anchor oligonucleotide was ligated to the 3′ end of cDNA. PCR amplification with the anchor primer and primer A7 resulted in amplification of a 450-bp fragment (R1), containing an additional 260 bp of 53BP1 cDNA sequence (Fig. 1 A). R1 was then used to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH) according to standard procedures (31Maniatis T. Frisch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Clone, P7, which was identified, was also used to screen this library, resulting in the isolation of clone P45 (Fig. 1 A). A 1.8-kb fragment was amplified from clone P45 by PCR with the sense primer A29, 5′-AAGAAGATACTTCAGGCAATA-3′, and the antisense primer A30, 5′-CTGGAGTCCTCTGAAGTAGCT-3′ (Fig. 1 A). Finally, a Jurkat cell cDNA library (a gift of Dr. P. Enrietto, State University of New York, Stony Brook) was screened with this 1.8-kb fragment, and the clone P7a was isolated. The 53BP1 cDNA sequence was obtained by sequencing overlapping cDNA inserts on both strands. All cDNA fragments were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase Kit Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The full-length 53BP1 cDNA was constructed in pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) from the inserts A70, P45, and P7a as follows. EcoRI digestion of clone P7a divided the insert DNA into two fragments, 1.25 and 0.27 kb. The 5′ 1.25-kb fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS(+) to generate pL6-2. pL6-2 was then digested at theNdeI site in the 53BP1 cDNA insert and at theBamHI site in the polylinker, and the resulting 529-bpNdeI-BamHI fragment was deleted from pL6-2 and replaced by a 2.6-kb NdeI-BamHI 53BP1fragment from clone P45 to generate pL8′-2. The 3.6-kb BglII53BP1 insert from the plasmid pSE1107A70 (23Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) was ligated into the BamHI site of pBluescript II KS(+) to generate pBSA70. pBSA70 was digested at the internal BamHI site in the 53BP1 cDNA and at the SpeI site in the polylinker, and the resulting 3.3-kb BamHI-SpeI fragment was ligated between the BamHI site in 53BP1 and the SpeI site in the polylinker of pL8′-2 to generate pBS53BP16.6. A 481-bp fragment beginning at the first ATG of the 53BP1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides A43 containing restriction sites forEcoRI and BssHII 5′ to the ATG, 5′-GGGGAGAATTCGGGCGCGCATGGACCCTACTGGAAGT-3′, and A32, 5′-GGGCTCGAGCAGCACCAAGGGAATGTGTA-3′ (Fig. 1 A). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and was inserted between the EcoRI site and the XhoI site in the polylinker of pCITE2C (Novagen) to generate pL17-1. The 428-bpXbaI fragment from pL17-1 was replaced by a 6.3-kbXbaI fragment between the XbaI site in 53BP1 and the XbaI site in the polylinker of pBS53BP16.6 to generate pCITE53BP16.4. The full-length 53BP1cDNA fragment was then obtained by digesting pCITE53BP16.4 at theBssHII site in the oligonucleotide A43 and at theXhoI site in the polylinker of pCITE53BP16.4. Both ends of this fragment were filled-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and the fragment was ligated into the filled-in BamHI site of pCMH6K (32Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. P. Tegtmeyer, State University of New York, Stony Brook) to generate pCMH6K53BP1. The protein expressed from pCMH6K contains an N-terminal tag that includes an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and a six-histidine tag. pCMH6K53BP1-N and pCMH6K53BP1-C were generated by ligating a 3.3-kb BamHI fragment of pCMH6K53BP1 and a 3.1-kbBamHI-BglII fragment of pSE1107A70, respectively, into the BamHI site of pCMH6K. pCMH6K53BP1-N and pCMH6K53BP1-C express the N-terminal 1052 and C-terminal 921 residues of 53BP1, respectively. The plasmid p14b (a gift of Dr. L. Naumovski, Stanford) contains the full-length 53BP2 gene in pBluescript SK (Stratagene). pCMH6K53BP2, a plasmid expressing the full-length 53BP2, was generated by inserting a BamHI fragment from p14b into the BamHI site of pCMH6K. The mammalian expression plasmid for wt mouse p53 (pCMH6Kp53) is described elsewhere (32Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSP72-ras and pBS-E1A, used for the transformation suppression assay, express activated Ras and the adenovirus E1A protein, respectively (33Reed M. Wang Y. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid, pCAB-PG26TATA, contains 26 direct repeats of a consensus p53-binding site upstream of an E1B TATA promoter and the CAT gene (32Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). pLB contains the same promoter with a single copy of the p53 recognition sequence controlling the luciferase gene (34Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A 1.3-kbPvuII fragment of the 53BP1 cDNA and a 1.3-kbHindIII-XbaI fragment of the 53BP2cDNA were used to screen 1.2 million plaques of a human genomic library (a gift of Dr. P. Enrietto, State University of New York, Stony Brook) according to standard procedures (31Maniatis T. Frisch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Inserts of positive phage clones were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+), and a panel of primers that hybridized on the 53BP1 or the 53BP2cDNA was used to obtain sequences of the corresponding genomic clones. Clones that were confirmed to contain 53BP1 or53BP2 genomic DNA were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization. Plasmid DNAs were biotinylated by nick translation, prehybridized in the presence of human Cot1DNA, and hybridized (at 10 ng/μl) to metaphase spreads of a normal male following procedures described in detail elsewhere (35Trask B.J. Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual.in: Birren B. Green E. Hieter P. Myers R. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). After hybridization and washing, the hybridization sites were labeled with fluorescein-conjugated avidin, and the chromosomes, which had previously been released from an early S-methotrexate block in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine, were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to produce a QFH-like banding pattern. Digital image processing was performed as described elsewhere (36Wise C.A. Clines G.A. Massa H. Trask B.J. Lovett M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The locations of hybridization signals were analyzed in 15–20 well spread, well banded metaphases for each plasmid. NCI-H358, human lung carcinoma cells (37Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. P. Tegtmeyer, State University of New York, Stony Brook), MCF7, human breast carcinoma cells (a gift of Dr. K. Kasahara, Kanazawa University), rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) (Biowhittaker), COS-1 (a gift of Dr. Y. Yoshitake, Kanazawa Medical University), HepG2, Saos-2, and WI38 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Japan) were used. REFs, MCF7, HepG2, and WI38 cells contain wt p53, whereas H358 and Saos-2 cells lack p53 alleles. All cells except WI38 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. WI38 cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. Transfections of cells were done at 70% confluency using Lipofectin (Boehringer Mannheim), except for MCF7 which used LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturers' protocols. COS-1 and H358 cells were seeded on coverslips and transfected with expression vectors expressing HA-tagged 53BP1, 53BP2, or p53. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 3.3% formamide and permeabilized with cold methanol acetone (50:50) for 3 min at room temperature. After a wash in PBS (31Maniatis T. Frisch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), cells were incubated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 2 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 2.4 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (BioSource International) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The coverslips were washed and mounted on slides, and the cells were examined and photographed with Kodak Tmax 400 film. H358, MCF7, and COS-1 cells that had been transfected with various expression plasmids were washed once with PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation. H358 and COS-1 cells were lysed with SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and applied to a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. MCF7 cells were lysed with PBS supplemented with 2% SDS and boiled for 3 min. Chromosomal DNA was sheared by passage repeatedly through a 26-gauge needle. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce), and 400 μg of protein was applied to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with 12CA5 (1 μg/ml), rabbit anti-53BP1 polyclonal antibodies (5 μg/ml), or a combination of mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody pAb421 (Calbiochem) (10 μg/ml) and mouse anti-p21 monoclonal antibody F5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MCF cells were irradiated in their culture dishes under subconfluent conditions at room temperature with a60Co-γ irradiator to deliver a dose of 8 Gy. Immediately after irradiation, the cells were cultured at 37 °C and then collected 4 h later. Two transiently transfected 10-cm dishes of H358 cells were pooled 40 h after transfection. Cells were lysed, and both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were recovered following the protocol of Gashler et al. (38Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Suknatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The nuclear fraction was lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were incubated with Ni-NTA beads that were equilibrated in the same lysis buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. Supernatants were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. The transformation assay was performed as described by Reed et al. (33Reed M. Wang Y. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar). REFs were prepared by passaging Fisher rat embryos three times. For transfection, a mixture of DNA, 2.5 μg of pSP72-RAS, and 2.5 μg of pBS-E1A, 50 μl of Lipofectin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 50 μl of 2× HeBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added to a 10-cm dish containing 3 × 105 cells/dish. For the transformation suppression assay, either 5 μg of pCMH6Kp53 or 22.5 μg of pCMH6K53BP2 or both were included. Transfected REFs were incubated and refed 20 h post-transfection and every 3 days. At 14 days post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained for 2 h with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution for protein detection. Plates were rinsed with water, and foci were counted. Duplicate samples were assayed each time, and each set of assays was repeated at least three times. For CAT assays, H358 cells were transfected with pCAB-PG26TATA (1 μg), pCMH6Kp53 (1 μg), and varying amounts of pCMH6K53BP1 or pCMH6K53BP2. pCMH6K DNA was used to adjust the total DNA to 10 μg. Cells were washed once with PBS 40 h after transfection, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and lysed by 6 rounds of freezing and thawing. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and its protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). 10 μg of protein were incubated with n-butyryl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol at 37 °C for 1 h. Butyrylated chloramphenicol products were extracted by a fixed volume of mixed xylenes (Aldrich), and the radioactivity of the butyrylated chloramphenicol was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Packard). Each assay was repeated three times. Northern blotting experiments indicated that 53BP1 is expressed in all tissues assayed with two transcripts of 11 and 6.6 kb (23Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Maraaccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As the initial53BP1 cDNA clones contained only 3.6 kb of sequence, we sought to identify a full-length 53BP1 cDNA. By using the 5′-RACE method (29Belyavsky A. Vinogradova T. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2919-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 30Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) with human skeletal muscle mRNA, we cloned a 450-bp fragment (R1), containing 260 bp of new sequence (Fig. 1 A). The R1 fragment was used to screen a cDNA library, followed by subsequent screenings using newly obtained sequences of two different cDNA libraries (see “Experimental Procedures”) to result in the isolation of cDNAs that together spanned 6.6 kb (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of the assembled 53BP1 cDNA is available, and the predicted open reading frame is shown in Fig. 1 B. The likely translation initiation codon of 53BP1 is preceded by an in-frame stop codon located 18 bp upstream. Although the nucleotide sequence 5′ of the first ATG (GAGCAGATG) does not resemble the consensus initiation sequence (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), as more than 90% of translation in vertebrates starts from the first methionine (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), we designate this ATG as the putative translation start site. The predicted open reading frame of the 6.6-kb 53BP1 cDNA encompasses 1972 amino acids, a protein with a molecular mass of 217 kDa. Recent sequence analysis revealed two BRCT domains in the C-terminal 247 residues of 53BP1. However, analysis of the entire protein by BLAST (40Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar) did not show any extensive homology to other known proteins. The interactions between 53BP1 and 53BP2 with wt but not mutant p53 raise the possibility that 53BP1 and 53BP2 are involved in some aspect of carcinogenesis in humans. Furthermore, it is possible that 53BP1 is a tumor suppressor based on its sequence homology to BRCA1. Therefore, it was of interest to map the chromosomal locations of these genes to determine whether they are located near cytogenetic locations known or suspected to harbor oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. To obtain probes long enough for in situ hybridization, we screened a human genomic library with probes derived from the cDNAs of 53BP1 and 53BP2, and we obtained 5 phage clones for 53BP1 and 9 for 53BP2. Two of these clones, clone A2–3 for 53BP1 and clone B1–2 for 53BP2,were confirmed to contain the appropriate DNA and were used for the chromosome localization experiments. 53BP1 and 53BP2 were mapped to their chromosomal location by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Plasmids A2-3 and B1-2 were biotinylated and hybridized to metaphase spreads of a normal male donor. 53BP1 (clone A2-3) maps to 15q15–21, and 53BP2 (clone B1-2) maps to 1q41–42 (Fig. 2). Neither these regions contains a known tumor suppressor gene or oncogene. To identify the protein expressed by the full-length 53BP1 cDNA we had assembled, we transfected H358 cells with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged 53BP1 (pCMH6K53BP1). In parallel, we also transfected expression plasmids for HA-tagged 53BP2 (pCMH6K53BP2) and p53 (pCMH6Kp53). Cells lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody which recognizes the HA tag. In cells transfected with pCMH6K53BP1, a protein larger than the 220-kDa marker was detected (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), indicating that the 53BP1 protein migrates significantly slower than its predicted size. Proteins with apparent sizes of 150 and 53 kDa were detected in cells transfected with the 53BP2 or p53 plasmids, respectively (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). A construct that expresses native non-tagged 53BP2 was reported to express a protein of 150 kDa, as determined by Western blot using rabbit anti-53BP2 antibodies (28Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A background of proteins was detected by 12CA5 in all cells, including those transfected with the expression plasmid lacking an insert (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). We also examined the time course of expression of the transfected 53BP1 and 53BP2 in H358 cells so that cells with peak level expression of these proteins could be used for the reporter assays (see below). Both 53BP1 and 53BP2 were expressed at 30 h post-transfection, and this expression continued at least until 40 h post-transfection (Fig. 3 B). Based on these time courses, we used cells 40 h after transfection in our transcriptional activation assays. In order to detect the endogenous 53BP1 protein in mammalian cells, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal 270 residues of this protein (41Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27544-27555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These antibodies detected the HA-tagged full-length (Fig. 3 C, lane 2) and HA-tagged C-terminal half (Fig. 3 C, lane 4) but not the HA-tagged N-terminal half (Fig. 3 C, lane 3) of 53BP1 expressed in COS-1 cells. The expression of each HA-tagged protein in COS-1 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the same blot with 12CA5 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7–9). Cell extracts from the human fibroblast cell line, WI38, and from the human cancer cell lines Saos-2, H358, and HepG2 were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-53BP1 polyclonal antibodies. We detected a band that has the same molecular weight as the protein produced by the full-length 53BP1-expressing plasmid only in H358 cells (Fig. 3 C, lane 1), indicating that the assembled53BP1 cDNA encodes the endogenous 53BP1 protein. Previously, we showed that both 53BP1 and 53BP2 bind to the DNA-binding domain of p53 and that p53 bound to 53BP1 or 53BP2 was not able to bind simultaneously to DNA carrying a consensus p53-binding site (23Iwabuch"

Recent evidence demonstrating that mammalian cells express novel, yet uncharacterized, Sp1-like proteins has stimulated a search for new members of this family. We and others have recently reported that the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-regulated gene TIEGencodes a new Sp1-like protein that inhibits cell growth in cultured cells. Here we report the identification, nuclear localization, DNA binding activity, transcriptional repression activity, and growth inhibitory effects of TIEG2, a novel TGF-β-inducible gene related to TIEG. TIEG2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with an enrichment in pancreas and muscle. TIEG2 shares 91% homology with TIEG1 within the zinc finger region and 44% homology within the N terminus. Biochemical characterization reveals that TIEG2 is a nuclear protein, which, as predicted from the primary structure, specifically binds to an Sp1-like DNA sequence in vitroand can repress a promoter containing Sp1-like binding sites in transfected Chinese hamster ovary epithelial cells. Furthermore, functional studies using [3H]thymidine uptake and MTS (3-(4,3-dimethyltiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assays demonstrate that the overexpression of TIEG2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibits cell proliferation.

These proteins are characterized by the presence of three highly conserved C-terminal zinc finger domains, which bind to GC-rich sequences.

This evidence has led many laboratories to search for novel members of the Sp1-like proteins.

In the current study, we describe the identification and functional characterization of TIEG2, a novel, ubiquitously expressed, Sp1-like zinc finger encoding cDNA. We have called this protein TIEG2 because, among the known members of the Sp1-like proteins, it displays the highest level of homology with TIEG. Sequence analysis demonstrates that TIEG2 contains the typical three zinc finger array at the C-terminal region of the protein and an N-terminal proline-rich domain. Biochemical studies indicate that TIEG2 encodes a nuclear protein that binds to a GC-rich consensus Sp1-like binding site and behaves as a transcriptional repressor. Moreover, functional studies demonstrate that the overexpression of TIEG2 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells inhibits cell proliferation. Thus, the identification and characterization of TIEG2 expands the repertoire of Sp1-like proteins expressed in mammalian cells and extends our understanding of the molecular machinery involved in the regulation of cell growth. We searched for TIEG-related proteins by comparing the rat TIEG sequence (GenBank™ accession number U88630) (13Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P.N. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. Urrutia R. J. Clin.

This comparison indicated the presence of a related Expressed Sequence Tag (I.M.A.G.E. clone 770800) (American Tissue Culture Collection (ATTC), Rockville, MD). For the isolation of TIEG2-encoding cDNAs, a total of 106 amplified recombinant plaques from a human epithelial CF Pac-1 cell line cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and screened using the TIEG-related Expressed Sequence Tag clone described above as a probe labeled to a specific activity of 2 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA. Recombinants were hybridized overnight at 68 °C in a solution containing 6× SSPE (1× SSPE = 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7), 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed with a final stringency of 0.1× SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Positive plaques were isolated for a secondary screening, which was performed under the same conditions as the first. cDNAs were rescued using the ExAssist helper phage-mediated protocol (Stratagene). Sequencing was performed using a thermocycler-based double-stranded DNA sequencing system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The analyses of sequences and data base comparisons were performed using GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) and BLAST (NIH, Bethesda, MD) DNA analysis software. The human pancreatic epithelial cell line, PANC1, and the Chinese hamster ovary epithelial cell line, CHO, were obtained from ATCC. PANC1 cells were cultured in DMEM, and CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 media, both supplemented with 5% FBS, 5% newborn calf serum, 100units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For experiments on the growth factor-mediated regulation of TIEG2 gene expression, PANC1 cells were cultured in 0.5% FBS-containing DMEM for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 3.5 ng/ml IGF-I or IGF-II, or 5 ng/ml PDGF (Life Technologies, Inc.,) in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for different periods of time before RNA extraction. 10 μg/ml cycloheximide or 1 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) was applied 30 min before and during TGF-β1 treatment for the early response experiments. For serum addition experiments, cells were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment with 15% FBS in DMEM. For serum withdrawal experiments, cells were cultured with 15% FBS for 24 h, media was replaced with DMEM alone, and RNA was extracted at various times after removal. Total RNA was prepared, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (40Cook T. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Northern blots of RNA from various human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Membranes were probed using either 4 ng/ml random primed32P-labeled full-length TIEG1 or TIEG2 cDNAs and washed with a final stringency of 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was carried out at −80 °C using X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and intensifying screens. For normalization, northerns were re-hybridized with a probe against the housekeeping genes, β-actin and 18 S, as described previously (13Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P.N. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. Urrutia R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2365-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of TIEG2 was determined using an epitope tag approach as described previously (41Imoto M. Tachibana I. Urrutia R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding an epitope-tagged form of TIEG2 was assembled by cloning the coding sequence of this gene in-frame with the XpressTM epitope in the pcDNA3.1/HisA vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Approximately 2 × 106 CHO cells/100-mm dish were transfected with the Xpress-tagged TIEG2 (pcHisTIEG2) for 5 h using LipofectAMINETM according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four h after the start of transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and plated on poly(l-lysine)-coated coverslips. After an additional 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min with −20 °C methanol. The localization of the tagged TIEG2 was performed using a monoclonal anti-XpressTMantibody (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and a fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR) by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (41Imoto M. Tachibana I. Urrutia R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM-310 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) using a 63× oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.25. The excitation was performed using 488- and 568-nm wavelengths from an argon krypton laser. For illustration purposes, the cytoplasm was given a red pseudocolor to show the cell outline. Gel shift assays were performed essentially as described (42Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 43Horie N. Takeishi K. J. Biol.

Briefly, a double-stranded GC-rich Sp1 binding site, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′, or a mutant GC box in which the two underlined G residues are replaced with two T residues (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Promega, Madison, WI). A NF1 binding site, 5′-CCTTTGGCATGCTGCCAATATG-3′, was used for heterologous competition studies. A glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein carrying the zinc finger region of TIEG2 (GST-ZF) was also used for these studies. To generate this construct, the three zinc fingers of TIEG2 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned in-frame with GST in the vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and verified by sequencing. BL21 bacteria were induced to express the GST-ZF fusion protein with the addition of 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h, and the recombinant protein was purified over a GST-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified GST or GST-ZF (∼200 ng) was incubated 10 min at room temperature with or without cold competitor or anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Promega). End-labeled oligonucleotide was added to each reaction for an additional 20 min, and the reactions were loaded immediately onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run for 3 h at 120 V at room temperature. Autoradiography was carried out at room temperature using X-Omat film (Kodak). The transcriptional regulatory activity of TIEG2 was determined in transfected CHO cells using the luciferase reporter plasmid pGAGC6, which contains six GC-rich Sp1 binding sites (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffery Kudlow, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) (44Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGAGC0, with the Sp1-like binding sites deleted, was used as a control. CHO cells were transfected with the pcHisTIEG2 vector and either the pGAGC6 or pGAGC0 reporter plasmids. Control experiments were performed using the parental plasmid pcDNA3.1/His. For these experiments, 3 × 105 CHO cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 4.5 μg of pcHisTIEG2 or control pcDNA3.1/His vector. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase assays were performed using a Turner 20/20 luminometer and a luciferase assay system according to manufacturer's suggestions (Promega, Madison, WI). Relative luciferase activity was determined using equal amounts of protein (20 μg) and was expressed as a ratio between the activity of pGAGC6 and pGAGC0. Studies were performed in triplicate in at least six independent experiments with similar results. To search for repression motifs within TIEG2, cDNAs encoding the regions N-terminal (1–389) or C-terminal (461–495 amino acids) to the zinc finger DNA binding domain were cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding motif present in the effector vector pSG424 (kindly provided by Dr. Zeleznik-Le, University of Chicago) (45Zeleznik-Le N.J. Harden A.M. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10610-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This vector was co-transfected along with a reporter construct carrying five GAL4 binding sequences upstream of the thymidine kinase basal promoter driving the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. As a control for basal transcriptional activity, the reporter construct was co-transfected with a plasmid carrying only the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Transfection of 5 × 105 CHO cells in 60-mm tissue culture dishes was performed in triplicate with a total of 5 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Co-transfection with a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase, pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega), was performed to control for transfection efficiency. Relative CAT activity was assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method from Boehringer Mannheim, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). In all experiments, CAT activity was determined using the same amount of protein (50 μg), and the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Studies were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments with similar results. Cell growth was measured in TIEG2-transfected CHO cells by [3H]thymidine uptake and colorimetric MTS assays. To enrich for cells overexpressing TIEG2, cells were co-transfected with pcHisTIEG2 and green fluorescent protein expression vector, phGFP-S65T (CLONTECH), as described previously (46Adams P.D. Lopez P. Sellers W.R. Kaelin W.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A control cell population was co-transfected with the parental plasmid, pcDNA3.1/HisA, and phGFP-S65T. Twenty-four h after transfection, GFP-expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were then plated in a 96-well microtiter plate at 4 × 103 cells/well, and proliferation was measured 12 to 72 h later using a colorimetric MTS assay according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Promega). For measurement of [3H]thymidine uptake, 4 × 104 cells were plated in a 48-well microtiter dish. Twelve to 72 h after plating, cells were incubated with 0.1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine/well at 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and incubated in 1 m NaOH with 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 37 °C. Scintillation counting of incorporated3H was performed using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). For annexin V studies, CHO cells were co-transfected with the CD20 transmembrane receptor (a gift kindly provided by Dr. David McKean, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and TIEG2-expressing plasmids. Annexin V analysis on CD20-positive cells was performed by FACS as described previously (46Adams P.D. Lope"

We report here that MCP-1 stimulates the formation of the lipid products of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, namely phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI 3,4,5-P3) in THP-1 cells that can be inhibited by pertussis toxin but not wortmannin. MCP-1 also stimulates an increase in the in vitro lipid kinase activity present in immunoprecipitates of the class 1A p85/p110 heterodimeric PI 3-kinase, although the kinetics of activation were much slower than observed for the accumulation of PI 3,4,5-P3. In addition, this in vitro lipid kinase activity was inhibited by wortmannin (IC50 = 4.47 ± 1.88 nm,n = 4), and comparable concentrations of wortmannin also inhibited MCP-stimulated chemotaxis of THP-1 cells (IC50 = 11.8 ± 4.2 nm, n= 4), indicating that p85/p110 PI 3-kinase activity is functionally relevant. MCP-1 also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of three proteins in these cells, and a fourth tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-precipitates with the p85 subunit upon MCP-1 stimulation. In addition, MCP-1 stimulated lipid kinase activity present in immunoprecipitates of a class II PI 3-kinase (PI3K-C2α) with kinetics that closely resembled the accumulation of PI 3,4,5-P3. Moreover, this MCP-1-induced increase in PI3K-C2α activity was insensitive to wortmannin but was inhibited by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Since this mirrored the effects of these inhibitors on MCP-1-stimulated increases in D-3 phosphatidylinositol lipid accumulation in vivo, these results suggest that activation of PI3K-C2α rather than the p85/p110 heterodimer is responsible for mediating the in vivo formation of D-3 phosphatidylinositol lipids. These data demonstrate that MCP-1 stimulates protein tyrosine kinases as well as at least two separate PI 3-kinase isoforms, namely the p85/p110 PI 3-kinase and PI3K-C2α. This is the first demonstration that MCP-1 can stimulate PI 3-kinase activation and is also the first indication of an agonist-induced activation of the PI3K-C2α enzyme.

MCP-1 has also been demonstrated to augment cytotoxic lymphocyte and natural killer cell activity in vitro, suggesting a novel role for chemokines as costimulators of T cell activation (9Taub D.D.

Support for MCP-1's importance in the physiology of inflammation comes from demonstrations in transgenic mice that it functions as a monocyte chemoattractantin vivo (10Fuentes M.E. Durham S.K.

Interestingly, both CCR2A and CCR2B can both couple to the Gi-Gβγ-PLCβ2 pathway, but these receptors demonstrate an interesting specificity in their coupling to the α-subunits of the Gq class. Hence, CCR2B couples to both Gα16 and Gα14, whereas CCR2A cannot couple to either Gα14 or Gα16 (22Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Other signaling events downstream of MCP-1 remain relatively poorly defined. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the related CC chemokine RANTES has been demonstrated to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins in a T-cell clone (25Bacon K.B.

The prototypical class 1A PI 3-kinase consists of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit responsible for protein-protein interactions via protein tyrosine phosphate-binding src homology domains and a catalytic 110-kDa subunit (28Vanhaesebroeck B.

Nevertheless, there is some evidence that G protein-coupled receptors, such as fMLP receptors, are able to activate the p85/p110 PI 3-kinase (36Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T.R.

In this respect, the p85/p110 heterodimer has been demonstrated to be synergistically activated by the βγ subunits of G proteins and by phosphotyrosyl peptide (37Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T.

The class I PI 3-kinases can potentially generate three lipid products, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PI 3-P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI 3,4-P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI 3,4,5-P3), which are collectively known as D-3 phosphatidylinositol lipids (reviewed in Refs. 38Stephens L.R.

Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). To date, PI 3,4-P2 and PI 3,4,5-P3 are regarded as signaling molecules, whereas PI 3-P is thought to regulate membrane trafficking (38Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys.

The PI 3-kinase family is completed by the class II C2 domain-containing PI 3-kinases and the class III PtdIns-specific 3-kinases (28Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.A. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The 190-kDa PI3K-C2α is a novel human member of the class II PI 3-kinase family that, in contrast to members of the other PI 3-kinase classes, is refractory to inhibition by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (40Domin J.

In addition, PI3K-C2α utilizes predominantly PI and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate as substrates in vitro, but when presented with phosphatidylserine it can also phosphorylate PI 4,5-bisphosphate (40Domin J.

Given the functional role of MCP-1 on superoxide generation and chemotaxis (4Carr M.W. Roth S.J. Luther E. Rose S.S. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1990; 171: 2177-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), it is interesting to note that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibits fMLP-stimulated superoxide release (31Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), interleukin-8-stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis (41Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 2437-2444PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, therefore, we have investigated the possible involvement of PI 3-kinase(s) in MCP-1 signal transduction and chemotaxis using the THP-1 monocytic cell line. Human recombinant MCP-1 was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Mouse p85α monoclonal antibody (mAb) was a generous gift from Doreen Cantrell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. All cell culture reagents and pertussis toxin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Wortmannin and standard phosphatidylinositol lipids were purchased from Sigma as was the PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. An N-terminal fragment was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in the following manner. Nucleotides 4–1011 of the PI3K-C2α cDNA sequence (encoding residues 2–337) were amplified by PCR using complementary oligonucleotides, which would incorporate a SmaI and anEcoRI restriction site at its 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. Following digestion with SmaI/EcoRI, this cDNA was ligated into a pGex2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to allow its in frame expression at the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase. This plasmid was used to transformEpicurian coli XL-1 cells, and production of the glutathioneS-transferase fusion was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (30 °C for 4 h). Cells were harvested and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 milli-trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotonin, 50 μm pepstatin, and 50 μm leupeptin (PBST buffer) at 4 °C. The fusion protein was affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (4 h, 40 °C), and after washing, it was eluted from the beads upon the addition of 10 mmglutathione, 150 mm NaCl in 100 μm Tris, pH 8.0. Glutathione was removed by dialysis against 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C. Aliquots of the expressed fusion protein were frozen and injected into rabbits (100 μg) at monthly intervals. One week after each injection, serum was tested for its ability to immunoprecipitate and Western blot recombinant PI3K-C2α protein and PI3K-C2α immunoreactivity from cell lysates. The resulting antisera displayed no cross-reaction upon Western blotting against a range of other recombinant PI 3-kinase protein standards. 2J. Domin and M. Waterfield, unpublished observations. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 expressing CCR2 was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (14Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc.

The cells were cultured in humidified incubators at 37 °C, 5% (v/v) CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 1 × 108 cells were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) as described (42Jackson T.R.

The samples were deacylated and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC analysis using a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman) (42Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluate was fed into a Canberra Packard A-500 Flo-One on-line radiodetector, and the results were analyzed by the Flo-One data program (Radiomatic). Eluted peaks were compared with retention times for standards prepared from 3H-labeled phosphatidylinositol lipids (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and32P-labeled D-3 phosphatidylinositols described elsewhere (42Jackson T.R.

The reaction was terminated after 15 min, and the resulting phospholipids were then separated by TLC (43Ward S.G. Reif K. Ley S. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol.

Aliquots of cell lysate (20 μl) or immunoprecipitates generated using either anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (1 μg/ml) or anti-p85 (1 μg/ml) antibodies were boiled in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed through 7.5% (v/v) acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (44Wright K. Ward S.G. Kolios G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12626-12633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with the anti-PI3K-C2α polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) or anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (0.1 μg/ml) as indicated in the appropriate figure legends, and the proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Ig (0.1 μg/ml) horseradish peroxidase conjugate, respectively, as a secondary antibody (Dako). THP-1 cell chemotaxis was examined using a 96-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD). The wells of the 96-well plate were filled with 380 μl of chemoattractant diluted in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and covered with an adhesive polyvinylpyrrolidine-free polycarbonate membrane (5-μm pore size). 5 × 105 cells were added to each upper well in a volume of 200 μl, and the chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cell suspension was subsequently aspirated off, and 200 μl of Versene (Life Technologies Inc., Paisley, UK) was added to each well. After a 20-min incubation at 4 °C, the 96-well plate and membrane were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of RPMI containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. THP-1 cell migration was assessed by adding 20 μl of Cell Titer 96 AQueoussolution (Promega, UK) to each well. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the plate was read at a wavelength of 490 nm, subtracting the readings at a reference wavelength of 650 nm to reduce the background contributed by nonspecific absorbance. MCP-1 induces a rapid and transient activation of phospholipase C in THP-1 cells (23Sozzani S. Molino M. Locati M. Luini W. Cerletti C. Vecchi A. Mantovani A. J.

In this study, we have used 32P-labeled THP-1 cells to investigate the effect of MCP-1 stimulation on the activation of another signaling pathway, namely PI 3-kinase. Accordingly, treatment of THP-1 cells with MCP-1 resulted in the concentration-dependent formation of PI 3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 1 A). The MCP-1-induced increase in PI 3,4,5-P3 exhibited bell-shaped characteristics with the maximum response observed in the presence of 60 nm MCP-1 (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the MCP-1-stimulated formation of PI 3,4,5-P3 was extremely rapid and transient, since it was detectable 5 s after stimulation and had returned to basal levels 2 min after MC"

Although the biochemical pathways of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis are relatively well understood, the localization of the enzymes involved in these processes has remained controversial. We here have raised antibodies against CGalT and shown by immunocytochemistry on ultrathin cryosections that the enzyme is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope but not to the Golgi apparatus or the plasma membrane. In pulse-chase experiments, we have observed that newly synthesized CGalT remains sensitive to endoglycosidase H, confirming the results of the morphological localization experiments.

Glycosphingolipids are enriched in the outer membrane leaflet of the plasma membrane of most eukaryotic cells, where they play a structural role in rigidifying and protecting the cell surface. A remarkable property of glycosphingolipids is found in the myelin sheath of Schwann cells where galactosylceramide (GalCer)1 and sulfatide are involved in axonal insulation, myelin function, and stability (1Coetzee T.

The enormous diversity in glycosidic structure of glycosphingolipids suggests specific roles of individual glycosphingolipids in cell physiology. Glycosphingolipids are involved in a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, cell-cell interaction, transmembrane signaling (4Hakomori S. Biochem. Soc.

Science. 1991; 253: 320-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Furthermore, glycosphingolipids are thought to play a key role in the sorting of lipids and proteins to the apical plasma membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells (9van Meer G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical pathways of glycosphingolipid synthesis are relatively well established, the intracellular localization and the topology of the enzymes involved in these pathways are incompletely understood. Until recently, these questions have largely been addressed by measuring the activity of these enzymes in isolated subcellular fractions (11Futerman A.H. Pagano R. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 12van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

The usefulness of such approaches, however, is limited, because removal of contaminating membranes has the caveat of selecting a subfraction of the membrane of interest. Alternatively, enzymes associated with a given intracellular compartment may dissociate from accessory factors, resulting in diminished activity or specificity. As a consequence, the localization of some of the glycosphingolipid-synthesizing enzymes is not clear. One of these enzymes is the UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase. It catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) to ceramide, yielding GalCer (15Morell P. Radin N.S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

CGalT contains a carboxy-terminal KKVK sequence that may act as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal, and the lack of complex glycosylated oligosaccharide chains is consistent with an ER localization (19Schulte S. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Still, a vast body of controversial results concerning the intracellular localization of CGalT has been reported. Biochemical enzyme assays on semipurified membranes and immunocytochemistry suggest that GalCer synthesis occurs in the Golgi complex and ER (13Burger K.N. van der Bijl P. van Meer G. J.

As part of our ongoing efforts to define the molecular mechanism of glycosphingolipid-mediated intracellular protein and lipid sorting, we here investigated the cellular location of CGalT and its membrane topology. We raised antibodies against CGalT and show that it is a class I integral membrane protein that is localized to the ER but not to the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane. Importantly, we found that CGlcT (28Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) in addition to GlcCer also synthesizes GalCer from a short chain ceramide in vitro when assayed in the presence of UDP-Gal, without UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc). This explains many of the ambiguities previously observed for CGalT localization. Reagents used in this study were from commercial sources and described in previous papers originating from this laboratory (13Burger K.N. van der Bijl P. van Meer G. J.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, CHOlec8 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD), and HeLa cells were cultured as described before (31van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I. Proc.

D6P2T cells, MEB4 cells, and CGlcT-deficient GM95 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Transient expression in HeLa cells was done with recombinant vaccinia T7 RNA polymerase, and protein expression was analyzed 5 h after infection (31van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6313-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). CHOlec8 cells were transfected with CGalTpcDNA3 (23van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate procedure (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 53: 456-467Crossref Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were obtained by subcloning individual colonies. Positive clones were selected by measuring CGalT enzyme activity as described (23van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transfected CGalT-CHO (23van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and CGalT-CHOlec8 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml geneticin. Protein expression was induced by 5 mm sodium butyrate (Fluka, Buchs, Germany) 14–16 h prior to all experiments (33Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I.

PCR products were ligated between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pRSET-A (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). A c-Myc epitope was spliced between Ser69 and Leu70 of CGalT by separately amplifying the 5′ and 3′ region of its cDNA in PCR reactions using CGalTpcDNA3 as template and the following primer sets: for the 5′ region, 5′-CGT CAA TGG GAG TTT GTT TTG GCA C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTC TTC CGA TAT CAG CTT CTG TTC CTC GCT GTA GTG ATT AGA TGG GTC AAT GTC TC-3′ (reverse); for the 3′ region, 5′-GAG GAA CAG AAG CTG ATA TCG GAA GAG GAT CTA CTC CAG CGA TAC CCA GGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGT CAA GGA AGG CAC GGG GGA G-3′ (reverse). PCR products were ligated into pGEMT-easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The 3′ region was released with EcoRV and SpeI and ligated between the EcoRV and SpeI sites of 5′ region pGEMT-easy. CGalTmyc was released with HindIII and XbaI and inserted in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A CGlcT cDNA was generously provided by Yoshio Hirabayashi and ligated in the NotI site of pcDNA3 to produce CGlcTpcDNA3. All constructs made by PCR were confirmed by sequencing both strands (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). pRSET-A constructs were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) and used for fusion protein production. Fusion proteins were insoluble and purified under denaturing conditions on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen, Leusden, The Netherlands) according to the vendor's instructions. His6-CGalT fusion proteins were dialyzed against PBS and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. Microsomal proteins prepared from CGalT-CHO cells were separated on preparative 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and used for affinity purification of antibodies. The mouse monoclonal antibodies 1D3 against PDI and CTR433 against a Golgi protein (35Jasmin B.J. Cartoud J. Bornens M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7218-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Stephen Fuller and Michel Bornens, respectively. The mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the Myc epitope was described previously (36Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). CGalT was synthesized from CGalTpcDNA3 in a coupled T7 RNA polymerase transcription-translation system (Promega) in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, dog pancreas microsomes (Promega), and Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) as described previously (37Bottger G. Nagelkerken B. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29191-29197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The translation mixture was diluted with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and spun for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, after which CGalT was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant. CGalT-CHO cells were washed with PBS and methionine- and cysteine-free minimal essential medium containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (pulse medium). The cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min in pulse medium and labeled with 250 μCi/ml Tran35S-label for 5 or 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and chased at 37 °C in growth medium containing 5 mm methionine, 5 mm cysteine, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After different periods of chase time, the cells were lysed in PBS, 1% TX-100, and CGalT was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates as described below. HeLa cells were depleted as described for CGalT-CHO cells and labeled for 45 min with 150 μCi/ml Tran35S-label. Cells were next detergent-lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed, gently scraped in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mmEDTA-NaOH, pH 7.2 (homogenization buffer), and broken by 12–14 passages through a 25-gauge needle. A postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation for 15 min at 375 × g. Protein concentrations were adjusted to 1.0 mg of protein/ml using the BCA assay (Pierce). For some experiments, postnuclear supernatants were layered over 1 ml of 0.4 m sucrose, 1 ml of 1.25m sucrose in homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 rpm in a SW60 rotor. Membranes were retrieved from the 0.4/1.25 m sucrose interface and used for blot purification of antibodies against CGalT. Fifty μl (50 μg) of post-nuclear supernatant prepared from metabolically labeled CGalT-CHO cells was incubated with 0.1 mg/ml of proteinase K or trypsin for 60 min at 10 °C in the presence or absence of 0.5% saponin. Samples were transferred to ice, and the reaction was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2.5 mg/ml), leupeptin (0.25 mg/ml), aprotinin (0.25 mg/ml), and pepstatin A (0.25 mg/ml) to the indicated final concentrations. Membranes were solubilized in 0.5% saponin, and CGalT was immunoprecipitated from the detergent lysates in the presence of protease inhibitors. Antibodies were prebound to protein A-Sephacryl CL4B beads, and immunoprecipitations were done exactly as described (37Bottger G. Nagelkerken B. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29191-29197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS containing 1 μg/ml of chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were split into two equal aliquots, one of which received 3 milliunits of Endo H, and both tubes were incubated for 6 h at 30 °C and processed for SDS-PAGE. After the addition of 4× reducing Laemmli sample buffer, samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% minigels. Gels were analyzed by fluorography or a STORM860 PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For Western blotting, polyvinylidene difluoride transfers were blocked for 90 min in PBS, 5% Protifar (Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), 0.2% Tween 20 (blotto). Primary antibody incubations were done for 60 min in blotto. Detection was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). For quantitative Western blots, detection was done with 125I-protein A and PhosphorImager analysis with ImageQuant software. Cells were homogenized, and postnuclear supernatant was prepared as described above. Unless stated otherwise, postnuclear supernatants were incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmUDP-Glc, 2.0 mm UDP-Gal, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 50 μm C6-NBD-ceramide (NBD-Cer). At the end of the incubation period, lipids were extracted as described (38van Meer G. Stelzer E.H.K. Wijnaendts-Van Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Samples were dried under nitrogen and applied to TLC plates using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Fluorescent lipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, identified by comparison with standards, and quantitated as described (23van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38van Meer G. Stelzer E.H.K. Wijnaendts-Van Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on coverslips to 40–60% confluency. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde; quenched in PBS, 50 mm NH4Cl; and incubated for 1 h in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin (blocking buffer). The cells were labeled with affinity-purified antibody 635 against CGalT, the mouse monoclonal antibody 1D3 against PDI, or the mouse monoclonal antibody CTR433 against a Golgi protein. After 30 min, the coverslips were washed for four periods of 10 min with blocking buffer and counterstained for 15 min with 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl]amino)fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and indocarbocyanine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and examined with a Leica confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) attached to a Leica microscope using separate filters for each fluorochrome viewed: for 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl]amino)fluorescein, λex = 488 nm and λem = 515 LP; for indocarbocyanine, λex = 568 nm and λem = 585 LP. Singly labeled cells were examined to exclude the possibility that bleed-through occurred for the given confocal conditions. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop and printed on a Tektronix dye sublimation printer. For immunogold electron microscopy, cells were fixed with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 2 h at room temperature, the cells were scraped, embedded in 10% gelatin, and stored for ultracryotomy as described (48Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Cryosections were prepared as described (49Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J.H. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and labeled with rabbit CGalT antibody, and with the monoclonal 1D3 antibody against PDI, followed by protein A gold. For single labeling of CGalT, we used 10- or 15-nm protein A gold. For double label experiments, CGalT was detected with 15-nm protein A gold, and PDI was detected with 5-nm protein A gold. A swine anti-mouse antibody was used to enhance binding of protein A gold to sections labeled with monoclonal antibodies. The intracellular distribution of gold label was quantitated by counting the gold particles associated with identifiable organelles on sections prepared from CGalT-CHO cells (n = 10). Data were corrected for nonspecific labeling of sections prepared from nontransfected control CHO cells (n = 10). To avoid difficulties associated with the use of enzyme assays on partially purified cell fractions for localizing CGalT, we first raised antibodies against the protein in rabbits. For this purpose, we expressed four regions of CGalT as polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli. Three fusion proteins contained parts of the predicted luminal domain and one the putative cytoplasmic domain of the protein (Fig. 1 A). Antisera were first tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate CGalT that was synthesized in an in vitro transcription translation system in the presence of microsomes. As shown in Fig. 1 B, three of the four antisera recognized CGalT expression products, whereas the corresponding preimmune sera did not. The antibodies detected at least three bands with different mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The two lowest bands probably represent immature forms of the protein caused by incomplete N-glycosylation or degradation products. The band with a molecular mass of approximately 54 kDa most likely is mature CGalT, since it has the same molecular weight as the major band we observed on Western blots of whole cell lysates and in pulse-chase experiments (see below). The novel antibodies allowed us to characterize the molecular features of CGalT in more detail. To obtain cells with high expression levels of CGalT, we generated stable cell lines by transfecting CHO (23van der Bijl P. Strous G.J. Lopes-Cardozo M. Thomas-Oates J. van Meer G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and CHOlec8 cells with the CGalTpcDNA3. CHO cells were selected as recipients because they do not express endogenous GalCer (39Warnock D.E. Roberts C. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young Jr., W.W. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10145-10153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore represented an ideal background for our studies. Both CHO and CHOlec8 cells transfected with CGalT (CGalT-CHO and CGalT-CHOlec8) expressed a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 54 kDa that was recognized by antiserum 635 on Western blots (Fig. 2). Two other antisera (636 and 638) that reacted with CGalT by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 B) also efficiently recognized the 54-kDa protein (not shown). In the nontransfected control CHO and CHOlec8 cell lines, this band was not detectable. Other studies describe an apparent molecular mass of 50–70 kDa (1Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas the molecular mass of the conceptually translated CGalT cDNA is 60 kDa. To rule out the possibility that the 54-kDa band was due to some peculiarity of CHO cells or our antibodies, we analyzed the presence of endogenous CGalT in D6P2T cells, and we transfected Myc-tagged CGalT in a human cell line. The rat oligodendrocyte D6P2T cell line (40Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) contains high levels of GalCer; accordingly, we expected appreciable expression levels of CGalT. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the 54-kDa band that was seen in the CHO transfectants expressing rat CGalT also represented the major form of CGalT in this nontransfected oligodendrocyte cell line. From quantitative Western blots, we estimated that initially the expression in CGalT-CHO and CGalT-CHOlec8 cells was 4 and 13 times the endogenous CGalT in the D6P2T cells, respectively. As a second control experiment, we transiently expressed CGalT and the epitope-tagged version CGalTmyc in HeLa cells using the recombinant vaccinia T7 RNA polymerase system. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled for 45 min, and CGalT was immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 antibody against the epitope tag or antibodies against CGalT. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the 9E10 antibody immunoprecipitated, although less efficiently, the same bands as the rabbit antibodies that were raised against different regions of CGalT. Upon comparing the bands immunoprecipitated from the CGalT and CGalTmyc lysates with the rabbit antibodies, it is clear that insertion of the Myc sequence altered the immunoprecipitation efficiency of some of the forms. The Myc sequence was inserted in the region to which antibody 635 was raised, possibly causing conformational changes in the putative luminal domain that may affect the epitopes seen by the rabbit antibodies. We therefore concluded that the apparent molecular mass of CGalT was ∼54 kDa in our gel system. When the same samples were run on 12.5% (instead of 10%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the immunoprecipitated CGalT bands shifted to 62 kDa (not shown). To investigate the intracellular fate of CGalT, CGalT-CHO cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with Tran35S-labeled amino acids and then chased for different periods of time. Besides some background bands (Fig. 3), the same 54-kDa band was immunoprecipitated by antibody 635 as detected on the Western blots. The antisera 636 and 638 also immunoprecipitated this band (not shown), and we therefore interpreted it as CGalT. A small but significant shift to a higher mobility form of CGalT occurred in the first hour after the pulse. Since this shift did not occur after Endo H treatment (see below), it represented processing of N-linked oligosaccharides of CGalT. Quantitative analysis of the 54-kDa band during the chase period showed that the half-life of CGalT was about 4 h. We next assessed the rate of CGalT degradation under steady state conditions in CGalT-CHO cells in the presence of 10 mm cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. From the analysis of CGalT levels by quantitative Western blot (not shown), we calculated a very similar half-life, conf"

This effect has been described in many cell types and is not restricted to species or phyla. In mammalian cells, there are 11 distinct glycolytic enzymes, at least 9 of which are induced by hypoxia. Recent reports described a role for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in the transcriptional activation of lactate dehydrogenase A, aldolase-A, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase-1 genes. It is not known whether the HIF-1 factor acts exclusively to regulate these genes during hypoxia, or how the other genes of the pathway are regulated. In this paper, we describe analyses of the muscle-specific pyruvate kinase-M and β-enolase promoters that implicate additional mechanisms for the regulation of glycolytic enzyme gene transcription by hypoxia. Transient transcription of a reporter gene directed by either promoter was activated when transfected muscle cells were exposed to hypoxia. Neither of these promoters contain HIF-1 binding sites. Instead, the hypoxia response was localized to a conserved GC-rich element positioned immediately upstream of a GATAA site in the proximal promoter regions of both genes. The GC element was essential for both basal and hypoxia-induced expression and bound the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Hypoxia caused the progressive depletion of Sp3 determined by DNA binding studies and Western analyses, whereas Sp1 protein levels remained unchanged. Overexpression of Sp3 repressed expression of β-enolase promoters. It is concluded that hypoxia activates these glycolytic enzyme gene promoters by down-regulating Sp3, thereby removing the associated transcriptional repression.

Glycolysis is induced in most cell types by anaerobic or hypoxic conditions when oxidative metabolism is repressed. In mammalian cells, the glycolytic pathway has 11 separate enzymes, some with multiple tissue-specific isoforms, each encoded by separate genes and mostly situated on unlinked chromosomal loci (reviewed in Ref. 1Webster K.A. Murphy B.J. Can. J. Zool. 1988; 66: 1046-1058Crossref Google Scholar).

They have not been described in a number of the other mammalian glycolytic enzyme genes including hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-phosphate isomerase, β-enolase, or some of the other tissue-specific isogenes. The absence of appropriately located sites indicates that there may be other mechanisms for regulating these genes. An additional consideration is that hypoxia response elements distinct from HIF-1 binding sites have been described in plant alcohol dehydrogenase, LDH, and aldolase gene promoters (11Good A.G. Paetkau D.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Walker J.C. Howard E.A. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, there is a precedent and perhaps a requirement for additional hypoxia-regulated mechanisms for mammalian glycolytic enzyme gene expression.Promoter elements with the core sequence GGGC/T/AGG bind a number of transcription factors including members of the Sp family (14Boulikas T.

The factors Sp1 and Sp3 appear to be ubiquitous in mammalian cells where they compete with similar binding affinities for common target sequences (18Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R.

Sp1 is typically a positive-acting transcription factor and may interact directly with the basal TFIID transcriptional complex (16Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sp3 appears to possess both transcriptional repressor and activating properties, the relative strengths of which depend on the promoter context as well as the cellular background (16Dennig J.

Exposure of C2C12 myocytes to hypoxia caused depletion of Sp3 from nuclear extracts without affecting Sp1. The loss of Sp3 binding to the conserved GC element in these promoters correlated with transcriptional activation. Overexpression of Sp3 caused transcriptional repression of cotransfected β-enolase promoters in support of a regulatory mechanism involving the hypoxia-mediated alleviation of Sp3 repression.DISCUSSIONWe show in this article that the region between −80 and −28 of the human β-enolase gene confers positive regulation by hypoxia. The region contains a GC-rich, Sp-family binding site and a 3′ proximal GATAA element. A similar sequence combination is present in the same location of the hypoxia-responsive PK-M promoter in the rat (27Takenaka M. Noguchi T. Inoue H. Yamada K. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2363-2367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a common combination in erythroid-specific promoters, many of which are directly or indirectly regulated by oxygen availability (31Max-Audit I. Eleouet J.F. Romeo P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5431-5437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Youssoufian H. Blood. 1994; 83: 1428-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the β-enolase GC element was mutated or deleted, basal (aerobic) expression was reduced and the response to hypoxia was lost. This indicates that the GC element is required alone or in combination with downstream element(s) to promote transcriptional activation by hypoxia.Gel mobility shift binding studies demonstrated that mutation of the GC element eliminated the binding of Sp proteins coincident with loss in function of the promoter. We reported previously that this site was also responsible for hyperoxic regulation of β-enolase expression through the reversible oxidation of Sp1 cysteine sulfhydryl groups (29Wu X. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Murphy B.J. Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These observations implicate the GC element as a critical redox control site in the β-enolase, PK-M, and possibly other promoters with a similar arrangement of proximal elements.Protein binding studies identified Sp1 and Sp3 as the major components of the complexes formed between nuclear extracts and the PK-M/β-enolase GC element. Although we cannot preclude involvement of other factors, the combination of Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies blocked or supershifted each of the specific complexes. Therefore, these proteins are implicated in the regulation. Protein binding as well as Western blots indicate that Sp1 levels did not change markedly in response to hypoxia whereas Sp3 levels fell dramatically.The loss of Sp3 binding could account for the transcriptional activation if Sp3 functions as a repressor when bound to these promoter elements. The effects of overexpressing Sp3 indicates that Sp3 can indeed repress transcription from the β-enolase promoters. Previous studies, typically using Schneider SL2 cells that lacks endogenous Sp factors, have shown that Sp3 is a strong repressor of some GC-dependent promoters, and it can antagonize multiple classes of positive-acting factors (17Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 18Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our observation that pCMV-Sp3 caused >60% repression of −101β-Eno in hypoxic C2C12 cells is substantial because these cells already have a high Sp background. The observation that overexpression of Sp3 countered the promoter induction by hypoxia provides strong evidence that Sp3 depletion is associated with gene activation. We propose that the hypoxia-mediated depletion of Sp3 alleviates a repressor activity, thereby activating transcription from the β-enolase promoters.It is not clear whether Sp1 has an active or passive role in this regulation. Previous studies indicated that Sp3 may repress transcription independently of Sp1 activity, probably by interacting directly with other transcription factors (16Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sp3 may also compete with Sp1 for the common DNA binding site, thereby reducing transcriptional activation by Sp1 (17Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 21Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The observation that overexpressing Sp1 did not augment the activity of −101β-Eno suggests either that endogenous Sp1 is saturating, or that Sp3 repression is independent of Sp1. Indeed, we have no direct evidence to indicate that Sp3 binding is replaced by Sp1 during hypoxia. The apparent increase of Sp1 p106 during hypoxia (Fig. 5) indicates an increased proportion of phosphorylated Sp1 in hypoxic nuclear extracts, and this in turn may reflect an increased binding of Sp1 because DNA-bound Sp1 is phosphorylated by a DNA-dependent kinase (33Jackson S.P. MacDonald J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 34Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Alternatively displaced Sp3 may be substituted by the new GC-binding factor that appears to be induced by hypoxia (Fig. 4 C). We have no information on this new complex, except that it is a GC-binding factor with a similar migration rate to Sp3, it accumulates under hypoxia, and it is not recognized by Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies.Sp3 down-regulation by hypoxia appears to be by a post-transcriptional pathway since Sp3 transcript levels did not change. Hypoxia-mediated degradation, post-translational modifications, or translational mechanisms may be involved. Interestingly, a post-translational mechanism involving ubiquitin-mediated degradation has recently been described for the regulation of HIF-1 by hypoxia (35Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that the repressor function of Sp3 is stronger when there are multiple Sp1/Sp3 binding sites (16Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, positive responses to hypoxia and the regulation of gene expression by this pathway may be selective for a subset of genes with multiple GC-rich promoter elements.Results presented here suggest that mechanisms other than, or in addition to, HIF-1 regulate the expression of glycolytic enzyme genes by hypoxia. Functional HIF-1 binding sites have been described in LDH-A, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase-1, and aldolase-A genes, and mutational analyses as well as studies of cells from HIF-1 knockout mice support the involvement of HIF-1 in the regulation of these genes (6Firth J.D.

Our GenBank data base analyses revealed 2 HIF-1 binding sites in the first intron of the PK-M gene but no sites in 7194 bp of the human β-enolase gene. HIF-1-regulated genes are induced by both hypoxia and transition metals (5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), although these functions may be controlled by separate regulatory elements in other genes. GenBank screens also revealed multiple metal response element binding sequences (TGCACT) in both PK-M and β-enolase gene promoters (not shown). These elements bind the metal response factor MTF-1 that mediates positive transcriptional responses to metals (37Dalton T. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 38Smith A. Alam J. Escriba P.V. Morgan W.T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For genes that do not contain HIF-1 sites, separate MREs and HREs could account for the dual regulation by hypoxia and metals (41Ho V.T. Bunn H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Finally, although contributions of Sp-binding sites to the hypoxia response have not been reported previously in mammalian cells, anaerobic response elements have been described in the maize alcohol dehydrogenase, LDH, and aldolase gene promoters (11Good A.G. Paetkau D.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Ferl R.J. Nick H.S. J. Biol.

The anaerobic response element in the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter contains a GC-rich element that constitutively binds Sp1 and is essential for activation by hypoxia (12Walker J.C. Howard E.A. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Olive M.R. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7053-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, hypoxia-mediated regulation of gene expression through the modulation of GC-binding factors may be an ancient pathway that has been conserved in plant and mammalian glycolytic enzyme genes. Glycolysis is induced in most cell types by anaerobic or hypoxic conditions when oxidative metabolism is repressed. In mammalian cells, the glycolytic pathway has 11 separate enzymes, some with multiple tissue-specific isoforms, each encoded by separate genes and mostly situated on unlinked chromosomal loci (reviewed in Ref. 1Webster K.A. Murphy B.J. Can. J. Zool. 1988; 66: 1046-1058Crossref Google Scholar). We reported previously that the transcription rates of glycolytic enzyme genes are coordinately induced in muscle cells subjected to hypoxia (2Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Webster K.A. Gunning P.W. Hardeman E. Wallace D.C. Kedes L.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with the appearance of elevated steady state mRNA levels, the transcription rates increased gradually over 1–2 days (2Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been described in endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia (4Aaronson R.M. Graven K.K. Tucci M. McDonald R.J. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27752-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways and genetic elements that control this response are probably complex. In recent reports, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1),1 originally identified as a factor in the regulation of the erythropoietin gene (reviewed in Ref. 5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), has been shown to play a role in the transcriptional activation of a number of genes by hypoxia (6Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W.

We propose that the hypoxia-mediated depletion of Sp3 alleviates a repressor activity, thereby activating transcription from the β-enolase promoters.It is not clear whether Sp1 has an active or passive role in this regulation. Previous studies indicated that Sp3 may repress transcription independently of Sp1 activity, probably by interacting directly with other transcription factors (16Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sp3 may also compete with Sp1 for the common DNA binding site, thereby reducing transcriptional activation by Sp1 (17Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 21Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The observation that overexpressing Sp1 did not augment the activity of −101β-Eno suggests either that endogenous Sp1 is saturating, or that Sp3 repression is independent of Sp1. Indeed, we have no direct evidence to indicate that Sp3 binding is replaced by Sp1 during hypoxia. The apparent increase of Sp1 p106 during hypoxia (Fig. 5) indicates an increased proportion of phosphorylated Sp1 in hypoxic nuclear extracts, and this in turn may reflect an increased binding of Sp1 because DNA-bound Sp1 is phosphorylated by a DNA-dependent kinase (33Jackson S.P. MacDonald J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 34Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Alternatively displaced Sp3 may be substituted by the new GC-binding factor that appears to be induced by hypoxia (Fig. 4 C). We have no information on this new complex, except that it is a GC-binding factor with a similar migration rate to Sp3, it accumulates under hypoxia, and it is not recognized by Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies.Sp3 down-regulation by hypoxia appears to be by a post-transcriptional pathway since Sp3 transcript levels did not change. Hypoxia-mediated degradation, post-translational modifications, or translational mechanisms may be involved. Interestingly, a post-translational mechanism involving ubiquitin-mediated degradation has recently been described for the regulation of HIF-1 by hypoxia (35Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that the repressor function of Sp3 is stronger when there are multiple Sp1/Sp3 binding sites (16Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, positive responses to hypoxia and the regulation of gene expression by this pathway may be selective for a subset of genes with multiple GC-rich promoter elements.Results presented here suggest that mechanisms other than, or in addition to, HIF-1 regulate the expression of glycolytic enzyme genes by hypoxia. Functional HIF-1 binding sites have been described in LDH-A, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase-1, and aldolase-A genes, and mutational analyses as well as studies of cells from HIF-1 knockout mice support the involvement of HIF-1 in the regulation of these genes (6Firth J.D.

Our GenBank data base analyses revealed 2 HIF-1 binding sites in the first intron of the PK-M gene but no sites in 7194 bp of the human β-enolase gene. HIF-1-regulated genes are induced by both hypoxia and transition metals (5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), although these functions may be controlled by separate regulatory elements in other genes. GenBank screens also revealed multiple metal response element binding sequences (TGCACT) in both PK-M and β-enolase gene promoters (not shown). These elements bind the metal response factor MTF-1 that mediates positive transcriptional responses to metals (37Dalton T. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 38Smith A. Alam J. Escriba P.V. Morgan W.T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For genes that do not contain HIF-1 sites, separate MREs and HREs could account for the dual regulation by hypoxia and metals (41Ho V.T. Bunn H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Finally, although contributions of Sp-binding sites to the hypoxia response have not been reported previously in mammalian cells, anaerobic response elements have been described in the maize alcohol dehydrogenase, LDH, and aldolase gene promoters (11Good A.G. Paetkau D.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Ferl R.J. Nick H.S. J. Biol.

The anaerobic response element in the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter contains a GC-rich element that constitutively binds Sp1 and is essential for activation by hypoxia (12Walker J.C. Howard E.A. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Olive M.R. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7053-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, hypoxia-mediated regulation of gene expression through the modulation of GC-binding factors may be an ancient pathway that has been conserved in plant and mammalian glycolytic enzyme genes. We show in this article that the region between −80 and −28 of the human β-enolase gene confers positive regulation by hypoxia. The region contains a GC-rich, Sp-family binding site and a 3′ proximal GATAA element. A similar sequence combination is present in the same location of the hypoxia-responsive PK-M promoter in the rat (27Takenaka M. Noguchi T. Inoue H. Yamada K. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2363-2367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a common combination in erythroid-specific promoters, many of which are directly or indirectly regulated by oxygen availability (31Max-Audit I. Eleouet J.F. Romeo P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5431-5437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Youssoufian H. Blood. 1994; 83: 1428-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the β-enolase GC element was mutated or deleted, basal (aerobic) expression was reduced and the response to hypoxia was lost. This indicates that the GC element is required alone or in combination with downstream element(s) to promote transcriptional activation by hypoxia. Gel mobility shift binding studies demonstrated that mutation of the GC element eliminated the binding of Sp proteins coincident with loss in function of the promoter. We reported previously that this site was also responsible for hyperoxic regulation of β-enolase expression through the reversible oxidation of Sp1 cysteine sulfhydryl groups (29Wu X. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Murphy B.J. Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These observations implicate the GC element as a critical redox control site in the β-enolase, PK-M, and possibly other promoters with a similar arrangement of proximal elements. Protein binding studies identified Sp1 and Sp3 as the major components of the complexes formed between nuclear extracts and the PK-M/β-enolase GC element. Although we cannot preclude involvement of other factors, the combination of Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies blocked or supershifted each of the specific complexes. Therefore, these proteins are implicated in the regulation. Protein binding as well as Western blots indicate that Sp1 levels did not change markedly in response to hypoxia whereas Sp3 levels fell dramatically. The loss of Sp3 binding could account for the transcriptional activation if Sp3 functions as a repressor when bound to these promoter elements. The effects of overexpressing Sp3 indicates that Sp3 can indeed repress transcription from the β-enolase promoters. Previous studies, typically using Schneider SL2 cells that lacks endogenous Sp factors, have shown that Sp3 is a strong repressor of some GC-dependent promoters, and it can antagonize multiple classes of positive-acting factors (17Hagen G.

About half of the presently known metalloprotease disintegrins carry a catalytic site consensus sequence for metalloproteases (HEXXH) and are therefore predicted to be catalytically active, whereas the remaining family members do not contain a catalytic site in an otherwise related metalloprotease-like domain and therefore must lack metalloprotease activity (15Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of metalloprotease disintegrins could thus serve to activate the protease by removing the pro-domain or could alternatively regulate the function of other domains, such as the disintegrin domain which is thought to mediate cell-cell interactions by binding to integrins. Processing could also release soluble extracellular protein domains from the plasma membrane. The proteolytic processing of the heterodimeric sperm metalloprotease disintegrin fertilin has been studied in some detail. The α subunit of fertilin contains a predicted pro-protein convertase cleavage site (RX(K/R)R) between its metalloprotease domain and disintegrin domain and is processed in the secretory pathway next to this cleavage site before the protein emerges on the cell surface (27Lum L. Blobel C.P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a targeted deletion of the spermatid-specific pro-protein convertase PC4 leads to infertility, which could be due, at least in part, to a lack of fertilin α processing (28Mbikay M. Tadros H. Ishida N. Lerner C.P. De Lamirande E. Chen A. El-Alfy M. Clermont Y. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Gagnon C. Simpson E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6842-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fertilin β processing occurs on the sperm surface in transit through the epididymis and correlates with the acquisition of fertilization competence in sperm (29Blobel C.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of another metalloprotease disintegrin, meltrin α, has also been suggested to play a role in regulating the function of this protein in myoblast fusion (20Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In contrast to fertilin, where the pro-protein convertase cleavage site directs removal of the metalloprotease domain, several other MDC proteins have a pro-protein convertase cleavage site between their pro- and metalloprotease domain (13Weskamp G.

This suggests that the pro-domain, but not the metalloprotease domain of these proteins, is removed in the secretory pathway. In this study, we have analyzed the intracellular processing and pro-domain removal of mouse MDC15, a putative homologue of human MDC15 (metargidin) (14Krätzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), both of which have a pro-protein convertase cleavage site between the pro- and metalloprotease domain. Western blot analysis of mMDC15 with antibodies against the pro-domain and the cytoplasmic domain demonstrate that the majority of the detectable protein indeed lacks the pro-domain in all mouse tissues examined. In mMDC15 expressing COS-7 cells, removal of the mMDC15 pro-domain can be inhibited with the secretory pathway inhibitors brefeldin A and monensin, and processed mMDC15 is resistant to the deglycosidase endo H.1These results indicate that the pro-domain is removed after transit through the medial Golgi compartment. In vitro, the pro-domain of mMDC15 can be removed by furin, suggesting that a furin-type pro-protein convertase is important for the maturation of mMDC15 in vivo. Finally we report that mMDC15 has a predominantly perinuclear localization in COS-7 cells, which could correspond to the trans-Golgi network and/or endosomal compartments. The predominantly intracellular localization raises the possibility that mMDC15 may also have intracellular functions, such as a role in intracellular protein maturation, in addition to the previously proposed roles as cell-surface metalloprotease or adhesion protein. These studies provide the first analysis of the intracellular maturation of a metalloprotease disintegrin protein in somatic cells and indicate that metalloprotease disintegrins may represent physiologically important substrates of pro-protein convertases such as furin. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. α-35S-dCTP for cDNA sequencing, [α-32P]dCTP for labeling of cDNA probes, and35S-labeled cysteine/methionine for metabolic labeling were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. A mouse lung cDNA library (13Weskamp G. Krätzschmar J.R. Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was probed under high stringency conditions with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragment corresponding to the first 1481 nucleotides of the 5′ end of human MDC15 (14Krätzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). 31 positive phage plaques were identified, and the phage carrying a cDNA insert with the apparently longest 5′ end was identified by PCR, using an antisense MDC15 primer and the T3 primer that anneals to the vector 5′ of the cDNA insert. One clone with a cDNA insert of 2833 base pairs was sequenced on both strands (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and found to contain an open reading frame encoding for a protein of 815 amino acid residues. cDNA sequence assembly and analysis were performed with AssemblyLign and MacVector software programs (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT) or the Editseq and Megalign modules of DNASTAR (Madison, WI). A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled mMDC15 probe corresponding to the first 1050 nucleotides of the 5′ end under high stringency conditions as described previously (31Weskamp G. Blobel C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2748-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A human β-actin probe was used as a control for equal RNA loading. cDNA constructs encoding for GST fusion proteins with either the 103 C-terminal amino acid residues within the cytoplasmic tail of mMDC15 or with the 93 amino acids within the pro-domain of mouse and of human MDC15 (Asn25 to Asn116) were generated as follows. The appropriate PCR products were produced using gene-specific primers with added restriction sites and ligated in frame into a pGEX plasmid vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). All constructs were sequenced to rule out possible mutations introduced by PCR and then transfected into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Bacteria expressing the fusion protein were collected from 1-liter LB cultures and disrupted by French press homogenization. Cell lysates were spun at 30,000 × gfor 30 min in a Sorvall centrifuge using an SS-34 rotor, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose CL4B beads (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Bound fusion proteins were eluted with SDS sample loading buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, excised after visualization in Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and recovered by electroelution in an Elutrap apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) in 50 mm NH3CO2, 0.1% SDS. Eluted fusion proteins were lyophilized, resuspended in double distilled H2O, precipitated at −20 °C with 10 volumes of acetone, 1 mm HCl, and finally resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the resuspended fusion proteins according to established protocols (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-139Google Scholar). The resulting antisera were processed as follows. The antiserum raised against the mMDC15 GST-cytotail fusion protein was first depleted of anti-GST antibodies by incubating with GST protein coupled to CNBr-activated CL4B beads (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). After depletion of the antibodies reactive with GST, the antiserum was incubated with mMDC15-GST-cytotail fusion protein coupled to CNBr-activated CL4B beads. Beads with bound antibodies were washed three times in PBS, pH 7.4, and the bound affinity purified antibodies were eluted with 100 mmglycine, pH 3.0, and neutralized immediately with 1 m Tris, pH 7.4. Depletion of antibodies reactive with GST alone or with the mMDC15-GST-cyto fusion protein and affinity purification of anti-mMDC15 antibodies were confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The affinity purified antibodies are referred to as mMDC15-cyto-IgG, whereas the antibodies depleted of IgG reactive with both GST and the mMDC15-GST-cytotail fusion protein are referred to as control IgG. Antibodies against the mouse MDC15 pro-domain were raised using an essentially identical approach. The cDNA encoding full-length mMDC15 was cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) between an EcoRI and XhoI restriction site. Fusion proteins consisting of the hMDC15 extracellular domain or the mMDC15 extracellular domain and the Fc portion of human IgG (hMDC15-Fc and mMDC15-Fc, respectively) were generated by using gene-specific PCR primers with added restriction sites to generate the cDNA encoding Met1–Ser693 (hMDC15) or Met1–Leu695 (mMDC15), so that the resulting fusion proteins included the entire extracellular domain of hMDC15 or mMDC15. These constructs were ligated into a pcDNA3 expression vector in frame with the cDNA encoding the human IgG-Fc domain without a signal sequence (kindly provided by J. Orlinik and Dr. M. Chao). The PCR-generated mMDC15 and hMDC15 cDNAs were sequenced to rule out PCR-induced mutations. All cDNAs were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transient protein expression was monitored by Western blot analysis (see below) using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat antibody against the human IgG-Fc domain (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) or by metabolic labeling followed by protein A-Sepharose precipitation. Mouse tissues for Western blot analysis were harvested from C57BL/6 mice that had been euthanized following the guidelines of the American Veterinary Association. Immediately following euthanasia, mouse tissues were dissected and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland) using 10 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, Tris-buffered saline, and protease inhibitors (29Blobel C.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) per g of tissue. COS-7 cells overexpressing mMDC15 were grown to confluency on 6-well tissue culture plates and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer per well. All lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm in a Sorvall tabletop centrifuge for 15 min. MDC15 contains several potential N-linked glycosylation sites and is thus predicted to be a glycoprotein. In order to enrich for glycoproteins for Western blot analysis, supernatants of tissues or cells containing full-length mMDC15 were incubated with 100 μl of ConA-Sepharose lectin beads (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) per 10 ml of extract for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples containing hMDC15-Fc were incubated with protein A beads. Bound proteins were eluted in sample loading buffer for 5 min at 95 °C, were subsequently reduced by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol where indicated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking in 5% dry milk dissolved in PBS for 1 h, the primary antibodies and the secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) were added for 1 h each, and bound antibodies were visualized after four washes in PBS, 0.5% Tween using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak XAR autoradiography film. COS-7 cells were transfected with mMDC15, mMDC15-Fc, hMDC15-Fc, or as a control with the pcDNA3 vector as described above. One day post-transfection, cells were preincubated for 30 min with growth media lacking the amino acids cysteine and methionine followed by incubation with 200 μCi/ml of Express Protein labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products) (70% [35S]methionine, 30% [35S]cysteine) for 20 min. Cells were then either washed and lysed immediately or washed and incubated in unlabeled Opti-MEM-I low protein media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for an additional 3, 6, or 9 h prior to lysis. For pulse-chase experiments in the presence of secretory pathway inhibitors, monensin was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and brefeldin A was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. The serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, Boehringer Mannheim) was added to hMDC15-Fc expressing cells in the chase period only at a final concentration of 400 μm in Opti-MEM. At this concentration Pefabloc does not alter the maturation of the 75-kDa nerve growth factor receptor overexpressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). mMDC15 was immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled cell extracts with the mMDC15-cyto-IgG, the mMDC15 pro-domain IgG, or control antibodies as indicated, whereas the mMDC15-Fc and hMDC15-Fc fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein A beads. All immunoprecipitated materials were separated by SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol for 15 min, incubated for 15 min with Enhance solution (DuPont), dried, and then exposed to Kodak XAR autoradiography film. Removal of N-linked carbohydrate residues with endoglycosidase H (endo H), or peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), or sialidase (neuraminidase) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) from glycoproteins was performed as follows. After immunoprecipitation of mMDC15 from35S metabolically labeled mMDC15 expressing COS-7 cells as described above, the sample loading buffer containing the immunoprecipitated material was adjusted to pH 4.5 or 5.5 with sodium citrate for sialidase or endo H treatment, respectively, or to pH 7.5 with sodium phosphate for PNGase F treatment. For PNGase F reactions, samples were further adjusted to a final Nonidet P-40 concentration of 1%. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C overnight in the presence or absence of 50 units of sialidase, 500 units of endo H, or 500 units of PNGase F in a 30-μl reaction volume. All samples were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for Western blot analysis as described above. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with mMDC15 in pcDNA3 or as a control with a pcDNA3 vector (see above) in 6-well tissue culture plates as described above. Two days post-transfection, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with the non-membrane-permeable biotinylation reagent NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 45 min at 4 °C. After labeling, the cells were washed in PBS, incubated with 0.1 m glycine to quench the labeling reaction, and lysed directly on the plate in 1 ml of lysis buffer per well (see above), and the resulting cell extracts were spun at 13,000 rpm for 15 min in a Sorvall tabletop centrifuge. To differentiate between proteins that are bound to mMDC15 covalently or non-covalently, certain samples were adjusted to an SDS concentration of 1.25%, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and subsequently diluted to a final SDS concentration of 0.15% with cell lysis buffer prior to immunoprecipitation. All other samples were diluted such that the final volume was equal prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated material was run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin, and bound horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin was visualized as described above under Western blot analysis. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with mMDC15 cDNA or pcDNA vector were pulse-chase-labeled with Express Protein Labeling Mix (NEN Life Science Products) for 0, 3, or 6 h, or cell-surface biotinylated (see above). Cells were then washed two times in PBS, cooled on ice for 10 min, and then incubated with ice-cold PBS with or without 500 μg/ml trypsin on ice for ½ h. Detached cells were pelleted in a tabletop microcentrifuge at low speeds. Cells were then washed once in 500 μg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor in PBS, pelleted again, lysed in cell lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, and then immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled and chased for 6 h in the presence of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml, see above). mMDC15 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and the immunoprecipitated material bound to protein A beads was washed into a modified furin cleavage buffer (20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) without protease inhibitors (10Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant furin (kindly provided by R. Fuller) was then added to a final concentration of approximately 40, 400, or 4000 units/ml (1 unit of furin is able to cleave 1 pmol of the standard substrate, tert-butoxycarbonyl-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-methylcoumarin amide per min at 37 °C). 2R. Fuller, personal communication. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (40 and 400 units/ml) or 40 min (4000 units/ml), and the reaction was stopped with sample loading buffer. Where indicated, the samples were further digested overnight with PNGase F (see above). COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates were transiently transfected with mMDC15 cDNA or pcDNA vector. One day post-transfection, cells were washed in PBS and subsequently fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then permeabilized and blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum for 30 min, and all subsequent washes and incubations were performed in this buffer. mMDC15-cytotail IgG was added to the fixed cells for 2 h. The coverslips were then washed five times for 8 min, followed by incubation with a rhodamine-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for ½ h. After five final washes, the coverslips with fixed cells were mounted on glass microscope slides with Immuno Floure Mounting Medium (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), which was allowed to settle overnight. The cells were viewed and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. We have previously reported the cDNA sequence of human MDC15 (metargidin), the first metalloprotease disintegrin with an RGD sequence in its predicted integrin binding site (14Krätzschmar J. Lum L.

Polycystin-2 shares ∼46% homology with pore-forming domains of a number of cation channels. It has been suggested that polycystin-2 may function as a subunit of an ion channel whose activity is regulated by polycystin-1. Here we report the identification of a human gene, PKDL, which encodes a new member of the polycystin protein family designated polycystin-L.

The full-length transcript of PKDL is expressed at high levels in fetal tissues, including kidney and liver, and down-regulated in adult tissues. PKDL was assigned to 10q24 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and is linked to D10S603 by radiation hybrid mapping. There is no evidence of linkage to PKDL in six ADPKD families that are unlinked toPKD1 or PKD2.

Polycystin-1 encodes a 4,303-amino acid plasma membrane protein with a large extracellular N-terminal domain that contains leucine-rich repeats, a C-type lectin domain, and an LDL-A-like domain, all three of which are involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions in other proteins (4The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1995; 81: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 5Hughes J.

These domains are followed by 16 repeats of the so-called PKD domain and by an REJ (receptor for egg jelly in sea urchin sperm)-like domain. Polycystin-1 has 7 to 11 transmembrane domains. The short cytoplasmic tail (197 amino acids) of polycystin-1 contains a coiled-coil domain, which appears to interact with other proteins containing similar structures (7Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y.

Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 8Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification, chromosomal localization, and expression of a third gene encoding a protein of the polycystin family. The product of this gene is an excellent candidate for a component of the pore-forming subunit of a polycystin-related channel and is also a candidate for various human and murine cystic diseases. Overlapping EST sequences W27963 and W28231, derived from a retina cDNA library, were identified by their gene product homology to polycystin-2 (gb 189U50928). A 340-base pair fragment in the overlap region of both ESTs was amplified from human adult kidney and brain poly(A)-selected RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-TCTTCGTGCTCCTGAACATG-3′ and 5′-CCTGTCGCATTTTTCCTGTT-3′. 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed with human skeletal muscle and kidney rapid amplification of cDNA ends kits (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Primers were designed based on PKDLreverse transcription-PCR products. Nested amplification was performed following manufacture's instructions. The 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product was random-labeled with [32P]dCTP and used to screen a human retina cDNA library (CLONTECH). Hybridization was performed in a buffer containing 5 × SSC (1× SSC, 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 50% formamide, 1% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution at 42 °C, overnight. Filters were washed three times in buffer (0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS) at 65 °C. Positive signals were purified, and inserts were subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. Clones were sequenced from both strands, and the sequences were aligned to give an overall consensus sequence. The computer program MOTIFS of GCG (11Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar) was used to identify putative glycosylation and phosphorylation sites (20Zhao Y.

Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar) was performed with the COILS computer program with and without 2.5-fold weighting of positionsa and d, whereas prediction by Berger's algorithm (13Berger B.

Kyte and Doolittle's hydropathy analysis (14Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J Mol Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) was performed using PEPPLOT (GCG). Secondary structure analysis was performed with PEPTIDESTRUCTURE (GCG) computer program and with the protein sequence analysis software using type-2 discrete state-space models (15Stultz C.M.

Math Biosci. 1994; 119: 35-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Analysis of transmembrane segments was performed with the TMpred computer program (17Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) using windows of 18–33 residues and with SOSUI 2Mitaku Group, Department of Biotechnology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (1998) SOSUI: Classification and Secondary Structure Prediction of Membrane Proteins. http://www.tuat. ac.jp/∼mitaku/adv—sosui/. and TMAP (19Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Alignments with homologous sequences from polycystin-1, polycystin-2, and Ca2+ channel α1 subunits were performed with LINEUP and BESTFIT (GCG) and optimized by visual comparison. Human adult and fetal RNA blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a randomly labeled 5′-most 1.5 kb of the coding sequence of PKDL in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution at 42 °C overnight. Filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and at 50 °C. Signals were visualized by autoradiography. A 1.7-kb humanPKDL genomic fragment between cDNA positions 2,006 and 2,206 was PCR-amplified with exonic primers and subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One μg of this vector was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP as described previously (20Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Moller D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), coprecipitated with 10 μg of Cot-1 DNA, and resuspended in 1× Tris-EDTA at 200 μg/ml. Hybridization of metaphase chromosome preparations from peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal human males was performed withPKDL at 10 μg/ml in Hybrisol VI as described previously (21Ney P.A. Andrews N.C. Jane S.M. Safer B. Purucker M.E. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5604-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled probe was detected using reagents supplied in the Oncor Kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacture's recommendations. Metaphase chromosomes were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Map position of PKDL was determined by visual inspection of the fluorescent signal on the 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-stained metaphase chromosomes using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Images were captured and printed using the CytoVision Imaging System (Applied Imaging, Pittsburgh, PA). Twenty-one metaphases were assessed for probe localization. An intron between cDNA positions 2,042 and 2,043 was amplified with exonic primers and sequenced. A set of primers was designed to amplify part of this intron. The Stanford G3 panel (22Stewart E.A.

Data was processed at the Stanford Human Genome Center RH server. Two families, one Italian and one Spanish (F431 and F432) have been previously described (3Turco A.E. Clementi M. Rossetti S.

Généthon polymorphic marker D10S603, which has the same distribution as PKDL by radiation hybrid mapping and two flanking markers (D10S198–1.2 cM-D10S603–0.2 cM-D10S192) were selected to test for linkage to ADPKD in six families previously shown to be unlinked to the PKD1 and PKD2 loci. Genomic DNA from members of these families were used as templates for PCR. [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pairwise affected-only linkage analysis was performed using the FASTLINK suite of programs. A fully penetrant dominant model with a disease gene frequency of 0.0001 and equal allele frequencies was assumed. The data was calculated using two-point lod scores. The Krd mutation arose on strain C3H and is maintained on strain C57BL/6J(27Keller S.A. Jones J.M. Boyle A. Barrow L.L. Killen P.D. Green D.G. Kapousta N.V. Hitchcock P.F. Swank R.T. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1994; 23: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J-Krd mice were crossed with strainSPRET/Ei to generate heterozygous (C57BL/6J-Krd × SPRET/Ei) F1 mice, as described previously (27Keller S.A. Jones J.M. Boyle A. Barrow L.L. Killen P.D. Green D.G. Kapousta N.V. Hitchcock P.F. Swank R.T. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1994; 23: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Aliquots of genomic DNA (10 μg) were digested with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed on agarose gels, and transferred to nylon filters (Zetaprobe GT, Bio-Rad). A 5′ 1.5 kb human PKDL cDNA probe was gel-purified and radiolabeled as described above. Filters were hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were visualized by autoradiography. Through data base searches we identified two EST sequences of ∼500 nucleotides, W27963 and W28231, with similarity to polycystin-2. The deduced amino acid sequences of W27963 and W28231 showed 78% homology and 56% identity (over residues 649 to 749) and 65% homology and 39% identity (over residues 678 to 786 with a single three-residue gap) to polycystin-2, respectively. The two EST sequences shared 94% identity over 421 base pairs. We tentatively concluded that these ESTs arose from the same gene. Using primer sets based on these overlapping EST sequences, we amplified the same reverse transcription-PCR product from adult kidney and brain RNA whose translated amino acid sequence shows 67% homology and 46% identity to residues 670 to 779 of human polycystin-2. We further performed 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends with skeletal muscle and kidney poly(A) RNA, respectively, and obtained 0.8 kb (5MR1) and 0.9 kb cDNAs (3MR20), respectively. Using 5MR1 as a probe, we screened a human retina library. Three clones, PKDL-6, PKDL-7 and PKDL-8, were obtained and sequenced. The consensus 3,044-base pair sequence revealed an open reading frame of 2,415 base pairs, which encodes a protein of 805 amino acids (Fig. 1). The putative translation start site at cDNA position 384 (5′-TTCCCCATGA-3′) is not accompanied by a typical Kozak sequence. A single in-frame stop codon is found in the putative 5′-untranslated region. The open reading frame is followed by several in-frame stop codons, and the 3′-untranslated region contains a consensus polyadenylation signal (5′-AATAAA-3′) 10 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail. The deduced amino acid sequence of PKDL is shown in Fig. 1. Hydropathy analysis of the polycystin-L sequence showed five highly hydrophobic regions predicted to be transmembrane segments (Fig. 2 A). Three additional relatively hydrophobic peaks were identified. Polycystin-L showed significant homology to polycystin-2 as expected (71% homologous, 50% identical). This homology is generally higher in predicted transmembrane segments and in the loops between transmembrane segments (Fig. 2 B). Polycystin-L also showed a moderate similarity (similarity 45%, identity 22%) to polycystin-1 over residues 1 to 797. This similarity is slightly higher in transmembrane segments, but there is one conserved positively charged short amino acid stretch in the first loop between transmembrane segments (Fig. 2 B). Polycystin-L, like polycystin-2, shows homology (similarity ∼47%, identity ∼21% overall) to each of the four domains of various Ca2+ channel α1 subunits and other cation channels. Regions of homology are clustered in the last four transmembrane segments and the pore region of each domain of the Ca2+channel α1 subunits (Fig. 2 B). In polycystin-L and polycystin-2, the regions corresponding to this pore region include the last of the three relatively hydrophobic peaks. The first two-thirds of this region is predicted to form a helical structure, which is characteristic for various cation channels. Two algorithms (12Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar, 13Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) predict that polycystin-L has a coiled-coil domain in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1). Polycystin-L also has a putative Ca2+ binding structure or EF-hand (25Marsden B.J. Shaw G.S. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that generally consists of two helices and a loop between them (Fig. 1). The C-terminal helix in the EF-hand of polycystin-L overlaps with the predicted coiled-coil region. Polycystin-L has a putative cAMP phosphorylation site in its C terminus. Putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites are all in regions predicted to be cytoplasmic. Four of five putative casein kinase II phosphorylation sites with strong motif sequences (positions 249, 563, 674, 703, 719) are also found in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). Multiple tissue RNA dot blot analysis using the 5′ 1.5-kb of the coding sequence as a probe revealed highest expression in adult heart and kidney (Fig. 3 A). Northern blot analysis showed the presence of 5- and 1.5-kb bands in fetal tissues including kidney, liver, and brain (Fig. 3, B and C). This result suggests the presence of alternatively spliced forms. The abundance of the two splice variants is ∼1:1 in fetal tissues. In adult tissues, however, the long transcript is only detected after prolonged autoradiography. Chromosomal assignment of PKDL to 10q24 was achieved by fluorescent in situ hybridization on 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride-stained metaphase human chromosomes using a 1.7-kb genomic probe (Fig. 4). In 17 of 21 metaphase preparations analyzed, a hybridization signal was found to be present on the long arm of chromosome 10 in band q24. In six spreads, both copies of chromosome 10 were labeled, and in 11 metaphase spreads, a signal was detected on a single chromosome 10. No signals were observed on other chromosomes. With the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid panel,PKDL was found to have an identical distribution pattern as polymorphic marker D10S603 (lod score greater than 1,000). Linkage analysis of the PKDL locus using flanking markers D10S603, D10S198, and D10S192 gave negative lod scores in six ADPKD families previously documented to be unlinked to PKD1 and PKD2 loci (Table I).Table IIndividual and cumulative lod scores from six familiesFamilyTheta00.050.10.20.3F431D10S19800000D10S603−0.721−0.463−0.317−0.149−0.060D10S192−0.721−0.463−0.317−0.149−0.060F432D10S198−∞−1.184−0.761−0.343−0.136D10S60300000D10S192−2.698−1.376−0.862−0.380−0.148TOR1D10S1980.7000.5990.5000.3000.160D10S603−0.770−0.510−0.390−0.260−0.190D10S192−1.110−0.850−0.690−0.430−0.250TOR2D10S1980.7000.5990.5000.3000.160D10S603−0.770−0.510−0.390−0.260−0.190D10S192−1.110−0.850−0.690−0.430−0.250Singa 1D10S19800000D10S60300000D10S1920.6020.5350.4650.3180.170CumulativeD10S198−∞0.0140.2390.2570.184D10S603−2.261−1.483−1.097−0.669−0.440D10S192−5.037−3.004−2.094−1.071−0.538Family Bulga 1 is not informative for all markers. Open table in a new tab Family Bulga 1 is not informative for all markers. The human PKDL gene is located within a linkage group that is conserved on the distal portion of mouse chromosome 19 (26DeBry R.W. Seldin M.F. Genomics. 1996; 33: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). A 7-centimorgan deletion of this region has been described in Krd mice (27Keller S.A. Jones J.M. Boyle A. Barrow L.L. Killen P.D. Green D.G. Kapousta N.V. Hitchcock P.F. Swank R.T. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1994; 23: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mouse homologue, Pkdl, is located within the Krd deletion, we analyzed genomic DNA from F1 animals obtained from a cross of strain C57BL/6J-Krd with strain SPRET/Ei. To detect theC57BL/6J-Krd-derived allele in the F1 DNA, we utilized restriction fragment-length polymorphisms detected by hybridization with a 1.5-kb human PKDL cDNA probe (Fig. 5 B). Strain C57BL/6J contains three hybridizingTaqI fragments of 5.5, 5.0, and 1.8 kb. StrainC3H, on which the Krd mutation originally arose, contains three hybridizing TaqI fragments of 5.5, 5.0, and 1.6 kb. Strain SPRET/Ei contains two hybridizing fragments of 8 and 4.5 kb. The (C57BL/6J-Krd X SPRET/Ei) F1 mouse inherited the hybridizing fragments contributed by theSPRET/Ei parent but did not inherit the fragments fromC57BL/6J or C3H (Fig. 5 B). This result indicates that the mouse Pkdl locus is located within the region that is deleted by the Krd mutation. The manifestations of PKD1- and PKD2-linked ADPKD are generally similar, raising the likelihood that the gene products function in the same or parallel biological pathways. Homology between polycystin-2 and the pore-forming α1 subunits of voltage-activated Ca2+ and Na+channel proteins, combined with evidence of interaction between polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 (7Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 8Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), has led to the proposal that polycystin-2 forms homo- or heteromultimeric complexes with itself, with polycystin-1, or with another protein to function as an ion channel (9Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as a small fraction of ADPKD families are not accounted for by PKD1 and PKD2 mutations and the function of polycystin family members may be cooperative, we postulated the existence of additional polycystin family members. Here we report the identification and cloning of a third gene encoding a member of the polycystin superfamily, polycystin-L. Its gene,PKDL, is therefore an excellent candidate gene for human and murine cystic diseases. The temporal expression pattern of PKDL is similar to that of PKD1. The hydropathy patterns of polycystin-L and polycystin-2 are similar except in the region corresponding to the S4 segment of polycystin-2 where polycystin-L has a much lower hydrophobicity score, suggesting that this is a secondary membrane-spanning region. Polycystin-L and polycystin-2 both have putative EF-hand structures in their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that their functions are influenced by cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. In several Ca2+channels, binding of Ca2+ to EF-hand structures inactivates the channels (28de Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Polycystin-L and polycystin-2 show moderate but significant sequence similarity to Ca2+ and other cation channels, especially within their S3-S6 segments and the loop between the S5 and S6 segments. In addition, the last two membrane-spanning segments of polycystin-L, polycystin-2, and Ca2+ channel α1 subunits share structural characteristics with the Streptomyces lividans K+ channel (KcsA) whose structure has been determined by crystallography (29Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5747) Google Scholar). The common structural features include: lining residues of the last membrane-spanning segments that are mostly hydrophobic except for the negatively charged acidic amino acid near the end of these segments; loops between the last two membrane-spanning regions (pore region) that are mildly hydrophobic (Fig. 2 A); first 23 of pore regions that are predicted to form short helical structures (pore-helix); and finally, last 13 of pore regions that begins with negatively charged residues which have been considered to determine the selectivity to Ca2+ in known Ca2+ channels (30Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Polycystin-L differs from polycystin-2 most significantly in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain where it lacks a 100-amino acid segment. In the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, polycystin-L is strongly predicted to have a coiled-coil structure, which has the potential to tightly interact with molecules with a similar structure like polycystin-1. Lupas' algorithm (12Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar) also predicts a coiled-coil structure in polycystin-2, but it is not supported by Berger's algorithm (13Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Polycystin-L and polycystin-2 have three positively charged residues in S4 as opposed to five to eight in voltage-gated channels. Whereas the S4 region in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is considered to be a voltage sensor (31Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether a membrane-spanning region with only three basic residues could act as a voltage sensor. Polycystin-L also has several putative phosphorylation sites: one cyclic nucleotide, two protein kinase C, and four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites with strong motif sequences in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Two other putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites are also found in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylation of these motif sequences may be involved in the gating process of the channel. Another scenario is that the channel is gated by a direct or indirect signal from associating proteins,e.g. polycystin-1. Given that polycystin-1 has domains that may be involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction and is known to interact with polycystin-2 (7Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 8Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the binding of ligand(s) to polycystin-1 may be associated with the gating of a polycystin-related channel. Sequence analysis and comparison to other channels support the six or seven membrane-spanning plus one pore-region topology of polycystin-2 and polycystin-L. In addition to the five putative transmembrane segments, the middle of the three relatively hydrophobic peaks, which corresponds to S4 in α1 subunits of cation channels, is likely to be another transmembrane segment. Whether the N-terminal peak (S1/2) forms a membrane-spanning region is not clear. One common feature of the polycystin-L/polycystin-2 structure that is rarely observed in known ion channels is that they both have relatively long extracellular loops between the first and the second putative transmembrane segments. Although this loop region does not show high homology to any known ion channels, polycystin-2 and polycystin-L maintain a high level of homology with each other in this region. Moreover, this region contains a 13-amino acid stretch with 3 to 4 basic residues that is conserved not only between polycystin-2 and polycystin-L but also with polycystin-1. The function of this polycystin-shared motif is not clear. Studies using D10S603, which maps to the same interval as PKDL by radiation hybrid mapping, and two adjacent markers, D10S192 and D10S198, did not reveal linkage in six non-PKD1, non-PKD2 families, making it unlikely that mutations in PKDL cause the disease in these families. Among other as yet unexplained human cystic kidney diseases, it is unlikely that PKDL plays a role in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, as mutations in most autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease families have been mapped to chromosome 6 (32Guay-Woodford L.M. Muecher G. Hopkins S.D. Avner E.D. Germino G.G. Guillot A.P. Herrin J. Holleman R. Irons D.A. Primack W. et al.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1101-1107PubMed Google Scholar). The PKDL locus can, however, be considered as a candidate for unmapped human genetic cystic disorders such as dominantly transmitted glomerulocystic kidney disease of postinfantile onset (33Sharp C.K. Bergman S.M. Stockwin J.M. Robbin M.L. Galliani C. Guay-Woodford L.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 77-84PubMed Google Scholar), isolated polycystic liver disease (34Pirson Y. Lannoy N. Peters D. Geubel A. Gigot J.F. Breuning M. Verellen-Dumoulin C. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 249-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome/serpentile fibula syndrome (35Kaplan P. Ramos F.

Genomics. 1996; 33: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This region is partially deleted in mice with the mutation Krd (Kidney and retinal defects) (27Keller S.A. Jones J.M. Boyle A.

The 7 centimorgans Krd deletion is located betweenTdt and Cyp17 and includes the paired box genePax2. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation of Pax2 frequently demonstrate reduction in kidney weight, which ranges from 10 to 100% normal (37Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced size is due mainly to calyceal and proximal ureteral diminution as well as cortical thinning, with a reduced number of developing nephrons (37Torres M. Gomez-Pardo E. Dressler G.R. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the phenotype of Krd/+ heterozygotes includes aplastic, hypoplastic, and cystic kidneys, as well as reduced viability on strain C57BL/6J (27Keller S.A. Jones J.M. Boyle A. Barrow L.L. Killen P.D. Green D.G. Kapousta N.V. Hitchcock P.F. Swank R.T. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1994; 23: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our Southern analysis demonstrates that the mouse ortholog of PKDL is deleted in Krdmice. Further study is needed to clarify the contribution of Pkdl to the Krd phenotype. Several other congenital murine and rat models with polycystic kidney disease are also known to exist, although the genetic defects in these models are as yet to be identified (38Schieren, G., Pey, R., Bach, J., Hafner, M., and Gretz, N.

Among mouse PKD models, loci for cpk, bpk, pcy, jck, jcpk, kd have been mapped to mouse chromosomes 12, 10, 9, 11, 10, and 10, respectively, and are unlikely to involve the mouse homologue of PKDL.

Using domain-specific antibodies against recombinant collagen XVII fragments, we identified two molecular forms of the collagen in human skin and epithelial cells. Full-length collagen XVII appeared as a homotrimeric transmembrane molecule of three 180-kDa α1(XVII) chains. The globular intracellular domain was disulfide-linked, and theN-glycosylated extracellular domain of three 120-kDa polypeptides was triple-helical at physiological temperatures. A second, soluble form of collagen XVII in keratinocyte culture media was recognized with antibodies to the ectodomain, but not the endodomain. The soluble form exhibited molecular properties of the collagen XVII ectodomain: a triple-helical, N-glycosylated molecule of three 120-kDa polypeptides. Northern blot analysis with probes spanning either the distal 5′or the distal 3′ end of the collagen XVII cDNA revealed an identical 6-kb mRNA, suggesting that both the 180- and 120-kDa polypeptides were translated from the same mRNA, and that the 120-kDa polypeptide was generated post-translationally. In concert, keratinocytes harboring a homozygous nonsense mutation in theCOL17A1 gene synthesized neither the 180-kDa α1(XVII) chain nor the 120-kDa polypeptide. Finally, treatment of normal keratinocytes with a synthetic inhibitor of furin proprotein convertases, decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone, prevented the generation of the 120-kDa polypeptide. These data strongly suggest that the soluble 120-kDa polypeptide represents a specifically cleaved ectodomain of collagen XVII, generated through furin-mediated proteolytic processing. Thus, collagen XVII is not only an unusual type II transmembrane collagen, but the first collagen with a specifically processed, soluble triple-helical ectodomain.

Collagen XVII, also known as the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen or BP180, is a structural component of the hemidesmosomes in epithelial cells (1Nishizawa Y. Uematsu J. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence predicts a type II integral transmembrane protein of 1497 amino acids, with an NH2-terminal intracellular domain of 466 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 23 residues and a COOH-terminal extracellular domain of 1008 amino acid residues (2Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Because of 15 collagenous subdomains characterized by -Gly-X-Y- repeat sequences within the ectodomain, the molecule was designated collagen XVII (3Li K. Tamai K. Tan E.M.L. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8825-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gatalica B. Pulkkinen L. Li K. Kuokkanen K. Ryynänen M. McGrath J. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 352-365PubMed Google Scholar). Traditionally, collagens are defined as triple-helical proteins with -Gly-X-Y- repeat sequences and with a function as a structural protein of the extracellular matrix (5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Among the more than 20 homo- and heterotrimeric collagens, types XVII and XIII represent the only putative transmembrane collagens (for review, see Ref. 6Pihlajaniemi T. Rehn M. Progr. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 225-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, probably as a result of their low level of expression in tissue and inaccessibility to standard biochemical analyses, the structures of these collagens were deduced from the cDNA sequences rather than from protein chemical data. Therefore, their molecular composition, folding, and assembly have remained a matter of conjecture. Nevertheless, Hirako et al. (7Hirako Y. Usukura J. Nishizawa Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13739-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) studied collagen XVII from bovine cell lines with sucrose gradient centrifugation, rotary shadowing electron microscopy, and chemical cross-linking experiments, and suggested that it appeared as an asymmetric molecule with a globular head, central rod, and a flexible tail, with potential to trimer formation. In concert with these findings, recombinant extracellular fragments of human collagen XVII expressed in COS-1 cells showed a high molecular mass form with an elongated conformation (8Balding S.D. Diaz L.A. Giudice G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8821-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that antibodies against recombinant ectodomain fragments labeled structures outside the keratinocyte plasma membrane along the skin basement membrane (9Masunaga T. Shimizu H. Yee C. Borradori L. Lazarova Z. Nishikawa T. Yancey K.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 200-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The functions of collagen XVII are not known, but as a transmembrane component of the hemidesmosomes, it is likely to play a role in maintaining linkage between the intracellular and the extracellular structural elements and in anchoring the epithelia to the underlying basement membrane (10Hopkinson S.B. Baker S.E. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Borradori L. Koch P.J. Niessen C.M. Erkeland S. van Leusden M.R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1333-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by pathological skin conditions. For example, in bullous autoimmune skin diseases, the presence of autoantibodies reactive with collagen XVII is associated with diminished epidermal-dermal cohesion (12Giudice G.J. Wilske K.

Furthermore, heritable skin blistering disorders of the junctional epidermolysis bullosa group are associated with mutations in the gene for collagen XVII, COL17A1, and with absence or attenuated expression of collagen XVII (4Gatalica B.

Despite a growing number of COL17A1 mutations, the genotype-phenotype correlations and the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypes have remained elusive as a result of insufficient information on the structure and functions of normal human collagen XVII. In the present study, we used domain-specific antibodies and biochemical analyses to characterize collagen XVII from normal human skin and epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the collagen occurs in two triple-helical forms, as a full-length transmembrane protein and as a soluble ectodomain, a specific proteolytic cleavage product of the full-length molecule. Recombinant fusion proteins corresponding to two different fragments of the human collagen XVII were generated using the bacterial pQE expression system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The fusion proteins contained an NH2-terminal His tag for easy purification of the expression products from bacterial lysates. The fusion protein Col17-intra spanned amino acids 61–360 in the intracellular domain, whereas the fusion protein Col17-extra corresponded to amino acids 1292–1497 in the carboxyl terminus of the extracellular domain of collagen XVII (Fig. 1). The corresponding cDNAs were synthesized by First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) of mRNA from normal human keratinocytes isolated by the QuickPrep mRNA isolation kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed with the sense primer 5′-ACGGATCCGCAGCGGCTACATAAACTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCGAAGCTTGCAGCTCCATCTCCTTCTT-3′for the fusion protein Col17-intra, and with the sense primer 5′-CGGGATCCAGCAGCTCCTCCTCACACA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCGAAGCTTGAGACCTTGGACCTAAGTG-3′ for the fusion protein Col17-extra. To generate the expression clones, 5′ end primers contained a BamHI site and 3′ end primers contained aHindIII site for cloning into the vector pQE32 (Col17-intra) and pQE30 (Col17-extra). The correct orientation and ligation of both clones was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis. The fusion proteins were produced using the QIAexpress Type IV kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer′s instructions and purified with affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Immunization of rabbits with the fusion proteins was performed using standard procedures (Eurogentec, Ougreé, Belgium). Since no immune response was obtained for Col17-extra, chicken were immunized, and the antibodies were purified from egg yolks by filtration and precipitation with polyethylene glycol (29Gassmann M. Thommes P. Weiser T. Hubscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Bullous pemphigoid patient autoantiserum IF 77/95 (Fig. 1) that was strongly reactive with the NC16a-domain (15Zillikens D. Pose P.A. Balding S.D. Liu Z. Olague-Marchan M. Diaz L.A. Giudice G.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 573-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but not with other domains of collagen XVII, was also used for immunoblotting. Normal human keratinocytes were obtained by trypsinization of skin biopsy samples, the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was a generous gift of Dr. N. Fusenig, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. All cells were cultured in serum-free, low calcium keratinocyte growth medium, supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor (KGM, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (30König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Prior to extraction and immunoblotting experiments, the cells were grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml l-ascorbate for 48 h (26Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Pulkkinen L. Mauviel A. Küster W. Lüthi U. Owaribe K. Uitto J. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1344-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For analysis of collagen XVII from cell cultures, proteins in the cell layer and the media were processed separately. The cell layers were extracted for 30 min on ice with 1 ml/75 cm2 of a neutral buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and when appropriate,14 μg/ml chymostatin, 7 μg/ml antipain, 7 μg/ml leupeptin, and 14 μg/ml pepstatin as proteinase inhibitors (31Sonnenberg A. Gehlsen K.R. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was then scraped with a rubber policeman, and the extract was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for further analyses. In some experiments, the above extraction was preceded by incubation of the cells with 0.5 m NaCl in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, to release neutral salt soluble proteins. For analysis of medium proteins, proteinase inhibitors were added immediately after collecting the medium onto ice. After removing cellular debris by centrifugation 1000 rpm for 10 min, the proteins from 10 ml medium were precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation for 4 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15 000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, the pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of a buffer containing 65 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Pefabloc (Merck), and 1 mm EDTA (32Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Fifty to 100 μl of the cell extracts or the medium concentrate were used for the enzyme digestions and 10–30 μl for immunoblotting. For extraction of collagen XVII from the epidermis, normal human skin was subjected to artificial epidermolysis in a neutral buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and the above proteinase inhibitors at 4 °C overnight (33Meyer L.J. Taylor T.B. Kadunce D.P. Thuong-Ngyen V. Zone J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 991-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the epidermis and the dermis were mechanically separated. Both skin layers were extracted with 400 μl/cm2 of a buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and proteinase inhibitors for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by extensive dialysis against 0.8m urea, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol in 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, as described previously (30König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Five to 15 μl of the extract was used for immunoblotting; application of significantly more than 15 μl of the epidermis extract onto SDS-PAGE1 was not possible, because the high content of keratins in the extract caused protein overloading of the lanes. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE using gels with either 7% polyacrylamide or 3–15% polyacrylamide gradients under non-reducing or reducing (1 mm dithiothreitol) conditions. The incubations with the first antibodies were overnight, and with the alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-rabbit, -chick, and -human second antibodies for 2 h. Semiconfluent keratinocytes or HaCaT cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 48 h, washed extensively and incubated with 3 μg/mld-biotinoyl-ε-aminocaproic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium borate, pH 8.0, for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 mmNH4Cl. After extensive washing, the cells were extracted with the Nonidet P-40-containing extraction buffer as described above, followed by immunoprecipitation with domain-specific collagen XVII antibodies. Prior to immunoprecipitation, preclearing was achieved by incubating 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) with 500 μl of biotinylated cell extract containing 0.1% SDS for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g, the supernatants were added to protein A-Sepharose/antibody complexes. These were prepared by adding 50 μl of rabbit antibody SA3485 to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose in 500 μl of the above Nonidet P-40 buffer with 0.1% SDS (Nonidet P-40 buffer, 0.1% SDS). Alternatively, 50 μl of chicken antibody Col17ecto-1 and 5 μl of rabbit-anti-chicken-IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were added to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, 0.1% SDS. The complexes were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, and the antibody/protein-A-Sepharose pellets were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, 0.1% SDS. The supernatants of precleared cell extracts were added to these antibody complexes and rotated at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with Nonidet P-40 buffer, 0.1% SDS, the pellets were suspended in 0.8 m urea, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. The supernatants were loaded onto 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed in blots using streptavidin-coupled alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for detection. For assessment of the domain structure and stability of collagen XVII, cell and medium extracts were subjected to collagenase, pepsin, sequential pepsin/trypsin, orN-glycosidase F digestions. The incubation with 40 units/ml highly purified bacterial collagenase (Advanced Biofacturers Inc., Lynbrook, NY) was carried out in 50 μl of the cell extraction buffer containing 15 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmPefabloc (Merck) for 4 h at 37 °C (34Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a limited pepsin digestion of collagen XVII, 100 μl of extracts were acidified by adding glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 0.1m, and the samples were incubated with 1 μg/ml pepsin (Fluka, Deisenhofen, Germany) at 5 °C for 2–24 h (34Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After neutralization with unbuffered Tris, the samples were either directly precipitated with ethanol at −20 °C overnight or treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma) at temperatures between 15 °C and 47 °C for 2 min (35Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding soy bean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (36Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For deglycosylation, 50 μl of the protein extract were treated with 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 60 °C prior to digestion with 10 units/ml N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) overnight at 37 °C. For Northern blotting, 1.5 μg of mRNA isolated from cultured cells with Oligotex Direct mRNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hildesheim, Germany) was separated on a 0,8% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) overnight, and immobilized by baking at 120 °C for 30 min. The membranes were pre-hybridized and then hybridized with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled collagen XVII cDNA (4Gatalica B. Pulkkinen L. Li K. Kuokkanen K. Ryynänen M. McGrath J. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 352-365PubMed Google Scholar) at 50 °C. The DIG labeling of the cDNA was performed with the DIG DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannhein, Germany) following the manufacturer′s instructions for randomly primed DNA labeling. After hybridization, the filters were washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × standard saline citrate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C. The cDNA-mRNA hybrids were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-DIG-antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence using CDP-StarTM substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). Normal keratinocytes or HaCaT cells were grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. As proteinase inhibitors, 1–5 mm EGTA, 0.1–1 mm Pefabloc (Merck), or 100 μm decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (Ref. 37Garten W. Hallenberger S. Ortmann D. Schäfer W. Vey M., H. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar; Bachem, Basel, Switzerland) were added. After a culture period of 20 h, the medium and cell layer were analyzed with immunoblotting as described above. Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant procaryotic fragments spanning the endodomain and the distal ectodomain of collagen XVII (Fig. 1) gave an intensive immune response in rabbits (antibody SA 3485) or in chicken (antibody Col17ecto-1). The antibodies showed no cross-reactivity or reaction with other hemidesmosomal components or basement membrane proteins, such as BP230, laminin 5, collagen IV, or collagen VII. In contrast, they specifically recognized collagen XVII extracted from skin or cultured cells in immunoblots and by immunoprecipitation. They did not work in immunofluorescence staining of skin cryosections or cultured cells. Collagen XVII could be extracted from human epidermis, but not dermis (Fig. 2 A) with a chaotropic buffer containing 8 m urea and 2% SDS as described previously (30König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The native conformation of collagen XVII was preserved by extraction of cultured keratinocytes with a neutral buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 as a detergent (31Sonnenberg A. Gehlsen K.R. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Notably, the α1(XVII) chains from both sources showed similar migration on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the tissue form of collagen XVII was similar to the cell form, and that no typical procollagen → collagen conversion (38Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen Ö. Zimmermann D. Dours-Zimmermann M.-T. Kalinke U.D. Gedde-Dahl Jr., T. Winberg J.-O. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) occurred prior to deposition in the tissue. The detergent was necessary for solubilization of collagen XVII from the cells, since no collagen XVII was extractable with phosphate-buffered saline or 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, or 0.1 m acetic acid (data not shown). The transmembrane location of collagen XVII was verified biochemically using keratinocyte cell surface biotinylation and subsequent immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the endo- and ectodomains. Specifically, semiconfluent keratinocytes were biotinylated under conditions that preserved cell integrity to allow for labeling of the putative extracellular domain only. The cells were then extracted with a neutral buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, collagen XVII was immunoprecipitated from the extract, and the precipitates were visualized with streptavidin as a marker. Both antibodies SA 3485 and Col17ecto-1 precipitated a biotinylated 180-kDa band (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that the polypeptide recognized by them contained a biotinylated extracellular domain. For characterization of the domain structure, native collagen XVII was subjected to limited proteolytic digestions. Treatment with highly purified bacterial collagenase yielded a band of approximately 65 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3 A), corresponding to the fragment predicted from the cDNA sequence (2Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Under non-reducing conditions, the collagenase-resistant fragment migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that the endodomain formed a disulfide-linked trimer. In concert with this observation, intact collagen XVII migrated as a large polymer under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3 C). The collagenase-resistant bands were recognized by the endodomain antibody SA 3485, but not by the ectodomain antibodies. Limited pepsin and/or trypsin digestion was used to isolate the collagenous domain, since triple-helical structures resist proteolysis under conditions in which globular sequences are digested (35Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Incubation of collagen XVII with 1 μg/ml pepsin at 5 °C for 2 h was sufficient to digest the endodomain. During an extended incubation, the digestion proceeded in a stepwise manner, yielding several intermediate products with apparent sizes of 140, 120, and 105 kDa, and a final pepsin-resistant fragment of about 90 kDa, both under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3, B and C), demonstrating that the collagenous domain did not contain disulfide bonds. Limited trypsin digestion also resulted in a 90-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 B, lane 5), indicating that the collagenous domain was triple-helical. The NH2 terminus of the pepsin/trypsin-resistant fragments extends to the NC16a domain, since the antibody IF 77/95 recognized all intermediate fragments. In contrast, antibody Col17ecto-1 raised against the 205 most COOH-terminal amino acid residues of collagen XVII reacted only with the 140-, 120-, and 105-kDa fragments, but not with the 90-kDa fragment (Fig. 4,lane 9), indicating that an extended pepsin incubation or trypsin treatment eliminated the distal ectodomain (compare with Fig. 1). Deglycosylation withN-glycosidase F resulted in faster migration of the 180-kDa α1(XVII) chain on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). When collagenase digestion preceded deglycosylation, no difference in the molecular mass of the endodomain was noted (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, differences emerged when the extracellular domain was deglycosylated: shifts in migration of the 140- and 120-kDa, but not of the 105- and 90-kDa pepsin fragments were observed (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). These findings are consistent withN-glycosylation of the -N-V-T- site in the distal COOH terminus (Asn-1421, numbered according to Giudice et al.;Ref. 2Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 243-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) of collagen XVII. This site lies within the segment recognized by the antibody Col17ecto-1, which is eliminated during extended pepsin digestion (Fig. 4, lane 9). The thermal stability of the extracellular domain of collagen XVII was assessed with trypsin or sequential pepsin/trypsin digestions as probes for the triple-helical conformation (35Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopu"

Heterotrimeric G proteins modulate signals from receptors to effectors by traversing a highly controlled GTPase cycle. GTP binding activates the G protein and allows it to activate its effector(s), and activation is terminated when bound GTP is hydrolyzed. Signal amplitude is thus a balance of GTP binding and hydrolysis. Receptors initiate and maintain signaling by catalyzing GDP dissociation and GTP binding, and GTP hydrolysis is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs.1 There are two classes of GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins. The first to be discovered are the phospholipase C-βs, the major effectors for the Gqfamily that also function as Gq GAPs to modulate the temporal acuity of Gq signaling (1Berstein G. Blank J.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The most numerous GAPs are the RGS proteins (regulators of Gprotein signaling), a family of more than 25 homologous proteins that are GAPs for the Gq and Gifamilies (see Refs. 3Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 6Ross E.M. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221PubMed Google Scholar). GAPs allow G protein signals to terminate rapidly (0.1–1.0 s) upon removal of stimulus (3Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Berman D.M.

The Gi and Gs families hydrolyze bound GTP with a half-time of about 10–20 s (7Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Higashijima T.

Chem. 1984; 259: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Gq and G12 families are even slower (10Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAPs can also act as simple inhibitors to decrease signal amplitude, as demonstrated non-physiologically by the overexpression of several RGS proteins. If acutely activated or induced, a GAP can also terminate a signal. Last, GAPs can suppress basal signal amplitude in the absence of stimulation and thereby enhance discrimination over background.We recently purified from brain a new GAP that is relatively specific for Gz, a member of the Gi family (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gz is unusual in that it hydrolyzes bound GTP very slowly (t ½ ∼7 min) (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Brain Gz GAP bound Gαz-GTP with a K d of about 2 nm in detergent solution and stimulated its rate of hydrolysis at least 200-fold. Gz GAP can thus act on physiological levels of Gz and allow termination of signaling on the time scale of a few seconds, appropriate for the presumed signaling functions of Gz. Brain GzGAP was purified about 50,000-fold from a cerebral cortical membrane fraction, making it less abundant than Gz itself (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gz GAP binds Gαz at or near its N terminus, and GAP activity is inhibited by N-terminal palmitoylation of its Gαz substrate (14Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Removal of palmitate may be therefore important in triggering GTP hydrolysis and deactivation. GzGAP is also inhibited by the binding of the G protein βγ subunits to Gαz (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The precise physiological function of Gz GAP is unknown, as is that of Gz. Gz is expressed at very low levels in only a few tissues (brain, platelets, adrenal medulla, and a few others) that are known for rapid and regulated secretion (13Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fong H.K.W. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1988; 85: 5384-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Gz GAP activity is segregated in these same tissues (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and both Gz and its GAPs may be involved in the control of transmitter release. Although Gz can respond to Gi-coupled receptors and inhibit adenylyl cyclase (17Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 18Parker E.M. Kamey K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), its scarcity in tissues that are already well endowed with Gi suggests that it is not just an ersatz Giand that the physiological signaling target for Gz remains to be discovered.As the next step toward understanding the function of GzGAP and its Gz target, we cloned the cDNA that encodes the principal brain Gz GAP isoform and compared the properties of the recombinant protein with those of the brain Gz GAP and of related RGS proteins. This work establishes the major Gz GAP as RGSZ1, an RGS protein whose specificity for Gαz is unusually high among the RGS family. The data also show that RGSZ1 is closely related to RET-RGS1 and GAIP, suggests that all three are primarily GAPs for Gz, and clarifies the interactions of RGSZ1 with membranes and the role of that interaction in its function. We further show that phosphorylation of Gαz by protein kinase C (20Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocks the GAP activity of RGSZ1 and other RGS proteins, thereby providing a mechanism for the amplification of Gz signals.DISCUSSIONThis study defines RGSZ1 as the major Gz GAP activity in brain and links it with two other known RGS proteins, RET-RGS1 and GAIP, as members of a family of Gz GAPs that probably contains at least two other members. Because Gz hydrolyzes bound GTP so slowly, the activity of RGSZ1 and other GzGAPs is necessary for Gz to function as a physiological signaling molecule with reasonable temporal acuity. Understanding the mechanisms of action and regulation of GAP is crucial to understanding further how Gz itself is regulated, and the ability to express and control Gz GAP activity may help us focus on the signaling functions unique to Gz, which still lacks recognized targets.RGSZ1, or very closely related homologs, appears by multiple criteria to be the major Gz GAP activity in brain. The RGSZ1 cDNA was identified according to peptide sequence obtained from brain Gz GAP, and antibodies raised against RGSZ1 cross-react with the multiple polypeptides in partially purified brain Gz GAP with nearly quantitative intensity (Fig. 3). The specific activity of RGSZ1 is equal to that of the brain preparation (corrected for fractional purity), and selectivity of RGSZ1 for Gαz over other Gα subunits is actually somewhat better that of the brain Gz GAP. The GAP activity of GAIP with Gαz-GTP is as high as that of RGSZ1, and GAIP may also be primarily a Gz GAP. GAIP probably does not contribute in a major way to the Gz GAP activity in cerebral cortical membranes, however, based on its unresponsiveness to millimolar Mg2+ (Fig. 4). Whereas RGSZ1, the Gz GAP activity in brain membranes, and all size fractions of purified brain Gz GAP were each stimulated about 4-fold by 1 mm Mg2+, GAIP was not. If GAIP contributed to total brain Gz GAP activity substantially (≥25%), the activity in crude brain membrane fractions would have had a detectably diminished Mg2+ response. For example, Gz GAP activity in C6 glioma cells is stimulated only 2-fold at 1 mm Mg2+, suggesting that about half of the activity is contributed by a Mg2+-responsive GAP and half by an unresponsive GAP (or that it all derives from yet another GAP with intermediate Mg2+ sensitivity). Thus, GAIP may act primarily on other G proteins (32De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 48De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), or its Gz GAP activity may require an additional activating factor, perhaps analogous to the way in which the Gt GAP activity of RGS9 in photoreceptor cells is activated by cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (55He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).It is likely that other RGSZ isoforms also exist, perhaps in significant amounts, in brain or elsewhere. Peptide sequence of a still uncloned protein that co-purified with RGSZ1 from bovine brain represents at least one more members of the Gz GAP subfamily. Because the distribution of Gαz in the brain is broader than that of RGSZ1 (Fig. 2), it is likely that other homologs are represented in these areas. For example, RET-RGS1 is probably the GAP for Gz in retinal interneurons, where both RET-RGS1 and Gαz are expressed (31Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 60Hinton D.R. Blanks J.C. Fong H.K.W. Casey P.J. Hildebrandt E. Simons M.I. J.

Distinct Gz GAPs may also be found in peripheral tissues that express Gz, adrenal medulla, platelets, etc. (13Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fong H.K.W. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1991; 1094: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The size of brain Gz GAP is heterogeneous according to both GAP activity and RGSZ1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3). Heterogeneity is not an artifact of purification (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More than one of the four in-frame Met codons may be used for initiation, the initial translation product may be partially proteolyzed in cells, other covalent modifications may alter electrophoretic mobility, or the size isoforms may reflect multiple RGSZs or RGSZ1 splice products. Although the RGSZ1 gene contains at least three introns (Fig. 1), we found no evidence of multiple RNAs, but rare species would have been undetectable.The Gz GAP SubfamilyThe primary structures of RGSZ1, RET-RGS1, and GAIP clearly define a subfamily of RGS proteins, all of which are active, high affinity, and relatively selective GAPs for Gz. Their sequences are distinctive in the generally conserved RGS box, which includes a major site of interaction with the Switch II region of the Gα subunit (49Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Their uniqueness includes replacement of a generally conserved Asn at the contact site by a Ser (Ser157 in RGSZ1). This substitution, which diminishes the activities of other RGS proteins (50Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12851-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 51Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6731-6735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), may be important for selective regulation of Gαz, which itself contains several unusual amino acid residues near the active site and which hydrolyzes bound GTP very slowly. The regulation of the GzGAP subfamily by Mg2+ may also reflect the distinct features of their RGS box.The Gz GAP subfamily is also distinctive in its sequence both C-terminal and N-terminal to the RGS box. Divergence of sequence in the N-terminal region of RGS proteins suggests that this domain may determine some of the distinct functions of the group: selectivity among G proteins, subcellular localization, covalent or allosteric regulation, or yet unknown regulatory functions not directly related to G proteins. Potential multiple palmitoylation of the cysteine string (residues 37–49) may influence subcellular localization (48De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 57Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), although all three proteins are relatively hydrophobic even when expressed in bacteria. Palmitoylated cysteine strings are thought likely to target the neuronal cysteine string dnaJ homolog to the secretory vesicle (44Buchner E. Gundersen C.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 223-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the domains that confer these functions awaits study of suitable chimeras with sequences of other RGS proteins.The RGSZ family is primarily marked by high selectivity for Gz. RGSZ1 is at least 20-fold, and probably over 100-fold, selective for Gαz over other Gi family members in our standard solution assay and has even lower affinity for Gq and Gs than for Gi. Its tissue distribution also argues for its physiological linkage to Gz. Nevertheless, the selectivity of RGS proteins for their G protein targets remains inadequately understood. The activity of RGSZ1 is strongly influenced by its hydrophobic environment (Fig. 6). At least for RGS2, apparent selectivity can be dramatically altered by their association with phospholipid bilayers that contain trimeric G protein (62Ingi, T., Krumins, A. M., Chidiac, P., Brothers, G. M., Chung, S., Snow, B. E., Barnes, C. A., Lanahan, A. A., Siderovski, D. P., Ross, E. M., Gilman, A. G., and Worley, P. F. (1998) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Such changes have not been observed for RGSZ1, however. Choice of detergent can also alter apparent preferences of a G protein among various GAPs (52Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis.in: Manning D.R. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar), and subcellular localization may contribute to specificity in vivo.Interaction of the RGSZ Family with MembranesThe structure and behavior of RGSZ1 raise intriguing questions about its mode of association with membranes and its interaction with membrane-bound Gz. Gz GAP activity in brain membranes was resistant to solubilization by most detergents under standard conditions and was solubilized incompletely only by 2% Triton X-100 at 30 °C (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was highly aggregated during all steps in purification. RGSZ1 also aggregated even in detergent solution but has no obviously hydrophobic sequence suggestive of a membrane span. RET-RGS1 also aggregated badly, and GAIP aggregated to a lesser extent (not shown). Moreover, RGSZ1 was essentially unable to regulate heterotrimeric Gz in phospholipid vesicles unless it was incorporated into the membranes during their formation. Regardless, all members of the Gz GAP subfamily were found mostly in the cytosol of E. coli or Sf9 cells when expressed in large amounts. These observations suggest that the intrinsic hydrophobicity of these proteins may act coordinately with affinity for a specific, low abundance attachment site in natural membranes to confer correct subcellular targeting. For example, preliminary data indicate that RGS4 expressed at very low levels in Sf9 cells is mostly particulate but that about half is soluble when it is overexpressed. 2Y. Tu, unpublished observations. Regulation of Gz GAPsAlthough we have no direct information about how or when the GAP activity of RGSZ1 is regulated in cells, several potentially physiological processes control its functionin vitro. Of these, palmitoylation and PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Gαz are potentially the most important. Gαz is phosphorylated in platelets in response to thrombin and thromboxane agonists (14Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in response to phorbol esters, in AtT20 and RBL-2H3 cells, which are models for anterior pituitary and mast cells, respectively (63Hallak H. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Gαz phosphorylation does not alter the basal rate of Gαz-GTP hydrolysis appreciably, it markedly decreases GAP activity (Fig. 8 and Table III). Potentially, inhibition of GAPs can prolong and amplify a Gz signal many fold. This mechanism allows stimulation of PKC to potentiate Gz activation by blocking Gz GAPs in response to Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, second messengers of PIP2 phospholipase C signaling.In addition to regulation by PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation, Gz GAP activity is almost completely blocked by palmitoylation of the Gαz target, allowing palmitoylation to protect Gz from GAP-promoted deactivation (14Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Such blockade is of particular interest in terms of the proposed linkage of the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle to G protein activation (Refs. 14Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 64Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and references therein). Although Gβγ can also inhibit GAP activity (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8), we do not know how the various complexes of receptor, Gαz, Gβγ, and their effectors may modulate access to RGSZ1. Clearly Gβγ is not a potent GAP inhibitor in a membrane-bound, multi-protein signaling system (Fig. 6). Last, control of the amount of RGSZ1 present in a cell may be a crucial component of its regulation; it displays high activity even though expressed at levels well below that of Gαz itself. Gz GAPs may prove to be as important and versatile regulators of Gz-mediated signaling as are receptors. Heterotrimeric G proteins modulate signals from receptors to effectors by traversing a highly controlled GTPase cycle. GTP binding activates the G protein and allows it to activate its effector(s), and activation is terminated when bound GTP is hydrolyzed. Signal amplitude is thus a balance of GTP binding and hydrolysis. Receptors initiate and maintain signaling by catalyzing GDP dissociation and GTP binding, and GTP hydrolysis is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs.1 There are two classes of GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins. The first to be discovered are the phospholipase C-βs, the major effectors for the Gqfamily that also function as Gq GAPs to modulate the temporal acuity of Gq signaling (1Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The most numerous GAPs are the RGS proteins (regulators of Gprotein signaling), a family of more than 25 homologous proteins that are GAPs for the Gq and Gifamilies (see Refs. 3Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar for reviews). G protein GAPs can perform diverse regulatory functions depending on their abundance, their affinities for their G protein targets, and the extent to which they accelerate deactivation (4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 6Ross E.M. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221PubMed Google Scholar). GAPs allow G protein signals to terminate rapidly (0.1–1.0 s) upon removal of stimulus (3Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Berman D.M.

The Gi and Gs families hydrolyze bound GTP with a half-time of about 10–20 s (7Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Higashijima T.

Chem. 1984; 259: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Gq and G12 families are even slower (10Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAPs can also act as simple inhibitors to decrease signal amplitude, as demonstrated non-physiologically by the overexpression of several RGS proteins. If acutely activated or induced, a GAP can also terminate a signal. Last, GAPs can suppress basal signal amplitude in the absence of stimulation and thereby enhance discrimination over background. We recently purified from brain a new GAP that is relatively specific for Gz, a member of the Gi family (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gz is unusual in that it hydrolyzes bound GTP very slowly (t ½ ∼7 min) (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Brain Gz GAP bound Gαz-GTP with a K d of about 2 nm in detergent solution and stimulated its rate of hydrolysis at least 200-fold. Gz GAP can thus act on physiological levels of Gz and allow termination of signaling on the time scale of a few seconds, appropriate for the presumed signaling functions of Gz. Brain GzGAP was purified about 50,000-fold from a cerebral cortical membrane fraction, making it less abundant than Gz itself (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gz GAP binds Gαz at or near its N terminus, and GAP activity is inhibited by N-terminal palmitoylation of its Gαz substrate (14Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Removal of palmitate may be therefore important in triggering GTP hydrolysis and deactivation. GzGAP is also inhibited by the binding of the G protein βγ subunits to Gαz (12Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The precise physiological function of Gz GAP is unknown, as is that of Gz. Gz is expressed at very low levels in only a few tissues (brain, platelets, adrenal medulla, and a few others) that are known for rapid"

We tested the hypothesis that fat feeding causes a change in plasma membrane composition that interferes with functioning of glucose transporters and/or insulin receptors. Epitrochlearis muscles of rats fed a high (50% of calories) fat diet for 8 weeks showed ∼50% decreases in insulin- and contraction-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport. Similar decreases in stimulated glucose transport activity occurred in muscles of wild-type mice with 4 weeks of fat feeding. In contrast, GLUT1 overexpressing muscles of transgenic mice fed a high fat diet showed no decreases in their high rates of glucose transport, providing evidence against impaired glucose transporter function. Insulin-stimulated system A amino acid transport, insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase activity, and insulin-stimulated IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were all normal in muscles of rats fed the high fat diet for 8 weeks. However, after 30 weeks on the high fat diet, there was a significant reduction in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in muscle. The increases in GLUT4 at the cell surface induced by insulin or muscle contractions, measured with the 3H-labeled 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-benzoyl-1,3-bis-(d-mannose-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine photolabel, were 26–36% smaller in muscles of the 8-week high fat-fed rats as compared with control rats. Our findings provide evidence that (a) impairment of muscle glucose transport by 8 weeks of high fat feeding is not due to plasma membrane composition-related reductions in glucose transporter or insulin receptor function, (b) a defect in insulin receptor signaling is a late event, not a primary cause, of the muscle insulin resistance induced by fat feeding, and (c) impaired GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface plays a major role in the decrease in stimulated glucose transport.

The high fat diet-fed rodent is of interest as a research model because it might provide insights regarding the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in obese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. For example, there is considerable experimental evidence that insulin signaling is impaired in skeletal muscle of obese, insulin-resistant humans (7Caro J.F. Sinha M.K. Raju S.M. Ittoop O.

One purpose of this study was to determine whether an insulin-signaling defect is involved in the development of muscle insulin resistance in response to a high fat diet. In addition to insulin, glucose transport in skeletal muscle can be stimulated by muscle contractile activity or hypoxia (for review, see Ref. 10Holloszy J.O. Hansen P.A. Blaustein M.P. Grunicke H. Habermann E. Pette D. Schultz G. Schweiger M. Reviews of Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 99-193Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways by which insulin and contractions/hypoxia stimulate glucose transport are distinct, as evidenced by the findings that their maximal effects on glucose transport are additive (11Nesher R. Karl I.E. Kipnis D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C226-C232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zorzano A. Balon T.W. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E21-E26PubMed Google Scholar), and the effect of insulin, but not of contractions/hypoxia, is blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition (13Yeh J.-I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L.

A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In this context, the finding that stimulation of glucose transport by muscle contractions is also impaired in high fat diet-fed rodents (6Han D.H. Hansen P.A. Host H.H. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rosholt M.N. King P.A. Horton E.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R95-R101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests the alternative possibility that it is a common step beyond the contraction and insulin-signaling pathways that is involved. Stimulation of skeletal muscle glucose transport by either insulin or contractions is mediated by translocation of the GLUT4 isoform of the glucose transporter to the cell surface (15Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 17Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O.

It has been postulated, on the basis of findings of Zierath et al. (19Zierath J.R. Houseknecht K.L. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that the insulin resistance induced by fat feeding is mediated by decreased movement of GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface, although this has not been a consistent finding (16Rosholt M.N. King P.A. Horton E.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R95-R101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second purpose of this study was to re-evaluate the effect of the high fat diet on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface and to determine whether the diet affects contraction-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. The catalytic activity of the glucose transporter proteins is sensitive to changes in the compositional and physical properties of the membrane bilayer (20Carruthers A. Melchior D.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6901-6911Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Sandra A. Fyler D.J. Marshall S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and it has been postulated that the insulin resistance associated with high fat feeding and obesity is mediated, in part, by membrane composition-related reductions in glucose transporter activity (22Borkman M. Storlien L.H. Pan D.A. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Campbell L.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 23Stevenson R.W. McPherson R.K. Persson L.M.

In support of this possibility, Rosholt et al. (16Rosholt M.N. King P.A. Horton E.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R95-R101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have obtained evidence that a high fat diet results in decreased GLUT4 intrinsic activity in skeletal muscle. The GLUT1 and GLUT4 isoforms of the glucose transporter have a high degree of sequence similarity (24James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 25Birnbaum M.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), suggesting that the basic mechanism by which GLUT1 and GLUT4 transport glucose across the plasma membrane is the same. If the hypothesis that a change in plasma membrane composition interferes with GLUT4-mediated glucose transport in muscle of fat-fed rodents is correct, it seems reasonable that glucose transport by the GLUT1 transporter would be similarly affected. Another purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance in high fat diet-fed rodents is mediated by an alteration in plasma membrane structure that interferes with glucose transporter function. To this end, we have evaluated the effect of a high fat diet on glucose transport in muscles of mice overexpressing the GLUT1 glucose transporter. We have also examined the effect of the high fat diet on the activity of the system A amino acid transporter, another protein whose function could be affected by compositional changes in the plasma membrane. α-[1-14C](Methylamino)isobutyrate,d-[2-3H]-mannitol, 3-O-[3H]-methyl-d-glucose, [14C]-mannitol, and [γ-32P]ATP were all purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 2-Deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Donkey anti-rabbit 125IgG and reagents for ECL were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies against the insulin receptor β-subunit, insulin receptor substrate-1, and phosphotyrosine were all purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-benzoyl-1,3-bis-(d-mannose-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-[2-3H]BMPA)1was kindly provided by Dr. Geoff Holman (University of Bath, United Kingdom). Immunoprecipitation of ATB-[3H]BMPA-labeled GLUT4 was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (G4 829) directed against the 16 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the GLUT4 glucose transporter. All experimental procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. At the time of weaning, colony-bred male Wistar rats were assigned to either high fat or chow diet groups. The semi-purified high fat diet was prepared as described previously (6Han D.H. Hansen P.A. Host H.H. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with 50% of the total calories derived from fat, 27% from sucrose, and 23% from casein. Control animals were fed constant-formula Purina rodent chow (Purina 5001). All diets were fed ad libitum. Additional high fat feeding experiments were performed using mice that overexpress the human GLUT1 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle and their nontransgenic littermates. The construction of these mice has been described previously (26Marshall B.A. Ren J.-M. Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18442-18445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minigene in this construct contains a 2.47-kilobase cDNA fragment encoding the human GLUT1 glucose transporter under the regulation of the 1.2-kilobase rat myosin light chain-2 promoter. Expression of the transgene is restricted to skeletal muscle and does not affect expression of the GLUT4 isoform. Basal glucose transport activity in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and epitrochlearis muscles from GLUT1 transgenic animals is 4–8-fold higher than in muscles from nontransgenic controls (27Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13115-16113Google Scholar). Rats or mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/100 g body weight), and the epitrochlearis and/or EDL muscles were excised. In some experiments, muscles were stimulated to contract in situ (see below) prior to dissection. Muscles were incubated with shaking for 1 h at 35 °C in 2 ml of oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) supplemented with 8 mm glucose, 32 mm mannitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), with or without a maximally effective concentration of insulin (2 milliunits/ml). Muscles were then washed in KHB containing 40 mm mannitol and 0.1% BSA, with or without insulin, for 10 min at 30 °C prior to measurement of glucose transport activity. The gas phase throughout the incubations was 95% O2, 5% CO2. Rat epitrochlearis muscles were stimulated to contract indirectly via the nerve. Square wave pulses (0.1 ms) were delivered with a Grass S48 stimulator at 100 Hz to give 250-ms-long trains at a rate of 60/min for 5 min. After a 1-min rest period, the muscles were stimulated for a second 5-min interval using the same protocol. Muscle glucose transport activity was assayed using 1.0 ml of KHB containing 8 mm3-O-[3H]methyl-d-glucose (3-MG; 2.2 μCi/ml), 32 mm [14C]mannitol (0.2 μCi/ml), 0.1% BSA, and insulin if it was present during the previous incubation. Incubations were performed at 30 °C with a gas phase of 95% O2, 5% CO2. Extracellular space and intracellular 3-MG concentration (μmol·ml intracellular water−1) were determined as described previously (28Young D.A. Uhl J.J. Cartee G.D. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16049-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, glucose transport activity was measured using 1 mm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose and 39 mm [14C] mannitol (27Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13115-16113Google Scholar). The nonmetabolizable amino acid analog α-(methylamino)isobutyrate (MeAIB) was used to measure system A amino acid transport activity as described previously (29Gulve E.A. Cartee G.D. Youn J.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C88-C95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscles were incubated in the presence or absence of 2 milliunits/ml insulin exactly as described above for the measurement of glucose transport activity. After the wash step, muscles were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 1.5 ml of KHB containing 0.1 mm[14C]MeAIB (0.075 μCi/ml), 10 mmd-[2-3H]mannitol (0.375 μCi/ml), 0.1% BSA, and insulin if it was present in the previous steps. Cell surface GLUT4 was assessed using the ATB-[2-3H]BMPA exofacial photolabeling technique as described previously (30Hansen P.A. Corbett J.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E28-E36PubMed Google Scholar), except that the labeled GLUT4 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody followed by protein A-Sepharose. Insulin receptors were prepared from the pooled gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles of one hind limb using previously described methods (31Burant C.F. Treutelaar M.K. Landreth G.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Bak J.F. Handberg A. Beck-Nielsen H. Pedersen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Insulin receptors were partially purified from solubilized muscle extracts using a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose column. The ability of the solubilized insulin receptors to phosphorylate exogenous substrates was tested using the synthetic peptide poly(Glu-Tyr (4:1)). Aliquots of the WGA eluate (100 μl containing 4 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin (16.7 milliunits/ml) for 60 min at 23 °C. Poly(Glu-Tyr (4:1)) (28 μg in 20 μl) was then added, and the reaction was initiated by the addition (20 μl) of a mixture containing 8 mm MgCl2, 600 μmNa3VO4, 45 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (32Bak J.F. Handberg A. Beck-Nielsen H. Pedersen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 23 °C, and the reaction was terminated by spotting aliquots of the reaction mixture on Whatman 31 ET filter paper. The papers were washed extensively in 1% H3PO4, rinsed in acetone, and then allowed to air dry prior to scintillation counting. Following an overnight fast, rats were anesthetized, and a bolus of saline (0.5 cc) was injected via a catheter placed in a jugular vein; after 120 s, the soleus muscle from the right hind limb was excised and clamp frozen. A bolus of insulin (10 units/kg body weight in 0.5 cc saline) was then injected into the catheter, and after 120 s, the left soleus muscle was excised and clamp frozen. Muscles were stored at −80 °C until analysis of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Soleus muscle extracts were prepared by the method of Saad et al. (33Saad M.J.A. Araki E. Miralpeix M. Rothenberg P.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For analysis of insulin receptor β-subunit autophosphorylation, aliquots of the solubilized muscle extract containing 100 μg were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6.25% gel) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 1% BSA in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1.5 μg/ml) followed by donkey anti-rabbit 125IgG and exposure to x-ray film for 12–48 h. For determination of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, an aliquot of the muscle extract containing 1 mg of protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-rat IRS-1 antibody, followed by adsorption with protein A-Sepharose for 60 min at 4 °C. The tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody exactly as described above for the insulin receptor β-subunit. IRS-1 protein content in the soluble muscle extracts (10 μg of protein) was assessed by immunoblotting using an antibody directed against the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of IRS-1, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Antibody-bound protein was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's specifications. Protein bands were quantitated by densitometry. For analysis of muscle insulin receptor protein content, a crude total membrane fraction was prepared (9Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Smith R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (70 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein bands were quantitated using densitometry. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Analysis of differences between the high fat-fed and chow-fed control groups was performed using a Student's t test.p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Rats that had been on the high fat diet for 8 weeks were significantly heavier and had higher plasma insulin levels than chow-fed controls of the same age (Table I). After 30 weeks on the high fat diet, the rats had become grossly obese and showed a further increase in plasma insulin levels. In addition, most of the animals on the high fat diet for 30 weeks had diabetic blood glucose levels (Table I).Table IEffect of the high fat diet on body weight and plasma glucose and insulin concentrationsDiet groupChowHigh fatBody weight (g) 8 weeks385 ± 5460 ± 9 30 weeks632 ± 21758 ± 29Plasma glucose (mg/dl) 8 weeks115 ± 4110 ± 2 30 weeks102 ± 4136 ± 15Plasma insulin (μU/ml) 8 weeks22 ± 244 ± 9 30 weeks26 ± 481 ± 9p < 0.001 vs. age-matched chow control.p < 0.05 vs. age-matched chow control.p < 0.01 vs. age-matched chow control.

The effect of 8 weeks of the high fat diet on glucose transport activity in the isolated epitrochlearis muscle is shown in Fig. 1. 3-MG transport stimulated by a maximally effective concentration of insulin was ∼50% lower in muscles from fat-fed animals. Glucose transport activity stimulated by muscle contractions was similarly reduced (∼50%) in muscles from animals fed the high fat diet. These results are similar to those reported previously by our group (6Han D.H. Hansen P.A. Host H.H. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also previously shown that insulin-stimulated glucose transport is decreased in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles (6Han D.H. Hansen P.A. Host H.H. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so these measurements were not repeated. In addition, it was previously found that the effect of fat feeding is on insulin responsiveness, rather than insulin sensitivity (6Han D.H. Hansen P.A. Host H.H. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the effect of a submaximal insulin stimulus was therefore not examined in this study. To investigate the possibility that the high fat diet might be influencing glucose transporter protein function by altering plasma membrane composition, we studied the effect of high fat feeding on glucose transport in skeletal muscle of mice overexpressing the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Nontransgenic mice fed a high fat diet for 4 weeks were heavier than chow-fed control mice (27.8 ± 1.3 g versus23.4 ± 1.7 g for high fat and chow, respectively) and exhibited a marked reduction in insulin-stimulated and hypoxia-stimulated glucose transport activities in epitrochlearis and EDL muscles (Fig. 2). Mice overexpressing GLUT1 were also fed a high fat diet or standard rodent chow ad libitum for 4 weeks. Like the wild-type mice, GLUT1 transgenic mice fed the high fat diet were heavier than their chow-fed littermates (27.4 ± 1.4 g versus 23.8 ± 0.5 g for high fat-fed and chow, respectively). The high fat diet had no effect on GLUT1 protein expression (2.04 ± 0.09 arbitrary unitsversus 2.02 ± 0.05 arbitrary units in chow and high fat-fed, respectively) or on basal glucose transport activity in the isolated EDL or epitrochlearis muscles of the GLUT1 transgenic mice (Fig. 3), suggesting that GLUT1-mediated transport was not affected by the diet.Figure 3Effect of 4 weeks of high fat feeding on basal glucose transport activity in epitrochlearis and EDL muscles of GLUT1 overexpressing mice. Muscles were incubated for 60 min at 35 °C in KHB containing 8 mm glucose and 32 mm mannitol. Muscles were then transferred to glucose-free KHB for 10 min at 30 °C prior to measurement of 3-MG transport as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means ± S.E. for six to eight muscles per group.

McKirahan K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, insulin stimulation of system A transport in skeletal muscle cells is completely abolished by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (35Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing evidence that insulin stimulation of system A amino acid transport and of glucose transport occurs via the same proximal steps of the insulin signaling pathway. To obtain preliminary information regarding the effect of the high fat diet on the insulin signaling pathway and to further investigate the possibility that a diet-induced alteration in plasma membrane composition might be interfering with the function of membrane transporter proteins, we examined the effect of 8 weeks of high fat feeding on system A amino acid transport activity in the epitrochlearis muscle (Fig. 4). Basal MeAIB transport was unchanged in muscles from high fat-fed animals compared with chow-fed controls. In contrast to the defect in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity that occurs in muscles of the fat-fed animals, MeAIB transport was stimulated to the same extent by insulin (∼2-fold above basal) in muscles from control and high fat-fed animals. This finding provides further evidence that the high fat diet does not cause alterations in plasma membrane composition that nonspecifically interfere with function of membrane transporter proteins. In addition, these results suggest that, after 8 weeks of high fat feeding, the early insulin signaling events are intact in skeletal muscle and that the high fat diet is acting on distal steps involved in stimulation of glucose transport. To further evaluate the effect of the high fat diet on insulin signaling, we measured the tyrosine kinase activity of WGA-purified, solubilized skeletal muscle insulin receptors toward an exogenous substrate. Insulin stimulated a ∼4-fold increase in 32P incorporation into poly(Glu-Tyr (4:1)) when receptors obtained from control animals were used. Phosphorylation of the substrate was increased to a similar extent (∼4-fold above basal) in preparations from animals fed the high fat diet for 8 weeks (Fig. 5 A), indicating that this duration of high fat feeding does not induce a defect in the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. In contrast, assay of the receptors isolated from animals fed the high fat diet for 30 weeks shows that longer term high fat feeding resulted in a decrease (∼30%) in tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5 B). Impaired insulin receptor function that was related to a change in the composition of its membrane lipid environment would not necessarily be observed when studying a solubilized receptor preparation. Therefore, to further evaluate the effect of the high fat diet on insulin receptor function in intact skeletal muscle, the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its endogenous substrate IRS-1 were studied following in situ administration of insulin (Fig. 6). There was no difference in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor between the chow control and 8-week fat-fed groups. In addition, 8 weeks of the high fat diet had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, after 30 weeks on the high fat diet, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor and IRS-1 were reduced by ∼30% (Fig. 6). The high fat feeding had no significant effect on the content of muscle insulin receptor (as assessed by β-subunit content) or IRS-1 protein at either 8 or 30 weeks. Although the early signaling events through which insulin and contractions increase muscle glucose transport activity are independent, both stimuli increase glucose transport by increasing the number of GLUT4 transporters at the cell surface (15Lund S.

https://openalex.org/W2041181082,"Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) are a family of proteins that attenuate the activity of the trimeric G proteins. RGS proteins act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the α subunits of several trimeric G proteins, much like the GAPs that regulate the activity of monomeric G proteins such as Ras. RGS proteins have been cloned from many eukaryotes, and those whose biochemical activity has been characterized regulate the members of the Gi family of G proteins; some forms can also act on Gq proteins. In an ongoing effort to elucidate the role of Gzα in cell signaling, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify proteins that could interact with a mutationally activated form of Gzα. A novel RGS, termed RGSZ1, was identified that is most closely related to two existing RGS proteins termed RetRGS1 and GAIP. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of RGSZ1 was limited to brain, and expression was particularly high in the caudate nucleus. Biochemical characterization of recombinant RGSZ1 protein revealed that RGSZ1 was indeed a GAP and, most significantly, showed a marked preference for Gzα over other members of the Giα family. Phosphorylation of Gzα by protein kinase C, an event known to occur in cells and that was previously shown to influence α-βγ interactions of Gz, rendered the G protein much less susceptible to RGSZ1 action.

Trimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins)1 are important players in the transmission of signals from the seven-transmembrane receptors to downstream effector molecules (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). G protein-mediated signaling pathways control many aspects of physiology in all eukaryotes. Although both the α and βγ subunits of the trimer are able to regulate effector molecules, G proteins are classified by the identity of the guanine nucleotide-binding α subunit. The α subunit cycles between active and inactive forms through the binding and hydrolysis, respectively, of GTP. The consequence of this GTP cycle is that the duration, and thus the level of amplification, of the signal transmitted by the G protein is in large part dependent on the length of time the G protein remains in the active, GTP-liganded, state. The level of understanding of the roles of particular G protein α subunits in signaling is quite varied. For several G proteins, the specific pathways in which an α subunit participates have been established; examples include hormonal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Gsα family), specific isoforms of phospholipase C (Gq/11 family), and regulation of rhodopsin-mediated cGMP levels in retinal photoreceptor cells (Gtα). However, several “orphan” G proteins exist for which no precise function has yet been defined. These include members of the G12 family, which have been implicated in stress responses and mitogenesis (3Chan A.M.-L. Fleming T.P. McGovern E.S. Chedid M. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 4Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar), although it remains unknown what the direct targets of G12proteins are in these signaling pathways. One particularly interesting orphan G protein is Gzα. By sequence comparison, Gzα is most highly related to the Gi proteins, with ∼66% homology to Gi1α, Gi2α, and Gi3α. Like these three α subunits, activated Gzα, at high (≥100 nm) enough concentration, is able to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (6Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, Gzα possesses many properties that distinguish it not only from the other Giα proteins but also from the other trimeric G proteins. One such property is pertussis toxin insensitivity; Gzα lacks the cysteine residue near the C terminus that serves as a site for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in the other Gi family members. Another interesting characteristic of Gzα is its limited pattern of expression. Through analysis of both mRNA and protein levels, expression of Gzα appears to be limited to retina, brain, and adrenal medulla. By immunoblot analysis, Gzα expression was easily detected in brain, adrenal medulla, and platelet membranes (8Matsuoka M. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5384-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Fong H.K.W. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is in sharp contrast to the Giα proteins that are rather ubiquitously expressed (12Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although most G proteins are very poor substrates for protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation, Gzα is an excellent PKC substrate (13Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Gzα occurs bothin vitro and in platelets treated with PKC activators such as thrombin or phorbol esters (14Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the impact of this event on Gz-mediated signaling is unclear, phosphorylation is rapid and stoichiometric (13Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylated Gzα has a greatly reduced affinity for the βγ subunit (15Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Combined, these studies suggest that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Gzα is a cellular event resulting in a down-regulation of the activity of Gzα. Biochemical analysis of Gzα has also revealed several properties of the protein that are quite unusual. The intrinsic rate of GDP dissociation (and therefore nucleotide exchange) is quite low (0.02 min−1 at 30 °C). In addition, the rate of exchange is reduced to nearly zero at Mg2+ concentrations above 500 μm (10Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of magnesium on the exchange rate of Gzα is unique compared with other trimeric G proteins and is qualitatively similar to that observed for the monomeric G proteins such as Ras (16Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another property Gzα shares with Ras-type proteins is that it is a poor GTPase, with an intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of 0.05 min−1 (10Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared with ∼10 min−1 for most other α subunits (17Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4713) Google Scholar). The slow GTP hydrolytic activity of Gzα prompted early suggestions that specific proteins might exist that could act as GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs, for this α subunit, similar to the GAPs that exist for many Ras-like proteins (10Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As detailed below, emerging data on the existence of such GAPs for trimeric G proteins reinforced the idea that a Gz-GAP could exist, and such a molecule has in fact been identified and characterized (18Fields T.A. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 19Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The first experimental evidence for the existence of GAPs for trimeric G proteins emerged in the early 90s when it was discovered that interaction of two Gα subunits, Gqα and Gtα, with their respective effector molecules could greatly enhance the GTPase rate of the G proteins (20Arshavsky V. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 21Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, it was the recent realization that a family of regulatory proteins, termedregulators of G protein signaling (RGS), exist that act as GAPs for certain Gα subunits that has elevated the study of this process to one of broad concern (22Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 23Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The founding member of the RGS family is the yeast protein Sst2p, originally identified as a gene important in desensitization of pheromone signaling in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Several mammalian RGS proteins as well as Sst2p have been characterized biochemically and found to act as general GAPs for members of the Gi family of G proteins (25Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 26Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); some RGS proteins can also act on Gqα (29Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As part of an overall effort to elucidate the signaling functions of Gz, a yeast two-hybrid screen was undertaken to identify proteins that specifically interact with a mutationally activated form of Gzα. This approach has resulted in the identification of a new member of the RGS family. The cDNA cloning and biochemical characterization of this RGS revealed that it exhibits high selectivity toward Gzα; thus, we have assigned it the tentative name of RGSZ1. Evidence is also presented that indicates that the action of RGSZ1 on Gzα is influenced by a dynamic post-translational modification of the G protein, which is PKC-mediated phosphorylation. Plasmids, strains, and instructions for performing the yeast two-hybrid screen were obtained from Stephen Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine). The monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody was a generous gift of Jonathan Horowitz (this institution). Gsα, Gzα, and myristoylated Gi2α were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (10Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gzα, purified from Sf9 cells (15Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was a gift of Tim Fields (this institution). Two-hybrid constructs containing mouse G13α(Q226L), mouse Gqα(Q209L), rat Goα(Q205L), bovine Gsα(Q227L), mouseG15α(Q212L), and mouse Gi2α(Q205L) were generously provided by Richard Premont (this institution). The cDNA containing the Q205L mutant form of rat Gzα was a gift of Henry Bourne, University of California, San Francisco. Antisera 6354 (13Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of David Manning (University of Pennsylvania). PKC was partially purified from bovine brain as described (33Kikkawa U. Minakuchi R. Takai Y. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Lipids were purchased as chloroform solutions from Avanti Polar Lipids. The cDNA containing the Q205L form of rat Gzα was digested with the restriction enzymeEcoRI, and the EcoRI fragment was made blunt with Klenow enzyme. The fragment was then cut with NcoI and directionally ligated into the NcoI and SmaI sites of pAS2. Ligation junctions and frame were verified by sequence analysis, and expression of the GAL4-HA-Gzα(Q205L) bait protein in the reporter strain, Y190, was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against the hemagglutinin epitope. The general procedures for conducting the two-hybrid screen are described elsewhere (34Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bait plasmid was sequentially transformed into Y190 with a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH)(36). Colonies that survived HIS selection and stained positive for β-galactosidase activity were screened for selectivity against four non-related bait constructs. Clones that survived those counterscreens were sequenced by automated sequencing (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence data obtained were then compared with the genome data bases by using BLAST algorithms. The complete cDNA for RGSZ1 was isolated from a human fetal brain library using the GeneTrapperTM positive selection system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, two oligonucleotides were generated corresponding to the 5′-most region of the partial RGSZ1 clone as follows: trap 1 (5′-TCCAGATGGGATCAGAGCGGAT-3′) and trap 2 (5′-AACTGCTCGTGTCTCACTGTTAG-3′). These oligonucleotides were gel-purified, and then biotin-dCTP was affixed to each with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. A human fetal brain library in pCMV·SPORT 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was first rendered single-stranded by nicking with Gene II and digestion of the nicked strand with exonuclease III, and then incubated in the presence of the biotinylated oligonucleotides. Library clones annealing to these oligonucleotides were recovered by incubation with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and DNA was eluted and introduced into E. coli by electroporation, and cells were plated onto selective medium. Colonies that arose were subjected to PCR analysis using as primers trap 1 and an oligonucleotide corresponding to the complementary strand of the partial RGSZ1. Plasmids were isolated from colonies that yielded the expected size (535-base pair) PCR product, and cDNA inserts were sequenced. Human multi-tissue and human brain multi-subregion poly(A)+ RNA blots were obtained fromCLONTECH. 32P-Labeled DNA probes were generated by random hexamer priming using a 1.6-kb region of RGSZ1 or the full-length sequence for Gzα as template and purified by size exclusion. Hybridizations were performed for 24 h at 42 °C, with 2 × 106 cpm/ml probe in a solution of 5× SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10× Denhardt's solution (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll (Sigma)) containing 0.4 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10 mg/ml SDS, and 50% deionized formamide. Blots were washed in 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 30 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min, then washed in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 58 °C for 20 min, and then again in the same solution at 68 °C for 20 min. Blots were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 36–40 h. A bank of human cDNA libraries was screened for the presence of RGSZ1 using PCR analysis. The primers used were trap 1 (above) and GSP4 (5′-TGTGTTGGGATGGCTCCACCATGTTTC-3′). PCR was performed under standard buffer conditions using Perkin-Elmer Amplitaq polymerase and buffers. Cycle parameters were 94 °C/30 s, 55 °C/30 s, and 72 °C/1 min for a total of 30 cycles. For RT-PCR, total RNA was prepared from fresh bovine tissues using the TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CLONTECHAdvantageTM RT kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the cDNA template for the PCR analysis. Two rounds of PCR were then performed under the same conditions stated above. An NcoI site was engineered at the initiating methionine of RGSZ1 using the QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene). A pCMV·SPORT 2 plasmid containing the entire cDNA for RGSZ1 was digested withPstI (a site present in the 3′-untranslated region), made blunt with T4 polymerase, and then digested with NcoI. The resulting insert, which contained the entire open reading frame of RGSZ1, was directionally ligated into the NcoI and HindIII (made blunt by Klenow enzyme) sites of pRSET B (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, termed pRGSZ, was transformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells containing the pRGSZ plasmid were grown in LB media at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g and resuspended (10 ml/liter culture) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease mixture (37Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. For purification of RGSZ1, the cell suspension (10 ml) was thawed in the presence of 6 μg of lysozyme and subjected to lysis in a French press. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min at 0 °C. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 such that the final buffer composition was 20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease mixture, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Lubrol (ICN). This extract was applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, and bound proteins eluted with a step gradient consisting of sequential 6-ml aliquots of the same buffer containing 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mmimidazole; RGSZ1 eluted at 150 mm imidazole. GTP hydrolysis activity of G protein α subunits was determined as described previously (26Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, α subunits were loaded with GTP in the presence of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 1.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.017% Lubrol, and 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (∼50,000 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 15 (Gsα, Gi2α, Goα) or 30 min (Gzα). Free GTP was removed by passage through Sephadex G-50 resin pre-equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, and 0.05% Lubrol. GTP hydrolysis reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of RGSZ1 and in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1.5–3.2 mm MgCl2, 0.15–0.32 μm GTP, and 0.025% Lubrol at 0 or 15 °C as described in the appropriate figure legends. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 770 μl of Norit A charcoal slurry (5% w/v in 50 mmNaH2PO4), and Pi content of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Total GTP binding was determined in each experiment by incubating an aliquot of the GTP-loaded G protein at 30 °C for sufficient time to allow for complete hydrolysis. Phosphorylation of Gzα by PKC was performed as described previously (38Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, Gzα was incubated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm GDP, 12 μg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phospho-l-serine, 2.1 μg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, 8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity ∼80 cpm/pmol), and ∼20 units/ml PKC for 60 min at 30 °C, then gel-filtered through G-50 resin equilibrated in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Lubrol. The stoichiometry of PKC phosphorylation was confirmed both by performing parallel reactions with high (1000 cpm/pmol) specific activity [γ-32P]ATP and also by analyzing a small aliquot of the phosphorylation reaction by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and excision of the band containing Gzα for radioactivity determination. The phosphorylation status of Gzα was also assessed by immunoblot analysis, specifically by following the reduction of a Gz-immunoreactive band using an antisera, 6354, that is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of Gzα (13Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted in which a constitutively active form (the Q205L variant) of Gzα was used as “bait.” The cDNA library chosen was derived from brain, as this tissue is one of the few types in which Gz expression can be readily detected. The human brain library chosen had a reported 5 million independent clones, and our initial screen yielded 29 million transformants, representing an approximate 6-fold overscreen. To verify Gzα-specific interactions, the initial two-hybrid screen included counterscreens against four nonspecific bait proteins, CDC42, Snf1, a nuclear lamin, and p53. Sequencing of the ∼100 clones that were determined to interact specifically with Gzα revealed that seven were identical copies of a partial cDNA whose sequence identified it as a novel member of the RGS family of proteins. An additional counter-screen was subsequently employed in which the ability of the protein product of the identified clone to interact with other activated G protein α subunits was determined by co-transforming the selected library plasmid with bait constructs containing the appropriate Gln → Leu mutants of G13α, Gqα, Goα, Gsα, G15α, and Gi2α. In this assay, the only other Gα that interacted with RGSZ1 was Goα (data not shown). The full-length cDNA encoding RGSZ1 was obtained by screening a fetal human brain library using biotinylated RGSZ1-specific oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”). The RGSZ1 cDNA was 1.77 kb in length, and translation of the cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 217 amino acids preceded by an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiating methionine. GAIP, an RGS protein with which RGSZ1 shares 53% amino acid identity, has an open reading frame of almost identical length (Fig. 1). Of the RGS members identified to date, RGSZ1 shares the highest homology with one termed RetRGS1 that was isolated from a bovine retinal library, although RGSZ1 lacks the large (156 amino acids) N-terminal domain found in RetRGS1. When this N-terminal region is excluded, RetRGS1 and RGSZ1 share 81% amino acid identity (Fig. 1). All three of these proteins contain the characteristic RGS core domain found in the C-terminal region of all RGS proteins, as well as a polycysteine string motif near the N terminus (39Pupier S. Leveque C. Marqueze B. Kataoka M. Takahashi M. Seager M.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the tissue distribution of RGSZ1 expression, a Northern blot analysis was performed using a radiolabeled RGSZ1 probe and poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. The analysis revealed a transcript of roughly 1.8 kb that was detected solely in brain (Fig. 2 A). In addition, human cDNA libraries derived from fetal brain, adult brain, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, testis, heart, HeLa cells, and leukocytes were subjected to PCR analysis using two specific RGSZ1 primers designed to yield a 535-base pair product. Of all the cell types examined, only the brain libraries yielded a readily discernible PCR product, although a faint signal was seen in the lung analysis (Fig. 3). RT-PCR analysis of bovine retinal and brain RNA was also performed, and although expression was readily detected in brain, no expression of RGSZ1 was detectable in retina (data not shown).Figure 3PCR analysis of RGSZ1 expression. Human cDNA libraries prepared from the indicated human tissues (Life Technologies, Inc.) were subjected to PCR using two primers specific to RGSZ1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PCR reactions were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and PCR products of the length expected for RGSZ1 (0.53 kb) were detected by staining with ethidium bromide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding that RGSZ1 was a brain-specific protein prompted us to examine the expression of this protein in defined subregions of human brain. The RGSZ1-derived probe was hybridized to a Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus. This analysis revealed that the RGSZ1 transcript was strikingly abundant in the caudate nucleus, although substantial message levels were seen in other subregions with the exception of the subthalamic nucleus and the thalamus, where barely detectable levels were observed (Fig. 2 B). Gzα expression was also examined in these same subregions, and a fairly uniform pattern of Gzα message was detected in all regions (Fig. 2 B). Since other RGS proteins act as GTPase-activating proteins, we investigated whether RGSZ1 also possessed this activity. The full-length RGSZ1 cDNA was subcloned into an E. coliexpression vector such that an amino-hexahistidine-tagged RGSZ1 protein would be produced. The tagged protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). RGSZ1 eluted at greater than 90% purity (Fig. 4) after this single column, and yield was approximately 6 mg/liter cells. We next assessed the ability of purified RGSZ1 to accelerate GTP hydrolysis of selected G protein α subunits. Recombinant RGSZ1 exerted no GAP activity toward Gsα at any tested concentration, whereas for all the Gi family members tested, a concentration-dependent increase in single turnover GTPase activity was observed in the presence of RGSZ1 (Fig. 5). Hence, like the other characterized RGS proteins, RGSZ1 shows selectivity toward the Gi family of G proteins. However, unlike the other RGS family members, RGSZ1 is highly selective for Gzα over other Giα proteins. Whereas 2.1 nm RGSZ1 exerted no detectable GAP activity toward Goα or Gi2α, this concentration of RGSZ1 stimulated the GTPase activity of Gzα nearly 5-fold. At the highest concentration of RGS protein tested (21 nm), the GTPase activity of Gi2α and Goα was stimulated some 2.5-fold, whereas the GTPase activity of Gzα was stimulated over 10-fold. At 21 nm RGSZ1, the GTPase activity of Gzα was outside the linear range of detection of the assay, so 10-fold activation can only be considered a lower estimate. The highest level activation we have observed for Gzα to date is ∼20-fold (see Fig. 7 B). Since only histidine-tagged RGSZ1 was used in these experiments, potential effects of the tag itself on the RGS-G protein interaction were not determined. However, all other RGS proteins bioch"

(1996) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 225, 869–876). Here we demonstrate that isoprenoid-induced apoptosis was preceded by an arrest in G0/G1 phase. The isoprenoid effects were independent of protein prenylation and of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Moreover, geranylgeraniol and farnesol induced a rapid inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis at the last step of the CDP-choline pathway controlled by choline phosphotransferase and not at the level of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the key enzyme of the pathway. Inhibition of choline phosphotransferase was confirmed by in vitro assays on microsomal fractions, which clearly showed that the isoprenoids acted by competitive inhibition with the diacylglycerol binding. Exogenous phosphatidylcholine addition prevented all the biological effects of the isoprenoids, including actin fiber disorganization and apoptosis, suggesting that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis might be the primary event of the isoprenoid action. These data demonstrate the molecular mechanism of geranylgeraniol and farnesol effects and suggest that the mevalonate pathway, leading notably to prenylated proteins, might be linked to the control of cell proliferation through the regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.

Isoprenoids are essential compounds required for cell proliferation and differentiation. Sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids are derived from a common precursor mevalonate, which is the product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)1-CoA reductase (EC1.1.1.34), the major rate-limiting enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis in mammalian cells (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation requires at least two derivatives of mevalonate: cholesterol, necessary for cell membrane assembly, and nonsterol products involved in the mechanisms controlling initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth (1Goldstein J.L.

PC is the most abundant phospholipid in mammalian cells, representing up to 50% of the membrane phospholipids.

Moreover, PC is required for the normal progression through the cell cycle as shown by accumulation in the G1 phase of fibroblasts cultured in choline-deficient medium (25Tercé F. Brun H. Vance D.E.

Apoptosis also occurs upon inhibition of CT in cells treated with antitumor phospholipid analogues (31Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Although it has been reported that the CDP choline pathway for PC biosynthesis is inhibited by the free isoprenoid FOH in leukemia cells (33Melnykovych G. Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the precise mechanisms underlying this inhibition remain to be elucidated. In the present study we have investigated whether the inhibitory effect of FOH on the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell proliferation could be related to an inhibition of PC synthesis. Moreover, we have analyzed whether GGOH induced apoptosis through a similar mechanism. We demonstrate here that both GGOH and FOH are able to induce a G0/Gl block and trigger apoptosis in A549 cells independently of the prenylation of proteins. We also show that GGOH, as well as FOH, induces a very rapid inhibition of PC biosynthesis at the level of choline phosphotransferase (CPT), the last step of CDP-choline pathway. Both GGOH and FOH appear to act as competitive inhibitors of CPT. These data provide the first demonstration of apoptosis induced by direct inhibition of CPT and suggest a potential coordinated regulation between the cholesterol and phospholipid biosynthesis pathways that is implicated in cell proliferation and death control. RPMI 1640 medium, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Egg yolk PC, 1,2 dioleoyl-rac-glycerol, FOH, GGOH, farnesylacetate, geraniol, choline chloride, and propidium iodide were from Sigma. [Methyl-3H]choline chloride (85 mCi/mmol), CDP-[methyl-14C]choline (62 mCi/mmol), and phosphoryl-[methyl-14C]choline (50 mCi/mmol) were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (ATCC-CCL 185) were routinely grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. After treatment with various compounds, cells were harvested at indicated times and stained with propidium iodide. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out as described previously (11Miquel K. Pradines A. Favre G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells in G0/G1 was calculated from their histograms using the Cellfit software (Becton Dickinson, Yvry sur Seine, France). 5.6 × 104 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes and grown for 2 days. Cells were then treated with compounds or vehicle for 48 h. Apoptosis was quantified on adherent cells using the Cell Death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). This method allowed detection of histone-associated DNA fragments, demonstrating the internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA occurring during apoptosis. Control or treated cells were washed once with PBS and lysed by incubating in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1% TX100, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μm pepstatin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6.4 mg/ml 104® phosphatase substrate (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (12000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) for Ras and Rap1A processing analysis, 50 μg of protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15%). For mitogen-activated protein kinase analysis, 10 μg of protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (25 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.8), 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and probed with either anti-Ha-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Rap1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-activeTM mitogen-activated protein kinase (Promega), or anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) IgG (SantaCruz Biotechnology), which recognizes the total ERK1 and ERK2, in 1% non fat dry milk in TBST and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad). Detection was performed with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham). A549 cells (1.35 × 105) were seeded into 100-mm dishes and grown for 2 days. Cells were then treated with the test compounds in medium containing 2 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice in PBS, scraped in CH3OH/H2O (2/1, v/v), briefly sonicated, and an aliquot was taken for protein determination. Cellular lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was dried under nitrogen, and then choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline were separated on silica gel chromatographic plates (Merck) developed in the solvent EtOH/2.4% NaCl/H2O/NH4OH (50/12.5/37.5/5). Lipids in the chloroform phase were separated in the solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (75/45/12/6). The spots were revealed by iodine vapor and scraped, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 50 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin. Cells were disrupted with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and briefly sonicated before centrifuging at 70,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and pellet obtained are referred to as the cytosol and microsomal fractions, respectively. The microsomal fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer, and both fractions were stored on ice until the time of enzyme assay. All assays were performed under conditions determined to be linear for time and protein concentration. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) activity was measured as described by Vance (35Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) in a mixture containing 58 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm EDTA, 8.9 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mmphosphoryl-[methyl-14C]choline (50 μCi/μmol), 3 mm CTP, and in the presence of sonicated vesicles of 0.2 mm PC, 0.2 mm oleate and up to 200 μg of cell protein. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 80 mg/ml phosphocholine and immersion of samples into boiling water for 2 min. CDP-choline and phosphocholine were separated by thin layer chromatography as described above. The CDP-choline spots were scraped, and their radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. CPT activity was assayed as described by Sleight and Kent (36Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10644-10650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a mixture of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm 1,2 dioleoyl-rac-glycerol (DG) in 0.1% taurocholate (sonicated before addition to assay mixture), 0.1 mm CDP-[methyl-14C]choline (7.14 μCi/μmol), and up to 100 μg of cell protein. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v). The lower phase was washed with a theoretical upper phase (methanol/water/chloroform/acetic acid) (4.8/4.7/0.3/0.1), and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. 1 × 104 cells grown for 72 h on glass coverslips in culture medium were treated with 80 μm of FOH or GGOH in the absence or presence of 65 μm DG or 65 μm egg yolk PC for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 20 min, incubated in 50 mm NH4Cl, PBS for 10 min, and then permeabilized in 0.1% TX100, PBS for 3 min. Cells were stained with 5 units/ml rhodamin phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min in a humidified chamber. Cells were examined with a Zeiss microscope through a 100× oil immersion lens. We recently demonstrated that among diverse isoprenoids, only GGOH and FOH induce actin cytoskeleton disorganization, growth inhibition, and apoptosis (11Miquel K. Pradines A. Favre G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have now evaluated the ability of GGOH and FOH to alter cell cycle distribution. After a 24-h attachment period, control cells displayed a typical repartition between the different phases of the cell cycle. Of total cells, 38% were in the G0/G1 phase, 38% were in the S phase, and 24% were in the G2/M phase (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 A, after a 24-h incubation, GGOH and FOH increased the number of cells in G0/G1 up to 52 and 62%, respectively, whereas two structural analogues, geraniol and farnesylacetate, did not modify cell cycle distribution. The effect of GGOH and FOH was maximal after 24 h of treatment; an additional 24-h incubation did not significantly amplify the response (Fig. 1 A). Quantification of histone-associated DNA fragments by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay clearly indicated that treatment of A549 cells by GGOH and FOH triggered apoptosis (Fig. 1 B), confirming our previous work (11Miquel K. Pradines A. Favre G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the G0/G1 block (Fig. 1 A) as well the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1 B) were greater after cell treatment with GGOH than with FOH. By contrast, after a 48-h incubation, neither 100 μm geraniol nor farnesylacetate induced apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Being structurally similar to and metabolites of farnesyl- and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which are substrates for protein prenylation, GGOH and FOH could act as competitive inhibitors of the prenyltransferases, farnesyl- and geranylgeranyltransferase I, like other analogues such as farnesylamine (37Kothapalli R. Guthrie N. Chambers A.F. Carroll K.K. Lipids. 1993; 28: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate whether GGOH and FOH were able to alter protein prenylation, A549 cells were treated with the isoprenoids for 48 h, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies directed to Ha-Ras and RaplA, two small G-proteins that are farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, respectively. In additional controls, cells were treated with FTI-277, an inhibitor of farnesyltransferase (38Vogt A. Qian Y.M. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 660-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), or by GGTI-298, an inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferase I (39McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As expected, FTI-277 inhibited farnesylation of Ha-Ras, and GGTI-298 inhibited geranylgeranylation of RaplA, as shown by the appearance of the upper band, which corresponds to the unprocessed form of the small G proteins (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, GGOH and FOH were unable to inhibit neither Ha-Ras or Rap1A processing, as indicated by the presence of only the processed form (lower band, Fig. 2 A). Moreover, GGOH and FOH did not inhibit the activity of purified farnesyltransferase determined in an in vitro assay (data not shown). These data indicated that the effects on the cell cycle of GGOH and FOH were not related to protein prenylation. Because the prenyl group might be required for protein-membrane or protein-protein interactions (40Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) we cannot exclude that GGOH or FOH could inhibit such interactions. To test this hypothesis we examined whether the isoprenoids could prevent Ras membrane anchorage and interfere with the Ras-dependent signaling pathway as shown for S-farnesylthiosalicyclic acid (41Gana-Weisz M. Haklai R. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The activation by EGF of the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinases or ERKs was analyzed in A549 cells treated or not by GGOH or FOH. As shown in Fig. 2 B, after an incubation of 24 h, GGOH and FOH inhibited neither basal nor EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42). These results indicated that the isoprenoids did not prevent Ras membrane localization where it can still induce its Raf-1-dependent signaling pathway. These data suggested also that the GGOH and FOH effects are independent of ERK pathway. It was previously reported that inhibition of PC biosynthesis by FOH may be the origin of apoptosis in leukemia CEM-C1 cells (19Voziyan P.A. Goldner C.M. Melnykovych G. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Melnykovych G. Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To know whether GGOH and FOH as well might act by a similar mechanism in adenocarcinoma A549 cells, the effect of these free isoprenoids on PC biosynthesis has been examined. As shown in Fig. 3 A, when GGOH or FOH were added simultaneously with [3H]choline, a strong and rapid inhibition of choline incorporation into PC was observed. By contrast, the rate of PC biosynthesis in the presence of two analogues, farnesylacetate or geraniol, was comparable with the control. After 3 h of incubation, inhibition of choline incorporation into PC was almost maximal at 60 μm GGOH or FOH (Fig. 3 B), with an IC50 around 40 μm. Analysis of the intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway (Fig. 4) indicated that phosphocholine labeling was identical in GGOH- and FOH-treated cells versus control cells. By contrast, the radioactivity of the CDP-choline pool was greatly enhanced in the presence of GGOH or FOH in opposition to the decrease in PC labeling. This result suggested that inhibition of PC biosynthesis in A549 cells took place at the last step of the CDP choline pathway regulated by CPT and not at the level of CT, the rate-limiting step of the pathway in most situations (20Tronchère H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We next performed a pulse-chase experiment with GGOH (Fig. 5). After a lag time of 10 min, CDP-choline accumulated in the presence of GGOH with a parallel decrease in PC labeling, confirming that CPT is the site of inhibition in GGOH- and FOH-treated cells.Figure 5Pulse-chase experiment with [methyl-3H]choline chloride in the presence of GGOH. Cells were prelabeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride for 24 h. The radioactive medium was removed, and [methyl-3H]choline chloride was chased by 14 mg/ml choline in the absence (■) or presence of 80 μmGGOH (▪). At the indicated times, radioactivity in CDP-choline (A) and in PC (B) was determined. Each value is plotted as the percentage of the total radioactivity and is representative of four independent experiments. Standard deviations are less than 5% of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CPT and CT activities were measured in subcellular fractions (cytosol or microsomes) of cells treated with GGOH or FOH for 3 h. As shown in Table I, CPT activity in the microsomal fraction was decreased in GGOH- or FOH-treated samples, confirming the radiolabel accumulation into the CDP-choline pool previously demonstrated (Fig. 4). CT activity was measured both in the microsomal and cytosolic fractions since this dual subcellular localization is a general feature of this enzyme (20Tronchère H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GGOH and FOH induced a decrease of CT activity in the cytosol and an increase of CT activity in microsomes.Table IEffect of farnesol and geranylgeraniol on CT and CPT activitiesControlFarnesolGeranylgeraniolnmol.min.mg−1CT activity Cytosol1.14 ± 0.150.46 ± 0.060.25 ± 0.02 Microsomes1.30 ± 0.072.20 ± 0.142.73 ± 0.32CPT activity0.080 ± 0.0060.064 ± 0.0050.052 ± 0.005Cells were incubated for 3 h in the absence or presence of 80 μm farnesol or geranylgeraniol.

Differences between control and farnesol- or geranylgeraniol-treated samples were significant in Student's t test (P < 0.05). The above results suggested that the effect of GGOH and FOH on PC biosynthesis correlated with the accumulation of cells in G0/G1 leading to apoptosis. To ascertain that the inhibition of PC synthesis by the isoprenoids initiated programmed cell death, A549 cells were incubated with GGOH or FOH in the presence of exogenous PC. The presence of 65 μm exogenous PC was able to entirely prevent induction of G0/G1block (Fig. 6 A) and apoptosis (Fig. 6 B) by both isoprenoids. Surprisingly, the same result was obtained with diacylglycerol, the lipid substrate of the inhibited enzyme CPT. Indeed, the presence of 65 μm DG in the culture medium was able to entirely prevent induction of G0/G1 block (Fig. 6 A) and apoptosis (Fig. 6 B) by the isoprenoids. To test whether PC or DG prevention of isoprenoids effects was not the result of a trapping of GGOH and FOH by the lipid vesicles added to the incubation medium, we have tried to prevent another cellular effect of GGOH by addition of PC or DG. Indeed, we have previously shown that a low concentration of GGOH (20 μm) was able to prevent the G0/G1 block induced by compactin, an inhibitor of isoprenoid synthesis (Ref. 7Miquel K. Pradines A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.A. Favre G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1846-1850PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 6 C). This GGOH prevention effect could be still observed whether PC or DG were added simultaneously or not, indicating that the lipids did not interact with GGOH, which could still reach its intracellular targets (Fig. 6 C). Since we have recently demonstrated that GGOH and FOH induced actin cytoskeleton disorganization in A549 cells (11Miquel K. Pradines A. Favre G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the addition of DG or PC prevent"

Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak, p130Cas, and paxillin is also induced by extracellular matrix proteins (17Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The influence of IGF-I on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak and paxillin has been less studied and is the subject of conflicting reports (12Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J.

The effect of IGF-I on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, a novel adaptor protein implicated in transformation (19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and recently identified as a critical mediator of cell migration (46Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 47Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), is unknown.In the present study we report, for the first time, that IGF-I induces a rapid and transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in Swiss 3T3 cells, a useful model system to elucidate signal transduction pathways in the action of growth factors (48Rozengurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our results also show that IGF-I promotes the formation of a complex between p130Cas and c-Crk and elicits a coordinate increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak and paxillin. IGF-I stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion proteins through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway that requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton.DISCUSSIONThere is increasing evidence indicating that IGF-I signaling is involved in multiple biological processes including cell migration, proliferation, and transformation, but the downstream targets that mediate these effects have not been fully identified. The findings presented here demonstrate that IGF-I induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor molecule p130Cas in Swiss 3T3 cells. The rapidity and the low, physiological concentrations of IGF-I inducing this effect suggest that this event may be functionally important in the biological action of IGF-I. Our results also demonstrate that IGF-I induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak and paxillin with kinetics that parallel those of p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation.The signal transduction events initiated by the IGF-IR have been extensively investigated, but the pathway(s) leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins p130Cas, p125Fak and paxillin by IGF-I was unknown. Given that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/ERK and PI 3-kinase pathways have emerged as major mediators of the biological effects promoted by IGF-I, we examined their role in IGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. We found that IGF-I stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin independently of ERK activation. In contrast, the structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 markedly attenuated the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin induced by IGF-I. Thus, our results identify a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion proteins in response to IGF-I stimulation.PI 3-kinase activity is required for the formation of membrane ruffles by several motility-inducing growth factors (11Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar), and the lipid products of this enzyme have been shown to induce actin reorganization and to increase cell migration (64Derman M.P. Toker A.

The small GTP-binding protein Rac is known to mediate the recruitment of actin into membrane ruffles induced by extracellular stimuli (66Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 67Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of a signal transduction pathway in the action of PDGF and epidermal growth factor involving PI 3-kinase, Rac, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization that leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin (26Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Rankin S. Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with either cytochalasin D or high concentrations of PDGF, at concentrations known to disrupt the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (24Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), abrogated the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion proteins induced by IGF-I. Our results reveal a novel cross-talk between IGF-I and PDGF and indicate that an intact actin cytoskeleton is essential for IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin via the PI 3-kinase pathway. The integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is likely to be required for promoting the assembly of the focal contacts (16Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar), the distinct sites of the plasma membrane where p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin are recruited and become tyrosine-phosphorylated.The signaling pathways that lie downstream of PI 3-kinase also include the serine/threonine kinases p70S6K (57Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 271-292PubMed Google Scholar) and the novel and atypical isoforms of PKC (59Toker, A., and Cantley, L. C. (1997) Nature387,Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that inhibition of either p70S6K or PKC activation, with the immunosuppressant rapamycin or the specific PKC antagonist GF 109203X, respectively, did not prevent IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin. Thus, IGF-I-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins is PI 3-kinase-dependent but can be dissociated from activation of either p70S6K or PKC.The results presented here also demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in response to bombesin is not prevented by either wortmannin or LY294002, at concentrations that virtually abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Casinduced by IGF-I. These results imply that there is a PI 3′-kinase-dependent and PI 3′-kinase-independent signal transduction pathway stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins in the same cells.The molecular cloning of p130Cas revealed an adaptor protein that contains an SH3 domain, proline-rich regions, and a cluster of 15 putative SH2-binding motifs (19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This suggests that tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas may serve to promote the assembly of multiple SH2-containing molecules. In fact, p130Cas forms stable complexes with other signaling proteins, including c-Crk and c-Src, in an SH2-dependent manner (19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y.

S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that integrin-dependent cell adhesion, neuropeptide agonists, and low concentrations of PDGF and epidermal growth factor stimulate association of p130Cas with c-Crk, an SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein (26Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol.

Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15398-15402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).The results presented here demonstrate, for the first time, that IGF-I rapidly induces the formation of a p130Cas·c-Crk complex that is dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, c-Crk has been implicated as a positive effector of IGF-I-mediated mitogenic signaling (74Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. IGF-I has been shown to increase c-Crk dissociation from insulin receptor substrate-1 (75Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), resulting in a pool of c-Crk available for new molecular interactions. The assembly of a p130Cas·c-Crk complex, as shown by our results, is one of the new interactions of c-Crk triggered by IGF-I. The complex between p130Cas and c-Crk may be important in regulating the subcellular distribution of c-Crk and/or the activity of new downstream effectors in IGF-I signal transduction pathways.The findings presented here assume an added interest in view of the increasing evidence implicating p130Cas and p125Fak in cell migration, proliferation, and transformation. The adaptor protein p130Cas also been implicated in agonist-stimulated mitogenesis (26Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and in cell transformation (19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 76Auvinen M. Paasinen-Sohns A. Hirai H. Andersson L.C. Hölttä E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and it has recently been identified as a mediator of p125Fak-mediated cell migration (46Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting that the formation of a p130Cas·c-Crk complex is emerging as a critical switch in the promotion of cell migration (47Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Crk binds to a number of signaling proteins through its SH3 terminal domain including C3G (77Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap-1, which is a small GTP-binding protein that induces mitogenesis in Swiss 3T3 cells (78Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and the induction of complex formation between p130Cas and c-Crk may be important novel early events in IGF-I signal transduction leading to cell migration and mitogenesis.Gene disruption experiments have demonstrated a critical role of p125Fak in embryonic development, cell migration, and turnover of focal adhesions (79Illc D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 80Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 81Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of dominant-negative fragments of p125Fak which displaces endogenous p125Fak from focal adhesions and prevents its activation inhibited cell motility and serum stimulation of DNA synthesis (82Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence linking overexpression of p125Fak to cell migration (80Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to the invasive properties of cancer cells (83Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Kornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I signaling is also of critical importance in cell proliferation, migration, and transformation (84Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For example, IGF-I has been shown to stimulate tumor cell metastasis, a process that requires cell migration (13Brooks P.C. Klemke R.L. Schon S. Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Consequently, our results showing that IGF induces a coordinate increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, p125Fak, and paxillin and the formation of a complex between p130Cas and c-Crk through a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway suggest novel mechanisms of action for this important growth promoting factor. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I)1 is implicated in many normal and abnormal processes including development, cell growth, and malignant transformation (1Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blakesley V.A. Kalebic T. Helman L.J. Stannard B. Faria T.N. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D.

Although MMP activity is controlled at multiple levels, the primary regulation of MMP activity is transcriptional. The transcriptional promoter elements required for MMP gene expression in cultured cells have been defined, but this has not been extended to the in vivo situation. In this paper, we show that the DNA sequences between −522 and +19 of the rabbit gelatinase B gene (MMP-9) (as characterized in the transgenic mouse line 3445) constitute a minimal promoter that drives appropriate developmental and injury-induced reporter gene expression in transgenic mice. We further show that the expression and activity of three transcription factors (NF-κB, AP-2, and Sp1) that control the activity of the gelatinase B promoter are selectively induced in the epithelium migrating to heal a wound. Although promoter activity parallels expression of the endogenous gene in cell cultures, we show by several criteria that cell cultures cannot model many aspects of promoter regulation in vivo. This study reveals that the transgenic mouse line 3445 might be a useful model for investigating the regulation of gelatinase B expressionin vivo and for identifying and characterizing new drugs that can control gelatinase B gene transcription.

Removal of ECM1structures is an important component of normal tissue remodeling, and excessive or inappropriate ECM degradation is the basis of a number of pathologies. The major effectors of ECM degradation belong to a family of structurally related enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (1Woessner Jr., J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1997: 1-14Google Scholar). MMPs share several properties that reflect the multiple levels at which their activity is regulated. These include secretion in an inactive pro-form requiring activation by proteolytic cleavage, requirement for zinc in the active site, and capacity of the active enzyme to be inhibited by members of the TIMP (tissueinhibitor of metalloproteinases) family (2Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Currently, there is much interest in the development of drugs to inhibit MMP activity that take advantage of the shared biochemical properties of these enzymes (3Brown P.D. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1997: 243-261Google Scholar). Although MMP activity is controlled at multiple levels, resident cells of a tissue typically do not make MMPs unless they are needed for remodeling (4Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1997: 299-356Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of MMP gene expression offers a second possible drug target for controlling inappropriate MMP activity. Expression of MMPs is controlled primarily at the level of transcription (5Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of agents and conditions stimulate MMP transcription (6Martisian L.N. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 7Alexander C.M. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), but only a few with inhibitory properties are known (4Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1997: 299-356Google Scholar, 5Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, identification of MMP transcriptional inhibitors can be made in cultured cell models. However, to begin evaluation of compounds with transcriptional inhibitory properties for efficacy in specific disease processes, animal models must be developed that make use of rapid and simple assays. One approach would be to introduce easily assayed reporter genes under control of a specific MMP promoter into transgenic mice. Development of this type of model would be able to rely on the extensive work characterizing the requirements for MMP promoter activity in cultured cells; however, the promoter requirements are likely to be far more complex in animals. We are aware of no studies characterizing promoter sequences in mice for any MMP gene to date. Gelatinase B (MMP-9) was one of the first members of the MMP family to be characterized (8Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1997: 115-147Google Scholar). This MMP is reactive against native type IV and V collagens, elastin, fibronectin, and denatured collagens of all types (9Shipley J.M. Doyle G.A.R. Fliszar C.J. Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Shapiro S.D.

Major sites of expression include trophoblast cells surrounding the implanting embryo (17Reponen P. Leivo I. Sahlberg C. Apte S. Olsen B. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as well as the brain and skeletal elements of the embryo proper (18Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Munaut C. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J.

In adults, gelB is expressed in brain (21Backstrom J.R. Lim G.P. Cullen M.J. Tokes Z.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7910-7919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in bone osteoclasts (18Reponen P.

Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1519-1530PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in adults is also inducible at a number of sites by stress stimuli. For example, gelB is not expressed in the epidermis or dermis of adult skin; however, expression is induced in the basal cell layers of the epidermis (23Oikarinen A. Kylmaniemi M. Autio-Harmainen H.

Much like other MMPs, inappropriate or excessive gelB expression is associated with a number of pathological conditions. Sites of pathological expression include the epithelium of ulcerating corneas (26Matsubara M. Zieske J. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 92-107Google Scholar, 27Fini M.E. Parks W.

In cell cultures, gelB expression is stimulated by growth factors and inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α and tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as TPA (4Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1997: 299-356Google Scholar). These stimulators also coordinately induce other MMP genes such as collagenase and stromelysin; however, the signaling pathways for gelB appear to be different (31Fini M.E. Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Bartlett J.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 622-636PubMed Google Scholar). 2P. Bargagna-Mohan, K. J. Strissel, and M. E. Fini, submitted for publication. The DNA flanking the 5′-end of the gelB gene is highly conserved across the human, mouse, and rabbit species from the transcription start site (+1), upstream through base −600. In common with many other MMPs, a canonical TPA response element that binds transcription factor AP-1 is found close to the transcription start site (33Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar); a second TPA response element is located near the distal end of the conserved region (34Huhtala P. Tuuttila A.

In this report, we advance MMP promoter characterization to the next level by investigating the regulatory sequences of the gelB promoter that confer expression in transgenic mice. We show that sequences between −522 to +19 of the gelB promoter, as characterized in the transgenic mouse line 3445, are necessary and sufficient for appropriate developmental and wound-inducible expression of alacZ reporter gene. We further show that the expression and activity of three transcription factors that control the gelB promoter in cultured cells (NF-κB, AP-2, and Sp1) are selectively induced in the epithelium migrating to close the wound in vivo. Although promoter activity parallels expression of the endogenous gene in cell cultures, we show that cell cultures cannot model many aspects of promoter regulation in vivo. These studies suggest that the transgenic mouse line 3445 might be a useful model for investigating the unique regulation characteristics of gelB gene expression and for identifying and characterizing new drugs that can control gelB gene transcription. The rabbit synovial cell line HIG-82, a gift from Dr. C. H. Evans (39Georgescu H.I. Mendelow D. Evans C.H. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was cultured as described (14Fini M.E. Girard M.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1779-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Primary corneal epithelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (14Fini M.E. Girard M.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1779-1788PubMed Google Scholar,31Fini M.E. Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Bartlett J.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 622-636PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit corneal “epithelial-like” cell line SIRC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) and the mouse keratinocyte cell line PAM-212 (a gift from Dr. Paolo Dotto, Massachusetts General Hospital) were cultured as recommended by the suppliers. Construct Pr43 was created using a two-step cloning strategy. A 541-base pair fragment extending from −522 to +19 of the rabbit gelB gene was PCR-amplified from rabbit genomic clone p36 (37Fini M.E. Bartlett J.D. Matsubara M. Rinehart W.B. Mody M.K. Girard M.T. Rainville M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28620-28628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Puc/M13 forward primer (5′-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT-3′; Promega, Madison, WI) and primer BF6 (5′-CGC GGG CTC GAG GGT GAG GGG AGA AGC GCT-3′) complementary to bases +19 to +2, with anXhoI site and a GC clamp added to the 5′-end. The resulting PCR product was cut with EcoRI (base −522) and XhoI and cloned into the pNASSβ expression vector (Promega). This construction is called Pr22. The 4666-base pair fragment from Pr22 containing the −522 to +19 gelB promoter/lacZ fusion gene was next cut withEcoRI/HindIII and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cytomegalovirus promoter from pcDNA3 was then removed by digestion with NruI and HindIII; the remaining plasmid ends were blunt-ended; and the ends were religated to produce Pr43 (see Fig. 1). An intermediate construct, Pr34, was created to facilitate the construction of the deletion constructs Pr35 and Pr42. To do this, the proximal region (−92 to +19) of the gelB promoter was PCR-amplified using a forward primer (5′-CGC GGG CTC GAG CAC CGG CCC TGA GTC AGC ACT-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CGC GGG GTC GACGGT GAG GGG AGC AGC AGC GTC T-3′). An XhoI site terminated by a GC clamp was added to the 5′-end of the forward primer. ASalI site terminated by a GC clamp was added to the 5′-end of the reverse primer. The amplified DNA fragment was cut withXhoI/SalI and cloned into the XhoI site of pNASSβ. Construct Pr35 was created by introducing the sequences from the distal AP-1 site to just upstream of the NF-κB site (−566 to −438) and fusing this fragment to the −92 to +19 gelB sequences contained in Pr34. The distal promoter sequences were PCR-amplified using the forward primer (5′-CGC GGG CTC GAG CCC ATC ACT GCC CTG AAG ATTC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CGC GGG CTC GAG AAA GCC CTC CTC TGA CTC AGC TTC-3′); each primer was 5′-terminated by an XhoI site-GC clamp. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was cut with XhoI and cloned into Pr34 at the XhoI site. Pr42 was created by amplifying the gelB promoter between −566 and −313 using the same forward primer as for Pr35 and a reverse primer containing the XhoI site-GC clamp (5′-CGC GGG CTC GAGTGG TCA GCT CAG CGA AAG GAT-3′). The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was cut with EcoRI (which removes DNA sequences upstream of the NF-κB site beginning at base −523) and XhoI and cloned into EcoRI/XhoI-cut Pr34, upstream of the −92 to +19 gelB promoter sequences. Plasmid DNAs were purified using the QIAGEN plasmid DNA purification kit. Pr43 plasmid DNA was transfected into SIRC and PAM-212 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure of the manufacturer. Cells were cultured in medium containing the antibiotic drug G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 0.625 mg/ml. Drug-resistant stably transfected cells were identified as discrete surviving colonies after 1 month of selection in culture. To determine whether transfected cells expressed the β-gal reporter gene, cells in one of the transfected dishes were fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde and stained with X-gal as described (40Wasserman P.M. DePhamphilis M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 319-374Google Scholar). About 80% of the drug-resistant colonies stained blue. Single drug-resistant colonies from SIRC and PAM-212 cells were isolated and amplified, and clones expressing β-gal were used in cell culture studies. For the experiments, cells were plated in six-well cluster plates at equal density. The following day, the cells were washed in serum-free medium, and each well was replenished with 1 ml of serum-free medium with and without 1 μm TPA (Sigma). The conditioned media were collected after 24 h, and equal volume samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography. gelB was quantitated by densitometry according to our standard methods (41Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1991; 2: 2441-2445Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein sample from the control and TPA-treated cell cultures were used for β-gal assays using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate and a spectrophotometric absorbance of 420 nm, according to a standard protocol (40Wasserman P.M. DePhamphilis M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 319-374Google Scholar). To prepare DNA for generation of transgenic mice, plasmid Pr43 was cut withEcoRI and HindIII, and the larger 4666-base pair band containing the gelB promoter and lacZ gene was gel-purified from agarose using the Glassmax kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). A similar strategy was used for Pr34 and Pr42. Plasmid Pr35 was cut with NarI and HindIII, and the gelB promoter/lacZ fusion gene fragment was purified for microinjections. Transgenic mice were generated in the core facilities of the Yale Cancer Center (New Haven, CT) and Beth Israel Hospital (Boston, MA). Briefly, fertilized F2 hybrid embryos obtained from matings of C57BL6 and SJL mice were injected with DNA fragments (2 μg/ml) and transferred to pseudopregnant Swiss outbred foster mothers. Putative transgenic founder pups born from these foster mothers were analyzed when the pups reached 5 weeks of age. Pups were screened for integration of the transgene into their genomes by Southern blot analysis of DNA from tail biopsies using a β-gal DNA fragment as a probe. To determine whether the integrated DNA was transmitted to progeny, founder mice were mated with wild-type CD-1 mice, and tail DNA from the F1 generation progeny was analyzed by PCR. One to two micrograms of tail DNA was subjected to PCR using a forward primer (RM62, 5′-CAC CGG CCC TGA GTC AGC ACT-3′) complementary to the rabbit gelB gene promoter sequences between −71 and −91 and a reverse primer (BF1, 5′-CCT CAG TGG ATG TTG CCT TTA CTT-3′) specific to thelacZ gene. A positive result was ascertained by the presence of an amplified DNA band of 245 base pairs. The transgene in all cases was found to be incorporated into the germ line since it could be transmitted to offspring according to mendelian genetics, as determined by mating positive heterozygotes with wild-type CD-1 mice (data not shown). Adult transgenic mice (6–8 weeks old) as well as non-transgenic littermates were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 2% Avertin (0.017 ml/g of body weight). The back hair from the mice was shaved in a region of 1 cm2, and a full-thickness dermal wound (3–4 mm in diameter) was made using a pair of surgical scissors. Bactericidal ointment (Mycitracin, The Upjohn Co.) was applied to the wound, and the mice were allowed to recover under a warming lamp. The mice were sacrificed 1–3 days after surgery, and tissues were processed for β-gal staining or histology. A control region of hair was shaved and/or wounded prior to sacrifice. In this case, tissues were excised immediately and processed along with experimental tissues. For corneal surgery, New Zealand White rabbits (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used. Rabbits were prepared for surgery by anesthetizing with xylazine and ketamine. Residual reflexes were blocked by topical application of 0.5% proparacaine (Ophthatetic, Alcon, Dallas, TX). An 8-mm diameter circular demarcation was created in the central portion of one eye of each rabbit by gently pressing a trephine on the surface of the cornea. The epithelium within this zone was abraded with an algebrush (Storz Ophthalmic Instruments, St. Louis, MO) to expose the corneal basement membrane. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the eyes, and rabbits were allowed to recover from surgery. Rabbits were sacrificed 20 h after surgery at a time when the migrating epithelial sheet had almost resurfaced the corneal defect. A similar procedure was performed in CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories), except that the wound size was 1.5 mm in diameter and the mice were sacrificed 18.5 h after surgery. Embryos from staged matings between transgenic heterozygous mice and wild-type CD-1 mice were collected from sacrificed females, and tissues were fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, washed three times in PBS, and stained as whole mounts in buffered 2% X-gal solution at 30 °C for 5–12 h (40Wasserman P.M. DePhamphilis M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 319-374Google Scholar). Embryos past embryonic day 15 (E15) were cut sagittally in half and processed. Adult organs or tissues were surgically removed from the mice, cut into smaller pieces, and fixed and stained as described above. After staining, the tissues were washed in PBS, refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and photographed immediately. Some tissues were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned (6 μm), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To collect tissue to prepare nuclear extracts, rabbits were anesthetized, transferred to a cold room, and sacrificed by intracardiac injection of phenobarbital. The corneal epithelium within a 9-mm centrally demarcated region from wound-healing (six) eyes or uninjured (six) eyes was removed by abrasion with a No. 10 Bard Parker surgical bade. Tissue was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.6 ml of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm each dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, aprotinin, spermidine, antipain, and leupeptin. The pooled wound-healing epithelial tissue and separately pooled control tissue were homogenized on ice with the aid of a microcentrifuge homogenizer. The remaining steps essentially followed the procedure of Dignamet al. (42Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of equal protein were frozen at −70 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared from corneal epithelial cells in a similar manner. For EMSA, the double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the canonical DNA-binding sites for transcription factors AP-1 (5′-CGC TTG ATG ACC AGC CGG AA-3′), NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG-3′), Sp1 (5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG GGG GCG AGC-3′), and AP-2 (5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′) were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Two double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (RM70, 5′-GGA GGA CGT AGC CTG CGG GAG AGC CTC A-3′, and its complementary strand, RM71; and RM72, 5′-TCA AGG GTG GGC CTG GGG TGG CAC TCA-3′, and its complementary strand, RM73) that contain the two AP-2 DNA-binding sites from the upstream region of the gelB promoter (see Fig. 1) located between −412 and −420 and between −368 and −375, respectively, were used as probes in EMSA. Briefly, 0.03 pmol of radiolabeled DNA (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with equal amounts of nuclear extracts (1–2 μg) from tissues or cell cultures in a high salt DNA-binding buffer containing poly(dI-dC) (Promega). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. For supershift EMSA assays, protein-DNA complexes were incubated with antibodies for an additional 40 min and resolved by gel electrophoresis. Antibodies for supershifts were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Frozen serial sections of wound-healing mouse eyes were processed for immunostaining according to standard methods (44Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were diluted in PBS (anti-Sp1, 1:500; anti-AP-2, 1:100; and anti-NF-κB (p65), 1:500). An anti-fibronectin antibody, R61 (a gift from Dr. Richard Hynes, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), was diluted 1:400 in PBS. Sections were blocked in normal goat serum, and antibodies (or normal rabbit serum) were applied to the sections for a 3-h incubation at room temperature. After washing, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:50 in PBS) for 45 min and then washed again. Slides were photographed by epifluorescence. We recently demonstrated that the DNA sequence between bases −519 and +19 of the rabbit gelB gene promoter drives expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene transiently transfected into cultured cells in a manner similar to the endogenous gelB gene (37Fini M.E.

The base position at −519 interrupts an NF-κB-binding motif located between −522 and −514, which was shown to be important for human gene response to tumor necrosis factor-α (36Sato H. Seiki M Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we designed a new reporter gene construct for the current studies, Pr43, which includes 3 additional bases up to −522 (Fig. 1). We also replaced the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene with LacZ to facilitate localization of expressing cells and utilized a new cloning vector containing a neomycin aminoglucotransferase gene for selection of stably transformed cells. To analyze the relationship between endogenous gelB gene expression and promoter activity of Pr43 in parallel, we developed two stably transformed keratinocyte cell lines, SIRC-43 and PAM-43. When plated in culture wells at equal density, each cell line exhibited constitutive β-gal activity, but at different levels. When treated with TPA, a 2-fold induction of β-gal activity was observed in SIRC-43; a much larger 8-fold induction was observed in PAM-43 cells (Fig. 2, left panels). Zymographic analysis of conditioned media from the same cultures used for β-gal analysis revealed gelB in the proenzyme form. In the rabbit corneal epithelial cell line SIRC-43, gelB ran as a doublet of glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms with the same relative mo"

The binding of rGrb14 to insulin receptors is insulin-dependent in vivo in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing both proteins and importantly, in rat liver expressing physiological levels of proteins. However, rGrb14 is not a substrate of the tyrosine kinase of the receptor. In the two-hybrid system, two domains of rGrb14 can mediate the interaction with insulin receptors: the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a region between the PH and SH2 domains that we named PIR (forphosphorylated insulin receptor-interactingregion). In vitro interaction assays using deletion mutants of rGrb14 show that the PIR, but not the SH2 domain, is able to coprecipitate insulin receptors, suggesting that the PIR is the major binding domain of rGrb14. The interaction between rGrb14 and the insulin receptors is almost abolished by mutating tyrosine residue Tyr1150 or Tyr1151 of the receptor. The overexpression of rGrb14 in CHO-IR cells decreases insulin stimulation of both DNA and glycogen synthesis. These effects are accompanied by a decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, but insulin receptor autophosphorylation is unaltered. These findings suggest that rGrb14 could be a new downstream signaling component of the insulin-mediated pathways.

Insulin is the principal hormone controlling energy metabolism, by modulating metabolic pathways in different target tissues. The liver occupies a central position in the regulation of glucose homeostasis by insulin; insulin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and stimulates glycogen and lipid synthesis. On the other hand, insulin stimulates glucose transport and utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These actions of insulin are mediated through a membrane-bound receptor. The insulin receptor is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, members of which contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase, which is activated after ligand binding. The best characterized substrates of the insulin receptor are insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2),1 and Shc (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

They are all known to bind to the phosphorylated Tyr960 residue of the receptor via their phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (3Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell.

Unlike most receptor tyrosine kinases, tyrosine-phosphorylated residues of the insulin receptor do not seem to recruit directly a number of SH2-containing proteins. These proteins are recruited by IRSs, which are considered to be docking proteins, and by Shc (2Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Trends Endocrinol.

For example, IRS-1 interacts with the SH2 domains of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 and of the regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to activate this enzyme. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is likely to be implicated in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4, the isoform of glucose transporters expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (9Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19161-19164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at the present time, few other effectors of insulin signaling that could participate specifically in metabolic effects of insulin have been characterized. Shc and IRSs are ubiquitously expressed, not specifically in insulin-sensitive tissues, and they are also phosphorylated after activation of a number of receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors (8Bonfini L.

It is therefore possible that other proteins, possibly implicated more specifically in insulin signal transduction, might exist. Recently, different groups have reported the cloning of new proteins supposed to be involved in insulin signaling, since they have been identified by two-hybrid screening using the insulin receptor as bait (15Liu F.

Grb10 was originally cloned as a growth factor receptor-binding protein by interaction with the EGF receptor (22Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). It is a molecular adapter and a member of the recently emerged Grb7 family of proteins, which comprises Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 (23Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although its precise role remains to be clarified, Grb10 is likely to be implicated in insulin- and insulin-like growth factor-1-induced mitogenesis (16O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K.

To identify new proteins implicated in insulin signal transduction, we performed a two-hybrid screen of a rat liver cDNA library, using the activated cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor as bait. To favor the identification of metabolic effectors, the rat used for the construction of the liver cDNA library had been starved for 48 h and refed for 10 h with a diet designed to stimulate transcription of genes implicated in insulin-regulated metabolism. We have cloned a protein displaying a high homology with the human Grb14, a member of the Grb7 subfamily of adapters (24Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This protein was then called rGrb14. The data presented in this study suggest that rGrb14 is potentially a new effector of the insulin receptor. In addition, we have identified in rGrb14 a region different from the SH2 domain, which is the main binding domain with the Insulin receptor. This region, named PIR (for phosphorylated insulin receptor-interacting region), is homologous to the BPS domain recently described in Grb10 (26He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Synthetic defined dropout yeast media lacking the appropriate amino acids were obtained from Bio 101, Inc. (Vista, CA). Oligonucleotides were purchased at the Pasteur Institut (Paris, France) and Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10 clone) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pY20), and polyclonal antibodies against insulin receptor β-subunit were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-LexA and anti-Gal4 activation domain antibodies were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, Ca). Polyclonal anti-rGrb14 antibodies were raised against the N-terminal 17 amino acids of rGrb14 (Neosystem) and purified on protein A-Sepharose before use. All chemicals were from Sigma France, and enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The intracellular domains of the rat insulin receptor and of the human insulin receptor ATP binding site mutant (IR K1018A) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and inserted in frame at the BamHI site of the pLex9 plasmid (pLex-IR and pLex-IR K1018). Other insulin receptor mutants in pLex9 vector and pACTII-Shc construct were generated as described previously (4Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

The rGrb14 mutation of the arginine 464 into lysine (rGrb14 R464K) was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences and constructions were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed in the yeast strain L40 using on one hand pLexIR, which encodes a constitutively activated insulin receptor β-subunit (27O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and on the other hand an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library from rat liver, cloned in fusion with the Gal4 activation domain in the pGAD3S2X plasmid (gift from M. Cognet-Vasseur, INSERM U129, Paris, France). After transformation by the lithium acetate procedure (28Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar), yeasts were plated on a tryptophan-leucine-histidine-deficient medium. Colonies growing in the absence of histidine (the first reporter gene) were subsequently tested for β-galactosidase activity (second reporter gene). The plasmids of the library producing yeast colonies of a His+/LacZ+ phenotype were isolated, and the specificity of association of their products with insulin receptors was tested using pLex-lamin as negative control. The cDNA inserts of these positive plasmids were sequenced, using an Applied Biosystems sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). To determine and clone the 5′-end of the rGrb14 cDNA, the 5′-RACE technique was used on a rat liver Marathon-Ready premade cDNA library (CLONTECH), with the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH) and a primer 5′-GCGGCACACCTGCACTGCCAGC-3′ corresponding to the 5′ sequence determined on library cDNA insert, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We obtained a 250-base pair fragment, which was sequenced and corresponds to the 5′-end of the cDNA. Since the largest library plasmid was lacking only 21 nucleotides of coding sequence, a full-length cDNA containing KpnI and BamHI sites at both ends and a Myc epitope at the 3′-end was reconstructed by PCR with the Pfu polymerase using this plasmid as template and the two following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-CCGCGGTACCGGATCCCTACGATCATGACCACGTCCCTGCAAGATGGGCAGAGCGCCGCGGGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCGGTACCGGATCCGAGATCTTCCTCGCTGATTAGCTTCTGCTCAACAGCCATCCTAGCACAGTAATGC-3′). The sequence integrity of the full-length rGrb14 cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method of Gietz (28Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses of β-galactosidase activity were performed using a solution assay as described previously (29Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Tartare-Deckert S. Van Obberghen E. Girard J. Burnol A.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17166-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from rat tissues or the adipocyte cell line 3T3-F442A using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (31Burnol A.-F. Leturque A. Loizeau M. Postic C. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using as a probe a 32P-radiolabeled 500-base pair XbaI fragment corresponding to the 3′-end of the rGrb14 cDNA. Rat tissues and 3T3-F442A cells were homogenized in a sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). These cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-rGrb14 antibodies. rGrb14 cDNA was inserted into the KpnI site of the pECE vector (32Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Stable expression of rGrb14 was achieved in CHO-IR cell lines after cotransfection of the pE-rGrb14 plasmid with a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance by the calcium phosphate procedure. After limiting dilution, pure clones were identified by Northern blot analysis and Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody. We have used the clone 8A9 for CHO-IR/rGrb14 cells. Preliminary experiments have established that endogenous rGrb14 mRNA can be detected by Northern blot in CHO cells using the rat radiolabeled cDNA probe. Confluent CHO-IR cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and stimulated or not by insulin (10−7m) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized at 4 °C, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and a standard mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Boehringer Mannheim), in addition to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), 20 mmNaF, and 20 mm NaVO3. After a 15-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-IR, anti-rGrb14, or anti-IRS-1 antibodies in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vivo studies in rats, animals were starved for 24 h, anesthetized, and injected with saline or insulin via the saphenous vein. After 10 min, the liver proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as described above. GST fusion proteins were produced as described previously (29Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Tartare-Deckert S. Van Obberghen E. Girard J. Burnol A.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17166-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CHO-IR cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated or not stimulated with insulin (10−7m) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cell lysates (4 × 105 cells) were prepared as described above and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of immobilized GST fusion proteins. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by heating in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody, and immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [14C]Glucose incorporation into glycogen and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA were measured as described previously (33Leconte I. Auzan C. Debant A. Rossi B. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17415-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of insulin for 1 h prior to incubation with 2 μCi of [14C]glucose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h. After two phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were lysed with 30% KOH, and the endogenous [14C]glycogen was precipitated and counted for radioactivity. After 72 h of serum depletion, cells were treated for 16 h with increasing concentrations of insulin and then exposed to 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min. After three phosphate-buffered saline washes, the DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloracetic acid, and the radioactive material was dissolved in 1 m NaOH and counted. Seven million independent yeast colonies were tested; 104 clones contained plasmids encoding proteins that exhibited a specific interaction with the insulin receptor β-subunit and not with the kinase-inactive insulin receptor mutated in the ATP binding site (IR K1018A) or with unrelated proteins like lamin. After DNA sequencing, these specific clones were classified into six different groups encoding distinct proteins (Fig. 1). Three of these proteins were already described as interacting with the insulin receptor: p85α, p85β, and Shc p52 (3Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell.

Other clones encode the C terminus domain of a splice variant of SH2B, an Src homology-2 domain-containing adapter (40Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell.

Clones encoding the full-length Grb7 were also found. Grb7 is a molecular adapter, first isolated by interaction with the EGF receptor (42Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C.

Another group corresponds to 14 plasmids containing inserts of the same cDNA, varying in length from 0.9 to 2.0 kb. This cDNA is the subject of the present study. The longest insert encodes a 531-amino acid protein, which lacks its N terminus. The missing sequence was cloned and identified using the 5′-RACE technique. The full-length protein is 538 amino acids long, as shown in Fig. 2 A. The first methionine codon was unambiguously identified by its fairly good context for initiating translation (43Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) and by the presence of an in frame stop codon 21 nucleotides upstream. This new protein is an adapter, characterized by the succession of various interacting domains: a central PH domain, a C terminus SH2 domain, and a proline-rich region in the N terminus of the protein. GenBankTM data base searches revealed significant homology of this protein with the Grb7 family of proteins (including Grb14, Grb7, Grb10, Grb-IR, and Grb10-IR/SV1; the last three are spliced variants of the same gene (16O'Neill T.J.

The percentage of amino acid identity of the different domains of this protein with members of the Grb7 family is schematized on Fig. 2 B. Given the high identity with the amino acid sequence of the human Grb14 (see Fig. 2 B) and the homology in nucleotide sequence with the human Grb14 (83%), it is likely that this protein is the rat variant of human Grb14. It was therefore named rGrb14. The tissue distribution of rGrb14 was studied by Northern and Western blot analysis. The main transcript is approximately 2.5 kb long, and a second smaller transcript (1.9 kb) is also present in some tissues, as shown in Fig. 3 A. rGrb14 mRNAs are expressed in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, brain, and white adipose tissue. On Western blot, the rGrb14 protein is a 60-kDa band, which is specifically displaced by preincubation of the antibodies with the antigenic peptide. The protein is present in liver, heart, and brain (Fig. 3 B) and can also be detected in skeletal muscle (data not shown). Thus, the expression of rGrb14 seems to be restricted to insulin target tissues and brain. This does not fully correlate with the human Grb14, which is also expressed in kidney and placenta (24Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the adipose cell line 3T3-F442A, rGrb14 mRNA are absent in undifferentiated fibroblasts (Fig. 3 C). After confluence, when fibroblasts begin to differentiate in adipose cells, there is a slight increase in rGrb14 mRNA expression. Maximum accumulation of rGrb14 mRNA is observed in fully differentiated adipose cells, 8 days after confluence. A similar pattern of expression was observed at the protein level (Fig. 3 D), indicating that rGrb14 may be considered as a marker of adipose cell differentiation. In the same cells, Grb7 mRNA expression did not vary with the differentiation state (data not shown). Thus, the parallelism between the level of expression and adipose cell differentiation is specific for rGrb14 among members of the Grb7 family of proteins. The rGrb14-insulin receptor interaction was first investigated in CHO-IR cells (expressing high levels of human insulin receptors) stably overexpressing a Myc-tagged rGrb14 recombinant protein. CHO-IR/rGrb14 cell lysate was either immunoprecipitated using anti-insulin receptor antibodies and immunodetected with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 4 A) or immunoprecipitated using anti-rGrb14 antibodies and immunodetected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 4 B). Under basal conditions, rGrb14 is not coprecipitated with the insulin receptors. After stimulation by insulin, the association of the activated receptors with rGrb14 is induced. The association between the insulin receptor and rGrb14 was also investigated in rat liver. Anesthetized rats were injected intravenously with insulin or saline, and after 10 min, liver proteins were extracted and immunodetected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In liver crude extracts, insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of three major proteins of 180, 95, and 50 kDa (Fig. 4 C, left part). Immunoblotting with corresponding antibodies confirmed that the 180- and 95-kDa bands are, respectively, IRS-1 and the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (data not shown). These liver extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-rGrb14 antibodies prior to immunodetection with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in the right part of Fig. 4 C, insulin stimulates the association between rGrb14 and the activated insulin receptors in rat liver. These experiments clearly show that rGrb14 binds to the activated insulin receptors, not only in two overexpressing systems (the two-hybrid system and the CHO-IR/rGrb14 cell line) but also in cells expressing physiological levels of both insulin receptors and rGrb14. In insulin-stimulated liver, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 is also detected in the anti-rGrb14 immunoprecipitate. rGrb14 is not revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in CHO-IR/rGrb14 cells or rat liver lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-rGrb14 antibodies (Fig. 4,B and C). Thus, rGrb14 is not a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In the two-hybrid system, a kinase-inactive insulin receptor mutant (K1018A, mutated in the ATP binding site) was unable to interact with either rGrb14 or Shc, an insulin receptor substrate taken as control (Fig. 5) (27O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This underlines the importance of the receptor activation for the interaction between the insulin receptors and rGrb14. To identify the tyrosyl residues of the insulin receptor that are necessary for this association, we measured the interaction between rGrb14 and insulin receptors mutated"

NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) is an essential subunit of the NMDA receptor and is developmentally expressed in postnatal neurons of the central nervous system. Here we identify on the NR1 promoter a binding site for myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), a developmentally expressed neuron/muscle transcription factor found in cerebrocortical neurons, and study its regulation of the NR1 gene. Co-expression of MEF2C and Sp1 cDNAs in primary neurons or cell lines synergistically activates the NR1 promoter.

The NMDA1 subtype of glutamate receptor plays an important role in normal brain development as well as in long term potentiation (thought to be important for some forms of learning and memory). However, in a variety of pathologic conditions, including stroke, central nervous system (CNS) trauma, and various neurodegenerative disorders, overactivation of NMDA receptors contributes to neuronal injury or death (1Choi D.W.

As in muscle development, the genes that encode MEF2 proteins are expressed during brain development in spatially and temporally specific patterns, consistent with the idea that they function in neuronal differentiation as well (22Leifer D.

The NR1 promoter also has a MEF2 site (TTATTTATTTAG, −805 to −796) upstream of its tandem Sp1 sites (−297 to −272) (13Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test the function of MEF2C on the expression of neuronal genes, we studied transcriptional regulation of the NR1 gene. Here we show that the synergistic action of ubiquitous and tissue-restricted transcription factors, mediated by an unexpectedly strong protein interaction between MEF2C and Sp1, imparts a specific pattern of expression to the neuronal NR1 gene. Similar interactions may apply to a broad range of neuronal genes during brain development. All reporter constructs were prepared as described previously (19Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

For mutation of MEF2C, a megaprimer was synthesized with GB81 (5′-GTCTATcgcTAAATAAATAACACCAAATTC-3′) and an upstream primer GB78 (5′-CCTAGAAGGTACCACTCTATGGTAG-3′), covering a native KpnI site at −919. The megaprimer was used in the secondary PCR with GB79 (5′-GGTACACTCTAGAGGCTGAGATAGG-3′) encompassing XbaI at −731. PCR products were cloned into a pGEM vector (Promega) and confirmed by sequencing. The MEF2C mutant was removed withKpnI/XbaI from pGEM-T and used to replace the relevant sequence of pNRL919 (19Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

Normalization for transfection efficiency was performed in all experiments on the basis of β-galactosidase activity (22Leifer D. Krainc D., Yu, Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal G.B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). P19 cells were co-transfected with dominant-negative MEF2C cDNA in pGK/DN or vector (pGK) with a neomycin resistance gene containing plasmid, pSV/neo (CLONTECH) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as above. Stable transfectant clones were screened with 200 μg/ml geneticin (G418), and MEF2C binding activity was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). P19 cells bearing pGK/DN (P19/DN) or pGK (P19/CV) were differentiated with 300 nm 13-cis-retinoic acid. 2S. Okamoto, K. Sherman, and S. A. Lipton, manuscript submitted for publication. Stable transfectants of PC12 cells bearing the NR1 promoter/luciferase gene were established (19Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and treated as described previously with 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor or 50 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor for 4 h before harvesting for the luciferase assays (19Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Martin J.F. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). DNA content in cell lysates was measured with Hoechst dye 33258 on a TKO 100 fluorometer following the manufacture's protocol (Hoefer Scientific Instrument). Copy numbers of integrated fusion genes in stable PC12 transfectants were measured using a slot blot assay as described previously (44Nemer M. Bai G. Stuebing E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10851-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracted genomic DNA was quantified both by absorbency at 260 nm and by Hoechst dye 33258. One or two μg of extracted DNA were blotted onto a nylon membrane. Various amounts of pGEM-Luc (Promega) served as standards. Two μg of salmon sperm DNA were used as a carrier. pGEM3Z plasmid and salmon sperm DNA were used as blank controls. A luciferase cDNA fragment (XbaI/EcoR V, 1296 base pairs) was radiolabeled by random primer extension in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and used to probe for the luciferase gene on blots. After stringent washing, blots were analyzed using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of luciferase gene in each DNA sample was calculated based on the linear signal of standard luciferase cDNA on each blot. Copy numbers among pooled PC12 cell lines were similar to each other. Total RNA was extracted from stably transfected P19 cells using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). NR1 mRNA was measured with a reverse transcriptase-PCR using a PCR MIMIC kit (CLONTECH). For synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, 1 μg of RNA was annealed with an NR1 3′ primer (GTCATTGATGCCTGTGATGC) and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3′ primer (TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA, CLONTECH). The cDNA synthesis was carried out using avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C for 1 h and stopped at 95 °C for 5 min. Then, 5′ primers of NR1 (GTCCTCTGCCATGTGGTTTT) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC) were added to Hot Tub polymerase (Amersham) for 30 cycles on a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler as follows: 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 1 s. An oligo(dT)-primed activation-tagged cDNA expression library was constructed from 22-week-old human frontal cortex, as described previously (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The library contains 3.5 × 106 clones, >80% of which have a cDNA insert between 1 and 2 kilobase pairs; one-third of its members express a fusion protein containing a COOH-terminal with an acidic activation domain in a vector that allows galactose-inducible expression of the resulting fusion protein. We used a selection strain that contained2LexAop-LEU2 and 2LexAop-LacZ reporters and a LexA fusion bait with the amino-terminal 86 residues of MEF2C (LexA-MEF2C1–86), which comprise the DNA-binding region of the protein. Although this bait could activate transcription in haploids, we found that this background transcription could be reduced by using a diploid yeast strain. The vector pJG4-5 expresses library-encoded proteins under the control of a galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter fused to a nuclear localization sequence, a hemagglutinin epitope tag, and a B42 activation domain. An interaction-trap selection was performed in a diploid yeast strain (EGY191xRFY206) which contains two reporters: a 2opLexA-LEU2 construct that replaced the yeast chromosomal LEU2 gene and an episomal 2opLexA-Gal1-LacZ gene. This strain was transformed with the brain interaction library using the lithium acetate method (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) and with the “bait” LexA-MEF2C1–86. Full-length MEF2C could not be used because it strongly activated the reporters on its own. Isolated cDNAs were sorted into 12 classes based on their restriction mapping pattern. Partial sequence analysis of one class showed that these plasmids contained independent cDNAs derived from the sameSp1 mRNA. Full-length Sp1 was then reintroduced into the EGY-48 yeast strain that contained an 8opLacZ reporter gene and a 6opLexA-LEU2 gene. Alternatively, full-length MEF2C was cloned into a pJG-45 activation vector and introduced into the EGY-48 strain together with LexA-Sp1 or a panel of unrelated baits. Activation of the LacZ reporter was determined in β-galactosidase assays (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) using the EGY48 yeast strain. Activation of the LEU2 reporter was determined by observing the growth rate of yeast colonies on complete minimal medium lacking leucine. The ability of the LexA-fusion to bind operator DNA was confirmed by a repression assay (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). We also verified that all LexA and B42 fusions were expressed at similar levels by immunoblotting with an antibody to LexA or to the hemagglutinin epitope tag on the B42 fusion vector (data not shown). The K d of the MEF2C/Sp1 interaction is comparable to measured j values for large stretches of DNA (j = 10−8m for 104 bases) (46Shore D. Langowski J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 47Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling and precipitations were performed as described previously (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), except that cells were lysed in 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μg/ml pepstatin for 45 min at 4 °C. Pellets were run on 10% SDS-gels. For V8 mapping, bands were excised and partially digested in the gel with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Products, including those resulting from digestion of in vitro translated MEF2C, were separated on 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In vitro translation of MEF2C was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The DNA-binding assays were carried out as described previously (22Leifer D. Krainc D., Yu, Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal G.B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts of rat cerebrocortical cultures after 7 days in vitro were also prepared according to a previously described method (19Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The incubation reaction contained 0.2 ng of the probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 100 ng of a single-stranded oligonucleotide. The core nucleotide sequence of the probes and competitor DNAs used in binding assays were as follows: NR1-MEF2, 5′-TATTTATTTATAGACA-3′; MEF2 5′-GCCTCTAAAAATAACCCT- 3′; MEF2mt, 5′-GCCTCTAAACATAACCCT-3′. Sp1 antiserum was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Our previous results had demonstrated that Sp1 protein in crude cell extracts binds to the tandem Sp1 sites in the proximal region of the promoter of theNR1 gene (19Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we identified a sequence, TTATTTATAG (positions −805 to −796), in this promoter (13Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which matches the consensus of the MEF2 motif (C/T)TA(A/T)4TA(G/A) (48Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Using an EMSA, we tested whether this putative site can be functionally bound by nuclear proteins in embryonic cerebrocortical neurons. As shown in Fig. 1, an A/T-rich sequence (positions −808 to −793) encompassing the MEF2 site in theNR1 promoter specifically formed a slowly migrating complex (lane 1). This complex was abrogated by competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled MEF2C consensus oligonucleotide (lane 2), but not by a similar concentration of previously characterized MEF2 mutant oligonucleotide (lane 3) (22Leifer D. Krainc D., Yu, Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal G.B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To further identify the complex, we used a MEF2C-specific antibody that does not cross-react with other MEF2 proteins (22Leifer D. Krainc D., Yu, Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal G.B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This antibody diminished this complex (lane 5) and confirmed that the putative MEF2 site in the NR1 gene is recognized by MEF2C. However, even at high antibody concentrations, part of the complex still remained (lane 5), suggesting the possible involvement of other members of the MEF2 family. We next examined the contribution of MEF2C and Sp1 in the transcription of the NR1 gene. We co-transfected MEF2C and/or Sp1 cDNAs with an NR1 promoter luciferase reporter in Drosophila SL2 cells which lack proteins related to mammalian MEF2C and Sp1 (49Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The NR1 promoter, designated pNRL919, contains the MEF2 site and the tandem Sp1 sites. Sp1 alone activated the reporter 40-fold, whereas MEF2C stimulated expression less than 10-fold (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, co-expression of MEF2C plus Sp1 stimulated reporter expression >140-fold, which is at least 2.8 times the additive activities of these two factors, indicating a synergistic effect. This synergism was mildly decreased either after co-expression of Sp1 with mutated MEF2C R24L, which does not bind to DNA (34Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), or after co-transfection of MEF2C and Sp1 with a promoter-reporter containing a mutation in the MEF2 site (pNRL919mtMEF2). These findings suggest that, after overexpression, MEF2C may act through protein-protein interactions with Sp1 rather than solely through DNA binding to the MEF2 site in order to produce the synergistic effect. Consistent with this notion, deletion of Sp1 domains A and C, which are responsible for protein interactions, or mutation of the Sp1 sites in this promoter, strongly reduced not only the basal level of promoter activity, but also the MEF2C-Sp1 synergism (Fig. 2). However, in the absence of Sp1 protein, mutation of the MEF2 site (pNRL919mtMEF2) or MEF2C protein (MEF2C-R24L) resulted in a 50% reduction of the reporter activity (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the MEF2 site also contributes to the basal activity of the NR1 promoter. In an attempt to directly confirm interactions between MEF2C and Sp1 protein, we used a two-hybrid system (50Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) as described by Gyuriset al. (45Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-8"

The native enzymes in membranes from Group A Streptococcus pyogenes HAS and Group CStreptococcus equisimilis HAS were compared with the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia colimembranes. Based on their amino acid sequences, the masses of these four proteins as monomers are ∼48 kDa. In all cases, loss of enzyme activity was a simple single exponential function with increasing radiation dose. The functional sizes calculated from these data were identical for the four HASs at ∼64 kDa. In contrast, the sizes of the proteins estimated by the loss of antibody reactivity on Western blots were essentially identical at 41 kDa for the four HAS species, consistently lower than the functional size by ∼23 kDa. Matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of purified S. pyogenes HAS-H6 and S. equisimilis HAS-H6 gave masses that differed by <0.07% from the predicted monomer sizes, which confirms that neither protein is posttranslationally modified or covalently attached to another protein. Ongoing studies indicate that the purified HAS enzymes require cardiolipin (CL) for maximal activity and stability. When irradiated membranes were detergent solubilized and the extracts were incubated with exogenous CL, the residual level of HAS activity increased. Consequently, the calculated functional size decreased by ∼23 kDa to the expected size of the HAS monomer. The ∼23-kDa larger size of the functional HAS enzyme, compared with the HAS monomer, is due, therefore, to CL molecules.

Hyaluronan (HA)1 is a linear heteropolysaccharide composed of the repeating disaccharideN-acetyl-d-glucosamine-β(1→4)-d-glucuronic acid-β(1→3). This relatively simple polysaccharide is found throughout the vertebrate phyla in almost every tissue. HA is an almost general component of extracellular matrices and is present in large amounts to serve specialized purposes in cartilage, synovial fluid, dermis, and the vitreous humor of the eye (1Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B.G. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 2Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 3Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 4Lesley J. Kincade P.R. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). This glycosaminoglycan plays critical roles during fertilization, embryogenesis, development, and differentiation. HA is also found in several bacteria, notably Streptococcus Group A and Group C strains, as an external capsule that contributes to bacterial pathogenicity (5Wessels M.R. Moses A.E. Goldberg J.B. DiCesare T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Schmidt K.H. Gunther E. Courtney H.S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 184: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The HA capsule helps these organisms evade the host immune response. Although HA was discovered in 1934 (7Meyer K. Palmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 107: 629-634Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the enzyme responsible for HA biosynthesis was not identified until the Group A HAS gene was cloned in 1993 (8DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HA synthases have at least three unique features that distinguish them from almost all of the previously characterized and cloned glycosyltransferases (9Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). First, although most glycosyltransferases are endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membrane proteins, only HAS is active at the plasma membrane in both bacteria and eukaryotes (10Philipson L.H. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5017-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This unusual localization for a biosynthetic enzyme is related to the second unusual feature, namely, that the product (HA) is extruded into the extracellular space, while the growing HA chain remains bound to the enzyme (12Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6252-6261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two substrate sugar nucleotides are presumably made and delivered to the active sites of the enzyme in the cytoplasm. HA chain release typically occurs after >20,000 monosaccharides (>4 × 106 Da) have been assembled. We presently view this HA extrusion process as requiring the enzyme to form a pore- or channel-like pocket to guide the hydrophilic HA chain through the lipid bilayer. Third, the HA synthase assembles a heteropolysaccharide composed of two alternating sugars. Other polysaccharide synthases that make homopolymers with a single linkage, such as cellulose or chitin, could have a single active site. HA synthases must have the ability to bind two different substrates and to catalyze the formation of two different glycoside bonds. The hyaluronan synthases from Group A and Group CStreptococcus are the smallest enzymes (419 and 417 amino acids, respectively) in the HA synthase family (13Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), which now includes at least three related mammalian enzymes that are ∼40% larger (14Itano N.

Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and an even larger enzyme fromPasteurella multocida (21DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The first member of this family to be cloned was spHAS. A surprising finding in the early studies of spHAS was that HA synthesis required only the single gene product, the purified HAS protein (8DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Many investigators in the field expected that heteropolysaccharide biosynthesis would probably require at least two different enzymes, each catalyzing one of the necessary glycosyltransferase reactions. Other proteins in the bacterial HA synthesis operon are only required to produce large enough quantities of the two sugar nucleotides, UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, so that the enzyme can create an HA capsule without crippling the ability of the bacterial cell to grow and divide (24Crater D.L. Van De Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 225-229PubMed Google Scholar). These latter processes require cell wall synthesis, which uses large amounts of UDP-GlcNAc. Recombinant spHAS, or the recently cloned seHAS (26Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), requires only the two substrates, but no other proteins, to polymerize HA chains of >5 × 106 Da within 5–10 min (23DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to determine whether the streptococcal HAS proteins function as monomers or oligomers during HA biosynthesis. Radiation inactivation analysis is a powerful and general method to determine the functional size (molecular mass) of proteins (27Kempner E.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A single radiation “hit” by high-energy electrons destroys the entire polypeptide, yielding multiple fragments. Because the probability of destroying a particular macromolecule is proportional to the radiation dose and the size (mass) of the target, one can calculate the mass from the relationship between the radiation dose and the extent of inactivation. The method has been used to characterize a variety of membrane receptors, transporters, and enzymes (28Ross A.C. Kempner E.S. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Via D.P. Kempner E.S. Pons L. Fanslow A.E. Vignale S. Smith L.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Dresel H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and has the advantage that it can be applied to membranes in the absence of detergents. Therefore, the functional size of a membrane protein in its natural environment can be assessed. In this study, we have used radiation inactivation of streptococcal membranes and mass spectrometry analysis of purified HAS to determine the size of the active HA-synthesizing species. In all cases the results support the conclusion that the active enzyme is a monomer, rather than a dimer or oligomer, of the HAS protein in complex with CL. Nonradiolabeled sugar nucleotides were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) or Sigma. Other reagents, including Escherichia coli CL, were supplied by Sigma unless stated otherwise. Media components were from Difco. Mucoid group A Streptococcus pyogenes S43/192/4 and group C Streptococcus equisimilis D181 were obtained from the Rockefeller University (New York, NY) collection. The E. coli host strain Sure Cells were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pKK223-3 vector was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Recombinant HAS open reading frames from S. pyogenes and S. equisimilis (26Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were cloned into pKK223-3 as described (23DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H.

The pKK223-3 vector contains a strong tac promoter that can be regulated by thelac repressor and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. To facilitate purification of the spHAS protein, a C-terminal fusion of 6-His residues was introduced into each construct using synthetic oligonucleotides and standard polymerase chain reaction techniques. A similar seHAS-H6 was used only for the MALDI-TOF MS experiments. The coding sequences of clones selected for extensive study were completely sequenced to verify that no changes had occurred. Membranes fromS. pyogenes and S. equisimilis were obtained by modifications of a protoplast method (31van de Rijn I. Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24302-24306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as reported previously (23DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The membranes from E. coli were isolated by a variation of the protoplast method of Ito et al. (32Ito K. Sato T. Yura T. Cell. 1977; 11: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sure cells containing the HAS-encoding plasmids were grown at 30 °C in Luria broth containing 50 mm glucose and trace elements (33Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley and Sons, West Sussex, England1990: 1-358Google Scholar) to an A 600 of 1.2. The cells were then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 3000 × g, washed twice with PBS containing 10% glycerol, and then frozen at −80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended to 1% of the original culture volume in 20% sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. Lysozyme (4 mg/ml) in 0.1m EDTA, pH 8 (0.1% culture volume), was added, and the suspension was incubated for 40 min on ice with constant mixing. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added to a concentration of 46 μg/ml, and the suspension was sonicated on ice three times for 30 s each at 20 watts with a microtip probe (W-380; Heat Systems Ultrasonic, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). MgCl2, DNase, and RNase were added to final concentrations of 60 mm, 1 μg/ml, and 1 μg/ml, respectively. After 20 min on ice with constant mixing, debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The lysate was diluted 2-fold in PBS containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and the above protease inhibitors before the membranes were harvested at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was resuspended once with PBS containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and the above protease inhibitors and recentrifuged. The final pellet was stored at −80 °C. Membranes containing native or recombinant HAS were resuspended to >3 mg/ml protein in a cryobuffer containing 50 mmbis-[2-hydroxyethyl]imino-tris-[hydroxymethyl]methane, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. Yeast G6PDH was added to the membrane samples to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml as an internal standard. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the samples were frozen in dry ice in 2-ml ampoules and then sealed with an acetylene torch. Sealed samples were kept at −80 °C until they were irradiated at −135 °C with 10-MeV electrons as described by Harmonet al. (34Harmon J.T. Nielsen T.B. Kempner E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After the samples were irradiated, the frozen vials were opened, purged with nitrogen gas, and thawed, and the membrane suspension was used for enzyme assays. Aliquots were refrozen for later SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Additional controls also verified that HAS activity was not significantly affected by the number of freeze-thaw cycles needed to perform these inactivation studies. For example, after freezing and thawing membranes twice, the spHAS activity was 90% of the control. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred, using a Bio-Rad mini Transblot device, to nitrocellulose (0.1 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) at 90 V for 2 h in buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.01% SDS as described by Towbinet al. (35Towbin H. Steahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). The blots were briefly air dried and visualized with 0.05% of the reversible stain copper (II)-phthalocyanine-3,4′,4"",4‴-tetrasulfonic acid (Aldrich) in 12 mm HCl. The blots were then photographed, destained with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and blocked by incubation at 4 °C overnight with 5% (w/v) BSA in the same buffer with 0.01% Tween 20 and 0.05% sodium azide. This latter buffer was used for the blocking, washing, and antibody incubations. The blots were incubated with a specific antipeptide polyclonal rabbit IgG (directed against the sequence E171RSDADVFLTVDSDT common to both HAS enzymes; (23DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) for 1 h and washed five times at 5 min each. The blots were then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 1 h, washed as above, and developed using p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluline salt (Bio-Rad) to visualize the bound primary antibody. Samples were assayed for HAS activity in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.05% BSA, 15% glycerol, either 1.5 mm (for spHAS) or 1.0 mm (for seHAS) UDP-GlcNAc, 1 mm UDP-GlcA, and 0.8 μm UDP-[14C]GlcA (267 mCi/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). To initiate the enzymatic reaction, a constant amount of membrane protein (in the range of 2–3 μg) was added, and the mixtures were gently mixed using a micromixer (Taitec Inst. USA, Inc., San Jose, CA) at 30 °C. Samples were taken from 2 to 60 min, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Incorporation of [14C]GlcA into high molecular weight HA product was measured (23DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) by descending paper chromatography using Whatman No. 3MM, developed in 1m ammonium acetate (pH 5.5)/ethanol (7:13). The Km values for UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc were determined by varying the concentration of UDP-GlcNAc from 0.01 to 3.0 mm at a constant concentration of UDP-GlcA (1 mm) and by varying the concentration of UDP-GlcA from 0.03 to 1.0 mm at a constant UDP-GlcNAc concentration of 1.5 mm (for spHAS) or 1.0 mm (for seHAS). The incorporation of substrate was monitored as described above, taking five time points to determine initial rates of reaction. Assays were performed under conditions of linearity with time and protein concentration. spHAS-H6 or seHAS-H6 was extracted from membranes and affinity purified, as will be described elsewhere. 2V. L. Tlapak-Simmons, B. A. Baggenstoss, K. Kumari, T. Clyne, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. The purified spHAS-H6/seHAS-H6 was eluted in 100 mm histidine, pH 7.7, containing 0.05% (w/v) DDM and diluted in a microcentrifuge tube 1:1 with 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid containing 0.1 μg/μl glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which was used as a carrier protein to prevent the synthase from sticking to the walls of the tube. In some experiments the carrier protein could be eliminated by eluting the enzyme with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.016% DDM, which resulted in a more concentrated eluate. One microliter of diluted spHAS-H6/seHAS-H6 was spotted onto an MS target plate followed by 1 μl of saturated sinapinic acid in 25% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The spot was then allowed to air dry. MS analysis was performed in the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center National Science Foundation EPSCoR Laser Mass Spectrometry Facility. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer used was a Voyager Elite (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with an N2 laser (337 nm). Samples were analyzed in the linear, positive ion mode with a delayed extraction of 250 ns and were subjected to a 25-kV accelerating voltage. All mass determinations were based on external and/or internal calibrations using two standard proteins: horse apomyoglobin and BSA, which have molecular masses of 16,951 and 66,432 Da, respectively. G6PDH was assayed as described by Kempner et al. (36Kempner E.S. Miller J.H. McCreery M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in 300 μl of 56 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 3.4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP, and 3.3 mm glucose-6-phosphate. The linear rate of change in A 340 at 25 °C was recorded before and after the addition of substrate. Any blank rate was subtracted from the observed rate, thereby yielding the specific rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The residual enzyme activity (A) for each membrane sample was normalized to that of the nonirradiated control (A o). The fraction of the remaining activity (A/A o) is displayed as a logrithmic function of radiation dose. The data were analyzed by a least squares linear regression fit according to the equation: A/A o =e (−), where kis the slope and D is the radiation dose in rads. The target size of the functional enzyme is calculated in daltons from the following equation (37Pestka S. Kelder B. Familletti P.C. Moschera J.A. Crowl R. Kempner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9706-9709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): target size = 1.792 × 1012 (k). Correlation coefficients were typically at least −0.90. SDS-PAGE reagents were the standard Laemmli formulation (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was assayed with Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. Radioactivity was determined in Packard Instrument Co. Ultima Gold scintillation fluid using a Packard 42300 scintillation spectrometer. Because both the spHAS and seHAS genes have been cloned, we were able to examine the recombinant enzymes expressed in E. colimembranes, as well as the native proteins in streptococcal membranes. In this study we use the term native to refer to the wild-type HAS protein expressed in Streptococcus membranes; the naturally occurring situation. After irradiation of membrane samples, the activity of HAS decreased, but the residual enzyme kinetics remained linear (Fig. 1). The validity of interpreting radiation inactivation data depends on the normal kinetic behavior of surviving enzyme molecules in the irradiated membrane samples. To apply the simplest theory of radiation inactivation, it is necessary to verify that the residual enzyme activity is not altered in its kinetic properties, except for a reducedV max. In addition to retaining linearity (Fig. 1), all of the irradiated HAS membrane samples demonstrated essentially unchanged K m values for the UDP-sugar substrates (Table I), indicating that the surviving HAS molecules were able to function normally. The decrease in V max with radiation dose was, therefore, suitable for a simple target analysis of enzyme inactivation.Table IEffect of radiation on the Michealis-Menten constants for spHAS and seHASSubstrateNative spHASRecombinant spHAS-H6Native seHASRecombinant seHAS0 Mrad24 Mrad0 Mrad24 Mrad0 Mrad24 Mrad0 Mrad24 MradKm(μm)Km (μm)Km(μm)Km (μm)UDP-GlcA36 ± 537 ± 239 ± 237 ± 372 ± 970 ± 673 ± 669 ± 9UDP-GlcNAc151 ± 2153 ± 4156 ± 9150 ± 170 ± 772 ± 271 ± 774 ± 14HAS activity in purified nonirradiated and irradiated membranes was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to determine the K m for each sugar nucleotide substrate.

Open table in a new tab HAS activity in purified nonirradiated and irradiated membranes was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to determine the K m for each sugar nucleotide substrate. Typically, ∼40% of the initial HAS activity remained after irradiation at the 24-megarad (Mrad) dose. The activity of spHAS in either streptococcal or E. colimembranes demonstrated identical single exponential decay curves when exposed to increasing radiation doses (Fig. 2). The results from a number of experiments are summarized in Table II. Based on inactivation of enzyme activity in three separate experiments, the functional size of the native spHAS ranged from 48 to 64 kDa. The average target size was 58 ± 9 kDa. The target size of the recombinant spHAS in E. coli membranes ranged from 60 to 80 kDa in seven experiments. The average target size was 67 ± 8 kDa.Table IIRadiation inactivation analyses of Group A spHASExp.Recombinant spHAS-H6 (E.c.)Native spHAS (S.p.)G6PDHActivityWesternActivityWesternG6PDH164 ± 9 (n = 10)32210460 ± 3 (n = 9)57 (n = 2)48 ± 5 (n = 7)44 (n = 2)104310361 ± 2 (n = 8)36 (n = 2)414266 (n = 2)45 (n = 2)64 (n = 2)41 (n = 2)119514364 (n = 2)45 (n = 2)62 (n = 2)40 (n = 2)119614277 (n = 2)28 (n = 2)713880 (n = 2)25 (n = 2)129 ± 20 (n = 6)67 ± 8 (n = 35)38 ± 11 (n = 13)58 ± 9 (n = 11)42 ± 2 (n = 6)114 ± 9 (n = 3)Isolated membranes were irradiated and then subjected to Western blot and enzyme activity analyses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average target sizes of the active species for native or recombinant spHAS were not significantly different at ∼63 kDa. Although the average sizes of the native and recombinant spHAS proteins were also identical at ∼40 kDa; this value is substantially smaller than the active enzyme species. Open table in a new tab Isolated membranes were irradiated and then subjected to Western blot and enzyme activity analyses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average target sizes of the active species for native or recombinant spHAS were not significantly different at ∼63 kDa. Although the average sizes of the native and recombinant spHAS proteins were also identical at ∼40 kDa; this value is substantially smaller than the active enzyme species. The native spHAS protein contains 419 amino acids and has a calculated mass of 47,774 Da (23DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The calculated mass for spHAS-H6 is 1.9% greater at 48,677 Da. For purposes of affinity purification, the recombinant spHAS has a C-terminal His6 tail that does not affect HA synthase activity. The radiation inactivation results indicate that the native and recombinant spHAS proteins have essentially identical functional sizes that correspond more closely to a monomer rather than a dimer of HAS (which has a predicted size of ∼97 kDa). Although the average calculated target size of ∼63 kDa for the active HAS is ∼30% larger than expected for a monomer, it is inconsistent with the active species being a homodimer. The larger-than-expected size for active spHAS indicates that additional mass of ∼15 kDa is required for enzyme activity. This extra mass could be even greater (by ∼8 kDa) based on the observed HAS sizeversus the calculated size (see below). The recently cloned seHAS (26Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was also examined by radiation inactivation, using the recombinant seHAS expressed in E. coli membranes and the native enzyme in Group C streptococcal membranes (Fig. 3 and Table III). The Group C HAS contains 417 amino acids (47,778 Da) and is 70% identical in primary sequence to the Group A enzyme. In four experiments, the native seHAS functional size ranged from 47 to 69 kDa, with an average of 62 ± 10 kDa. The recombinant seHAS indicated a target size of 72 ± 8 kDa in four experiments. Again, the functional sizes of the native or recombinant seHAS enzymes (average of ∼67 kDa) were not significantly different from each other or from the sizes observed for the spHAS enzymes. These data indicate that the functional unit of both streptococcal HA synthases contains a single copy, rather than multiple copies, of the HAS protein. As i"

Following activation of the IGF-I receptor, the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositide 3′-kinase (PI3′K) pathways are activated and result in cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In this study, we analyzed the IGF-I effect on the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity using human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 293 cells transiently expressing hemagglutinin-JNK, and 293 cells stably expressing a hemagglutinin-JNK transgene. In all cell types, endogenous or transfected JNK activity was strongly stimulated by anisomycin or tumor necrosis factor-α, and 10 nm IGF-I pretreatment suppressed the induced JNK activity. To determine whether the effect of IGF-I on JNK activity involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase or PI3′K pathway, we used the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 and the PI3′K inhibitor LY 294002. PD098059 did not alter the IGF-I suppressive effect on stressor-induced JNK activity, but LY 294002 suppressed the IGF-I effect. Moreover, in transiently transfected parental 293 cells expressing dominant-negative Akt, anisomycin-increased JNK activity was not suppressed by pretreatment with IGF-I.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)1 and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) have multiple pleiotropic effects. During early embryogenesis, these factors play an essential role in growth and development. Null mutations of IGF-I and IGF-II are associated with growth retardation, whereas mice with a null mutation of the IGF-IR die at birth due to respiratory failure as a consequence of poorly developed diaphragmatic muscle (1Liu J.P.

Following ligand binding to the receptor, the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation and increased receptor tyrosine kinase activity. This is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of endogenous substrates including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family of substrates, Src homology collagen (SHC), Syp, Crk, and Grb2 (3Le Roith D.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the IGF-IR signaling may utilize multiple different cascades to effect the final biological event in a cell type-specific manner. The stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway has not as yet been demonstrated to play a role in IGF anti-apoptotic effects. To study the potential effects of IGFs on the JNK pathway, we activated JNK using anisomycin (an environmental stress) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; a physiological stress) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 293 cells transiently expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-JNK, and 293 cells stably expressing an HA-JNK transgene. In each case, we demonstrate that IGF-I exerts a potent inhibitory effect on JNK activation by stress-inducing signals. To determine whether the effect of IGF-I on JNK activity involves the MAP kinase pathway or the PI3′K pathway, we used the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD098059, the PI3′K inhibitor LY 294002, and transiently transfected parental 293 cells with dominant-negative Akt. Our results demonstrate that the action of IGF-I on JNK in these cells is via PI3′K and Akt. Recombinant IGF-I was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

(Beverly, MA). The radionuclide [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit and donkey anti-rabbit IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Prior to growth factor stimulation, subconfluent cultures of cells in 100-mm poly-d-lysine-coated dishes were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY) and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for 2 h. In some experiments, the MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 (10 μm) was added to cells 30 min before growth factor stimulation, and the PI3′K inhibitor LY 294002 (10 μm) was added 2 h before stimulation. Cells were treated with 10 nm IGF-I for 5 min, 10 μg/ml anisomycin for 20 min, or 50 ng/ml TNF-α for 15 min, all diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. JNK activity was determined as reported by Coso et al. (24Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar) using GST-c-Jun (79) fusion protein as a substrate. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid-sodium salt, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were sonicated four times for 5 s on ice. Endogenous JNK activity in parental 293 cells was determined following immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of polyclonal anti-JNK1 antibody and 35 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose beads for 1 mg of total cellular protein. JNK activity in either transiently or stably transfected cells was determined following immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of monoclonal anti-HA-II antibody and 25 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose beads for 500 μg of total cellular protein. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in washing buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium vanadate in phosphate-buffered saline), once in a second washing buffer (0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.5 m LiCl), and once in kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitates were separated into two tubes for each sample; one was tested for JNK assay, and the other was used for Western immunoblotting. In vitro JNK assay was performed by resuspending the beads in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi/reaction [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm MgATP, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 or 2 μg of GST-c-Jun (79) protein. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Immunocomplex kinase reactions were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. The spots were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). A second JNK assay using a commercial kit was performed without any radioactive materials. JNK was precipitated by c-Jun-conjugated beads, and JNK activity was determined by Western immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-phosphorylated c-Jun antibody. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method, adjusting the total amount of DNA to 5–10 μg/plate with vector alone. Plasmids expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged JNK (pcDNA3-HA-JNK) (24Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar) and kinase-dead Akt (pCEFL-HA-Akt K179M) or wild-type Akt (pCEFL-HA-Akt.wt) (25Murga C.L.L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) were used. Selection in 0.5 mg/ml G418 began 48 h after transfection. After 2–3 weeks of selection in G418, individual colonies were isolated using 0.8-mm glass cloning cylinders (PGC Scientifics, Gaithersburg, MD). As a control, empty vector pGEM-7zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) was transfected. For analysis of JNK protein, immunoprecipitates using monoclonal anti-HA-II antibody were analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-JNK1 antibody after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For technical reasons (JNK migrates at the same level as the heavy chain of IgG), we were unable to measure endogenous JNK protein levels in the immunoprecipitated samples using anti-JNK1 antibody. Phosphorylation of JNK was also analyzed by Western blot analysis. For analysis of Akt protein, immunoprecipitates using polyclonal anti-Akt-1 antibody were analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-HA-II antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using donkey anti-rabbit IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Immunoblots were scanned by FotoLook 2.08 and quantified by MacBAS 2.31. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Calculations were performed using Excel Version 6.0 (Microsoft). HA tagged-JNK was transiently transfected into 293 cells, and JNK activity was determined following stimulation with 10 nm IGF-I for 0, 5, 30, and 60 min. The maximum effect was seen following 5 min of stimulation with 10 nm IGF-I (data not shown). Basal JNK activity was increased slightly by 0.1 nm IGF-I, whereas 1 and 10 nm IGF-I inhibited JNK activity. Treatment with 10 nm IGF-I suppressed JNK activity by ∼40% (Fig. 1). Anisomycin potently increased JNK activity, and pretreatment with 1 and 10 nm IGF-I inhibited the anisomycin-stimulated JNK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). In fact, 10 nm IGF-I abrogated the anisomycin-enhanced JNK activity (p < 0.005). Thus, at physiological concentrations (26Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8769-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), IGF-I is a potent inhibitor of the increased JNK activity caused by anisomycin, an inducer of oxidative stress in 293 cells. We then wished to determine if physiological concentrations of IGF-I inhibited endogenous JNK activity. JNK activity was analyzed by performing kinase reactions with immunoprecipitates obtained from 1 mg of total cell protein. Treatment with 10 nm IGF-I alone did not change basal JNK activity (Fig. 2). Anisomycin (10 μg/ml) stimulated endogenous JNK activity by 1120 ± 276% (mean ± S.D.). IGF-I treatment suppressed the anisomycin-induced JNK activity by 76 ± 17% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). To explore whether IGF-I could also reduce the enhancement of JNK activity in response to a physiological stress, we performed similar experiments with TNF-α without or with IGF-I pretreatment. TNF-α (50 ng/ml) stimulated endogenous JNK activity by 825 ± 371%; however, this effect was suppressed by 62 ± 23% (p < 0.05) by IGF-I pretreatment (Fig. 2). In contrast, the TNF-α effect was suppressed by only 16% when the IGF-I was applied after TNF-α (Fig. 2). Thus, IGF-I inhibition of stress-induced JNK activity requires that the IGF-I treatment be given before the stressor, not after. Thus, activation of JNK by both anisomycin and TNF-α could be reduced by a short pretreatment with 10 nm IGF-I. To confirm the above findings, we analyzed anisomycin-enhanced JNK activity normalized by JNK protein levels in transiently transfected 293 cells. HA-tagged JNK was transiently transfected into 293 cells, and the JNK activity was normalized by the amount of p46JNK protein, the predicted protein encoded by the transfected JNK vector (Fig. 3). The polyclonal anti-JNK antibody also detected a JNK-related protein migrating slightly slower than p46JNK. This band is uncharacterized, but according to the supplier, is seen in other cells transfected with JNK. It is not p54JNK based on electrophoretic mobility. The amount of this slower migrating JNK-related protein did not correlate with changes in JNK activity. No detectable JNK activity could be detected in untransfected or mock-transfected 293 cells when 500 μg of total cell protein was used, compared with results in Fig. 2, where 1 mg of protein was used to detect endogenous JNK activity. In this experiment and the others (Figs. 1, 4, and 5), unstimulated cells transfected with HA-JNK had measurable JNK activity in the immunoprecipitates from 500 μg of total cell protein. Treatment with 10 nm IGF-I for 5 min reduced basal JNK activity (Fig. 3). Anisomycin increased JNK activity by ∼530% in transfected cells, and pretreatment with 10 nm IGF-I suppressed the anisomycin-induced JNK elevation by 103 ± 27% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). However, when 10 nm IGF-I was added after treatment with anisomycin, the IGF-I suppressive effect was not observed (data not shown). This was consistent with the importance of adding IGF-I before the stressor, as seen in Fig. 2 with TNF-α. TNF-α also induced JNK activity by ∼270% in transfected cells, and pretreatment with 10 nmIGF-I suppressed the TNF-α-induced JNK activity by ∼68% (data not shown). Thus, transient transfection of HA-JNK into 293 cells and stimulation with IGF-I affect JNK activity in a quantitatively similar manner compared with parental cells.Figure 4IGF-I suppresses TNF-α-induced JNK activity in 293 cells stably transfected with HA-JNK.

Parental 293 cells were stably transfected, and six independent clones were obtained by serial dilution plating. Four of the six clones expressed HA-JNK, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-JNK antibody on anti-HA immunoprecipitates. Clones 1 and 3 showed greater levels of HA-JNK compared with clones 2 and 4 (data not shown). TNF-α enhanced JNK activity by 442 ± 13%, and pretreatment with IGF-I suppressed the TNF-α-induced JNK activity by 62 ± 17% in clone 3 (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with the other HA-JNK-expressing clones (data not shown). These results are similar to those seen with transiently transfected 293 cells (Fig. 3). IGF-I (10 nm) did not change the basal JNK activity significantly in any stably transfected clones (Figs. 4 and 5). Anisomycin stimulated JNK activity to different levels depending on the particular clone (maximally up to 2600%). There was a reasonable correlation between the level of JNK protein expression and the response of JNK activity to anisomycin (clone 1 = 2058 ± 8%, clone 2 = 816 ± 96%, clone 3 = 2019 ± 460%, and clone 4 = 961 ± 146%, where clones 1 and 3 expressed the highest levels of HA-JNK). Pretreatment with IGF-I (10 nm) reduced the anisomycin-enhanced JNK activity by 80 ± 33% (p < 0.001) in all clones. During the course of these experiments, a commercial antibody that specifically detects phosphorylated c-Jun (38 kDa) became available. We directly measured the level of c-Jun phosphorylation in response to IGF-I and/or anisomycin in both parental cells and cells stably expressing HA-JNK (clone 3). In support of the results shown above, JNK activity was significantly enhanced by anisomycin in both parental and HA-JNK-expressing cells (Fig. 6). Pretreatment with IGF-I reduced the JNK activity to the level of that with IGF-I alone in both cell lines. Thus, despite varying levels of JNK expression and endogenous levels or various levels of transfected JNK, IGF-I pretreatment abrogates the stimulation of JNK activity in response to the stressors TNF-α and anisomycin. To determine whether the effect of IGF-I on suppression of anisomycin-induced endogenous JNK activity involved the MEK1/MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) or PI3′K pathway, we used the specific MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 or the PI3′K inhibitor LY 294002. Parental 293 cells were pretreated with the MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 (10 μm) for 30 min or with the PI3′K inhibitor LY 294002 (10 μm) for 2 h before stimulation. Then the cells were treated with 10 nm IGF-I for 5 min without or with the addition of 10 μg/ml anisomycin for another 20 min, The MEK1 inhibitor (PD) did not significantly alter the IGF-I effect on anisomycin-induced endogenous JNK activity (Fig. 7). However, the PI3′K inhibitor (LY) blocked the IGF-I suppressive effect on anisomycin-induced endogenous JNK activity by 86 ± 39% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). The PI3′-kinase inhibitors similarly affected the IGF-I suppression of TNF-α-induced JNK activation by 90 ± 28% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). Thus, inhibition of the PI3′K pathway blocked the ability of IGF-I to suppress the stressor-induced activation of endogenous JNK. To confirm the above findings, we analyzed anisomycin-increased JNK activity in parental 293 cells transiently expressing kinase-dead Akt or wild-type Akt. Endogenous JNK activity in mock-transfected cells was increased by anisomycin treatment by 1283 ± 337%, and pretreatment with 10 nm IGF-I suppressed the anisomycin-induced JNK elevation by 56 ± 9% (Fig. 8). Compared with this result, IGF-I suppression of anisomycin-increased endogenous JNK activity in transiently transfected 293 cells with kinase-dead Akt was abrogated (Fig. 8). In 293 cells transiently expressing wild-type Akt, anisomycin-increased endogenous JNK activity was suppressed by IGF-I by 51 ± 10% (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 8). Thus, blockade of the Akt pathway abrogated the IGF-I suppression of stressor-induced JNK activation. The IGF-IR is an α2β2-heterotetrameric protein with ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity (3Le Roith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Binding of IGF-I to its receptor induces receptor autophosphorylation in the intracellular kinase domain of the β-subunit and results in activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR (27Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. Le Roith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The predominant substrate of the IGF-IR is IRS-1, a docking protein that has multiple tyrosines in YMXM or related motifs known to associate with proteins containing SH2 domains. Phosphorylated IRS-1 regulates the activity of certain SH2 domain-containing proteins such as PI3′K (9Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). IRS-1 also associates with other SH2 domain-containing proteins involved in growth factor signaling pathways, including Grb2, Nck, and Syp (3Le Roith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Other phosphotyrosine substrates of the IGF-I signaling pathway are phospholipase C-γ and SHC (3Le Roith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated SHC associates with Grb2 and subsequently, through a Grb2·SOS (Sonof Sevenless) complex, activates Ras and Raf-1, an intermediate in the Ras/ERK signaling pathway (8Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases are a large family of serine/threonine protein kinases, divided into a number of major subfamilies. Activation of p42 and p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) occurs via the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway (28Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 29Marais R. Marshall C.J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 101-125PubMed Google Scholar). p38 MAP kinase, the mammalian homologue of the yeast Hog1 protein kinase, is involved in a stress-activated pathway that is induced following environmental stresses such as changes in osmolarity, UV irradiation, and heat shock (30Graves J.D.

Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). In primary fetal neurons, insulin was shown to inhibit p38 MAP kinase activity and to promote cell survival (23Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The third major MAP kinase pathway involves SAPK/JNK, which has multiple isoforms derived from three related genes (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3). Unlike the ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways, the JNK pathway has not as yet been demonstrated to play a role in IGF anti-apoptotic effects, although activation of JNK by TNF-α or environmental stresses leads to phosphorylation of several transcription factors that regulate immediate-early gene expression (31Kyriakis J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to determine if IGF-I modulated the stress-induced pro-apoptotic JNK pathway in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Multiple activators have been shown to increase JNK activity. Increased osmolality (e.g. sorbitol treatment) activates JNK via an as yet unidentified pathway. UV irradiation and anisomycin trigger activation of the JNK pathway via MAP kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1) and MAP kinase/ERK kinase-4 (MEK4) (also known as SEK-1, JNKK, or MKK4). Recently, it has been shown that TNF-α activates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1, a JNK kinase kinase kinase), which then activates MEK4, leading to JNK activation (37Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a catalytically inactive form of ASK1 prevented TNF-α-induced apoptosis (37Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). We chose to investigate the impact of IGF-I on anisomycin and TNF-α activation of JNK. We showed that anisomycin stimulates the activity of endogenous and transfected JNK in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, as seen in other cell types. Prior treatment with 10 nm IGF-I (physiological range) abrogates the anisomycin stimulation of JNK activity. Physiological concentrations (26Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8769-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) of IGF-I inhibit JNK activity in the absence of treatment with anisomycin. These results are consistent with the down-regulation of one or more of the substrates involved in the JNK kinase pathways. These results do not rule out the effect of IGF-I from other upstream pathways, as yet undefined, that may converge on the JNK pathway. We show here that the ability of IGF-I to prevent anisomycin-induced JNK activation occurs only if the cells are pretreated with IGF-I. This is consistent with the IGF-I-inducible pathway being initiated upstream of the point in the pathway where anisomycin-inducible events occur. Thus, IGF-I might mediate this effect through MEKK1 or MEK4. Alternatively, IGF-I could be working through an entirely separate pathway that converges directly at JNK, but fixes JNK in a state whereby it is unresponsive to activation by MEKK1 and MEK4, or converges directly on the pathway upstream of JNK. In support of these data, IGF-I (10 nm) can block TNF-α activation of JNK only if IGF-I is presented to the cell before exposure to TNF-α. Previous studies have indicated that TNF-α and anisomycin use the MEKK1/MEK4 pathway to activate JNK; thus, the similarity of the IGF-I effects on these two methods of activating JNK is as expected. Since the specific IGF-I-inducible pathway(s) that modulate the JNK pathway are unknown, we used inhibitors of two pathways known to be activated in response to IGF-I. Suppression of the MEK1/MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) pathway by PD098059 does not affect the ability of physiological concentrations of IGF-I to abrogate the anisomycin activation of JNK. In contrast, when the PI3′K pathway was inhibited by LY 294002, the IGF-I effect was blocked. Our results are consistent with recent reports of upstream regulators of JNK (38Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 39Lopez-Ilasaca M. Li W. Uren A., Yu, J.C. Kazlauskas A. Gutkind J.S. Heidaran M.A. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, a recent report showed that the IGF-I suppressive effect on JNK activation by high glucose in human neuroblastoma cells was blocked by PD098059 (42Cheng H. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14560-14565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), in contrast to our results. One possible explanation is the different cell lines used in those experiments (42Cheng H. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14560-14565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Akt/RAC/PKB, a serine/threonine kinase, regulates JNK activity (43Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and IGF-I stimulates Akt via PI3′K (12Dudek H. Datta S.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). We have shown that the IGF-I effect on anisomycin-induced JNK activation is at least partially mediated through PI3′K and Akt. Other growth factors (i.e. insulin, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor) have been found to activate JNK via PI3′K (26Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C.

Both the dominant-negative form of PI3′K and a fungal inhibitor (wortmannin) of PI3′K blocked epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor induction of JNK (38Logan S.K. Falasca M.

Interestingly, in these studies, no effect of the growth factors on stress-induced JNK was measured, however. In contrast to IGF-I, fibroblast growth factor blocked TNF-α-induced apoptosis, but did not affect JNK activation (20Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Since JNK activity may produce pleiotropic effects, in some instances inducing apoptosis coincident with growth factor proliferation, we conclude that the different responses to these growth factors are likely cell type-specific and determined by variability in the cellular context, whether in the resting state or in the stress-activated state. Thus, other pathways may impact on these differential responses under varying conditions of cell stimulation. Dominant-negative forms of MEK4 block Fas-induced JNK activation (45Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), providing evidence that Fas-induced apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, by the MEK4/JNK pathway (46Wilson D.J. Fortner K.A. Lynch D.H. Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Posada J.A. Budd R.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Daxx, a signaling protein that binds to the Fas death domain, stimulates both JNK activation and apoptosis. The Daxx apoptotic pathway is sensitive to Bcl-2, which is itself regulated by IGF-I signaling (47Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expressed Bcl-2 inhibits ceramide and Fas activation of JNK (48Herrmann J.L. Menter D.G. Beham A. von Eschenbach A. McDonnell T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 49Goillot E. Raingeaud J. Ranger A. Tepper R.I. Davis R.J. Harlow E. Sanchez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3302-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Heat shock protein (hsp70) can prevent ceramide-induced activation of JNK and apoptosis (50Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Presently, there is no evidence that IGF-I signaling converges with hsp70 upstream of JNK. Recently, two members of the mixed lineage kinases, MUK/DLK/ZPK and mammalian STE20-like protein kinase/MLK2, have been shown to activate MEK4 and JNK (51Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to be JNK kinase kinases that are parallel to MEKK1. Therefore, any convergent effects on the JNK pathway that positively or negatively affect JNK activity could occur at the level of MEK4. At this point, there is no evidence that IGF-I signals through the mixed lineage kinases. In summary, we have shown that IGF-I blocks the enhancement of JNK activity in response to anisomycin and TNF-α. Furthermore, we have shown results consistent with the model that IGF-I impacts on the JNK pathway at or upstream of JNK. It will be important to extend these studies of the IGF-I impact on the JNK pathway and provide identification of the specific pathways regulating the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis when cells are exposed both to the growth factor IGF-I and stressors known to promote apoptosis."

A single transcription initiation site for mRNA containing exon 1-b was mapped by primer extension analysis and numbered +1. We found three tandemly aligned sequences, similar to the DNA replication-related element (DRE; 5′-TATCGATA), which is commonly required for transcription of genes related to DNA replication and cell proliferation, in the region upstream of this site. Band mobility shift analyses using oligonucleotides containing the DRE-related sequences with or without various base substitutions revealed that two out of three DRE-related sequences are especially important for binding to the DRE-binding factor (DREF). On footprinting analysis with Kc cell nuclear extracts and a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with the N-terminal fragment (1–125 amino acid residues) of DREF, all three DRE-related sequences were found to be protected. Transient luciferase expression assays in Kc cells demonstrated that the region containing the three DRE-related sequences is required for high promoter activity. We have established transgenic lines of Drosophila in which ectopic expression of DREF was targeted to the eye imaginal disc cells. Overexpression of DREF in eye imaginal disc cells enhanced the promoter activity of dE2F. The obtained results indicate that the DRE/DREF system activates transcription of the dE2F gene.

E2F is a transcription factor playing important roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation (1Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In mammals, at least six distinct E2F family members (E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, E2F4, E2F5, and E2F6) and two heterodimer partners (DP1 and DP2) have been isolated (2DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L.

Many DNA replication-related mammalian genes such as those for DNA polymerase α, thymidine kinase, PCNA,1 and ribonucleotide reductase contain E2F-binding sites in their promoters. Transcription of these genes is induced by E2F family members during progression from G0 to S phase (2DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In general, the levels of DP1, DP2, and E2F4 proteins are constant throughout the cell cycle (5Helin K. Wu C. Fattaey A. Lees J.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and E2F1 and E2F2 genes contain E2F-binding sites in their promoters, their expression being repressed by E2F-mediated negative control through these sites during G0 to G1 phase (8Sears R. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Neuman E. Flemington E.K. Sellers W.R. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell.

Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The repression is likely mediated by an E2F-Rb family complex. In late G1 phase, E2F-mediated repression is relieved by G1 cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a Rb family protein (12Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Then, transcription factors like CCAAT-binding protein and YY-1 appear to activate the E2F1 gene promoter (11Hsiao K.M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13van Ginkel P.R. Hsiao K.-M. Schjerven H. Farnham P.J. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a single set of E2F and DP has been identified and characterized (14Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but two different E2F cDNAs have been reported (14Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although these two cDNAs encode an identical protein, the nucleotide sequences in their 5′-untranslated regions differ. Comparison of the newly determined genomic sequences of theDrosophila E2F gene (dE2F) and its 5′-flanking region 2T. Sasaki, T. Sawado, M. Yamaguchi, and T. Shinomiya, manuscript in preparation. with the cDNAs nucleotide sequences allowed us to map two genomic regions, corresponding to the diverged sequences of two E2F cDNAs. These two genomic regions likely represent parts of two different first exons, named 1-a and 1-b, that are, respectively, located 10.1 and 5.4 kb upstream of the common second exon containing the translation initiation codon. Northern hybridization analyses using specific probes confirmed the existence of two transcripts, named transcripts-a and -b. Although transcript-a was detected exclusively in embryos, transcript-b could be identified in other stages of development. Fluctuation of transcript-b level was roughly similar to those of other DNA replication-related genes (16Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Masutani M. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Matsukage A.

Biol. 1990; 10: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in knowing whether synthesis of transcript-b is regulated by the same factors involved in expression of DNA replication-related genes. Like their mammalian counterparts, Drosophila E2F and DP form a heterodimer to generate a sequence-specific DNA binding factor that appears to activate transcription of DNA replication-related genes through E2F-binding sites (14Ohtani K.

In addition to E2F-binding sites, a common 8-base pair (bp) palindromic sequence named the DNA replication-related element (DRE: 5′-TATCGATA) is frequently found in the promoters of growth-related genes (23Hirose F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A transcription factor DREF (DRE-binding factor) that specifically binds to the DRE sequence has been isolated as an 80-kDa polypeptide homodimer (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its cDNA has been cloned (28Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our previous studies performed in vitro and in vivo suggested that E2F-binding sites and DRE function synergistically to activate promoters of the PCNA and DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit genes (23Hirose F.

Interestingly, we found three tandemly aligned DRE-related sequences, each of which matched 6 bp out of the 8-bp DRE consensus sequence, located at positions −540 to −533 (site I), −532 to −525 (site II), and −521 to −514 (site III) with respect to the initiation site of transcript-b. The region from −2184 to +203 showed promoter activity in Drosophila Kc cells with the three DRE-related sequences playing an important role. In addition, DREF specifically bound to these DRE-related sequences, and overexpression of DREF in Drosophila eye imaginal disc cells activated the expression of the lacZ reporter gene, which was under the control of the dE2F gene promoter. The obtained results indicate that transcription of the dE2F gene is regulated by the DRE/DREF system. Kc cells derived from Drosophila melanogaster embryos were grown at 25 °C in M3(BF) medium (31Cross D.P. Sang J.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; 45: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum in the presence of 5% CO2. Monoclonal antibodies to DREF, mAb 1 and mAb 4, were raised as described previously (28Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol.

A genomic library was constructed by Sau3AI partial digestion of D. melanogaster Oregon-R DNA and ligation into the BamHI site of λEMBL3. The details of the procedures for screening and nucleotide sequencing of the genomic clones for dE2F will be described elsewhere2 (accession number AB011813). To determine the transcription initiation site, the following oligonucleotide was used in primer extension experiments: primer 4.5pet, 5′-AATCTTTTACTTGCAGAGGCAGTGTTTTGCGGCT. To obtain a fragment containing the promoter of the dE2F gene, the following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were chemically synthesized: −9610HS2, 5′-CTCAAGCTTCCGCGGGCAGTTCGAGCATTTGT; +8230X, 5′-AAACTCGAGGAAGATGGTGAAGCGGTT; and +8771, 5′-TTTCTCGAGAACACTCAAATGTATT. To obtain a fragment containing the first exons of the dE2Fgene, the following PCR primers were synthesized: 5.2ss3761+, 5′-AAAGGATCCCGCCCGCTTGCAAAGTG; 5.2ss4777−, 5′-AAGCTGCAGACCTGTCCGCCCTAACT; 4.5se9007+, 5′-GCTGGATCCGTCGATTCGCCGCGTTC; 4.5se10049−, 5′-ATCCTGCAGGGAGGTTATTAGAGGGC. To obtain a fragment containing a full-length DREF cDNA, the following PCR primer was synthesized.: DREF-ATG, 5′-ACAGGATCCAAGATGAGCGAAGGGGTACCA. To obtain a fragment containing GAL4 coding sequence, the following PCR primers were synthesized. GAL4+, 5′-ATCGAATTCGGTACCAGATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATCGA; GAL4−, 5′-ATAAGATCTGCGGCCGCTTACTCTTTTTTTGGGTTTGGTG. The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the DRE of the PCNA gene promoter (DRE-P), or a 3 base-deleted derivative (DRE-PΔ3), were as described previously (29Yamaguchi M.

The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing DRE-related sequences or their base-substituted derivatives in the promoter for 1-b were defined as follows: DRE-Eb, 5′-GATCCTATCGTAATATCGAATAGCTATCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GATAGCATTATAGCTTATCGATAGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut I), 5′-GATCCcgcCGTAATATCGAATAGCTATCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GgcgGCATTATAGCTTATCGATAGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut II), 5′-GATCCTATCGTAAcgcCGAATAGCTATCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GATAGCATTgcgGCTTATCGATAGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut III), 5′-GATCCTATCGTAATATCGAATAGCcgcCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GATAGCATTATAGCTTATCGgcgGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut I II), 5′-GATCCcgcCGTAAcgcCGAATAGCTATCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GgcgGCATTgcgGCTTATCGATAGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut II III), 5′-GATCCTATCGTAAcgcCGAATAGCcgcCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GATAGCATTgcgGCTTATCGgcgGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut I III), 5′-GATCCcgcCGTAATATCGAATAGCcgcCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GgcgGCATTATAGCTTATCGgcgGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG; DRE-Eb (mut I II III), 5′-GATCCcgcCGTAAcgcCGAATAGCcgcCGTTTGATCAGA, 3′-GgcgGCATTgcgGCTTATCGgcgGCAAACTAGTCTCTAG. Nucleotides with substitution for the wild type sequence and those inserted into the wild type sequence are shown by underlined lowercase letters. All nucleotide positions of thedE2F gene in the following part of this paper are numbered with the transcription initiation site for transcript-b set as +1. Plasmid DPA124SE4.5 contains the region corresponding to exon 1-b and at least 4 kb upstream region in the vector pBluescript II SK(−). Plasmid DPA124SS5.2 contains the region corresponding to exon 1-a and at least 3.5 kb upstream in the vector pBluescript II SK(−).2 The expression plasmid Act-dE2F (15Dynlacht B.D. Brook A.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 62: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid pRL-actin5C for the internal control of the luciferase-transient expression assay, pActCAT was digested with SacI and HindIII, and the DNA fragment that contained the actin 5C gene promoter was isolated and blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase. Then, this DNA fragment was inserted into EheI site of the plasmid pRL-null vector (Promega). To construct the plasmid p-3x6/8-pBluescript II SK(−) for the footprinting analysis, plasmid DPA124SE4.5 was digested withPvuII, and the DNA fragment containing the region from −843 to −440 was isolated. Then, this fragment was inserted into theEcoRV site of the plasmid pBluescript II SK(−). To construct the plasmid p-2184E2Fbluc for the luciferase-transient expression assay, plasmid DPA124SE4.5 was digested with NdeI and EcoRV, and the DNA fragment containing thedE2F gene fragment was isolated and inserted into blunt-ended BglII site of the plasmid PGVB. To construct the plasmid p-1159E2Fbluc, PCR was performed using plasmid DPA124SE4.5 as a template, and primers +8230X and −9610HS2 in combination. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and HindIII and inserted between the XhoI and HindIII sites of plasmid PGVB. To construct the plasmid p-913E2Fbluc, plasmid DPA124SE4.5 was digested with EheI and EcoRV, and the DNA fragment containing the dE2F gene fragment was isolated and inserted into the blunt-ended BglII site of the plasmid PGVB.

The PCR products were digested withXhoI and HindIII, and inserted between theXhoI and HindIII sites of plasmid PGVB. To construct the plasmid p-440E2Fbluc, plasmid DPA124SE4.5 was digested with PvuII and EcoRV, and the DNA fragment containing the dE2F gene fragment was isolated and inserted into the blunt-ended BglII site of the plasmid PGVB. To construct the plasmid p-34E2Fbluc, plasmid-DPA124SE4.5 was digested with NaeI and EcoRV, and the DNA fragment containing the dE2F gene fragment was isolated and inserted into the blunt-ended BglII site of the plasmid PGVB. To construct the luciferase expression plasmid having three DRE-related sequences placed upstream of the heterologous TATA promoter (Fig. 9), the oligonucleotides DRE-Eb or DRE-Eb (mut I II III) were ligated in a head-to-tail manner as described previously (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligated oligonucleotides were isolated and digested with BglII and BamHI, and inserted into the BamHI site of the p-TATA-SK. The fragments containing DRE and TATA promoter were isolated by digestion with SmaI and SacI, and inserted between SmaI and SacI sites of PGVB. For p-TATA-SK, TATA-CAT (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M.

To construct the control plasmid TATA-PGVB carrying the metallothionein gene basal promoter alone, TATA-SK was digested withKpnI and SacI, after which the DNA fragment containing metallothionein gene basal promoter was isolated and inserted into the KpnI and SacI sites of PGVB. To construct the plasmid pGMR-GAL4, PCR was performed using plasmid pGaTB as a template, and primers GAL4+ and GAL4− in combination. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BglII, and inserted between the EcoRI and BglII sites of plasmid pGMR. To construct the pUAS-DREF, PCR was performed using plasmid DCDREF2.2 (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template, and primers DREF-ATG and T7 primer (Toyobo) in combination. The PCR products were digested withBamHI and XhoI, and then inserted betweenBamHI and XhoI sites of pUAST (33Brand A. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue, isolated by standard procedures (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and further purified through two cycles of ethidium bromide/CsCl density-gradient centrifugation. Total cellular RNA was isolated from bodies of Drosophila at various developmental stages by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and blotted onto a sheet of GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont). Probes were radiolabeled using the random primer method (36Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing conditions were the same as described elsewhere (16Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Masutani M. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Matsukage A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4991-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR films or quantified with a BAS2000 (Fuji Film) imaging analyzer. The exon 1-a specific probe (Fig. 1) was prepared by means of PCR using plasmid DPA124SS5.2 as a template and primers 5.2ss3761+ and 5.2ss4777− in combination. The exon 1-b specific probe (Fig. 1) was prepared by means of PCR using plasmid DPA124se4.5 as a template and primers 4.5se9007+ and 4.5se10049−. Each PCR product was gel-purified and radiolabeled. The coding region specific probe was obtained by digestion of Act-dE2F with HindIII and BamHI. 1.2 kb of fragment was gel-purified and radiolabeled. Full-length cDNA of ribosomal protein 49 (Rp-49) gene was used as a control. Primer extension analysis was performed as detailed earlier (25Takahashi Y. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Cotterill S.

Total cellular RNA was extracted fromDrosophila 8–12-h embryos, unfertilized eggs, third instar larvae, and Kc cells by the methods described previously (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). A 34-mer primer (4.5pet), which was complementary to the region downstream of the 5′-end of the cDNA reported by Dynlacht et al. (15Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl.

The reaction product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, followed by autoradiography. 35S-Labeled DNA fragments, produced in the dideoxy-sequencing reaction with the plasmid DPA124SE4.5 as a template using 4.5pet as a primer, were run in parallel, allowing precise mapping of the transcription initiation site. Band mobility shift analysis was performed as detailed previously (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. An expression plasmid for the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DNA binding domain of a DREF (DREF1–125) fusion protein was constructed, and the fusion protein was expressed in E. colias described previously (28Hirose F.

Kc cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for the band mobility shift analysis. The oligonucleotides DRE-Eb or DRE-P were end-labeled with32P, and DNA-protein complexes were electrophoretically resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA containing 2.5% glycerol at 25 °C. The gels were dried and autoradiographed or quantified with a BAS2000 (Fuji Film) imaging analyzer. Kc cells (2 × 106/dish) were grown in 60-mm plastic dishes for 24 h and cotransfected with 5 μg of the reporter plasmid DNA and 10 ng of pRL-actin5C DNA using CellFectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (37Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 48 h after DNA transfection. The luciferase assay was carried out by means of a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. Transfections were performed several times with at least two independent plasmid preparations. DNase I footprinting analysis was performed essentially as described previously (23Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragment (−440 to −843) was obtained by digestion of p-3x6/8-pBluescript II SK(−) with BamHI (lower) and HindIII (upper), labeled at 5′-end of the upper or lower strand. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed. Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C on standard food. The Canton S fly was used as the wild type strain. ThedE2F 729 allele, described previously (19Duronio R.J. O'Farrell P.H. Xie J.E. Brook A. Dyson N.

P-element-mediated germ line transformation was carried out as described previously (38Spradling A.C. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). F1 transformants were selected on the basis of white eye color rescue (39Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Philips R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four independent lines were obtained with pGMR-Gal4 constructs and line 16 carrying pGMR-GAL4 on X chromosome was used. Five independent lines were obtained for pUAS-DREF constructs. The line carrying pUAS-DREF in the second chromosome was used in this study. The details of the procedures for establishment of lines with the UAS-DREF transgene will be described elsewhere. 3F. Hirose, T. Sawado, M. Yamaguchi, Y. Nishi, K. Sakaguchi, and A. Matsukage, manuscript in preparation. The line carrying GMR-GAL4 in the X chromosome was crossed with the line carrying UAS-DREF in the second chromosome, and the resultant hybrids were crossed withdE2F 729. The progenies were analyzed as detailed below. Third instar larvae were dissected in DrosophilaRinger solution, and imaginal discs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS/0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), the samples were blocked with PBS-T containing 10% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-DREF IgG at a 1:2000 dilution or with mouse anti-β-galactosidase monoclonal antibody at a 1:1000 dilution at 4 °C for 16 h. After extensive washing with PBS-T, the imaginal discs were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) at a 1: 1000 dilution or with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (E-Y Laboratory) at a 1:500 dilution as second antibody. After extensive washing with PBS-T, color was developed in a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium salt, and 0.175 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidinium salt for the alkaline phosphatase reaction and in a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, 2.5 mm CoCl2, and 0.003% H2O2 for the peroxidase reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1969252444,"Previous studies have shown that the ceramide analogue,d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamin-3-morpholino-propanol (d-PDMP), inhibits glucosylceramide synthase and thus leads to extensive depletion of glycosphingolipids derived from glucosyl ceramide. Our previous studies have shown that cholera toxin B subunit, which specifically binds to the cell surface ganglioside GM1, and GM1 itself can enhance the action of nerve growth factor (NGF) in responsive cells by enhancing the NGF-induced autophosphorylation of the high affinity NGF receptor, Trk. Using d-PDMP, we examined the effects of the inhibition of the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids on intracellular NGF signaling pathway.d-PDMP was found to inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Moreover, d-PDMP clearly inhibited NGF-induced autophosphorylation of Trk and prevented the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, downstream targets of Trk-initiated intracellular protein kinase cascades. These effects of d-PDMP were abolished by the addition of GM1 but not by the addition of other ganglioside subspecies to the culture medium. Furthermore, the effect of d-PDMP seemed to be specific for the Trk receptor, because intracellular signaling pathway of epidermal growth factor was not affected byd-PDMP. Dimethylsphingosine and the cell-permeable analogue, C<sub>2</sub>-ceramide, did not show such a strong inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth or on the autophosphorylation of Trk. The present results and our previous observations clearly demonstrate that Trk requires endogenous gangliosides, especially GM1, for its normal function in mediating the neurotrophic activity of NGF at least in PC12 cells."

The liver is the major site for drug metabolism and detoxification. Growing evidence indicates that these activities are also present in non-hepatic tissues including the eye (1Shichi H. Nebert D.W. Extra-hepatic Metabolism of Drugs and Other Foreign Compounds. 1980; (, Medical and Scientific Book, New York): 333-363Google Scholar, 2Shichi H. Sears M.L. Pharmacology of Eye. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 117-148Google Scholar). The incomplete reduction of oxygen by a variety of electron transfer systems gives rise to reactive oxygen species (O⨪2, H2O2, and HO⋅) that can cause cellular damage. Drug-metabolizing enzyme systems are such systems. In the eye, vascularized uveal tissues such as ciliary body and iris possess the highest drug-metabolizing activities for detoxification of blood nutrients (3Das N.D. Shichi H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 433-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Schwartzman M.L. Masferrer J. Dunn M.W. McGiff J.C. Abraham N.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1987; 6: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For protection against the detrimental effects of the toxic oxygen species, the eye tissues, like other mammalian tissues, have both nonenzymatic (ascorbic acid, β-carotene, glutathione, α-tocopherol, etc.) and enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) antioxidant systems. The two-layered epithelium of ciliary body demonstrates fairly high levels of the antioxidant enzyme activities, especially in the nonpigmented epithelium (5Ng M.C. Susan S.R. Shichi H. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of the important physiological functions of the ciliary body epithelium is the production of aqueous humor by metabolic ultrafiltration of blood plasma. The aqueous humor provides nutrients to nonvascularized lens and cornea. Destruction of the blood-aqueous barrier in the ciliary epithelium by reactive oxygen species results in the secretion of the aqueous humor containing blood hydrolytic enzymes and other undesirable substances into the anterior chamber of the eye, and may damage the lens and cornea and cause the opacification of these tissues. Protection of the ciliary epithelium from oxidants, therefore, is very important to maintain unimpaired vision.We have previously investigated the capacity of bovine ciliary body to detoxify peroxides (H2O2,t-butylhydroperoxide) and found that glutathione and its redox cycle play a pivotal role in peroxide reduction (6Kishida K. Kodama T. O'Meara P.D. Shichi H. J. Ocular Pharmacol. 1985; 1: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Shichi H. Hodder W.A. Giblin F.J. J. Ocular Pharmacol. 1986; 2: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the glutathione peroxidase activity of this tissue is mainly accounted for by a novel enzyme, which contains no selenium and shows no glutathione S-transferase activity, and hence is different from any known type of glutathione peroxidase (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There are at least four isoforms of glutathione peroxidase in mammals, all of which are selenium-dependent enzymes: cellular glutathione peroxidase 1 (EC 1.11.1.9) (9Rotruck J.T. Pope A.L. Ganther H.E. Swanson A.B. Hafeman D.G. Hoekstra W.G. Science. 1973; 179: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (6109) Google Scholar), gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase 2 (10Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), extracellular glutathione peroxidase 3 (11Takahashi K. Cohen H.J. Blood. 1986; 68: 640-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase 4 (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In addition, a glutathioneS-transferase isozyme exhibits glutathione peroxidase activity (13Prohaska J.R. Ganther H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 437-445Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal 27 residue-sequence of the novel enzyme we have purified showed little identity to the amino-terminal sequence of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases and glutathione S-transferases.Frank et al. (14Frank S. Muntz B. Werner S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported recently that a gene induced in cultured human keratinocytes in response to keratinocyte growth factor encodes a protein that shows a high degree of identity to the amino-terminal sequence of bovine ciliary body glutathione peroxidase we had purified. The finding prompted us to characterize this enzyme further. In this study, we have isolated cDNA clones and analyzed the nucleotide sequence to deduce the primary structure of the enzyme. Using RNA probes prepared from the cDNA clones, mRNA levels in different tissues of bovine eye were determined by RNase protection assay. In addition, enzymatic activities of translation products prepared from bovine mRNA and cDNA clones were investigated. For the sake of convenience, the eye enzyme is designated GPX.1DISCUSSIONNucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the GPX cDNA contains a single open reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 224 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 25,064 Da. The NH2 terminus of GPX purified from bovine eye lacks the methionine residue (6Kishida K. Kodama T. O'Meara P.D. Shichi H. J. Ocular Pharmacol. 1985; 1: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating posttranslational modifications of the enzyme. GPX shows little sequence identity to selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases and glutathioneS-transferases (22Ishida K. Morino T. Takagi K. Sukenaga Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10051Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Yoshimura S. Takekoshi S. Watanabe K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The sequence of bovine GPX is 95% identical to that of a protein expressed by human keratinocytes in response to keratinocyte growth factor (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11). Reactive sulfur- and oxygen-metabolizing enzymes, which are termed thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes and alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, respectively, and constitute a molecular family, have been characterized from a number of microorganisms. Antioxidant sequences are also found in proteins of higher organisms such as rehydrins. Bovine GPX shows a significant sequence identity to the antioxidant proteins of the family (Fig. 11). GPX also shows significant identity to rat heme-binding 23-kDa protein (BLAST accession no. D30035) and mouse thioredoxin peroxidase (BLAST accession no. U51679). Chae et al. (27Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) compared more than 23 proteins belonging to this family and constructed a consensus sequence. This family of enzymes appears to be subdivided on the basis of the number of conserved cysteine residues. The sequence containing the first cysteine from the NH2 terminus is PVCT in the 1-cysteine members and FVCP in the 2-cysteine members (27Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). GPX possesses a single cysteine residue in the PVCT sequence and belongs to the 1-cysteine group. The conserved VC sequence could be important for the catalytic activity of this family of enzymes. A reaction mechanism involving cysteine SH group(s) was proposed for the active center of antioxidant enzymes (28Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The sequences of several bacterial antioxidant enzymes possessing thioredoxin-linked thiol peroxidase activity were recently compared (30Wan X.Y. Zhou Y. Yan Z.Y. Wang H.L. Hou Y.D. Jin D.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence GVC or PVC appears to be important for antioxidant activities.Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase are well documented antioxidant enzymes in mammals. However, microorganisms often lack some or all of the antioxidant enzymes. Aerotolerant parasitic protozoa, for example, are deficient in catalase and glutathione peroxidase, although glutathione and NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase are present (31Mehlotra R.K. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 231-295Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Glutathione disulfide reduction in these organisms depends upon a thiol-containing cofactor (e.g. trypanothione). Therefore, trypanothione peroxidase is equivalent to glutathione peroxidase in mammals. These findings suggest that diverse antioxidant systems similar to the glutathione peroxidase-glutathione reductase system exist in nature. In view of the sequence similarity of GPX to alkyl hydroperoxide reductases and thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes, it seems likely that GPX we characterized in this work is an evolutionary derivative of the family of antioxidant enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen and sulfur species.Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases are believed to be critical antioxidant enzymes for the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. For example, nutritional studies demonstrated that hyperoxia-induced pulmonary injury is exacerbated in selenium-deficient rats (32Hawker F.H. Ward H.E. Stewart P.M. Wynne L.A. Snitch P.J. Eur. Respir. J. 1993; 6: 1317-1323PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a mouse mutant deficient in glutathione peroxidase 1, the major selenium-dependent isoform ubiquitously present in all types of mammalian cells, was produced (33Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L. Bronson R.T. Cao J. Gargano M. Sugawara M. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the knockout mice grew normally, remained healthy and fertile, and showed no increased lung injury to hyperoxia compared with normal mice. Glutathione peroxidase is considered to be essential for ocular lens transparency. The knockout mice, however, showed no sign of opacity development in the lens (34Spector A. Yang Y. Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.J. Wang R.R. Ma W. Li W.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since GPX expression in the lung is pronounced, it is of interest to produce a mouse mutant in which GPX is deficient and investigate whether the mutant is highly susceptible to hyperoxia-induced pulmonary injury.The GPX gene in cultured human keratinocytes was activated by keratinocyte growth factor (i.e. fibroblast growth factor 7) (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). GPX may have a protective role during the skin wound healing process against reactive-oxygen species, which are mediators of tissue injury (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In the eye, the ciliary body and iris are severely damaged in inflammatory conditions but are regenerated to the original architecture within a few weeks after inflammation (35Peng B. Shichi H. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Wang J. Essner E. Shichi H. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1995; 63: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). GPX may play an important role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated in the inflammatory condition and in facilitating the repair process. The liver is the major site for drug metabolism and detoxification. Growing evidence indicates that these activities are also present in non-hepatic tissues including the eye (1Shichi H. Nebert D.W. Extra-hepatic Metabolism of Drugs and Other Foreign Compounds. 1980; (, Medical and Scientific Book, New York): 333-363Google Scholar, 2Shichi H. Sears M.L. Pharmacology of Eye.

Subsequent studies have shown that the glutathione peroxidase activity of this tissue is mainly accounted for by a novel enzyme, which contains no selenium and shows no glutathione S-transferase activity, and hence is different from any known type of glutathione peroxidase (8Shichi H. Demar J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There are at least four isoforms of glutathione peroxidase in mammals, all of which are selenium-dependent enzymes: cellular glutathione peroxidase 1 (EC 1.11.1.9) (9Rotruck J.T. Pope A.L. Ganther H.E. Swanson A.B. Hafeman D.G. Hoekstra W.G. Science. 1973; 179: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (6109) Google Scholar), gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase 2 (10Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H.

Blood. 1986; 68: 640-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase 4 (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In addition, a glutathioneS-transferase isozyme exhibits glutathione peroxidase activity (13Prohaska J.R. Ganther H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 437-445Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal 27 residue-sequence of the novel enzyme we have purified showed little identity to the amino-terminal sequence of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases and glutathione S-transferases. Frank et al. (14Frank S. Muntz B. Werner S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported recently that a gene induced in cultured human keratinocytes in response to keratinocyte growth factor encodes a protein that shows a high degree of identity to the amino-terminal sequence of bovine ciliary body glutathione peroxidase we had purified. The finding prompted us to characterize this enzyme further. In this study, we have isolated cDNA clones and analyzed the nucleotide sequence to deduce the primary structure of the enzyme. Using RNA probes prepared from the cDNA clones, mRNA levels in different tissues of bovine eye were determined by RNase protection assay. In addition, enzymatic activities of translation products prepared from bovine mRNA and cDNA clones were investigated. For the sake of convenience, the eye enzyme is designated GPX.1 DISCUSSIONNucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the GPX cDNA contains a single open reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 224 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 25,064 Da. The NH2 terminus of GPX purified from bovine eye lacks the methionine residue (6Kishida K. Kodama T. O'Meara P.D. Shichi H. J. Ocular Pharmacol. 1985; 1: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating posttranslational modifications of the enzyme. GPX shows little sequence identity to selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases and glutathioneS-transferases (22Ishida K. Morino T. Takagi K. Sukenaga Y.

The sequence of bovine GPX is 95% identical to that of a protein expressed by human keratinocytes in response to keratinocyte growth factor (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11). Reactive sulfur- and oxygen-metabolizing enzymes, which are termed thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes and alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, respectively, and constitute a molecular family, have been characterized from a number of microorganisms. Antioxidant sequences are also found in proteins of higher organisms such as rehydrins. Bovine GPX shows a significant sequence identity to the antioxidant proteins of the family (Fig. 11). GPX also shows significant identity to rat heme-binding 23-kDa protein (BLAST accession no. D30035) and mouse thioredoxin peroxidase (BLAST accession no. U51679). Chae et al. (27Chae H.Z. Robison K.

A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) compared more than 23 proteins belonging to this family and constructed a consensus sequence. This family of enzymes appears to be subdivided on the basis of the number of conserved cysteine residues. The sequence containing the first cysteine from the NH2 terminus is PVCT in the 1-cysteine members and FVCP in the 2-cysteine members (27Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). GPX possesses a single cysteine residue in the PVCT sequence and belongs to the 1-cysteine group. The conserved VC sequence could be important for the catalytic activity of this family of enzymes. A reaction mechanism involving cysteine SH group(s) was proposed for the active center of antioxidant enzymes (28Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The sequences of several bacterial antioxidant enzymes possessing thioredoxin-linked thiol peroxidase activity were recently compared (30Wan X.Y. Zhou Y. Yan Z.Y. Wang H.L. Hou Y.D. Jin D.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence GVC or PVC appears to be important for antioxidant activities.Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase are well documented antioxidant enzymes in mammals. However, microorganisms often lack some or all of the antioxidant enzymes. Aerotolerant parasitic protozoa, for example, are deficient in catalase and glutathione peroxidase, although glutathione and NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase are present (31Mehlotra R.K. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 231-295Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Glutathione disulfide reduction in these organisms depends upon a thiol-containing cofactor (e.g. trypanothione). Therefore, trypanothione peroxidase is equivalent to glutathione peroxidase in mammals. These findings suggest that diverse antioxidant systems similar to the glutathione peroxidase-glutathione reductase system exist in nature. In view of the sequence similarity of GPX to alkyl hydroperoxide reductases and thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes, it seems likely that GPX we characterized in this work is an evolutionary derivative of the family of antioxidant enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen and sulfur species.Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases are believed to be critical antioxidant enzymes for the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. For example, nutritional studies demonstrated that hyperoxia-induced pulmonary injury is exacerbated in selenium-deficient rats (32Hawker F.H. Ward H.E. Stewart P.M. Wynne L.A. Snitch P.J. Eur. Respir. J. 1993; 6: 1317-1323PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a mouse mutant deficient in glutathione peroxidase 1, the major selenium-dependent isoform ubiquitously present in all types of mammalian cells, was produced (33Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L.

Surprisingly, the knockout mice grew normally, remained healthy and fertile, and showed no increased lung injury to hyperoxia compared with normal mice. Glutathione peroxidase is considered to be essential for ocular lens transparency. The knockout mice, however, showed no sign of opacity development in the lens (34Spector A. Yang Y. Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.J. Wang R.R. Ma W. Li W.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since GPX expression in the lung is pronounced, it is of interest to produce a mouse mutant in which GPX is deficient and investigate whether the mutant is highly susceptible to hyperoxia-induced pulmonary injury.The GPX gene in cultured human keratinocytes was activated by keratinocyte growth factor (i.e. fibroblast growth factor 7) (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). GPX may have a protective role during the skin wound healing process against reactive-oxygen species, which are mediators of tissue injury (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In the eye, the ciliary body and iris are severely damaged in inflammatory conditions but are regenerated to the original architecture within a few weeks after inflammation (35Peng B. Shichi H. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Wang J. Essner E. Shichi H. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1995; 63: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). GPX may play an important role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated in the inflammatory condition and in facilitating the repair process. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the GPX cDNA contains a single open reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 224 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 25,064 Da.

To investigate channel biogenesis, we disrupted the formation of these discrete functional domains with mutations, including an amino-terminal deletion, Δ97–196, which is likely to disrupt subunit oligomerization; D316K and K374E, which prevent proper folding of the voltage sensor; and E418K and C462K, which are likely to disrupt pore formation. We determined whether these mutant subunits undergo three previously identified assembly events as follows: 1) tetramerization of Shaker subunits, 2) assembly of Shaker (α) and cytoplasmic β subunits, and 3) association of the amino and carboxyl termini of adjacent Shaker subunits. Δ97–196 subunits failed to establish any of these quaternary interactions. The Δ97–196 deletion also prevented formation of the pore. The other mutant subunits assembled into tetramers and associated with the β subunit but did not establish proximity between the amino and carboxyl termini of adjacent subunits. The results indicate that oligomerization mediated by the amino terminus is required for subsequent pore formation and either precedes or is independent of folding of the voltage sensor. In contrast, the amino and carboxyl termini of adjacent subunits associate late during biogenesis. Because subunits with folding defects oligomerize, we conclude that Shaker channels need not assemble from pre-folded monomers. Furthermore, association with native subunits can weakly promote the proper folding of some mutant subunits, suggesting that steps of folding and assembly alternate during channel biogenesis.

The Shaker K+ channel is a member of the superfamily of voltage-dependent cation channels that control the excitability of nerve and muscle (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). In response to depolarization of the membrane, Shaker channels open, conduct K+, and then close by a fast inactivation process. During the biogenesis of voltage-dependent K+ channels such as Shaker, four α subunits assemble to form the aqueous pore for K+permeation (2MacKinnon R.

Many of the functional properties of the Shaker channel have been mapped onto the primary structure of the protein by electrophysiological and biochemical analysis of site-directed mutants. These studies suggest that the protein is organized in a modular fashion, with different regions responsible for subunit assembly, activation gating, ion conduction, and fast inactivation (Fig. 1 A). A conserved amino-terminal region corresponding to residues 97–196 has been implicated in controlling α-α and α-β subunit oligomerization (9Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Upon opening, the wild-type channel rapidly inactivates by a ball and chain mechanism, in which an amino-terminal region between residues 6 and 46 blocks the inner mouth of the pore, preventing further conduction (25Hoshi T.

Little is known about the steps of subunit folding and assembly that generate functional K+ channels. In this study, we investigate the pathway of channel biogenesis, focusing on assembly of the subunits, folding of the voltage sensor, and formation of the pore. The Shaker protein is made as an immature, core-glycosylated precursor in the ER,1 where it folds, acquires hallmarks of the native structure, and assembles into tetramers (8Nagaya N. Papazian D.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Upon transfer to the Golgi apparatus and processing of the oligosaccharide residues, the immature Shaker precursor is converted to the mature product (8Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol.

Maturation of the wild-type protein occurs efficiently in such diverse expression systems as Xenopus oocytes and cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (28Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Maturation is highly correlated with folding and assembly of Shaker subunits into a native conformation (13Papazian D.M.

Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A variety of site-directed mutations block maturation of the Shaker protein, trapping it in the ER in an immature form (13Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Seoh S.-A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys.

Such mutations are likely to disrupt proper folding or assembly of the channel protein, making it a substrate for the quality control and retention system of the ER (reviewed in Refs. 31Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar and 32Rowling P.J.E. Freedman R.B. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 41-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used mutations that block maturation to identify likely structural interactions in the Shaker channel (13Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Seoh S.-A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For instance, the mutant proteins D316K and K374E do not mature or form functional channels. These defects can be rescued by combining the two mutations in one subunit. The double mutant subunit K374E/D316K matures and incorporates efficiently into active channels, indicating that a native structure has been restored (18Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The two mutations do not suppress each other if they are located on separate subunits. These results indicate that D316K and K374E disrupt biogenesis by preventing the formation of a specific tertiary interaction between positions 316 and 374, located in the voltage sensor in transmembrane segments S3 and S4, respectively (18Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to providing insights into protein packing, mutations that disrupt folding and assembly provide an opportunity to investigate the pathway of channel biogenesis. Therefore, we have disrupted the formation of different functional domains by mutagenesis and determined the effects of these mutations on subunit assembly. We focused on five mutations that block maturation, located in three different functional domains. A deletion in the amino terminus, Δ97–196, removes a region previously implicated in subunit recognition and assembly (9Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The charge reversal mutations D316K and K374E disrupt folding of the voltage sensor, as described above (18Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The mutations E418K in the S5-P loop and C462K in S6 are located in the region of the pore and are good candidates to disrupt its formation. These mutants were evaluated for their ability to establish three previously identified quaternary interactions as follows: 1) tetramerization of Shaker α subunits; 2) assembly of Shaker α subunits and auxiliary β subunits (6Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); and 3) association between the amino and carboxyl termini of adjacent α subunits, known to be a structural feature of the native channel (5Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results of this investigation predict a tentative sequence of events during biogenesis and suggest that Shaker channels do not assemble from prefolded monomers. Rather, it is likely that folding and assembly steps alternate during channel biogenesis. Point mutations and Δ97–196, a deletion of amino acids 97–196, were engineered into a pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) subclone of the Shaker B cDNA (33Schwarz T.L. Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 331: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) using polymerase chain reaction methods (34Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Mutated regions were transferred into the wild-type subclone and verified by dideoxy sequencing. The Sh1–246 construct has been described previously (36Tang C.-Y. Schulteis C.T. Jiménez R.M. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1263-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, cRNA was transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were prepared and injected as described previously (37Timpe L.C. Schwarz T.L. Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 331: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The concentration of cRNA was determined by measuring absorption at 260 nm and confirmed by electrophoresis on denaturing agarose gels with an RNA ladder of known concentration (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transfection of mammalian cells, wild-type and mutant Shaker cDNA were transferred into a plasmid vector, pcDNA1/AMP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The Kvβ2 clone in the pRGB4 vector was the kind gift of Dr. J. Trimmer (38Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7084-7089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). DNA used for transfections was purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) (39DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.-M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) were grown, transfected as described previously (28Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and collected at 36–48 h post-transfection. For metabolic labeling, transfected cells were incubated for at least 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free medium and subsequently pulsed for 20 min in 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine (EasyTag Express Protein Labeling Mix, NEN Life Science Products). Cells were chased in complete media supplemented with 5 mm methionine. Ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4), supplemented with protease inhibitors as described previously (28Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was added directly to the tissue culture plates. The plates were rotated at 4 °C for 10 min, and the cells were collected by brief trituration. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. For electrophysiological analysis,Xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.25-5 ng of cRNA. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature (22–25 °C) in modified Barth's saline (37Timpe L.C. Schwarz T.L. Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 331: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), using a two-electrode voltage clamp (Warner Electronics, Hamden, CT). Data were acquired using pCLAMP version 5.5.1 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using pCLAMP and Microsoft Excel for Macintosh (version 5.0a). Statistical analysis was performed using InStat version 2.0.1 or Microsoft Excel. The significance of dominant negative experiments was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons. For biochemical analysis of protein, each oocyte was injected with 50–75 ng of cRNA and 500 nCi of [35S]methionine (in vitro translation grade; ICN, Irvine, CA). After 48 h incubation, the cells were lysed using a procedure modified from that described by Hollmann et al. (40Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were homogenized in buffer H (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors and rocked gently for 15 min at 4 °C. The majority of yolk proteins were removed by spinning for 2 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge, and the remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, oocyte membranes were isolated and solubilized in 2% Lubrol-PX as described previously (29Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The protein was then subjected to immunoprecipitation (29Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In some cases, oocytes were oxidized with 1 mm iodine prior to lysis as described previously (5Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Solubilized Shaker protein was incubated with 100 μm 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl-propionate) (DTSSP) (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of concentrated Tris-HCl, pH 8, to a final concentration of 100 mm, followed by incubation for another 30 min. Alternatively, intact Xenopus oocytes expressing Shaker protein were suspended in modified phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (5Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and incubated with 1 mm bismaleimidohexane (BMH) (Pierce), a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent, for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, followed by incubation for another 10 min. Immunoprecipitation of Shaker or Kvβ2 protein was performed as described previously (29Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using an antibody directed against the Shaker-β-galactosidase fusion protein (kind gift of Dr. L. Jan) (41Schwarz T.L. Papazian D.M. Carretto R.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 119-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or a peptide fragment of the Kvβ2 subunit (kind gift of Dr. J. Trimmer) (42Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer including either 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (reducing conditions) or 16 mm iodoacetamide (non-reducing conditions) and boiled for 3 min prior to electrophoresis on denaturing 5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels with 3 or 4% stacking gels (28Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, soaked in fluorographic enhancer, dried, and exposed to film. Shaker proteins mutated in different functional domains were expressed and metabolically labeled in Xenopusoocytes, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 1 B). As previously reported (26Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 30Perozo E. Santacruz-Toloza L. Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 345-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the Shaker-IR mutant, which contains a deletion of the inactivation ball and chain (residues 6–46), matures normally and generates functional channels. In contrast, mutations D316K in S3 and K374E in S4 prevent maturation by disrupting the folding of the voltage sensor (18Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have now characterized the maturation of Shaker proteins with mutations in the pore region (E418K in the S5-P loop and C462K in S6) and in the amino-terminal domain implicated in subunit recognition and assembly (Δ97–196). The Δ97–196, E418K, and C462K proteins did not form functional channels (data not shown) and failed to mature (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that proper formation of the assembly domain, the voltage sensor, and the pore are required for maturation, whereas the inactivation ball and chain can be deleted with no apparent detrimental effects on biogenesis. In the Δ97–196 mutant, the amino-terminal region implicated in controlling subunit assembly has been deleted (Fig. 1). The ability of Δ97–196 subunits to oligomerize was assessed in Xenopus oocytes using chemical cross-linking and dominant negative experiments. The wild-type and Δ97–196 proteins were solubilized in the detergent Lubrol and incubated with the reagent DTSSP, which reversibly cross-links primary amino groups. Upon treatment of the wild-type protein with DTSSP, three high molecular weight adducts corresponding to a dimer, trimer, and tetramer of Shaker protein were detected under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1). Under reducing conditions, which cleave the DTSSP cross-links, only the monomer band was observed. Upon treatment of the Δ97–196 protein with DTSSP, no adducts were observed under either reducing or non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2). Only the monomer band was detected. Significantly, no aggregated protein was observed at the top of the gel. These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal region between residues 97 and 196 is critical for the formation of detergent-stable tetramers of Shaker subunits. Furthermore, the data indicate that the Δ97–196 protein does not aggregate nonspecifically in detergent solution. To determine whether Δ97–196 subunits associate in the undisrupted environment of the ER membrane, Δ97–196 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and treated in situ with the membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent bismaleimidohexane (BMH). The mutant N259Q/N263Q, which makes unglycosylated Shaker subunits that assemble into active cell-surface channels (29Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was used as a control. Following immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis, high molecular weight adducts of N259Q/N263Q subunits were observed (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1). In contrast, no adducts or aggregates of Δ97–196 subunits were detected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2). These results suggest that Δ97–196 subunits do not associate or aggregate in the ER membrane. To investigate whether Δ97–196 subunits can associate with native Shaker subunits in vivo, we used a dominant negative strategy. It has been shown previously that fragments of Shaker protein that include the putative amino-terminal assembly domain suppress the functional activity of co-expressed, native, full-length subunits (9Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,36Tang C.-Y. Schulteis C.T. Jiménez R.M. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1263-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is because the amino-terminal fragment associates with the intact Shaker protein, preventing its incorporation into active cell-surface channels. cRNA encoding the Shaker-IR subunit, which forms functional channels lacking N-type (fast) inactivation (25Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), was injected alone or was co-injected with cRNA encoding the Δ97–196 subunit in molar ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:10. Shaker-IR current amplitudes in the absence or presence of co-expressed Δ97–196 subunits were determined at +40 mV using a two-electrode voltage clamp. No dominant negative effect was observed over the entire range of expression ratios (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that the Δ97–196 subunit is unable to oligomerize with native Shaker subunits. We conclude that the Δ97–196 mutation prevents the assembly of Shaker subunits. As demonstrated above, the interaction between amino-terminal assembly domains is critical for the oligomerization of Shaker subunits. In the native channel, however, additional intersubunit interactions must occur. For instance, a subunit is obliged to contact its neighbors around the K+-selective, aqueous pore. To determine whether subunit interactions around the pore can be detected in Δ97–196, we took advantage of the M448C mutation. Met-448 is located in a narrow part of the P region, at or near the center of symmetry of the pore (Fig. 1 A) (43Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Upon substitution with cysteine, an intersubunit disulfide bond between two 448 residues forms to generate a covalent dimer of Shaker subunits (43Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, this reaction occurs spontaneously whether the M448C protein is located on the cell surface or is retained in the ER by treatment with brefeldin A plus nocodazole. The M448C mutation was inserted into the Δ97–196 subunit, and the construct was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As a control, the M448C mutation was also inserted into the unglycosylated mutant N259Q/N263Q (29Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Intact cells were treated withN-ethylmaleimide to protect free sulfhydryl groups prior to lysis and solubilization. The Δ97–196/M448C and N259Q/N263Q/M448C proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3). In contrast to the N259Q/N263Q/M448C protein, no disulfide-linked dimers of Δ97–196/M448C protein were detected. These results indicate that prior oligomerization of the 97–196 domain is required for pore formation and suggest that other subunit interactions which must occur in the native state, including those around the pore, are insu"

After infection with Ad.Id1, neonatal cardiac myocytes display a significant reduction in viability, which was proportional to the level of Id1 expression. A similar effect was observed in adult myocytes. Morphological and biochemical assays demonstrated that Id1 expression resulted in myocyte apoptosis. In contrast, expression of Id1 in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, or fibroblasts did not affect the viability of these cells. Along with the induction of apoptosis, the expression of Id1 in neonatal cardiac myocytes resulted in an increase in the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. The source of these reactive oxygen species appears to be the mitochondria. Reducing the ambient oxygen concentration or treatment with a cell-permeant H2O2 scavenger prevented Id1-stimulated apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. These results suggest that the expression of Id1 leads to the induction of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes through a redox-dependent mechanism.

The Id family of proteins belongs to a class of nuclear proteins known as helix-loop-helix (HLH)1 proteins, which regulate differentiation and tissue-specific gene expression. To date, four different Id family members have been identified (1Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

Although these four proteins share a high degree of homology, especially within the HLH domain, evidence suggests that they exert nonoverlapping functions (7Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Ikayama H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2139-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Losorella A. Iavarone A. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell.

Genet. 1996; 18: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The HLH domain acts as a protein dimerization motif. Members of the HLH protein family which act to regulate transcription positively also contain an additional basic domain that mediates binding to DNA. In contrast, members of the Id family lack this domain and therefore are unable to bind DNA. These structural differences have led to a model in which Id proteins act in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit differentiation (1Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 2Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, expression of high levels of Id1 would result in the binding and subsequent inactivation of basic domain HLH proteins.Consistent with this model of Id function is the observation that Id expression decreases when skeletal muscle cells differentiate (10Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, forced expression of Id has been shown to inhibit tissue-specific gene expression or differentiation of a variety of cell types (1Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L.

Although Id expression is low or absent in adult cardiac myocytes in culture, its expression can be reactivated by certain stimuli, such as α-adrenergic agonists (14Springhorn J.P. Ellingsen O.

A similar induction of Id expression has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle after treatment with the cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (16Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although previous studies have demonstrated that forced expression of Id proteins can block differentiation, relatively little is known about the effects of Id expression in the context of a terminally differentiated cell phenotype. This is perhaps because of the difficulty of efficient gene transfer into most terminally differentiated cell types. The use of recombinant adenoviruses, which allows for high efficiency gene transfer, provides one strategy to address these issues in cardiac myocytes (18Guzman R.J. Lemarchand P. Crystal R.G. Epstein S.E. Finkel T. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Kirshenbaum L.A. MacLellan W.R. Mazur W. French B.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin.

These studies were motivated initially by the possibility that reexpression of Id in cardiac myocytes potentially could lead to a dedifferentiated phenotype and possible reentry into the cell cycle. Such results could have important potential therapeutic implications. In this report, however, we demonstrate that overexpression of Id1 in cardiac myocytes results in the induction of apoptosis.RESULTSIn an effort to induce efficient expressions of HLH proteins in cardiac myocytes, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus encoding Id1. Infection of neonatal ventricular myocytes with Ad.Id1 adenovirus resulted in an increase in the level of Id1 protein detected in myocyte lysates (Fig. 1). Whereas levels of Id were undetectable in uninfected myocytes or in myocytes infected with a control adenovirus (Ad.d1312), infection with Ad.Id1 adenovirus resulted in significant expression of Id1.We next assessed the biological effects of Id1 expression. Within 48–72 h after Ad.Id1 infection, there was a marked reduction in myocyte viability (Fig. 2). The reduction in viability was proportional to the m.o.i. and hence the level of Id1 expression (see also Fig. 4 A). In contrast, infection with the control adenovirus (Ad.d1312) did not affect cell viability.Figure 2Expression of Id1 results in a reduction in cardiac myocyte viability. Cells infected with the indicated m.o.i. of either Ad.d1312 (broken lines) or Ad.Id1 (solid lines) were assayed over 4 days for viability using XTT absorbance.

Cultures of Ad.d1312-infected cells and cells infected with Ad.Id1 were assessed using a fluorescence-based TUNEL assay. To confirm that only cardiac myocytes were analyzed, cells were counterstained with a Texas red-conjugated antibody recognizing myosin heavy chain. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 A, there were very few TUNEL-positive nuclei in control-infected myocytes. In contrast, myocytes infected with Ad.Id1 (Fig. 3 B) demonstrated a high percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. Quantification of TUNEL-positive nuclei obtained from three separate experiments demonstrated a marked increase in the Ad.Id1-infected cell cultures (Fig. 3 C). Direct measurement of cell death using an ELISA capable of detecting cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments also demonstrated significant Id1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 D).Figure 3Id1 induces neonatal myocyte apoptosis.Primary cultures of myocytes infected 72 h earlier with Ad.d1312 (panel A) or Ad.Id1 (panel B) were assayed with a fluorescence-based TUNEL assay. Apoptotic nuclei are green. Cultures were stained concurrently for the expression of the cytoplasmic myosin heavy chain (red). Panel C, quantification TUNEL-positive nuclei.

By light microscopy, the apoptotic cells appeared to round up, with evidence of membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation; electron micrographs of myocytes infected with Ad.Id1 demonstrated rounded cell shapes and highly condensed chromatins (see Fig. 3 B and data not shown).We next sought to assess whether the apoptotic effects of Id1 expression could be demonstrated in other cell types. Cultures of fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells were infected with a control virus or with Ad.Id1. All cell types were transduced efficiently by recombinant adenoviruses; however, the level of Id1 expression was less than what was observed in neonatal myocytes (Fig. 4 A). As demonstrated in Fig. 4 B, in these three different cell types there was no appreciable effect on viability after Ad.Id1 infection. Although these differences in viability may merely reflect differences in the absolute level of expression, it should be noted that the level of Id1 expression appeared to be higher in these other cell types infected at 100 m.o.i. than in neonatal cardiac myocytes infected at 25 m.o.i. Nonetheless, myocytes infected at 25 m.o.i. have a reduction in cell viability (see Fig. 2), whereas there was no cell death observed in the other cell types when infected at either 100 m.o.i. (Fig. 4 B) or at 200 m.o.i. (data not shown). These results suggest that the apoptotic effects of Id1 may have different thresholds in different cell types.One significant difference between cardiac myocytes and the other cell types tested is their limited capacity for cell division. We thought it possible, therefore, that Id1 may induce apoptosis only in nondividing cells. To explore this possibility, we infected confluent growth-arrested endothelial cells. Under these conditions, there is little if any endothelial cell division, and there is no effect of Id1 on cell viability (Fig. 4 C).Previous experiments have demonstrated that ROS may participate in apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 30Jacobson M.D. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In particular, expression of wild-type p53 results in the initiation of a redox-dependent apoptotic program in certain cell types (31Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 32Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Given these previous observations, we next sought to assess whether Id1 expression altered the redox state of cells. Using the peroxide-sensitive fluorophore DCF, levels of intracellular hydrogen peroxide were assessed. Two days after infection, cardiac myocytes infected with Ad.Id1 demonstrated a 2–4-fold increase in the level of DCF fluorescence compared with cells infected with the control virus (Fig. 5 A and B). In contrast, in endothelial cells, which do not undergo apoptosis after Ad.Id1 infection, there was no comparable increase in DCF fluorescence after Id1 expression (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Idl affects the level of ROS in myocytes.

Theasterisk (*) indicates p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next sought to determine the source of Id1-induced ROS production. A variety of evidence has suggested that under basal conditions the mitochondria are the predominant source of ROS and that these organelles are also responsible for the increase in ROS seen during apoptotic conditions (for review, see Ref. 33Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Consistent with the mitochondria being the source of ROS, when Id1-infected cells were treated with rotenone, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport, the increase in cytosolic DCF fluorescence was abolished (Fig. 6 A). We next assessed the mitochondrial ROS level directly using the fluorophore DHR123, which is taken up selectively by mitochondria and converts to a fluorescent moiety by mitochondrial ROS. As seen in Fig. 6,B and C, compared with control cells, Ad.Id1-infected cells had higher levels of DHR123 fluorescence. Quantification of DHR123 from control and Id1-expressing cells demonstrated an approximate 2–3-fold rise in DHR123 fluorescence after Ad.Id1 infection (Fig. 6 D).Figure 6Id1 increases the level of mitochondrial ROS. Panel A, levels of DCF fluorescence in the presence or absence of the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone (1 μm). Panel B, level of DHR123 fluorescence in Ad.d1312-infected cells or (panel C) Ad.Id1-infected cells. Panel D, quantification of DHR123 fluorescence (arbitrary units) from approximately 60 random cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To understand the significance of the rise in ROS after Ad.Id1 infection of cardiac myocytes, we made use of the observation that the formation of ROS is a function of ambient oxygen tension (34Shigeomi S. Eguchi Y. Kisaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 35Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). If the rise in ROS was essential for Id1-induced apoptosis, then lowering the ambient oxygen concentration should protect the cells. Therefore, cells infected with Ad.Id1 or a control adenovirus were grown in a 1%, 5%, or the standard 20% oxygen environment. Consistent with the observation that Id1 results in an increase in oxidative stress, measurement of lipid peroxide levels demonstrated a significant rise after Ad.Id1 infection (Fig. 7). Lowering the level of ambient oxygen, consistent with the known ability of oxygen to regulate ROS levels, resulted in a decreasing amount of lipid peroxide generation after Id1 expression.Figure 7Id1 increases the level of lipid peroxides. Levels of lipid peroxides were measured in neonatal myocytes infected with either Ad.d1312 or Ad.Id1 that had been incubated in the indicated level of ambient oxygen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To understand whether the rise in ROS was important in the ability of Id1 to induce apoptosis, we assessed cell viability under different O2 levels. As demonstrated in Fig. 8 A, lowering the ambient O2 level to 1% resulted in a significant rescue in cell viability of Id1-infected cells. Similarly, direct measurement of the level of apoptosis demonstrated that lowering the ambient oxygen lowered the rate of apoptosis (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8The apoptotic effects of Id1 are inhibited by lowering ROS levels. Panel A, cultures of cardiac myocytes were infected with Ad.d1312 or Ad.Id1 and transferred to a 1%, 5%, or 20% O2 environment. Cell viability was assessed 3 days after infection.

We observed toxicity when neonatal myocytes were exposed to either N-acetylcysteine or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. A similar toxic effect has been observed previously in other cell types (36Tsai J.- C. Jain M. Hsich C.- M. Lee W.- S. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Perella M.A. Cooke C. Wang H. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.- E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3667-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with pyruvate, a known scavenger of hydrogen peroxide (37Zhong W.X. Oberley L.W. Yan T. Domann F.E. St. Clair D.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1175-1186PubMed Google Scholar, 38Guidarelli A. Brambilla L. Cattabeni F. Cantoni O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9060-9067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in significant protection from Id1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8 C).Finally, we sought to understand if similar results were obtainable in adult myocytes. In contrast to neonatal myocytes the level of apoptosis under basal conditions was approximately 5-fold higher in adult myocytes. Nonetheless, as demonstrated in Fig. 9, expression of Id1 resulted in an increase in the level of apoptosis. Although the magnitude of this effect was smaller, as in neonatal cells, treatment with the H2O2 scavenger pyruvate had a protective effect on both control and Id1-expressing cells. This may suggest that ROS may also play a role in the elevated basal rate of apoptosis observed in adult myocytes.Figure 9Id1 expression increases adult cardiac myocyte cell death.

Previous experiments have demonstrated that in the myoblast cell line C2C12, it is difficult to express Id l stably (10Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These results suggest a potential growth-inhibitory or apoptotic effect of Id1 in these skeletal muscle cells. In contrast, other studies using different cell lines suggest that expression of Id1 can be achieved readily (9Hara I. Uzman J.A. Dimri G.P. Nehlin J.O. Testori A. Campisi J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Kreider B.L. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T.

Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that high level expression of Id1 can, in certain cell types, result in apoptosis. It should be noted that in the course of these experiments another report reached a similar conclusion, namely that overexpression of Id3 could induce apoptosis in serum-starved embryonic fibroblasts (42Norton D.J. Atherton G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2371-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In many experimental situations, apoptosis is accompanied by a rise in intracellular ROS (30Jacobson M.D. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Perhaps the system most relevant to the present results is the previous demonstration using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of wild-type p53 to normal smooth muscle cells (31Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) or transformed epithelial cell lines (32Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that human smooth muscle cells but not rat smooth muscle cells undergo apoptosis after p53 overexpression. The sensitivity to p53-mediated apoptosis correlated with the ability of p53 expression to increase the level of intracellular ROS (31Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p53 changes intracellular ROS levels appears to be related, at least in part, to its ability to alter the levels of gene products that function to regulate the redox state (32Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Inhibiting the rise in ROS levels in each system dramatically inhibits the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis.A rise in ROS preceding the onset of apoptosis appears to be a common but not universal (30Jacobson M.D. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 34Shigeomi S. Eguchi Y. Kisaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y.

It is conceivable that Id1 functions to alter the redox state of cells by changing the level of p53. However, Western blot analysis of Ad.Id1-infected myocytes demonstrated no change in the amount of p53. 2K. Tanaka and T. Finkel, unpublished observations. Although apoptosis is accompanied by a rise in ROS levels, it is difficult to prove that such a rise is the cause rather than a consequence of cell death. Nonetheless, our experiments in low ambient O2 conditions as well as with the peroxide scavenger pyruvate support the concept that ROS are important mediators of apoptosis.Previous studies have demonstrated that in adult myocytes, levels of Id are low but can be stimulated significantly by maintaining adult myocytes in culture and even more rapidly by agents such as phenylephrine (14Springhorn J.P. Ellingsen O. Berger H.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14360-14365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Evans S.M. Walsh B.A. Newton C.B. Thorburn J.S. Gardner P.D. van Bilsen M. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reexpression of Id gene products may be one reason why we observed a higher level of apoptosis in adult rather than neonatal myocytes. Expression of Id in this in vitrosituation correlates with the reexpression of neonatal gene products, such as prepro-atrial natriuretic protein and skeletal muscle α-actin. It is interesting to note that, clinically, heart failure is accompanied by a similar reexpression of fetal gene products. In addition, recent studies suggest that the failing heart is characterized by an increase in oxidative stress (43Dhalla A.K. Singal P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1280-H1285Google Scholar, 44Dhalla A.K. Hill M.F. Singal P.K. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 506-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the numbers of apoptotic cells (45Narula J. Haider N. Virmani R. Di Salvo T.G. Kolodgic F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.

It is tempting to speculate that these three presumably unrelated findings, i.e. the expression of dedifferentiated gene products, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, may be potentially related through the reactivation of Id1 expression in the failing myocardium. The Id family of proteins belongs to a class of nuclear proteins known as helix-loop-helix (HLH)1 proteins, which regulate differentiation and tissue-specific gene expression. To date, four different Id family members have been identified (1Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full T"

The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which has its active site exposed on the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), catalyzes the transfer of preassembled high mannose oligosaccharides onto certain asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides. The mammalian OST complex was initially thought to be composed of three transmembrane proteins, ribophorin I (RI), ribophorin II (RII), and OST48. Most recently, a small integral membrane protein of 12 kDa called DAD1 has been identified as an additional member of the mammalian OST complex. A point mutation in the DAD1 gene is responsible for the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a baby hamster kidney-derived cell line (tsBN7) that undergoes apoptosis at the non-permissive temperature. Furthermore, the mutant protein DAD1 is not detectable in tsBN7 cells 6 h after shifting the cells to the non-permissive temperature. This temperature-sensitive cell line offered unique opportunities to study the effects caused by the loss of one OST subunit on the other three subunits and also on N-linked glycosylation. Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed that after 6 h at the non-permissive temperature, steady-state levels of the ribophorins were reduced by about 50%, and OST48 was barely detectable. On the other hand, steady-state levels of other components of the rough ER, such as the α-subunits of the TRAP (translocon-associated membrane protein) and the Sec61 complex, which are components of the translocation apparatus, are not affected by the instability of the OST subunits. Furthermore,N-glycosylation of the ribophorins was seriously affected 6 h after shifting the cells to the non-permissive temperature, and after 12 h they were synthesized only in the non-glycosylated form. As may be expected, this defect in the OST complex at the non-permissive temperature caused also the underglycosylation of a secretory glycoprotein. We concluded that degradation of DAD1 at the non-permissive temperature not only affects the stability of OST48 and the ribophorins but also results in the functional inactivation of the OST complex.

Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 464-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as a 48-kDa membrane protein named OST48 (11Silberstein S. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RI and OST48 are type I transmembrane proteins with large luminally oriented amino-terminal domains (11Silberstein S. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I.

Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RII has also a large luminal domain, but the disposition of its cytoplasmic domain is less clear (12Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Pirozzi G. Zhou Z. D'Eustachio P. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although the COOH-terminal portion contains three hydrophobic domains, only the one most proximal to the N terminus is of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to function as a typical transmembrane domain. RII may, therefore, assume a type I disposition like RI and OST48. The yeast OST complex is apparently composed of seven non-identical polypeptides (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two of the subunits, Wbp1 (15te Heesen S. Rauhut R. Aebersold R. Abelson J. Aebi M. Clark M.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 8-18PubMed Google Scholar) and Sw1p (16te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), were identified and characterized prior to the purification of the enzyme, and both proteins were shown to be essential for the glycosylation of proteins (16te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ost1p, another subunit of the yeast OST complex, was also shown to be essential for the N-linked glycosylation of proteins in vivoand for oligosaccharide transfer to an acceptor polypeptide in vitro (18Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein sequence comparison established homologies between OST48 and Wbp1p, RII and Sw1p, and RI and Ost1p (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, three subunits of the yeast OST complex are homologous to three well characterized subunits of the mammalian OST complex. Recently, a polypeptide of 16 kDa named Ost2p was identified as part of the yeast OST complex (19Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); Ost2p is 40% identical in sequence with the human protein DAD1 (defender against apoptoticdeath) (20Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima Y. Shibata S. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The extensive sequence homology between DAD1 and Ost2p and the in vivo and in vitro evidence demonstrating that Ost2p is an essential subunit of the yeast OST complex suggested that DAD1 represents a possible fourth subunit of the vertebrate complex (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This was recently confirmed as DAD1 copurifies with the other three OST subunits and can be chemically cross-linked to them (4Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This conclusion was also supported by experiments from our laboratory demonstrating that the cytoplasmically exposed amino-terminal tail of DAD1 interacts with the C terminus of OST48 (21Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Mol. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29687-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar).DAD1 was initially identified as a negative regulator of apoptosis in a temperature-sensitive mutant hamster cell line (tsBN7) (20Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima Y. Shibata S. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mutant DAD1 protein contains a single amino acid substitution, which results in its rapid degradation at the non-permissive temperature, such that the protein can no longer be detected after 6 h. This degradation of DAD1 precedes the onset of apoptosis, suggesting that it may be the event that triggers programmed cell death. The tsBN7 cells could be rescued at the non-permissive temperature upon transfection with the DAD1 wild-type gene (20Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima Y. Shibata S. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that this membrane protein assumes a U-loop disposition in the ER membrane with both the N and C termini exposed at the cytoplasmic surface. Furthermore, at the non-permissive temperatureN-glycosylation was suppressed (22Makishima T. Nakashima T. Nagata-Kuno K. Fukushima K. Iida H. Sakaguchi M. Ikehora Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We became interested in the tsBN7 cell line as it offered an opportunity to analyze the effects of the deletion of one of the OST subunits on the stability of other subunits and also on the enzymatic activity of the whole complex. The results of this study demonstrate that DAD1 is an essential component of the OST complex and that its loss causes the rapid degradation of OST48 and, also to a lesser extent, of the ribophorins. As might be expected, the degradation of the OST subunits is accompanied by a complete loss of the N-glycosylation activity.DISCUSSIONThe major finding obtained from this study is that DAD1, the recently identified fourth subunit of the mammalian OST complex (4Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,22Makishima T. Nakashima T. Nagata-Kuno K. Fukushima K. Iida H. Sakaguchi M. Ikehora Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is required for the functional and structural integrity of the oligosaccharyltransferase. We have shown that when tsBN7 cells, which harbor a temperature-sensitive mutation in the DAD1 gene, are grown at the non-permissive temperature, steady-state levels of RI and RII are significantly reduced, and OST48 is reduced to barely detectable levels 6 h after the temperature shift. As the mutation, rendering DAD1 unstable at the non-permissive temperature, has a comparable effect on the stability of OST48, one may suspect that OST48 interacts physically with DAD1. Alternatively, the rapid degradation may be a reflection of the intrinsic susceptibility of the unassembled subunit toward degradative mechanisms. The former conclusion is supported by experiments where interactions among the OST subunits were identified using the yeast two-hybrid assay (21Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Mol. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29687-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was shown that DAD1 is directly linked via its amino-terminal domain to the short cytoplasmic segment of OST48. On the other hand, the luminal domains of both RI and RII interact with that of OST48 in such a way that the ribophorins are only indirectly connected to the DAD1 protein. Similar conclusions were reached from chemical cross-linking experiments on the isolated mammalian OST complex (4Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), although specific interacting domains could not be determined in this way. Support for interactions between DAD1 and OST48 was also obtained from genetic tests and chemical cross-linking experiments affecting the yeast homologs (16te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies performed on the yeast OST, which contains apparently seven subunits (8Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that the OST2 gene, which is homologous to DAD1, is a suppressor of a mutation in the WBP1 gene (OST48 in mammals) and that overexpression of Ost2p increases the stability of Wbp1p as well as that of the RII homolog Swp1p (19Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Accordingly, overexpression of SWP1 results in the suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of WBP1 (16te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Although about 30% of the tsBN7 cells cultured for 24 h at 39.5 °C are at a late state of apoptosis (Fig. 1), there is no change in the rate of synthesis of RI, suggesting that basic metabolic functions are not yet impaired and that the decrease in the steady-state levels of the OST subunits is a consequence of their accelerated rate of degradation at the non-permissive temperature. After culturing tsBN7 cells for 12 h at 39.5 °C,N-glycosylation of RI was completely suppressed, despite the fact that the steady-state levels of both ribophorins were still about 50% compared with cells grown at 33 °C. This indicates that OST48 and DAD1, subunits of the OST that have almost completely disappeared after 6 h, are needed for the functioning of the oligosaccharyltransferase. This is in agreement with the finding that the yeast OST subunits Wbp1p and Ost2p, which are homologous to OST48 and DAD1, respectively, are both essential gene products, and their deletion affects N-glycosylation (15te Heesen S. Rauhut R. Aebersold R. Abelson J. Aebi M. Clark M.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 8-18PubMed Google Scholar, 19Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In yeast, the genes encoding the OST subunits Ost1p and Swp1p are also essential (17te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,18Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); therefore, it may be expected that the same is true for RI and RII in the mammalian OST complex. According to our yeast two-hybrid assays, where we tested for interactions among the OST subunits, it was found that the two ribophorins do not interact directly with each other, but instead RI and RII interact with OST48 via their luminal domains. Degradation of OST48 is therefore expected to have deleterious effects on the structure and stability of the ribophorins and, therefore, on their function.Because the active site of the OST complex is located at the luminal side of the ER (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), inhibition of N-glycosylation in tsBN7 cells at the non-permissive temperature is not expected to interfere with the insertion into, and the translocation across the ER of soluble or membrane proteins. In fact, it has been shown that purified Sec61p, which represents apparently the core of the translocation apparatus, can accomplish polypeptide translocation in the absence of N-glycosylation when reconstituted into lipid vesicles (for review, see Ref. 34Rapoport T. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1966; 65: 271-303Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Our experiments have demonstrated that despite the biochemical evidence for a tight interaction between the OST complex and Sec61p (32Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), destabilization of the subunits of the OST complex at the non-permissive temperature does not affect the steady-state concentration of the alpha subunit of the Sec61 complex. This is apparently a reflection of the fact that the two complexes represent distinct oligomers that can be purified as such (3Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Inhibition of N-glycosylation may, however, result in the misfolding of proteins (35Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar), which causes an induction of BiP in the ER lumen of tsBN7 cells.The DAD1 protein was initially characterized as an integral membrane protein that suppresses apoptotic cell death, as a specific point mutation in the DAD1 gene triggered programmed cell death at the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 1; see also Ref. 20Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima Y. Shibata S. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The time lag between complete degradation of the DAD1 protein (6 h) and onset of apoptosis (24 h) suggested an indirect effect on apoptosis. It is plausible that the accumulation of underglycosylated and malfolded proteins made in the absence of DAD1 (and OST48) causes a stress response from the ER (35Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar), leading to the activation of certain genes that ultimately result in programmed cell death. In fact, we have shown earlier (36Wang X.-Z. Lawson B. Brewer J. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.-J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ren D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1966; 16: 4273-4280Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar) that levels of CHOP, a transcription factor that is activated by agents that adversely affect the folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, are elevated in tsBN7 cells at the non-permissive temperature. It was found that CHOP levels peak at 6 h and taper off after 24 h (36Wang X.-Z. Lawson B. Brewer J. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.-J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ren D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1966; 16: 4273-4280Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). That inhibition of N-glycosylation may indeed lead to apoptosis, albeit by an indirect mechanism, is also supported by experiments where HL-60 cells from a human premyelocytic cell line were treated with tunicamycin, a drug that interferes with the synthesis of the dolichol pyrophosphate oligosaccharide (37Perez-Sala D. Mollined F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this case, the substrate for the oligosaccharyltransferase, dolichol pyrophosphate oligosaccharide, is not made, resulting in the suppression of N-glycosylation of newly synthesized polypeptides. The latter effect is obtained in tsBN7 cells grown at the non-permissive temperature due to degradation of the subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. Loss of N-glycosylation activity may result in the accumulation of under- and non-glycosylated proteins that may not fold properly and, therefore, do not exit from the ER (35Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar). We have in fact demonstrated that the underglycosylated form of the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), which was used as a reporter protein for theN-glycosylation activity of the OST complex, does not exit from the ER. It seems, therefore, either that a specificN-glycosylated protein is required to suppress apoptosis or that a nonspecific accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the ER initiates the apoptotic response. Asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins is a highly conserved cotranslational modification reaction that occurs in all eukaryotic organisms. The process is initiated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and follows a highly conserved pathway. A core oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is first assembled on the lipid carrier dolichol pyrophosphate and then transferreden bloc to asparagine residues within the acceptor-sequenced Asn-X-Ser/Thr of nascent polypeptide chains. This final reaction in the N-linked glycosylation process is catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST)1 complex (1Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M.B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 453-459Google Scholar, 2Silberstein S. Gilmore R.

Although the COOH-terminal portion contains three hydrophobic domains, only the one most proximal to the N terminus is of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to function as a typical transmembrane domain. RII may, therefore, assume a type I disposition like RI and OST48. The yeast OST complex is apparently composed of seven non-identical polypeptides (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R.

Recently, a polypeptide of 16 kDa named Ost2p was identified as part of the yeast OST complex (19Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J.

https://openalex.org/W1967204377,"L1210/D3 mouse leukemia cells are resistant to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate due to expansion of cellular folate pools which block polyglutamation of the drug (Tse, A., and Moran, R. G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25944-25952). These cells were found to have two point mutations in the reduced folate carrier (RFC), resulting in a replacement of isoleucine 48 by phenylalanine and of tryptophan 105 by glycine. Each mutation contributes to the resistance phenotype. Genomic DNA from resistant cells contained both the wild-type and mutant alleles, but wild-type message was not detected. Folic acid was a much better substrate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was a poorer substrate for transport in L1210/D3 cells relative to L1210 cells. Enhanced transport of folic acid was due to a marked, ≈20-fold, decrease in the influxK m. Influx of methotrexate and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate were minimally altered. Transfection of mutated rfc cDNA into RFC-null L1210/A cells produced the substrate specificity and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate resistance observed in the L1210/D3 line. Transfection of the mutant cDNA into wild-type cells also conferred resistance to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate. We conclude that the I48F and W105G mutations in RFC caused resistance to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, that the region of the RFC protein near these two positions defines the substrate-binding site, that the wild-type allele was silenced during the multistep development of resistance, and that this mutant phenotype represents a genetically dominant trait. L1210/D3 mouse leukemia cells are resistant to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate due to expansion of cellular folate pools which block polyglutamation of the drug (Tse, A., and Moran, R. G. (1998) J.

Folic acid was a much better substrate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was a poorer substrate for transport in L1210/D3 cells relative to L1210 cells. Enhanced transport of folic acid was due to a marked, ≈20-fold, decrease in the influxK m. Influx of methotrexate and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate were minimally altered. Transfection of mutated rfc cDNA into RFC-null L1210/A cells produced the substrate specificity and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate resistance observed in the L1210/D3 line. Transfection of the mutant cDNA into wild-type cells also conferred resistance to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate. We conclude that the I48F and W105G mutations in RFC caused resistance to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, that the region of the RFC protein near these two positions defines the substrate-binding site, that the wild-type allele was silenced during the multistep development of resistance, and that this mutant phenotype represents a genetically dominant trait. 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase methotrexate polymerase chain reaction reduced folate carrier reduced folate carrier gene folate-binding protein base pair(s) high performance liquid chromatography nucleotide(s). 5,10-Dideazatetrahydrofolate (DDATHF)1 is the prototypical folate antimetabolite inhibitory to de novo purine synthesis (2Taylor E.C. Harrington P.J. Fletcher S.R. Beardsley G.P. Moran R.G. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the step of de novo purine synthesis affected by (6R)-DDATHF is the first folate-dependent enzyme of this pathway, glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT)(3, 4). In the accompanying article (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we describe the characteristics of an unusual cell line, the L1210/D3, that was originally selected for resistance to (6R,6S)-DDATHF. This cell was highly resistant to (6R)-DDATHF, but only in culture conditions under which cellular folate metabolism is supported by folic acid in the medium; during growth on folinic acid, L1210/D3 cells are actually more sensitive to (6R)-DDATHF than were the wild-type mouse L1210 cells from which they were derived. We demonstrated that there is an alteration in the membrane transport of folic acid in the L1210/D3 cells, which causes a substantial expansion of the cellular pool of folate cofactors, and that this expanded folate pool blocks the metabolism of (6R)-DDATHF to its polyglutamates. In the present article, we prove that the reduced folate carrier (RFC) transport system is responsible for the drug-resistant phenotype of the L1210/D3 cell and that the substrate specificity of this transporter in the resistant cells is subtly modified by two point mutations in therfc gene. Transfection experiments reveal that each mutation contributes part of the phenotype, and that the resistance can be transferred to either cells lacking a functional reduced folate transport system or to wild-type L1210 cells. That is, these transfection experiments demonstrate that the point mutations in therfc gene are causative of the phenotype of the L1210/D3 cells and that this phenotype represents a genetically dominant trait. Monensin and methotrexate were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and Sigma, respectively. (6R)-DDATHF and chemically synthesized (6R)-DDATHF polyglutamate standards were kindly provided by Dr. Chuan Shih of Eli Lilly Research Laboratories. (6R)-[3H]DDATHF was prepared by coupling [3,4-3H]glutamic acid with 5,10-dideazapteroic acid as described in the accompanying article (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). [3′,5′,7-3H]Methotrexate (MTX), (6S)-[3′,5′,7,9-3H]5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Mycoplasma-free mouse L1210 cells were passaged in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum in the presence of increasing concentrations of (6R,6S)-DDATHF until the culture resumed the same growth rate as a parallel culture maintained without drug. This process was repeated at progressively higher drug concentration until a cell line capable of growth in 3 μm(6R,6S)-DDATHF was obtained; this line, which was denoted as L1210/D3, was then cloned in soft agarose and frozen. The characteristics and derivation of L1210/D3 cells and of L1210/D0.5, a cloned intermediate cell line capable of growth in 0.5 but not 3 μm (6R,6S)-DDATHF, are described in detail in the accompanying article (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). L1210/A cells (5Schuetz J.D. Westin E.H. Matherly L.H. Pincus R. Swetlow P.S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16261-16267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had been isolated by selection of parental L1210 cells with methotrexate and were cloned by limiting dilution; they were kindly provided for these experiments by Dr. I. David Goldman of Albert Einstein Cancer Center as was a line of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells which overexpress folate-binding protein isotype β (FBP-β) (6Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were transferred to drug-containing medium in 24-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 104/ml in a total volume of 1.5 ml. Culture density was determined after 72 h at 37 °C (N) and compared with the density of wells determined at time 0 (N o) and cell growth data were presented as the ratio of these culture densities. IC50 values were determined by interpolation as described previously (7Keyomarsi K. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5229-5235PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of folic acid required to support the growth of cells was determined as described previously (8Moran R.G. Werkheiser W.C. Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3569-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total folate pool measurements were determined as described previously (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Moran R.G. Werkheiser W.C. Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3569-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA from cell lines was extracted using the Triazol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), denatured with glyoxal, and separated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Biotrans, ICN, Irvine, CA) and hybridized with either a probe representing a 700-bpSmaI/EcoRI fragment of the 1800-bp mouserfc cDNA isolated as described below, a gel-isolated 500-bp SacI fragment of the cDNA for the mouse FBP-α cDNA or a 700-bp BamHI fragment of the FBP-β coding sequence (6Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Westin E.H. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Probes were random labeled to a specific activity of about 2 × 109 cpm/μg and were used at 1 μCi/ml of hybridization solution (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA). Blots were hybridized at 65 °C and washed to a stringency of 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C; a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (ATCC 57090) was used to normalize for RNA loading. Transport of (6R)-DDATHF, MTX, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and folic acid was studied using the method described in the accompanying article (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The transport buffer contained 107 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.9 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 7 mmd-glucose, and had a pH of 7.4 at 37 °C (9Sirotnak F.M. Goutas L.J. Jacobsen D.M. Mines L.S. Barrueco J.R. Gaumont Y. Kisliuk R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). (6R)-[3H]DDATHF was brought to >98% purity by reversed phase HPLC in a paired ion system, followed by removal of the tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate on a 1-ml column of anion exchanger (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). (6S)-[3H]5-Formyltetrahydrofolate and [3H]folic acid were purified on a 3 μm10-cm reverse phase HPLC column eluted with a shallow gradient of methanol in 0.03 m sodium acetate (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). [3H]MTX was purified on the same HPLC system eluted with a 12–15% methanol gradient in 0.03 m sodium acetate over 15 min. Transport rates of (6R)-DDATHF, MTX, and folic acid were constant for approximately 6, 4, and 6 min, respectively, and initial velocities were measured at 37 °C over 4, 2, and 2 min for these various transport substrates. For folic acid transport experiments, cells were preincubated with 10 μmtrimetrexate for 10 min at 37 °C to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (10Assaraf Y. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), then thymidine and hypoxanthine were added to a final concentration of 5.6 and 32 μm, respectively, and transport measurements were immediately performed in the presence of these compounds. For some experiments, cells were pretreated with 10 μm monensin for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed once before the transport of folic acid was initiated. Transport of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was measured over a 1-min period of influx to approximate initial velocities. In these experiments, (6S)-[3H]5-formyltetrahydrofolate was added to a mixture of unlabeled (6R,6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and kinetic constants were calculated based on the concentration of the (6S)-diastereomer in the mixture. Kinetic constants were derived by analysis of primary data using the Enzfitter program (Elsevier Biosoft, Inc.). The coding region for therfc gene expressed in wild-type and mutant L1210 cells was isolated by reverse transcription of mRNA followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells by a single step acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (11Puissan C. Houdebine L.M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149PubMed Google Scholar) and the samples were selected for the presence of a poly(A+) tract using a FastTrack kit (Promega). The poly(A+) RNA was reverse transcribed by extension with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Gibco Biologicals, Inc., Grand Island, NY) of a gene-specific antisense primer complementary to a sequence located in the 3′-untranslated region of the published (12Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA: 5′-CATGAAGTAGGCTGGGTTTAG-3′; reverse transcribed cDNA was purified on a GlassMAX cartridge essentially as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The PCR was run on an aliquot of this cDNA using 3 units of Taqpolymerase and 180 ng of each primer (forward, 5′-TGATGGATCCTGAGACCTGGGCAACATG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GTCACTCGAGTCAGAAGGATAAGC-3′) in a 60-μl reaction containing 1.5 mm MgCl2. The gene-specific portions of these primers (underlined) are preceded by BamHI and XhoI sites for the forward and reverse primers, respectively; these restriction sites were designed for construction and directional cloning of cDNAs containing each of the two mutations found in the L1210/D3 cells (see below). The PCR conditions used after an initial denaturation at 93 °C for 3 min, consisted of four cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 1 min, 52 °C annealing for 1 min, and 4 min of extension at 72 °C, followed by 30 cycles in which the annealing temperature was raised to 58 °C, and finally a 5-min extension at 72 °C. A 1800-bp PCR fragment which spanned nt −14 to 1766 2Nucleotide 1 by this numbering is the A of the published (12Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) translational start codon. of the published mouse rfc cDNA was gel purified and isolated on glass powder, then ligated into the pCRII vector (Stratagene). Individual colonies were picked, colonies with an 1800-bp insert were selected by colony PCR, and the identity of the inserts were corroborated by digestion of the colony PCR products withSmaI. The complete sequence of three clones from L1210 cells and of seven clones from L1210/D3 cells were determined by manual dideoxysequencing using Sequenase 2.0. Deviations from the published (12Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequence were verified by sequencing runs from the opposite direction. A cloned, PCR-derived cDNA for the rfc gene from both L1210 and from L1210/D3 cells was excised from the pCRII vector with BamHI, gel purified, and religated into the pcDNAIII vector cut with this same enzyme. These cDNA clones were sequenced in their entirety and were free from PCR-derived fidelity errors. Likewise, cDNA expression plasmids containing only single mutations of the two found in L1210/D3 cells (see “Results”) were prepared as follows: one cDNA clone in pCRII derived from L1210 cells and a second clone from L1210/D3 cells were selected based on the criterion of being free from random PCR-derived fidelity errors (see below). These clones were digested with XhoI, BamHI, and PstI, which allowed the isolation of the 1800-bp coding region of therfc cDNA as two fragments. These fragments were a 300-bpPstI-BamHI fragment containing the codon 48 mutation found in the rfc cDNA from L1210/D3 cells, and a 1500-bp fragment which contained the remainder of the cDNA for the RFC coding region, including the codon 105 mutation found in L1210/D3 cells. These two fragments were gel-purified and one mutant fragment from L1210/D3 cells was mixed with the opposite fragment from L1210 cells and the mixtures were used in triple ligations into pcDNAIII, allowing the construction of identically cloned expression plasmids containing each of the two mutations one at a time. The regions of each mutation and restriction endonuclease digestion were sequenced in each construct to confirm their identity. The pcDNAIII constructs were not found to allow good expression in the L1210 cell, so that, subsequently, the cloned RFC constructs were released from the pcDNAIII vector with BamHI and XhoI, the fragments were gel isolated, treated with Klenow fragment, and ligated into the pTK-PGK vector (13Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) which had been linearized with Ecl136II. This vector placed the expression of the RFC constructs under the murine phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and also contained a neomycin resistance cassette.Escherichia coli strain MC/1061/P3 were transfected with these plasmids, and the orientation of the insert was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and a subsequent sequencing run. The function of wild-type and mutant RFC proteins was studied in clonal cell lines constructed from L1210 and L1210/A cells transfected with the corresponding cDNAs. Exponentially growing recipient cells were harvested and washed once with serum-free medium, then resuspended at a final density of 1 × 107 cells in 0.8 ml of DEAE-dextran buffer containing 40 μg of plasmid pTK-PGK or with the same plasmid containing an insert representing wild-type, double mutant, or single mutant rfc cDNAs. The suspensions were subjected to electroporation at 250 V and 350 microfarads, following which each transfection mixture was brought to 10 ml with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% serum, and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 36 h. Each culture was then adjusted to 1 × 105cells/ml in complete medium containing 0.75 mg/ml active G418 and 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20,000 cells were distributed into each well of five 96-well plates. For each transfection, cell growth occurred in 10–15 of these wells after 8–10 days; cells from multiple wells were expanded for further analysis. Transfectants constructed from L1210/A cells were screened first for their ability to grow in 0.2 μm MTX and cultures which proved sensitive to MTX in this test were judged to express the transfected rfcgene. For each series, RNA was prepared from 6–10 such cultures and the levels of expression of the endogenous and transfectedrfc genes and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined by Northern blotting and quantitation with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Both endogenous and exogenous rfctranscripts could be quantitated in these screens and were easily separable, due to the different sizes caused by the presence or absence of the endogenous 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions. Transfections into L1210 cells were, likewise, distributed into wells at 20,000 cells/well, and outgrowing wells were expanded and screened forrfc expression levels by Northern blot without prescreening for function. For each transfection, 2–6 cultures were selected which did not express more than three times the amount of exogenousrfc transcripts than the amount of wild-type rfctranscript found in L1210 cells. Cell lines were prepared from these cultures by cloning G418 resistant and low level RFC expressing cultures by limiting dilution: an average of 0.1 cell was distributed into each well of a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 with 20% serum and 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and one cloned cell line was expanded for further study from each cloning plate. Each of these cell lines was then characterized for the rate of transport of (6R)-DDATHF and folic acid, total folate pool size, and sensitivity to growth inhibition by (6R)-DDATHF. PCR reactions were performed on genomic DNA from L1210 and L1210/D3 cells using primers which straddled the position of both mutations and an intron (14Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), to ensure that each PCR product originated from genomic DNA. The primers used were: 5′-GCCTGGTGTTCTATCTCTGCTTCTTCGG-3′, a sense primer in exon 2 of the mouse rfc gene and 5′-TGAGTTGCATGTGCACGACAG3′, an antisense primer in exon 3. A mixture of Taq polymerase (2 units) and Pfu polymerase (1 unit) was used in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 60 ng of each primer. The reaction was initially held at 94 °C for 30 s, followed by cycling conditions of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation for 3 min at 68 °C, and then held at 72 °C for 5 min after a total of 35 cycles. The single 3.4-kilobase products of these PCR reactions were isolated on a low melting temperature TAE-agarose gel, and the excised band was purified on a Wizard PCR purification kit (Promega) according to the directions supplied by the manufacturer. The primers used to amplify these PCR products were end-labeled with [γ-33P]ATP using T4-kinase and the end-labeled primers were used to prime cycle sequencing reactions on the purified PCR product using Fmol cycle sequencing reagents (Promega). Translocation of folate derivatives across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells can be mediated at neutral pH by at least three transport systems: 1) a carrier-mediated system commonly known as the RFC (15Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1526-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3992-4000PubMed Google Scholar); 2) a low pH optimum transport system (18Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) a series of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked folate-binding proteins, which facilitate the intracellular transfer of folates via a endocytotic-like mechanism (19Kamen B.A. Wang M.T. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13602-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that L1210/D3 cells, like the parental L1210 cells, when grown in micromolar concentrations of folic acid, express only trace levels of transcripts for the folate-binding protein-α and -β isotypes (Fig. 1). However, the reduced folate transport protein encoded by the rfc gene was expressed in the L1210/D3 cells, as it was in the wild-type leukemic cells (Fig. 1 C). No differences in the sizes of these transcripts were detected, but the abundance of the rfc transcript in L1210/D3 were about 50% of that in wild-type L1210 cells when corrected for RNA loading (n = 3). The distinguishing characteristics of the RFC are a marked substrate preference for methotrexate and reduced folates (15Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which efficiently block transport of any alternative substrates by this transport route, whereas the folate receptor-mediated endocytotic pathway has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to inhibition by the ionophore monensin (19Kamen B.A. Wang M.T. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13602-13609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When these criteria were applied to the transport of folic acid in L1210/D3 cells, it was found that transport of folic acid over a 2-min period was ≈90% inhibited by 20 μmmethotrexate (5–7 times the previously described Michaelis constant for MTX transport in L1210 cells (15Goldman I.D. Lichtenstein N.S. Oliverio V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5007-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1526-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3992-4000PubMed Google Scholar, 18Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar)), but that monensin at 10 μm had little effect (≈10% inhibition) on folate transport in either parental L1210 cells or L1210/D3 cells. There were only small differences in the influx kinetics of (6R)-DDATHF, MTX, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in L1210/D3 cells, compared with the kinetics observed in parental L1210 cells (Table II). The K m for transport of (6R)-DDATHF was 3.5 times higher in L1210/D3 cells, but there was a small change in V max, resulting in a decrease overall of about 2.5-fold in the first order rate constant of transport (k'). Because the rate of transport of (6R)-DDATHF in L1210/D3 cells would be made equivalent to that in L1210 cells by an increase in extracellular concentration of 2.5-fold, this alteration could not explain the 400–500-fold resistance (1Tse A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25944-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) of these cells. In L1210/D3 cells,V max for the transport of MTX was identical to that found in L1210 cells, but the K m for transport appeared to be about two-thirds that in L1210 cells. Likewise, kinetics of the uptake of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate measured over 60 s in the parental and resistant cell lines showed small differences, with about a 2-fold higher K m in L1210/D3 cells.Table IIGrowth inhibition of L1210 cell transfectants by DDATHFRecipient cellTransfected cDNACell lineIC50 for DDATHFnmnL121023 ± 36L1210/D0.53100 ± 3002L1210/D39000 ± 10004L1210/A1700 ± 5204L1210/Awt-rfcwt-A 0160 ± 23L1210/Awt-rfcwt-A 0747 ± 43L1210/Awt-rfcwt-A 1425 ± 43L1210/Awt-rfcwt-A 1638 ± 43L1210/AI48F,W105G-rfcdm-A 016200 ± 5003L1210/AI48F,W105G-rfcdm-A 067800 ± 23003L1210/AI48F,W105G-rfcdm-A 176330 ± 18903L1210/AI48F-rfcI48F-A 021950 ± 5003L1210/AI48F-rfcI48F-A-1220001L1210/AW105G-rfcW105G-A 12470 ± 1203L1210/AW105G-rfcW105G-A 154501L1210/A cells, which lack functional reduced folate carrier, were transfected with cDNA cloned from wild-type L1210 cells (wt-rfc), from L1210/D3 cells (I48F,W105G-rfc), or with recombinant cDNAs with only the codon 48 mutation (I48F-rfc) or only the codon 105 mutation (W105G-rfc).

Open table in a new tab L1210/A cells, which lack functional reduced folate carrier, were transfected with cDNA cloned from wild-type L1210 cells (wt-rfc), from L1210/D3 cells (I48F,W105G-rfc), or with recombinant cDNAs with only the codon 48 mutation (I48F-rfc) or only the codon 105 mutation (W105G-rfc).

The major change observed was a dramatic increase in the transport of folic acid in L1210/D3 cells. The transport of folic acid by L1210 cells was very slow, and the saturation kinetics needed to estimate aK m or a V max were not observed at achievable concentrations of extracellular radiolabeled folic acid (Fig. 2). In contrast, folic acid was transported into L1210/D3 cells with clear saturation kinetics, and had a V max for transport equivalent to or higher than that of the best substrates for the reduced folate carrier system (Table I).

The inhibition of (6R)-DDATHF transport by folic acid was analyzed by Dixon analysis; the K i with which folic acid inhibited (6R)-DDATHF transport was 340 μm in L1210 cells and 18 μm in L1210/D3 cells. The initial slope of a plot of transport velocityversus extracellular folic acid (Fig. 2) allowed an estimate of the first order rate constant (k') for transport in L1210 cells (Table I).

To investigate the mechanisms controlling the activity of promoter III, its regulatory elements and transcription factors were characterized in gonadal and non-gonadal cells. The TATA-less PIII domain was localized to the region −437 to −179 (ATG +1) containing the 5′-flanking region and part of the non-coding first exon. Within the promoter domain, a functional CAAT-box/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) (−398) and an Sp1 element (−386), which bind C/EBPβ and Sp1/Sp3, respectively, contribute individually to promoter activation in gonadal and non-gonadal cells. However, significant redundancy was demonstrated between these elements in non-gonadal cells. Additionally, an element within the non-coding exon 1 (−338) is also required for promoter activity. Activation of PIII by the widely expressed Sp1 and C/EBPβ factors explains its common utilization in multiple tissues.

Prolactin is the most functionally diversified pituitary hormone that exerts a wide range of biological actions involving lactation, reproduction, growth and metabolism, water-salt balance, immune regulation, and maternal behavior through specific prolactin receptors (PRLR)1 present on various prolactin target tissues (1Nicoll C.S.

The functional diversity of this hormone and the wide distribution of its receptors have suggested that a complex form of regulation determines the levels of PRLR expression in individual prolactin target tissues. This has been revealed by the recent demonstration of multiple and tissue-specific promoter control of the prolactin receptor gene expression in rat gonadal and non-gonadal tissues (4Hu Z. Zhuang L.

PRLRs are present as long and short forms and are encoded by multiple PRLR mRNA transcripts, which are derived from alternative transcription initiation from different PRLR promoters at the 5′-end, alternative splicing of the 5′-noncoding exon (exon 2), and the coding exons (3Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 94-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Three PRLR gene promoters have been identified in the rat. Promoter I, specifically utilized in gonadal cells, contains a functional SF-1 consensus element that binds steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), a specific zinc finger DNA-binding protein also known as Ad4BP (6Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), which is an essential transcriptional activator for this promoter (5Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14263-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Promoter II is specifically utilized in the liver (4Hu Z. Zhuang L.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar) and its activity is regulated by the liver-specific hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) through binding to an HNF4 element in the promoter region (7Moldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the generic promoter III (PIII) is commonly utilized in the rat gonads and liver and as a sole promoter in the rat mammary gland (4Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14263-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of PIII revealed C/EBP- and Sp1-binding elements. It is likely that this promoter is also utilized in other PRLR-expressing tissues that have not been examined. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of the commonly utilized PRLR promoter III has not been investigated.In the present study, we aimed to define the promoter domain of PIII and to identify the cis-elements and trans-factors that regulate its promoter activity in gonadal and non-gonadal cells. We demonstrated that C/EBPβ and Sp1 bind to the 5′-flanking region and regulate the PIII activity in homologous and heterologous cells. In addition, a proximal downstream sequence element (DSE) was essential for basal promoter activity. Finally, we have determined that the promoter III homolog in the mouse shares structural and functional similarity with the rat PIII, whereas in this species, the PI homolog exhibits minimal promoter activity due to mutation of the SF-1 element that renders this element non-functional. Taken together, these findings indicate that PIII is of central importance in the control of transcription of the prolactin receptor gene.DISCUSSIONOur study has provided insights on the regulation of promoter III of the PRLR gene, a commonly utilized promoter of the prolactin receptor gene in a wide variety of tissues. The PIII activity is governed by activation of two functionally independent sites, a C/EBP element that binds to C/EBPβ and an Sp1 element (Sp1a) that binds to Sp1 and Sp3, members of the same family of nuclear proteins. A DSE is required for basal functions of this promoter, and the two downstream adjacent Sp1 elements (Sp1b, c) may substitute for DSE function.Cell-type differences in activation of PIII by C/EBPβ and Sp1 were observed. In MLTC cells, single mutation of either binding site reduces the promoter activity by ∼50% or more, with the role of Sp1 being more dominant than that of C/EBPβ, indicating that both factors are required to attain full promoter activity. However in HepG2 cells, mutation of either binding site caused only slight decrease in promoter activity (to 82 and 69% of the wild type, respectively), whereas double mutation reduced the activity to 38%, suggesting partial functional redundancy between the two factors. The differences in the C/EBPβ binding in EMSA analyses of nuclear extracts from MLTC (less retarded single band) and from HepG2 cells (more retarded double bands) may be related to the differential transactivation by the two factors in these two cell types. The close proximity of the two binding sites (C/EBP and Sp1a) in the promoter domain may impose some spatial restraint to the extent that smaller complexes (in MLTC) may bind simultaneously to the two sites, whereas larger complexes (in HepG2) may bind in a mutually exclusive manner. Although synergistic effects were observed between C/EBPβ and Sp1 in other genes (13Lee Y.H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synergism between the two factors was not observed on the promoter activity of promoter III of the PRLR gene. Therefore it appears that C/EBPβ and Sp1 contribute separately to the promoter activity, presumably through their association to specific coactivators or directly with members of the TATA-binding protein associated factor complexes. C/EBPβ was reported to bind to transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP (14Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Sp1 can directly associate with dTAFII110 or hTAFII130 (15Tanese N. Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Chen J.L. Admon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and TAFII55 (16Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).Promoter III lacks a TATA box within the promoter domain and consensus initiator (Inr) sequences. The sequences encompassing the two main TSS (−340 and −351) are TCAGAGA and TG AGCTT, respectively, and these represent mismatches by two nucleotides (underlined) of the consensus Inr sequence YYANt/aYY (17Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether these sequences serve as variant Inr in PIII, the construct (−506/−345) lacking the downstream sequences including one of the two Inr-like sequences displayed minimal promoter activity. The downstream sequence element (DSE) (CGGCTGGCGA) is likely part of the core promoter elements required for efficient transcription initiation from this promoter, since its mutation reduced the promoter activity by ∼50% in both MLTC and HepG2 cells. However, it appears that the DSE in PIII is distinct from DPE (downstream promoter element) by sequence as well as by its location. DPE was identified in a subset of TATA-less gene promoters with a distinct 7-nucleotide sequence (A/G)G(A/T)CGTG, located at +28 to +34 downstream of the transcription initiation sites (18Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). DPE can be bound by TFIID but not by TATA-binding protein and is defined as part of the core promoter components (18Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although the DSE in PIII does not conform to DPE, it is an integral part of the promoter domain and may participate in or facilitate the assembly of the basal transcription machinery.Whereas the upstream Sp1a is of major importance in PIII promoter activity, the two downstream Sp1b and Sp1c, which both bind to Sp1 protein, appeared to be non-operative or redundant in the presence of an intact DSE element, in that mutation of the two downstream Sp1 sites did not alter the promoter function in transient reporter gene assays. However, in the presence of altered DSE, mutation of both Sp1b- and Sp1c-binding sites caused further reduction in promoter activity, suggesting that SP1b,c sites could partly compensate for the function of DSE when DSE was mutated. Both DSE and Sp1b, c elements are GC-rich sequences, and when they were all mutated, the promoter activity was greatly compromised. Therefore, although the Sp1b, c sites are normally redundant, they are potentially able to compensate or partially restore the promoter activity.Unlike MLTC and HepG2 cells, we were not able to detect discernible C/EBPβ-binding complex(es) in the nuclear extract of rat ovarian granulosa cells using either the short probe containing only C/EBP site or the long probe containing both C/EBP and Sp1a sites. However, functional analyses of the mutated C/EBP element and the transactivation of the promoter domain by cotransfection of the C/EBPβ cDNA into this cell (Fig. 7) indicated that C/EBP element in the PIII domain is a functional C/EBPβ-binding site in vivo, through an action that is independent of the Sp1 element.In the C/EBPβ knock-out mice, ovarian follicles undergo normal growth but fail to luteinize after ovulation, suggesting that the ovary is deficient in expression of those genes that are participating in the process of luteinization and are regulated by C/EBPβ (19Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It is well known that prolactin is required for the maintenance of luteinization as well as luteolysis in rodents (20Bonifacino J.S. Dufau M.L. Saxena B.B. Hormone Receptors in Growth and Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1984: 149-163Google Scholar). Expression of prolactin receptor is increased during follicular growth and during luteinization (21Hu Z.Z. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ expression is increased after the luteinizing hormone surge when ovulation occurs (22Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21931-21938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, up-regulation of both C/EBPβ and the prolactin receptor in granulosa cells is critical for luteinization. We now provide evidence that C/EBPβ is a transcriptional activator for this promoter, since overexpression of C/EBPβ in granulosa cells significantly increases the PIII activity. Because PIII activity is also controlled by Sp1/Sp3, the C/EBPβ knock-out mice would be expected to maintain a reduced level of PRLR, well below normal basal and hCG-stimulated levels. This marked reduction in transcription of the PRLR gene could in part explain the luteal deficiency observed in these mice.Typical Sp1 DNA-binding sequences are GC box (GGGGCGGGC) and GT motif (GGGTGTGGC) present in most TATA-less and GC-rich promoters. A variant Sp1-binding site CTC repeat (CTCCTCCTC) was identified in TATA-less promoter regions of a number of other growth-related genes including Wilm's tumor-1 gene (WT-1) (23Cohen H.T.

Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There are at least three close members of Sp family proteins, Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, which share similar structural features (30Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 31Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 20: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The three proteins contain highly conserved DNA binding domains that all recognize the GC box and GT motif. Sp3 and Sp4 have also been suggested in transcriptional regulation. InDrosophila SL2 cells, Sp3 could suppress the Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation due to the competition with Sp1 for their common binding sites in some genes (32Hoppe K.L. Francone O.L. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 969-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In other cases, Sp3 enhances the promoter activity (34Pang H. Miranda K. Fine A. Biochem J. 1998; 333: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with equal potency (35Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and sometimes is even a more effective activator than Sp1 (36Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is differential regulation of different genes by Sp1 or Sp3. Although the activation of PIII in SL2 cells by Sp1 (2–3-fold) was not as dramatic as in some other genes, the fact that Sp3 is not present in these cells may also be reflective of the degree of activation observed in this study. In mammalian cells (CV-1, HeLa, and Ishikawa cells), it was also reported that the reporter promoters (uroglobin and SV40) containing GC box or GT motif were activated by Sp1 and Sp4 but not by Sp3 (37Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that like Sp1, Sp3 could also bind to CTC repeats in the PIII. Although it is clear that Sp1a is a positive cis-element in this promoter, the individual contribution by Sp1 and Sp3 to this promoter activation is not certain. It is believed that Sp1 is an important activator to promoter III in gonadal and hepatic cells as in numerous other Sp1-activated genes (38Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 39Tsai-Morris C.H. Geng Y. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7487-7494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since Sp3 is also a ubiquitous factor and can bind to Sp1a element, the regulatory roles of Sp3 in the PIII await further study.The activity of the PIII domain (−437/−179) was induced significantly by hCG/cAMP in cultured rat primary granulosa cells. However, neither C/EBP- nor Sp1-binding sites were found to specifically mediate this response to hCG/cAMP, albeit they were important for basal promoter activity. Although both C/EBPβ and Sp1 have been shown to participate in cAMP induction of transcription in some genes (40Metz R. Ziff E.

However, there is no consensus cAMP response element or functional AP2 site present within the promoter domain that could mediate second messenger action, thus other elements may be involved in cAMP-mediated induction of promoter activity.The mouse PIII is highly similar in structure and function to the rat promoter III as expected, suggesting that this promoter is well conserved. However, unexpectedly the homolog of the rat gonadal promoter I was critically altered in the mouse. The SF-1 element, which is essential for the rat PI activity, is a non-functional sequence in the mouse. This is reflected in the vestigial promoter activity observed in reporter assays and very low expression of the endogenous mouse counterpart of rat E11 (non-coding exon 11) (4Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in both MLTC and mouse ovary as compared with the E13. Hence the essential promoter for the PRLR in the mouse ovary is promoter III and the expression of the mouse ovarian PRLR is primarily regulated by C/EBPβ and Sp1, whereas promoter I is inactive due to critical base pair substitution in the SF-1 element. It is therefore expected that PRLR transcription in the ovary is reduced in C/EBPβ knock-out mice and may contribute to the deficiency in luteinization in such animals (19Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).Because C/EBPβ and Sp1 are the major transcriptional activators to promoter III of the rat PRLR gene, the wide expression of these two transcription factors may explain the common utilization of this promoter in multiple tissues and in different species. This is in contrast to PI and PII, which were specifically activated by SF-1 (5Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14263-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and HNF-4 (7Moldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar) in the gonads and the liver, respectively.In summary, we have identified in promoter III multiple nuclear protein-binding sites including C/EBPβ and Sp1/Sp3 and a functional DSE. C/EBPβ and Sp1a are the two major transcription factors regulating the PIII activity, and DSE is also required for the basal promoter activity. Promoter III is highly active and is well conserved in the rat and mouse; therefore, it is of central importance in the regulation of the PRLR gene expression in various tissues of different species. Prolactin is the most functionally diversified pituitary hormone that exerts a wide range of biological actions involving lactation, reproduction, growth and metabolism, water-salt balance, immune regulation, and maternal behavior through specific prolactin receptors (PRLR)1 present on various prolactin target tissues (1Nicoll C.S.

Promoter I, specifically utilized in gonadal cells, contains a functional SF-1 consensus element that binds steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), a specific zinc finger DNA-binding protein also known as Ad4BP (6Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), which is an essential transcriptional activator for this promoter (5Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X.

Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the generic promoter III (PIII) is commonly utilized in the rat gonads and liver and as a sole promoter in the rat mammary gland (4Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14263-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of PIII revealed C/EBP- and Sp1-binding elements. It is likely that this promoter is also utilized in other PRLR-expressing tissues that have not been examined. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of the commonly utilized PRLR promoter III has not been investigated. In the present study, we aimed to define the promoter domain of PIII and to identify the cis-elements and trans-factors that regulate its promoter activity in gonadal and non-gonadal cells. We demonstrated that C/EBPβ and Sp1 bind to the 5′-flanking region and regulate the PIII activity in homologous and heterologous cells. In addition, a proximal downstream sequence element (DSE) was essential for basal promoter activity. Finally, we have determined that the promoter III homolog in the mouse shares structural and functional similarity with the rat PIII, whereas in this species, the PI homolog exhibits minimal promoter activity due to mutation of the SF-1 element that renders this element non-functional. Taken together, these findings indicate that PIII is of central importance in the control of transcription of the prolactin receptor gene. DISCUSSIONOur study has provided insights on the regulation of promoter III of the PRLR gene, a commonly utilized promoter of the prolactin receptor gene in a wide variety of tissues. The PIII activity is governed by activation of two functionally independent sites, a C/EBP element that binds to C/EBPβ and an Sp1 element (Sp1a) that binds to Sp1 and Sp3, members of the same family of nuclear proteins. A DSE is required for basal functions of this promoter, and the two downstream adjacent Sp1 elements (Sp1b, c) may substitute for DSE function.Cell-type differences in activation of PIII by C/EBPβ and Sp1 were observed. In MLTC cells, single mutation of either binding site reduces the promoter activity by ∼50% or more, with the role of Sp1 being more dominant than that of C/EBPβ, indicating that both factors are required to attain full promoter activity. However in HepG2 cells, mutation of either binding site caused only slight decrease in promoter activity (to 82 and 69% of the wild type, respectively), whereas double mutation reduced the activity to 38%, suggesting partial functional redundancy between the two factors. The differences in the C/EBPβ binding in EMSA analyses of nuclear extracts from MLTC (less retarded single band) and from HepG2 cells (more retarded double bands) may be related to the differential transactivation"

Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is an insulin-sensitive enzyme. We examined the effects of thiazolidinediones on lipoprotein lipase expression in adipocytes. When added to 3T3-F442A, 3T3-L1, and rat adipocytes in culture, troglitazone and BRL 49653 inhibited lipoprotein lipase activity. This inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm and within 2 h after addition of the drug. Lipoprotein lipase activity was inhibited in differentiated adipocytes as well as the differentiating cells. Despite this decrease in enzyme activity, these drugs increased mRNA levels in undifferentiated 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cells and had no effect on mRNA expression or synthesis of lipoprotein lipase in differentiated cells. Western blot analysis showed that these drugs did not affect the mass of the enzyme protein. Lipoprotein lipase activity in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells was not inhibited by troglitazone. Glucose transport, biosynthesis of lipids from glucose or the biosynthesis of proteins were unaffected by thiazolidinediones in differentiated cells, whereas glucose transport and lipid biosynthesis were increased when these drugs were added during differentiation.

Adipocytes are derived from a stem cell of mesodermal origin, and adipocyte differentiation is characterized by a coordinate increase in the expression of a number of specific genes. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis is central to adipocyte lipid accumulation in humans and rats (1Hollenberg C.H. J. Clin.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, is expressed during differentiation of several preadipocyte cell lines (4Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar). PPARs regulate the expression of genes by binding to the PPAR response elements, which have been identified in the regulatory regions of several genes encoding enzymes that modulate the metabolism of lipids (6Keller H.

Thiazolidinediones are antidiabetic agents that lower blood glucose by increasing the insulin sensitivity of target tissues in human subjects and animal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) (8Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1169-1661Crossref Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These drugs also decrease plasma insulin and triglycerides in insulin-resistant animal models (9Stevenson R.W. Hutson N.J. Krupp M.N. Volkmann R.A. Holland G.F. Eggler J.F. Clark D.A. McPherson R.K. Hall K.L. Danbury B.H. Gibbs E.M. Kreutter D.K. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thiazolidinediones were also found to activate PPARγ in preadipocytes and promote differentiation into adipocytes (10Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkinson W.O. Wilson T.M. Kliewer S.A.

Pioglitazone, one of the thiazolidinedione compounds, increased the rate of lipogenesis and glucose transport in 3T3-L1 cells and increased the expression of mRNA for Glut4, LPL, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the presence of insulin (11Kletzien R.F. Clarke S.D. Ulrich R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 393-398PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, a similar enhancement of adipocyte differentiation by pioglitazone was observed in 3T3-F442A cells (12Sandouk T. Reda D. Hofmann C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1600-C1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tafuri (13Tafuri S.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4706-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) has recently reported that troglitazone enhanced the differentiation, basal glucose transport, and Glut1 level in 3T3-L1 cells, and Schoonjanset al. (14Schoonjans K. Peinadoonsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J.

In none of these studies was the activity of LPL determined. In the present study, we investigated the effect of troglitazone and BRL 49653 on LPL expression and enzyme activity in 3T3-F442A, 3T3-L1 cells, and rat adipocytes. As reported by other investigators, these drugs stimulated the expression of LPL mRNA in 3T3- preadipocytes (14Schoonjans K. Peinadoonsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). However, they inhibited LPL activity in differentiated adipocytes and isolated rat adipocytes suggesting post-transcriptional inhibition of LPL expression. When added to 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, despite decreased LPL activity, thiazolidinediones increased the rate of glucose transport, lipid biosynthesis, and lipid accumulation. 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from Dr. Howard Green (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge). Media and other tissue culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human recombinant insulin (Novolin) was obtained from Nordisk Pharmaceuticals (Princeton, NJ). [U-14C]Glucose, 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose, [35S]methionine, and [3H]triolein were from NEN Life Science Products. Bovine serum albumin, triolein, lecithin, clofibrate, prostaglandin D2, docosahexaenoic acid, 2-deoxyglucose, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit chicken IgG were purchased from Sigma. Matrigel was obtained from Becton Dickinson. Troglitazone was a gift from Parke-Davis. BRL 49653 was obtained from Smith Kline Beecham (United Kingdom). Polyclonal antibodies against bovine LPL raised in rabbit were from Dr. Ira Goldberg (Columbia University, New York). 3T3-F442A cells were maintained in 75-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum and a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin. For experiments, they were subcultured in 12-well dishes. Confluent cultures were allowed to differentiate by adding DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 nm insulin. The cells differentiated well in 3–5 days after switching to the differentiation medium. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated using isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), dexamethasone, and insulin as described by Clancy and Czech (15Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Troglitazone and BRL 49653 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added in the concentrations indicated. The stock solutions were made in such a way that no more than 2 μl were added to 1 ml of culture medium. The control cells received 2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide per ml of medium. The cell number was determined in a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). In some experiments, cells were cultured in lipid-depleted FBS. This was obtained by extraction of FBS twice with heptane and then ultracentrifugation after adjusting the density to 1.2 g/ml with KBr. The floating lipid layer was discarded, and the infranatant was collected and dialyzed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 150 and 250 g were sacrificed, and the epididymal adipose tissue was removed immediately. Adipocytes were isolated from the adipose tissue by collagenase digestion (16Lima F.B. Bao S. Garvey W.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed three times and cultured in Matrigel-coated 12-well culture dishes. Matrigel was thawed on ice, and 150 μl of the liquid was applied to each well in the plate kept on ice. 150 μl of the adipocyte suspension (1:1 ratio of packed cells to medium) were added to each well on the liquid matrix and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. During this time the Matrigel gelled around the cells and anchored them to the dish. After this incubation 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to each well and incubated for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium, and troglitazone or BRL 49653 were added to give a final concentration of 1 μm. After 24 h the medium was aspirated, and the cells were incubated in heparin-containing medium for 1 h to release the LPL. Before the glucose transport assay the cells were incubated with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer and incubated in the same buffer for 30 min. 2-Deoxy[3H]glucose was added to give a final concentration of 0.1 mm (1 μCi/100 nmol) and incubated for 10 min. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 n NaOH. Radioactivity in this lysate was determined by scintillation counting. Protein content in the lysate was determined by Bio-Rad reagent. Non-carrier-mediated glucose transport was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin (15Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL was measured in the medium after release with heparin, as described previously (17Kern P.A. Marshall S. Eckel R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The culture medium was removed from the dishes, and 1 ml of fresh medium containing heparin (10 units/ml) was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. It was found that more than 90% of the total extractable LPL activity in these cells was released by heparin under these conditions. LPL catalytic activity was measured using an emulsified [3H]triolein substrate as described previously (18Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation of 100 μl of sample with 100 μl of substrate for 60 min, liberated 3H-fatty acids were separated from the reaction mixture using the method of Belfrage and Vaughn (19Belfrage P. Vaughn M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LPL activity is expressed as nanomoles of fatty acids released in 60 min. To study the biosynthesis of total lipids from glucose, the cells were incubated with [U-14C]glucose or [14C]acetate for the indicated times and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. Total lipids from the monolayers were extracted using 2 ml of hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) mixture and evaporated to dryness, and then the radioactivity was determined. The cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for 2 h. The monolayers were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2n NaOH in a microcentrifuge tube. These cell extracts were treated with trichloroacetic acid to give a final concentration of 15% for 2 h on ice. The tubes were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were finally dissolved in 0.2 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was determined. RNA was isolated from the cells using guanidine thiocyanate as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Nylon 1, Life Technologies, Inc.), and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for human LPL. The blot was probed simultaneously for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase to control the amount of RNA loaded in the gel. After treating the cells with troglitazone the culture medium was removed and replaced with methionine-free medium. They were pulsed with 50 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine for 30 min. At the end of this period the medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in a buffer containing detergents. Quantitative immunoprecipitation with anti-LPL antibody was carried out using samples containing an equal amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts, followed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioautography (21Ong J.M. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells from each well from a 12-well plate were lysed in 1.0 ml of a buffer containing Triton X-100 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and 5 μl of the clear samples were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. LPL was detected using polyclonal antibodies raised against bovine LPL in rabbit and peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. The bands were visualized using chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All experiments were carried out at least two times in triplicate wells and processed individually. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. To examine the effects of troglitazone and BRL 49563 on LPL activity, 3T3-F442A cells were induced to differentiate, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the drugs were added to the differentiated cells. The data presented in Fig. 1 show that the addition of troglitazone inhibited LPL activity in a dose-dependent manner. At a troglitazone concentration of 0.1 μm, the inhibition was 46%, and at 1.0 μm the inhibition was maximal at 86%. BRL 49653 inhibited 90% of LPL activity at 0.1 μm. Similar experiments were done to determine the time course of LPL inhibition by these drugs. By using these drugs at a concentration of 1.0 μm, the inhibition of LPL activity can be observed 1 h after addition of troglitazone and 2 h after addition of BRL 49563, with a maximal inhibition after 4 h (Fig. 2). LPL activity was also inhibited by these drugs when added to cultured rat adipocytes at 1 μmconcentration for 16 h (control, 44.6 ± 5.1: troglitazone, 25.1 ± 2.8: 23.7 ± 2.3; all values are expressed as nmol/106 cells ± S.D.). The inhibition of LPL activity was also observed in 3T3-L1 cells differentiated by treatment with IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin (Table I). There was no direct inhibition of LPL triglyceride hydrolysis by troglitazone when the drug was added directly to an LPL source in vitro (data not shown). The inhibition of LPL by troglitazone was partially reversible when the drug was withdrawn. As shown in Fig. 3, LPL activity was inhibited by about 75% when the differentiated adipocytes were treated with the drug for 16 h. After this treatment, when the cells were washed and incubated without the drug, the LPL activity recovered to about 60% of the control value within 4 h.Figure 2Time course of inhibition of LPL activity by troglitazone and BRL 49653 in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes.Differentiated adipocytes were treated with 1.0 μmtroglitazone (Trog) or BRL for the indicated periods, and the heparin-releasable LPL activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value represents mean from triplicate dishes, and the error bars indicate S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IEffect of troglitazone and BRL 49653 on LPL activity in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytesAdditionsLPL activitynmol/mg cell proteinNone620 ± 12Troglitazone150 ± 10BRL110 ± 303T3-L1 cells were differentiated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The differentiated cells were treated with 1 μm troglitazone or BRL 49653 for 5 h, and the heparin-releasable LPL activity was determined.

The values are mean and S.D. from triplicate wells for each treatment. When cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, which express LPL, were treated with troglitazone, no inhibition of LPL activity was observed (control, 94 nmol/mg protein; troglitazone-treated cells (1 μm, 18 h), 116 nmol/mg cell protein). The inhibitory effect of troglitazone on LPL activity appears to be relatively specific to adipocytes. The above experiments involved differentiated adipocytes. We next examined the effect of adding troglitazone and BRL 49653 to 3T3-F442A cells during differentiation. As shown in Table II, LPL activity increased about 4-fold during differentiation with insulin alone. When the cells were treated with thiazolidinedione for 4 days during the differentiation process, LPL activity was decreased both in the presence and absence of insulin. During this time, despite the decreased LPL activity, the cells had accumulated lipid droplets and differentiated into adipocytes, and the cellular triglyceride content had increased (Table II). These data show that troglitazone and BRL 49653 inhibited LPL activity in differentiating as well as fully differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes.Table IIEffect of troglitazone on LPL activity, 2-deoxyglucose transport, cellular triglyceride content, and lipid biosynthesis in 3T3-F442A cellsAdditionsLPL activityGlucose transportTriglyceridesGlucose → lipidsAcetate → lipidsnmolnmolμgnmoldpm × 10None123 ± 80.23 ± 0.043.3 ± 0.28.0 ± 0.114 ± 2Insulin475 ± 303.7 ± 0.45.5 ± 0.442 ± 1.9123 ± 3Troglitazone48 ± 52.7 ± 0.29.5 ± 0.649 ± 2.8163 ± 23Insulin + Trog84 ± 615.4 ± 0.810.5 ± 0.5106 ± 12BRL 4965330 ± 313.2 ± 1.1270 ± 26The cells were cultured in 12-well dishes, and when the monolayers were confluent they were treated with insulin (100 nm), troglitazone (Trog) (1.0 μm), BRL 49653 (1.0 μm) for 4 days.

At the end of this period more than 70% of the cells were differentiated into adipocytes. LPL activity and 2-deoxyglucose transport were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All values are per 106 cells. In order to understand how the cells were able to accumulate lipids in the presence of a thiazolidinedione-mediated inhibition of LPL activity, we studied the uptake of glucose and the biosynthesis of lipids from [14C]glucose and [14C]acetate. The data in Table II show that glucose transport increased about 12-fold and glucose incorporation into lipids by 6-fold in troglitazone-treated cells. The presence of insulin along with troglitazone increased the glucose uptake and lipid biosynthesis further. Troglitazone and BRL 49653 also stimulated the synthesis of lipids from [14C]acetate about 12- and 20-fold, respectively. Although troglitazone inhibited LPL activity, it did not affect other metabolic pathways such as glucose transport, lipid biosynthesis, or protein synthesis in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes as shown in Table III. This suggests that the inhibition of LPL activity by troglitazone is a specific effect and not due to drug-mediated cell toxicity.Table IIIEffect of troglitazone on glucose transport, [C]glucose incorporation into total lipids, and [S]methionine incorporation into proteins in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytesAdditionsGlucose transport[14C]Glucose lipids[35S]Methionine proteinsnmol/mg proteindpm/mg proteinNone3.37 ± 0.1838,680 ± 45010,260 ± 300Troglitazone3.99 ± 0.0735,000 ± 205011,050 ± 250The differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes (4 days with 100 nminsulin) were incubated with 1.0 μm troglitazone for 4 h.

The addition of troglitazone and BRL 49653 also increased the cellular protein content by 3-fold, but the cell number varied only to a small but significant extent. The rate of protein synthesis was studied, and the results show that both these drugs increased the incorporation of [35S]methionine into proteins 3–4-fold (Table IV).Table IVEffect of troglitazone and BRL 49563 on cell number, cell protein, and protein synthesis in differentiating 3T3-F442A cellsAdditionsCell numberCell proteinProtein synthesis×10/wellμg/welldpm × 10/10 cellsNone0.21 ± 0.0249 ± 174 ± 16Troglitazone0.27 ± 0.04110 ± 6198 ± 56BRL0.19 ± 0.02116 ± 7280 ± 27Insulin0.30 ± 0.05118 ± 5127 ± 31Confluent monolayers of 3T3-F442A cells were treated with 1 μm troglitazone, BRL 49653, or 100 nm insulin for 4 days.

Bu using differentiated adipocytes, Northern blot analysis of the RNA isolated from control and troglitazone-treated cells showed that there was no change in the expression of LPL mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Since the regulation of LPL is known to occur at the level of translation, we also studied the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable LPL protein. The results, presented in Fig. 4 B, show that troglitazone did not inhibit the synthesis of LPL protein. Western blots of the cell extracts also demonstrated no change in LPL protein in the total as well as the heparin-releasable fractions despite the inhibition of enzyme activity by more than 65% (Fig. 5).Figure 5Effect of troglitazone and BRL 49563 on the cellular LPL protein content in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes.

To examine the effects of thiazolidinediones on LPL mRNA levels in undifferentiated cells, we added troglitazone and BRL 49653 to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, in the absence of differentiation agents, and observed an increase in LPL mRNA expression (Fig. 6). This effect was more pronounced when the cells were cultured in lipid-depleted FBS. However, even though 3T3-L1 preadipocytes demonstrated increased LPL mRNA following treatment with thiazolidinediones, these cells expressed low levels of LPL activity, which was no different between control and thiazolidinedione-treated cells and not increased with insulin (Table V). These cells expressed high LPL activity only when they were differentiated with IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin.Table VEffect of troglitazone and BRL 49653 added during differentiation in 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells cultured in FBS and lipid-depleted FBS on LPL activityLPL activity, nmol/106 cells3T3-F442A3T3-L1FBS Control495 ± 100185 ± 21 Troglitazone175 ± 30195 ± 13 BRL120 ± 10195 ± 20 Insulin1360 ± 50175 ± 14Lipid-depleted FBS Control65 ± 870 ± 13 Troglitazone85 ± 1670 ± 14 BRL65 ± 1475 ± 13 Insulin360 ± 3878 ± 33T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in DMEM containing FBS until they were about 80% confluent.

A major interleukin 2 (IL-2)-responsive region that contains two adjacent control elements (JA and JB) exists within the J chain promoter. Transcription factor PU.1 positively regulates J chain gene expression by binding to one of the control elements (JB) in the J chain promoter. In the present study we have determined that a myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)-related nuclear factor, named B-MEF2, positively regulates the J chain gene promoter activity via the second control element (JA). An in vitrotranslated MEF2 family member, MEF2C, was found to bind the JA site with identical properties as endogenously expressed B-MEF2 in B cell lines. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that a dominant negative mutant of MEF2C blocked B-MEF2 regulation of the J chain promoter. Consistent with its role as positive regulator of J chain gene expression, B-MEF2 levels were enhanced in highly differentiated B cells. In addition, induction of an IL-2-responsive presecretor cell line BCL1 with IL-2 or IL-5 (which up-regulates J chain gene expression) resulted in an increased expression of B-MEF2. We conclude that a MEF2-related transcriptional factor, B-MEF2, acts as a stage-specific positive regulator of J chain gene expression in the B cell lineage.

The differentiation of B lymphocytes from committed precursor cells to antibody-secreting plasma cells is distinguished by changes in the expression of genes encoding immunoglobulins and accessory molecules. On activation of naive mature B cells by antigens, cytokines stimulate these cells to express the J chain gene, resulting in the assembly and secretion of the pentamer IgM antibody (1Koshland M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1985; 3: 425-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The J chain gene is expressed only in activated B cells in response to IL-21 and IL-5, and its synthesis is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. A single nuclease-hypersensitive site is co-induced with J chain gene expression either in normal B lymphocytes stimulated with mitogens or in BCL1 cells stimulated with recombinant IL-2 (2Minie M.E. Koshland M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4031-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The IL-2 signal therefore alters the 5′ structure of the J chain gene, allowing access to the transcriptional machinery. Previous studies have shown the presence of an IL-2-responsive region of the J chain promoter that contains adjacent elements: a positive T-rich sequence (JA) and an A + G-rich sequence (JB) with overlapping positive and negative regulatory motifs (3Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In a previous study, transcription factor PU.1 was identified as one of the elements that binds to the JB site of the J chain promoter (4Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the present work we have identified a second positive regulator, B-MEF2, which through binding to the JA region, activates J chain gene expression. Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2) proteins belong to the MADS box family of transcription factors named MCM1 that controls mating type-specific genes in yeast, A gamous andD eficiens, that function as homeotic genes in plants and serum response factor, which regulates muscle specific and serum-inducible gene expression (5Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Members of the MADS family share homology within a 56-amino acid domain termed the MADS box, which mediates DNA binding and dimerization (6Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). An additional 29-amino acid sequence immediately adjacent to the MADS box called the MEF2 domain is also highly conserved among MEF2 proteins (A, B, C, and D) but is absent from other MADS box proteins. MEF2 factors form homo- and heterodimers that bind to the consensus site (C/T)TA(A/T)4TA(G/A) originally identified in the promoters of several muscle-specific genes (7Nurrish S.J. Treisman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4076-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Molkentin J.D. Firulli A.B. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Hustad C.M. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Development. 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MADS and the MEF2 domains have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for dimerization and DNA binding (10Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). All of the MEF2 proteins characterized so far are subject to complex forms of regulation at many levels. Alternative mRNA splicing of MEF2A gives rise to muscle-specific isoforms, and their role in muscle development has been extensively studied (11Doduo E. Sparrow D.B. Mohun T. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Martin J.F. Miano J.P. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The expression of MEF2C mRNA is primarily restricted to skeletal muscle (13Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 877-889Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar), brain (14Leifer D. Golden J. Kowall N.W. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C., Yu, Y-T. Andres V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), whereas transcripts of MEF2A, B, and D are widely expressed. Although MEF2 proteins have been shown to be present in muscle and non-muscle cells (17Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Subramanian S.V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the role of these factors in non-muscle cells is less well understood. Recent studies have shown that MEF2C is activated by MAP kinase P38 during inflammation, resulting in an increase in c-jun gene transcription (19Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that MEF2C activation may play a role in host defense and inflammatory responses during an infection. In the present report we have identified the recognition site for a MEF2 transcription family member within the IL-2-responsive region upstream of the J chain gene. The protein was identified as a MEF2 family member by several criteria, including binding of the J chain promoter by the product of a MEF2 family member cDNA clone, specific binding competition with mutant oligonucleotides, and reactivity of DNA-protein complexes with a MEF2 antibody. Finally, we show that B-MEF2 is responsive to IL-2 or IL-5, and its expression correlates with J chain gene expression during B cell differentiation. Recombinant human IL-2 (107 units/ml) was obtained from Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, and recombinant IL-5 (107 units/mg) was obtained from DNAX. The lymphokine doses were as follows: IL-2, 100 units/ml and recombinant IL-5, 25 units/ml for a 3-day incubation. The myeloma cell lines S194 was grown at 37 °C under 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The pre-B cell line PD36, immature B cell line WEHI 231, pre-secretor BCL1, and mature B-cell line K46R were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as above. Progressive 5′ deletions were made in the J chain promoter and cloned into the reference pCAT3M plasmid as described previously (3Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 4-bp mutation in the JA site was introduced in the 1.2-kb J chain promoter by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). For linked promoter analysis, the oligonucleotides representing the JA element and the mutant JA sequence were synthesized with the Xba site linker and cloned either as one copy or as multiple copies upstream of the γ-fibrinogen promoter. In the γ42Cass1 vector, theCAT gene is under the control of a truncated γ-fibrinogen promoter (−54 to +36) that includes a TATA box and a single SP1 site (3Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to confirm oligomer copy and orientation. For the dominant negative transfection experiments, the dominant negative mutant for MEF2 containing the DNA binding domain of MEF2 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking the DNA binding domain of MEF2C. The MEF2C cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Astar Winoto. The PCR product was cloned into the pcDNA1 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). The reporter constructs for the dominant negative transfection contained a 1.24-kb J chain promoter sequence upstream and a 1-kb μ heavy chain enhancer sequence downstream of the CAT gene. The plasmid containing the MEF2C cDNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNA was translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The subsequent products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transfections of S194 cells were performed by the DEAE-dextran technique using 10 μg of plasmid for 107 cells as described (20Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1985; 41: 885-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity 48 h after transfection as described previously (3Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Percent conversion of unacetylated to acetylated chloramphenicol normalized to protein was calculated as described previously (4Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the dominant negative cotransfection assays, 2 μg of reporter vector and 6 μg of test expression plasmid or an equivalent amount of Bluescript KS(+) II vector was used. For the transactivation studies, the total amount of DNA was kept constant by using 5 μg of reporter vector and 4 μg of expression vector in each assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared form the various B cell lines as described (21McFadden H.J. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11027-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme by standard methods described previously. Binding reactions were performed for 20 min at 25 °C in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 8 μg of nuclear extract, 104 cpm end-labeled DNA probe (0.1–1.0 ng), 4 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 1× binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol). For antibody-blocking assays, extracts were preincubated with antibody (1 μl) for 15 min before the binding reaction. Samples were electrophoresed in a 5% acrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/N, N′-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio) in 0.25× TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Oligonucleotide sequences used in this study as competitor probes were made by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides. The probes and oligonucleotides used were: B8, 5′-GGGGTTATTTTAAGAAAGCAGAAGCAGCAT-3′; B10, 5′-CTCTGGGGTTATTTTAAG-3′; mutant JA (MJA), 5′-CTGGGGTTCGGGTAAG-3′; PU.1, 5′-AAGAAAGCAGAAGCAGCAT-3′. The mutated residues are underlined. For immunoblot analysis, nuclear extracts from different cell lines were electrophoresed on SDS gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked in 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with anti-MEF2 antibody, which recognizes MEF2A, C, and D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-actin antibody (Sigma) as the primary antibody for 1 h. The filters were washed three times for 10 min each in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The filters were washed again three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescense detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In a previous study, a series of 5′ deletions within the J chain promoter led to the identification of a major IL-2-responsive control region containing both positive and negative elements (3Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, a more precise deletion analysis of this region was performed to characterize the positive regulatory element within the J chain promoter. The reporter plasmid, pCAT3M, containing the 1.24-kb 5′-flanking J chain sequence upstream of the CAT gene was used to assess the activity of various deletion mutants of the J chain promoter region as described previously (3Lansford R.D. McFadden H.J. Siu S.T. Cox J.S. Cann G.M. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These constructs of the J chain promoter region were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran into the J chain-positive plasmacytoma cell line S194 to determine their relative abilities to activate transcription of theCAT gene. As shown in Fig. 1, deleting base pairs from −70 to −61 or −70 to −60 resulted in a 10-fold decrease in CAT activity. Moreover, site-specific mutations introduced between nucleotides 60 and 63 within the context of the J chain promoter resulted in a similar loss in CAT activity. These results indicate the presence of a major positive control element within the region upstream of the J chain gene. This positive element located within a previously identified hypersensitive site was designated JA, and the factor binding this element was termednuclear factor JA (NFJA). A computer search of previously known DNA binding sites performed to identify the NFJA factor revealed that the consensus recognition sequence for MEF2 family showed a strong homology to the JA sequence. The putative MEF2 element in the J chain promoter extending from nucleotide −56 to −65 (5′-TTATTTTAAG-3′) is the reverse complement of the consensus sequence (5′-(C/T)T(A/T)(A/T)AAATA(A/G)-3′) recognized by the MEF2 transcription family. Since MEF2 is not known to play a role in B cells, the functional role of this putative MEF2 binding site in B cells was further characterized by assessing the ability of a minimal fragment (−70 to −56) representing this region to drive the expression of the CAT gene using a heterologous promoter in S194. This fragment was cloned as a single copy or as a multimer (4 copies) into the γ42Cass1 vector (which contains the γ fibrinogen minimal promoter) and transfected into the S194 cell line. The construct containing a single copy of the putative MEF2 sequence resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the CAT activity, whereas the construct with 4 tandem repeats of the sequence displayed a 40-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. 2). These results further validate the positive regulatory function of this sequence. Mutational analysis of this region provided additional evidence of the positive regulatory role of this element. A construct containing a four-base pair substitution within the core MEF2 sequence when transfected into the S194 cell line abolished reporter gene activity (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the putative MEF2 binding site was functionally essential for J chain promoter activity in B cells. The results above suggested that the region of the J chain promoter from −70 to −56 might contain a binding site for a MEF2-related transcription factor. We therefore performed gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from S194 using the B8(−70/45) probe, a 24-bp fragment containing the JA and JB sites, and detected the presence of three major DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3 A). The specificity of the complexes was determined by competition for binding with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Competition of the B8(−70/45) 32P-labeled probe with excess unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide B10, an 18-bp (−74/−56) J chain promoter sequence containing the MEF2 site, resulted in specific displacement of complex 1 and 2 binding. In contrast, unlabeled sequence PU.1(−63/−45) corresponding to the PU.1 site competed successfully for the binding of complex 3. To correlate specific binding of the putative MEF2 core sequence with the functional expression shown in Fig. 2, we examined the ability of the mutant oligonucleotide (−72/−57; mutant JA, 5′-CTGGGGTTCGGGTAAG-3′) not containing the PU.1 site but with a 4-bp substitution within the MEF2 site (which abolished reporter specific expression) to compete for binding of the MEF2 site. As shown in Fig. 3 A. the mutant oligonucleotide was unable to effectively compete for binding. To initially assess whether the binding complex might reflect binding of a MEF2 family member, binding experiments were carried out with in vitro translated MEF2C (which binds the common consensus site of the MEF2 family) and the B8 probe (−70 to −45), which contains the putative MEF2 and PU.1 binding sites. The MEF2C cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro, yielding a protein of apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gel, in agreement with the predicted size based on the published cDNA sequence (11Doduo E. Sparrow D.B. Mohun T. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis (using a MEF2 antibody cross-reactive with MEF2A, C, and D) of the translated product along with nuclear extracts from B cell lines revealed the presence of in vitro translated MEF2C and a band in nuclear extracts with similar size and mobility (Fig. 3 B). Gel mobility shift assays showed that in vitro translated MEF2C bound the B8 probe strongly (Fig. 3 C, 5th lane). Moreover, in vitro translated MEF2C protein and endogenous protein from the myeloma cell line S194 had similar DNA binding properties in terms of mobility of the complex. To directly demonstrate that the binding was in fact due to a MEF2 family member, we performed antibody blocking gel mobility shift assay. Incubation of the S194 extracts with a MEF2 antibody resulted in inhibition of the formation of complex 2 (Fig. 3 C, 3rd lane), confirming the presence of a MEF2-specific DNA binding complex. We observed a similar inhibition of complex formation in the case of the in vitrotranslated protein (Fig. 3 C, 7th lane). In contrast, control antiserum (anti-PU.1) did not result in any inhibition of complex 2 formation (Fig. 3 C, 2nd and 6thlanes) but instead inhibited the formation of complex 3 (PU.1 specific DNA complex). The MEF2 antibody used in this study recognizes and cross-reacts with mouse MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D proteins. Antibodies specific to MEF2B and MEF2D were used to further characterize the MEF2 family member present in the complex. Since neither antibody was able to inhibit formation of the complex (data not shown), these studies indicate that the MEF2 family member binding the MEF2 site is either MEF2A, MEF2C, or a previously unidentified family member. The antibodies available cannot distinguish between these possible family members. These results indicate that NFJA is a MEF2 family member (referred to as B-MEF2) with similar in vitrobinding properties and an identical consensus binding site. The MEF2 family of transcription factors shows a high degree of homology in the MADS box and the adjacent MEF2 domain, which together constitute the DNA binding domain of these proteins (12Martin J.F.

Indeed, previous studies have shown that MEF2 proteins with mutations within this DNA binding region act as dominant negative mutants, which can inhibit activation of MEF2-dependent genes by wild type MEF2C (10Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional in vivo role of B-MEF2 in J chain gene expression, therefore, a construct containing the DNA binding domain of MEF2C was overexpressed. If this mutant protein could function as a dominant negative mutant, it should suppress the activity of endogenously expressed B-MEF2. The DNA binding domain of MEF2C was cloned into the vector pcDNA1 (containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer) and co-transfected into S194 cells along with a CAT reporter gene construct containing 1.24 kb of the J chain promoter sequence. Control transfections included expression vectors containing no insert or a reporter construct in which the J chain promoter sequence was replaced with the minimal γ fibrinogen promoter. Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant resulted in a near complete inhibition of reporter gene expression (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, overexpression of the MEF2C mutant did not suppress the reporter construct that contained the γ minimal fibrinogen promoter in place of the J chain promoter sequence. These results indicate that the dominant negative effect of the MEF2 mutant was specific to the J chain promoter MEF2 site. To determine whether MEF2C could transactivate via the MEF2 site within the J chain promoter in B cells, cotransfection experiments were performed using MEF2C cDNA cloned into pcDNA1 as the expression plasmid and various reporter constructs containing the J chain promoter MEF2 site. The reporter constructs contained a heterologous minimal promoter (γ-fibrinogen) and four copies of the MEF2 binding site (JA) driving the bacterial CAT gene. The reporter and effector plasmids were then introduced into the S194 cell line. Transactivation of the CAT reporter gene was observed when MEF2C was expressed simultaneously. In S194 there was a 10-fold increase in CAT expression when both the reporter and MEF2C cDNA were cotransfected together. As shown in Fig. 4 B, activation of the reporter constructs was dependent solely on the presence of the intact MEF2 binding sites and the presence of MEF2C. No increase in CAT activity was observed in the absence of JA sites. These results indicate that MEF2C can function as a transcriptional activator, specifically via the target JA site on the J chain promoter in B cells. The expression of the J chain gene has been shown to correlate with the different stages of B cell differentiation. The J chain gene remains silent during the early antigen-independent stages of differentiation but becomes activated when the mature B cell makes contact with antigen and T cell lymphokines (22Nakanishi K. Cohen D.I. Blackman M. Nielsen E. Ohara J. Hamaoka T. Koshland M.E. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1736-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding properties of B-MEF2 were therefore analyzed over a range of B lymphoid cell lines to determine whether a similar expression pattern during B cell differentiation was displayed. Binding properties of B-MEF2 were examined by gel mobility shift assays using the B8 probe (which includes the PU.1 site) and nuclear extracts from cell lines representing different stages in B cell development. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the B-MEF2 complex appeared in the highly differentiated S194 cell line. Low or almost undetectable amounts were observed in the pre-B cell line PD36, immature B cell line WEHI 231, and the mature B cell line K46R, representing the early stages of B cell differentiation. To determine whether the amounts of bound B-MEF2 correlated with the levels of MEF2 family member proteins present in these cell lines, we performed Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts from B cell lines representing different stages in B cell differentiation were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using antibodies recognizing MEF2 family members. The same blots were also probed with antibodies specific for actin to confirm equivalent loading of sample protein. As shown in Fig. 5 B, detectable levels of MEF2 proteins were observed in cell lines representing the early stages of B cell differentiation. These results indicate that the presence of MEF2 transcription family members in early B cells does not correlate with increased binding to the MEF2 site. However, the presence of high levels of expressed and bound MEF2 complex in the highly differentiated plasmacytoma S194 cell line is consistent with the role of B-MEF2 as a positive regulator of the J chain gene. In a primary immune response J chain, gene expression is induced by cytokines such as IL-2 or IL-5, leading to the secretion of the pentameric (IgM)5J antibody. This J chain response has been duplicated in vitroin the cloned murine B cell lines with physiological doses of recombinant IL-2 and/or IL-5. The effect of addition of these cytokines was therefore analyzed to determine whether there were any changes in the levels of MEF2 family member proteins. We utilized the BCL1 cell line as a model for normal B cell activation, because it can be induced to express high levels of J chain protein after IL-2 or IL-5 stimulation. Nuclear proteins were extracted after 3 days of IL-2 or IL-5 stimulation and assayed for MEF2 proteins by Western blot analysis. We found that the addition of IL-2 or IL-5 resulted in increased expression of MEF2 proteins (Fig. 6 A). This is consistent with the levels of expression of the J chain gene in BCL1 cells on induction by IL-2 or IL-5 (Fig. 6 A). We also performed mobility shift experiments with nuclear extracts that showed an increased binding of B-MEF2 protein in activated BCL1 cells in comparison with unactivated BCL1 cells (Fig. 6 B, 1st and 2nd lanes). In contrast, as we reported earlier, the levels of PU.1 were unchanged after the addition of IL-2 (4Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides specific for PU.1, MEF2, and mutant MEF2 were used to show specificity of the bound complexes (Fig. 6 B, 3rd–5th lanes). These results suggest that the amounts of B-MEF2 protein are induced by IL-2 and IL-5, similar to the induction observed with J chain. In the present study we have demonstrated that a member of the transcription factor MEF2 family, B-MEF2, specifically binds the JA element of the J chain promoter. By deletion analysis, the binding site for MEF2 was identified between −74 and −56 nucleotides within the J chain promoter. Mutations in the JA site resulted in an almost complete loss of CAT activity when the JA site was placed under the control of the J chain promoter or with a heterologous minimal promoter. By several criteria we show that the DNA-binding protein that interacts with the JA site is a MEF2-related protein. First, in vitrotranslated MEF2C recognizes and binds the JA site with strong and comparable affinity as endogenously expressed B-MEF2. Second, oligonucleotides corresponding to the JA site competed specifically with the B8 probe for binding to the B-MEF2 protein in nuclear extracts, whereas a mutant oligonucleotide failed to compete with the B8 probe in similar binding experiments. Also, antibodies recognizing MEF2 family members were able to inhibit complex formation in both nuclear and in vitro translated extracts. Finally, we show that MEF2C transactivates reporter constructs containing the JA site, and a dominant negative mutant of MEF2C suppresses the transcriptional activity of the J chain reporter construct. The presence of a MEF2 binding site within the J chain promoter was unexpected since MEF2 factors have previously been described to be muscle-specific factors (23Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 24Yu Y-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, all the MEF2 factors form hetero- and homodimers that bind to an A/T rich consensus sequence found in the control regions of numerous muscle-specific genes. More recently however, transcripts of MEF2 family members have been shown to be more widely expressed. The potential function of MEF2 proteins in these various non-muscle tissues has yet to be elucidated. In this study we provide evidence for a novel role for the MEF2 family of transcription factors in B cell development. The role of B-MEF2 in immune cell development described here is specifically important, since this expands the regulatory potential of these proteins to regulate gene transcription during development in cell types not restricted to muscle lineage. Moreover, these proteins along with their isoforms could recruit other transcription factors into combinatorial interactions forming regulatory complexes, providing a network of transcription control. The pattern of MEF2 binding and expression in B cell lines representing different stages of differentiation suggests that low levels of B-MEF2 are expressed through the early stages of development. However, in activated B cell lines, the amounts of bound B-MEF2 protein increase, correlating with the expression of J chain during B cell differentiation. A similar correlation of MEF2 expression with differentiation of myocytes is also known to exist. For example, similar to the pattern observed in B cell differentiation during embryogenesis, MEF2 transcripts appear initially in precursors of the cardiac and skeletal muscle lineage and are subsequently expressed at high levels in these differentiated muscle cell types (25Chambers A.E. Kotecha S. Towers N. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Edmondson D.G. Cheng T-C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Development. 1992; 120: 1251-1263Google Scholar). Also, mutations of the D-mef2 gene in Drosophila melanogaster suggest that MEF2 is an essential cofactor for differentiation of skeletal, cardiac, and visceral muscle cells (27Lilly B. Zhao B. Ranganyakulu G. Paterson B.M. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Science. 1994; 267: 688-693Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the absence of D-MEF2, myoblasts fail to differentiate despite being correctly positioned. These observations along with our results in B cell differentiation suggest a more wide-ranging role for MEF2 in differentiation processes than has previously been envisaged. Previous studies have shown that either IL-2 or IL-5 stimulate antigen-activated B cells to express the J chain gene necessary for the secretion and assembly of pentameric (IgM)5J antibody (28Blackman M. Tigges M.A. Minie M.E. Koshland M.E. Cell. 1986; 46: 609-617Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar,29Niles M.J. Matsuuchi L. Koshland M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2884-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further analyses of the IL-2 signal revealed that transcription of the J chain gene correlates with chromatin changes in the 5′ region. We show here that the levels of B-MEF2 are also induced by treating BCL1 cells with IL-2 or IL-5. The induction of B-MEF2 by cytokines is significant because it demonstrates a direct link between B-MEF2 activation and the induction of the J chain promoter by cytokines. These studies also indicate that MEF2 family members may regulate gene expression via IL-2 and IL-5 signaling pathways. Earlier studies have shown that in monocytic cells, activation by LPS increases the transactivation activity of MEF2C through MAP kinase p38-catalyzed phosphorylation, resulting in an increased transcription of the c-jun gene (19Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Also, serum treatment has been shown to regulate the activation of MEF2C (30Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and MEF-2D (31Han T-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), thereby increasing expression of the c-jun gene. The serum-induced MEF-2C activation requires the MEK5/BMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway. Since mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate several cellular processes including differentiation, growth, and apoptosis (32Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 33Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these studies indicate that MEF2 proteins may have a broader role in regulating gene expression. These findings also indicate that members of the MEF2 family can mediate responses from various external agents including cytokines by using different signaling pathways. We were also interested in determining whether adjacently bound PU.1 synergizes with B-MEF2 to activate the transcription of the J chain gene. We found that B-MEF2 and PU.1 have transactivating capabilities that are likely to function independent of each other (data not shown). Furthermore, when they are present together, they bind the J chain promoter, resulting in an additive rather than a synergistic effect. Moreover, we found no evidence of any in vitro interaction between B-MEF2 and PU.1 using co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). These results are consistent with our earlier observations, which indicated that PU.1 does not require the cooperation of a second nuclear factor for its transactivation function (4Shin M.K. Koshland M.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which B-MEF2 serves to activate transcription of the J chain gene is not known and is currently under investigation. Among the possibilities is the interaction with the recently discovered enhancer upstream of the J chain promoter (34Kang C-J. Sheridan C. Koshland M.E. Immunity. 1998; 8: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This enhancer element, which also responds to IL-2, has several binding sites for transcription factors including CBF (core binding protein) and bHLH protein (E protein), which could interact with B-MEF2 to promote transcription of the J chain gene. Similar mechanisms have been proposed for the role of MEF2 in myogenesis (35Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2889-2892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For instance, it is known that though MEF2 factors lack myogenic activity, they have been shown to potentiate the activity of myogenic bHLH factors. This potentiation appears to be mediated by direct protein-protein interactions between MEF2 and heterodimers formed between bHLH factors and E proteins (36Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 37Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that B-MEF2 may function as an accessory factor for another transcription factor in the activation of J chain gene transcription, similar to the role of other members of the MADS box factor family. The results of the present study demonstrate that J chain gene expression is regulated by B-MEF2. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether this factor is MEF2A, MEF2C, or a novel related protein. The selective expression and function of B-MEF2 in the non-muscle system of B lymphocyte differentiation suggests a wide-ranging role of this factor in developmental processes. We thank Dr. A. Winoto and Dr. Bill Sha for their comments and useful suggestions. We also thank Dr. Patty Zwollo, Dr. Ben Ortiz, and Jeff Wallin for their stimulating and helpful discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2094776852,"In mammals, methionine synthase plays a central role in the detoxification of the rogue metabolite homocysteine. It catalyzes a transmethylation reaction in which a methyl group is transferred from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to generate tetrahydrofolate and methionine.

Homocysteine is a rogue metabolite that is generated by the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine, the spent form of the ubiquitous methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine. Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine constitute a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (1McCully K.S. Atheroscler. Rev. 1983; 11: 157-246Google Scholar, 2Kang S.S.

There are two major metabolic avenues for detoxifying homocysteine in mammalian cells. Transmethylation, catalyzed by methionine synthase or by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, salvages homocysteine as methionine, whereas transsulfuration, catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase, commits it to degradation (Fig. 1). Of these three enzymes, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase has a very limited tissue distribution and has been found only in the liver and kidney (8Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in either methionine synthase (9Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol.

Dis. 1994; 17: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) result in severe hyperhomocystinemia, with attendant early and aggressive occlusive arterial diseases. Noticing the correlation between prominent arterial damage and elevated homocysteine, McCully (12McCully K.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1969; 56: 111-128PubMed Google Scholar) boldly postulated in 1969 that the vascular alterations could be attributed to high homocysteine concentrations. Despite the longevity of this hypothesis, little is known about how cells regulate homocysteine levels or about the etiology of homocysteine-dependent vascular changes. Whereas the activity of methionine synthase directly influences intracellular homocysteine concentration, its activity is itself dependent on auxiliary redox proteins that could influence homocysteine levels indirectly (Fig. 2). This is strongly supported by the existence of the cblE class of patients with an inborn error of cobalamin metabolism resulting in a functional methionine synthase deficiency, albeit the methionine synthase itself is apparently normal (13Schuh W. Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A. Lue-Shing H. Matiaszuk N. Grauer K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper B.A. Pottier A.

Biochemical analysis of fibroblast cells from cblE patients indicates that the reductive activation system is compromised. However, the identities of the mammalian proteins that regulate the activity of methionine synthase have not been established. Methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13) is a cobalamin (or vitamin B12)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from CH3-H4folate1to homocysteine (Fig. 2). During this transmethylation reaction, the methyl group is transiently transferred to the cofactor cob(I)alamin, a supernucleophilic and oxidatively labile intermediate, to form methylcobalamin (16Banerjee R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The latter then transfers its methyl group to homocysteine to generate methionine. During catalysis, accidental oxidation of the reactive intermediate, cob(I)alamin, results in leakage of enzyme out of the turnover cycle and its accrual in an inactive cob(II)alamin state. Readmission to the catalytic cycle requires an electron source and S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. Under in vitro assay conditions, artificial donors such as titanium citrate or dithiothreitol and hydroxycobalamin can serve as an electron source (18Chen Z. Chakraborty S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19246-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the physiological reductive activation system uses NADPH as the preferred electron donor and requires two flavoproteins, NADPH-flavodoxin (or ferredoxin) oxidoreductase and flavodoxin, for electron transfer to methionine synthase (19Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In porcine liver, both NADH and NADPH can serve as the ultimate source of electrons, and crude fractionation studies indicated that at least two proteins are required for reductive activation (15Gulati S. Chen Z. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified the cellular locations of the two proteins: one is microsomal, whereas the second is cytoplasmic. The latter component has been purified to homogeneity and is soluble cytochromeb 5, which suggests the identities of the microsomal NADH- and NADPH-dependent oxidases to be cytochrome b 5 reductase and cytochrome P450 reductase, respectively. Furthermore, purified microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase can reconstitute methionine synthase activity in the presence of soluble cytochrome b 5. The role of soluble cytochrome b 5 in the reductive activation of methionine synthase is a novel addition to its so far limited repertoire of known functions. Cytochromeb 5 represents an additional locus that is a candidate for genetic polymorphisms that may be correlated with mild hyperhomocystinemia. Porcine livers obtained fresh from a slaughterhouse in Crete, Nebraska, were cubed and stored frozen at −80 °C until further use. DEAE-cellulose, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, TLCK, dithiothreitol, aprotinin, l-homocysteine thiolactone, and NADPH were purchased from Sigma. Bio-Gel P-60 gel (medium) was from Bio-Rad. Phenyl-Sepharose (fast flow) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and HTP was from Calbiochem. (6R,6S)-[5-14C]CH3-H4folate (barium salt; 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. (6R,6S)-CH3-H4folate (calcium salt) was obtained from Schircks's Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Two procedures were employed interchangeably for purifying microsomes. The first protocol (21Ozols J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) represents a slightly larger scale purification in which 300 g of cubed pig liver was placed in 1 liter of 5 mm Tris (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 13 mg of trypsin inhibitor, 25 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mg of TLCK, and 1 ml of aprotinin. The liver pieces were homogenized in a Waring blender at 4 °C for 3 × 1 min at high speed with 1-min intervals. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was filtered through two layers of Miracloth and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of 5 mm Tris (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The washed microsomes were resuspended in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) containing 20% glycerol to ∼30 mg/ml protein concentration and stored at −80 °C until further use. Alternatively, to obtain microsomes of higher purity, a sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation method was employed as described previously (22Dallner G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For this, 100 g of cubed pig liver was placed in 500 ml of 5 mm Tris (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 7 mg of trypsin inhibitor, 13 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg of TLCK, and 0.5 ml of aprotinin. The initial homogenization, centrifugation, and filtration steps were conducted as described above, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was suspended in 9 ml of 5 mm Tris (pH 7.2) containing 0.44m sucrose and 1 mm MgCl2 and layered over a discontinuous gradient. The latter consisted of 3 ml of 3 m sucrose and 15 mm CsCl overlaid with 1.0 ml of 0.6 m sucrose and 15 mm CsCl. The extract was centrifuged for 3 h at 105,000 × g. The upper band containing the smooth microsomes sedimented above the interface, whereas the rough microsomal fraction sedimented at the bottom of the tube. The two microsome-containing bands were separately resuspended in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) containing 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C until further use. Microsomal localization of component I activity was verified by measuring the activity of the marker enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, in which the formation of free phosphate was followed (23Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 2. Academic Press, New York1974: 876-880Google Scholar). Microsomal samples (1 ml) were dialyzed against two changes of a 2-liter solution containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA to remove the phosphate prior to the glucose-6-phosphatase assay being performed. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. One pig liver was cubed and placed in 2 liters of 100 mm potassium Pi(pH 5.9) containing 25 mg of trypsin inhibitor, 50 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 mg of TLCK, and 2 ml of aprotinin and was homogenized at high speed in a Waring blender for 3 × 1-min bursts with 1-min intervals to prevent overheating. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was filtered through two layers of Miracloth. Approximately 500 ml of DEAE-cellulose slurry pre-equilibrated with 50 mmpotassium Pi (pH 7.2) was added to the homogenate, stirred for 40 min, and filtered. The resin was resuspended in 2 liters of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2), stirred for 30 min, and filtered. Then, 500 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) was added to the resin, and the slurry was poured into a 5 × 15-cm column. The column was washed with 500 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) and eluted with a 2-liter gradient ranging from 50 to 300 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2). Component II elutes at ∼200 mmpotassium Pi. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼30 ml. Protein from the previous step was diluted 20–30-fold with cold 0.2 m KCl and loaded onto a 5 × 14-cm HTP column pre-equilibrated with 5 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 mm KCl. The column was washed with 200 ml of 5 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) containing 0.2m KCl and eluted with a 2-liter gradient ranging from 5 to 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2) containing 0.2m KCl (in both buffers). Component II activity elutes at ∼30 mm potassium Pi. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼20 ml. The protein from the previous step was brought to 0.4 m ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a 2.5 × 18-cm phenyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 200 ml of equilibration buffer containing 50 mmpotassium Pi (pH 7.2) and 0.4 m ammonium sulfate. Component II activity elutes in the wash. Active fractions were collected and concentrated to ∼5 ml. The concentrated solution from the previous step was loaded onto a 2.5 × 90-cm Bio-Gel P-60 column. The column was eluted with 50 mmpotassium Pi (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 m KCl. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated to ∼1 ml, and stored at 4 °C. Component I and II activities were monitored indirectly by following the activity of methionine synthase. Methionine synthase was purified as described previously (24Chen Z. Crippen K. Gulati S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27193-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anaerobic NADPH-dependent assay (15Gulati S. Chen Z. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was employed, in which the reductive activation system for methionine synthase was reconstituted by adding fractions to be tested for component II activity to an assay mixture containing microsomes (0.6 mg of total protein) with component I activity and purified methionine synthase. Under these conditions, the activity of methionine synthase is limited by the presence of component II. During the purification of component II, typically 200–400-μl aliquots of fractions were added to the assay after being made anaerobic. Similarly, for measuring component I activity, methionine synthase and component II were provided in the assay mixture, and variable amounts of component I were added. The activity of methionine synthase was reconstituted underin vitro conditions using full-length purified recombinant rat cytochrome P450 reductase, which was a generous gift from Thomas Shea and Bettie-Sue Masters (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). The anaerobic assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.2), 500 μm homocysteine, 19 μm S-adenosylmethionine, 1 mm NADPH, 250 μm(RS)-[5-14C]CH3-H4folate, and the three enzymes methionine synthase, soluble cytochromeb 5 (5.2 μm), and cytochrome P450 reductase (0.82 μm) or variable amounts of microsomes as indicated in Fig. 7 B. The assay was initiated and conducted as described previously (25Banerjee R. Gulati S. Chen Z. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a PLATFORM spectrometer (Micromass) at the Department of Chemistry, University of Nebraska. The protein samples were prepared for mass spectroscopy by exchanging the buffer with water by repeated dilution and concentration of the sample in a Microcon-3 filter (Amicon, Inc.). The protein concentration of the final sample was ∼1 mg/ml. The protein band was excised from a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and submitted to the University of Nebraska Protein Core Facility for N-terminal and internal peptide sequence analysis. We have employed a combination of anion-exchange, hydrophobic, and size-exclusion chromatographic steps to purify component II (Table I). Enzyme activity eluted in a broad peak following anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (Fig. 3 A). Chromatography on two other columns, hydroxylapatite and Bio-Gel P-60 gel filtration, resulted in elution of a single and relatively sharp band containing component II activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Hydrophobic chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column resulted in a convenient negative purification since component II bound weakly to the column under the conditions employed. The four-step purification of component II yielded a single protein with a molecular mass of ∼14 kDa as estimated on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4 A). Separation on a calibrated size-exclusion column yielded a slightly larger estimate of 17 kDa for the native protein (data not shown). Hence, component II is a small monomeric protein.Table IPurification summary of component II (soluble cytochrome b5)ProcedureVolumeUnits/mlTotal unitsProteinTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationmlmg/mlmgunits/mg%-foldHomogenate205026555,442,75037.677,08070.61001DEAE-cellulose3315,656516,71424.07926529.59HTP602981178,8603.42048773.312Phenyl-Sepharose622,440134,64011.87119022.527Bio-Gel P-601.872,278130,1001.52.748,1852.4683Specific activity is expressed as 1 nmol of methionine formed per h/mg of component II.

B, Western blot analysis of purified component II using antibodies for cytochromeb 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specific activity is expressed as 1 nmol of methionine formed per h/mg of component II. The identity of component II was established unambiguously to be soluble cytochrome b 5 by four independent methods. First, component II comigrated with purified soluble human cytochrome b 5 and cross-reacted with antibodies raised against it (Fig. 4 B). Second, the molecular mass of purified component II is 10,977 ± 0.81 Da (Fig. 5), which corresponds exactly to the calculated mass for porcine cytochrome b 5extending from residues 2 through 97 in which the initiator methionine is removed and the N-terminal residue is acetylated (26VanderMark P.K. Steggles A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between the molecular mass estimated by chromatographic techniques and the actual mass has been noted previously for soluble cytochrome b 5 (27Passon P.G. Reed D.W. Hultquist D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 275: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Third, we obtained the following amino acid sequences for two high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptides generated by partial tryptic digestion of component II: TFIIGELHPDDR and QAGGDAXENFE, which exactly match the published sequence for porcine cytochrome b 5(26VanderMark P.K. Steggles A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two attempts were made to obtain the N-terminal sequence of isolated component II prior to its identity being known. Both were unsuccessful, consistent with the N-terminal residue being acetylated. Finally, following the HTP column step, an obvious correlation between red color and component II activity was consistently observed, indicating that it is a hemeprotein. As shown in Fig. 3 (Band C), the activity of component II coeluted with heme absorption monitored at 413 nm. Purified component II has a typical oxidized cytochrome b-like spectrum, with a Soret absorption maximum at 413 nm and a broad absorption band in the 550 nm region (Fig. 6). Reduction with dithionite shifts the Soret band to 423 nm and sharpens the α and β bands at 555 and 525 nm, respectively. The α band is asymmetric with a shoulder at 560 nm (Fig. 6, inset), which is a characteristic of reduced cytochrome b 5 (27Passon P.G. Reed D.W. Hultquist D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 275: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The presence of a b-type heme was also independently confirmed by the pyridine hemochrome assay (Ref. 28Berry E.D. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar and data not shown). The anaerobic assay employed to monitor component II (hereafter referred to as soluble cytochromeb 5) activity during its purification is limited by its concentration. Fig. 7 Ashows that the activity of methionine synthase was reconstituted by soluble cytochrome b 5 in a saturable manner. A Michaelis-Menten analysis of this data yielded aK act for cytochrome b 5 of 0.19 ± 0.05 μm and a V max of 6.34 ± 0.44 nmol min−1. Based on the concentration of the methionine synthase used in these experiments, we estimate that soluble cytochrome b 5 is in 20-fold excess at maximal activation. However, only a low proportion (∼30%) of the cytochrome b 5 that we isolated had bound heme. We presently do not know whether or not the heme is required for the functioning of cytochrome b 5 in this activation system, as discussed below. Initial attempts at purifying component I activity from the soluble fraction were unsuccessful. Two observations indicated that component I is membrane-associated. First, component I activity could be precipitated from the liver homogenate at 25% ammonium sulfate saturation, which is typical for many membrane-associated proteins. Second, fractions containing component I activity from pilot chromatography columns that were tested initially were turbid and whitish. The microsomal location of component I was confirmed by the co-purification of glucose-6-phosphatase and component I activities (data not shown). The activity of methionine synthase in the presence of soluble cytochrome b 5 was dependent on the presence of isolated microsomes in a saturable manner (Fig. 7 B). The microsomal fraction could be substituted for purified full-length cytochrome P450 reductase (Table II). NADPH did not support methionine synthase activity in the absence of either soluble cytochrome b 5 or cytochrome P450 reductase. Addition of both components reconstituted methionine synthase activity fully based on the activity obtained in the standard in vitro assay conducted in the presence of dithiothreitol and hydroxycobalamin.Table IIReconstitution of methionine synthase activity by purified cytochrome P450 reductase and soluble cytochrome b5MS activitynmol/minAssay mixture + MS0Assay mixture + MS + Cyt P450 reductase0.01Assay mixture + MS + soluble Cyt b 50Assay mixture + MS + Cyt P450 reductase + soluble Cytb 5231 min−1Assay mixture + MS + DTT + OHB12227 min−1MS, methionine synthase; Cyt, cytochrome; DTT, dithiothreitol; OHB12, hydroxycobalamin.This assay represents the standard in vitro assay and was performed under aerobic conditions as described previously (25Banerjee R.

Mammalian methionine synthase has been the subject of intense interest since it is one of the two cellular enzymes that control homocysteine metabolism in cells. It catalyzes two successive methyl transfer reactions from the substrate CH3-H4folate to the cofactor cob(I)alamin and from methylcobalamin to the second substrate, homocysteine (Fig. 2). The reactivity of the cob(I)alamin intermediate results in its inadvertent escape to an oxidized and inactive enzyme form approximately once every 100–2000 turnovers depending on the assay conditions (20Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Drummond J. Huang S. Blumenthal R.M. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9290-9295Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The oxidized enzyme is rescued to the catalytic cycle in a reductive methylation reaction that employsS-adenosylmethionine and an electron source. The physiological pathway for electron transfer in bacteria is well studied and involves two flavoproteins, NADPH-dependent flavodoxin reductase and the proximal reducing partner, flavodoxin (19Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mammals, which apparently lack flavodoxin, the nature of the physiological reducing system was unknown. Partially purified porcine methionine synthase was reported to have an associated thiol oxidase activity (30Matthews R.G. Jencks D.A. Frasca V. Matthews K.D. Cooper B.A. Whitehead V.M. Methionine Biosynthesis: Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., New York1986: 697-706Google Scholar) that was postulated to function in the reductive activation of the mammalian enzyme. However, we found an inverse correlation between specific thiol oxidase and methionine synthase activities during purification of the porcine enzyme, ruling out the presence of an inherent thiol oxidase activity (15Gulati S.

To date, tumor cell resistance to (6R)-DDATHF has been attributed to decreased drug transport (18Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. McGuire J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), decreased FPGS activity (20Pizzorno G. Moroson B.A. Cashmore A.R. Russello O. Mayer J.R. Galivan J. Bunni M.A. Priest D.G. Beardsley G.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 566-573PubMed Google Scholar), and increased γ-glutamylcarboxypeptidase (hydrolase) activity (19Rhee M.S. Wang Y. Nair M.G. Galivan J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2227-2230PubMed Google Scholar), all of which result in the reduction in the steady state level of cellular (6R)-DDATHF polyglutamates. In this report, we describe a unique mechanism by which murine leukemic L1210 cells develop resistance to (6R)-DDATHF (and cross-resistance to ZD-1694): an expansion of the intracellular folate pool with consequent blockade of the synthesis of (6R)-DDATHF polyglutamates. This unexpected mutant phenotype appears due to a suspected but heretofore unproven feedback control mechanism on the synthesis of cellular (anti)folate polyglutamates, presumably by direct effects of cellular folates on FPGS. 10-CHO-5,8-dideazafolic acid was a gift from Dr. Homer Pearce of Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) and was subsequently obtained from Dr. John Hynes of the Medical University of South Carolina (Charleston, SC); α,β-GAR was also from Dr. Pearce. ZD-1694, 1-chloro-3,5-dimethoxytriazene, (6R,6S)-, (6R)-DDATHF, and their chemically synthesized polyglutamates, and (6S)-DDATHF were gifts from Dr. Chuan Shih of Lilly Research Laboratories. [3′,5′,7,9-3H]-(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate, [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid, and [6-3H]fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA),l-[3,4-3H]glutamic acid from either NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA) or Amersham, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), MTX, and folinic acid ((6R,6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate) from Sigma. [3H]Folic acid and [3H]5-formyltetrahydrofolate were purified by reverse phase HPLC eluted by a linear gradient of methanol and 0.03m sodium acetate (4–12% methanol over 12 min for folic acid; 3–15% methanol over 15 min for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate) and were stored at −20 °C for no more than 2 weeks prior to use. [3H]FdUMP was purified by DEAE column chromatography (21Moran R.G. Spears C.P. Heidelberger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). (6S)-H4PteGlu and 10-CHO-H4PteGlu were prepared as described previously (22Moran R.G. Werkheiser W.C. Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3569-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (6R)-DDATHF-[3,4-3H]Glu3was synthesized by incubating 0.145 mm[3H]glutamic acid (200 μCi) at 37 °C with 200 μm (6R)-DDATHF, 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm ATP, 20 mmMgCl2, and 30 mm KCl, and 2.8 μg of recombinant cytosolic human folylpolyglutamate synthetase (23Sanghani P.C. Sanghani S.P. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 98Google Scholar) in a total volume of 30 μl of 0.2 m Tris, pH 9.0, containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped after 2 h by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The major product was the tetraglutamate derivative, which was identified by cochromatography with authentic DDATHF polyglutamate standards on a reverse phase, paired-ion HPLC column. Product was purified, first on a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA), then on a 10 × 0.46-cm Luna 3 μm C-18 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) eluted with a multiphase gradient of methanol in acqueous tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (Pic A reagent, Waters Associates) run at 0.6 ml/min. To generate this gradient, mobile phase methanol concentration was initially 27%, then was increased to 35% in a linear gradient over 10 min; subsequently, a less steep linear gradient was initiated which reached a methanol concentration of 42% after an additional 15 min; the methanol concentration was then held at 42% for the next 10 min. Pooled HPLC fractions containing (6R)-[3H]DDATHF tetraglutamate were dried under vacuum, dissolved in 100 μl of water, and passed through a 1-ml column of AG 50W-X8 (Bio-Rad) to remove the ion-pairing reagent; the product was concentrated and stored at −20 °C in 20% ethanol. The amount of tetraglutamate product in an HPLC run was quantitated against the area of a known amount of monoglutamate standard. A procedure for the synthesis of (6R)-[3H]DDATHF was developed with the advice of Dr. Chuan Shih of Eli Lilly Research Laboratories, which involved the coupling of [3,4-3H]glutamic acid diethyl ester to (6R)-5,10-dideazapteroic acid. (6R)-5,10-Dideazapteroic acid was prepared by hydrolyzing (6R)-DDATHF in 6 n HCl at 100 °C in a sealed tube for 4 h, followed by purification on a column of DEAE cellulose. The diethyl ester of [3H]glutamic acid was prepared by reacting 18 μmol of [3,4-3H]glutamic acid (1 mCi; 55 Ci/mmol) (Amersham) with 0.1 m ethyltosylate in dry ethanol under reflux for 24 h. Crude diethyl ester of [3H]glutamic acid was purified on a column of silica gel and the pooled fractions were dried under N2. Typically, 3.4 μmol of 5,10-dideazapteroic acid was added to an equimolar amount of 1-chloro-3,5-dimethoxytriazene in 30 μl of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide containing 36 μmol of 4-methylmorpholine and allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature. This mixture was added to the dried [3H]diethylglutamate and reaction was allowed to proceed for 6 h at room temperature. (6R)-[3H]DDATHF was obtained by hydrolysis of the [3H]diethyl ester of (6R)-DDATHF with 1n sodium hydroxide for 6 h at room temperature. The product was purified by chromatography on a column of DEAE-cellulose and further purified on a paired ion-reverse phase HPLC system and the tetrabutylammonium ion present in the mobile phase was removed as described above. The product was stored at −20 °C in 33% ethanol. The purity and specific activity of the final product was determined by paired ion HPLC and scintillation counting; coinjection of (6R)-[3H]DDATHF with standard (6R)-DDATHF allowed purity to be estimated at >98%. (6R)-[3H]DDATHF was stable (<2% impurities detected by HPLC) for at least 2 weeks when stored at −20° C. The stability of the radiolabel was studied by HPLC after incubation at 37 °C in transport buffer (see below); purity was 95% after 24 h, but dropped to about 70% after 72 h. Mycoplasma-free mouse L1210 cells were passaged in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS in the presence of increasing concentrations of (6R,6S)-DDATHF until the culture resumed the same growth rate as a parallel culture maintained without drug. Initial drug concentration was 0.05 μm; thereafter, drug concentration was increased 2-6-fold every 3–4 weeks. Continuous passage of cells resistant to 3 μm (6R,6S)-DDATHF for an additional 5 months in 10 μm drug did not allow the emergence of a phenotype which could grow rapidly at that concentration of selective agent. Sublines of L1210 cells which grew in 0.5, 3.0, and 10 μm (6R,6S)-DDATHF were initiated from clones grown in soft agarose (24Keyomarsi K. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5229-5235PubMed Google Scholar), and used for all comparisons against similarly cloned wild-type L1210 cells. Exponentially growing cells were transferred to drug containing medium in 24-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 104/ml in a total volume of 1.5 ml. Culture density was determined after 72 h at 37 °C and compared with the density of wells determined at time 0. For short term exposure to MTX, cells were incubated with drug for 6 h, washed with prewarmed PBS, and resuspended in drug-free medium; cell density was determined after a total of 72 h of growth. IC50values were determined by interpolation (24Keyomarsi K. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5229-5235PubMed Google Scholar). GARFT was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as described previously (6Baldwin S.W. Tse A. Gossett L.S. Taylor E.C. Rosowsky A. Shih C. Moran R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This procedure is based on affinity chromatography on a 3-ml column of Sepharose 4B to which 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate was attached via an ethylene linker. GARFT was then eluted with a 3 mm solution of 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid and was passed through a 10-ml column of Sephadex immediately prior to kinetic experiments. GARFT activity was assayed using a spectrophotometric assay which followed the rate of conversion of 10-CHO-5,8-dideazafolic acid to 5,8-dideazafolate (6Baldwin S.W. Tse A. Gossett L.S. Taylor E.C. Rosowsky A. Shih C. Moran R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Smith G.K. Meuller W.T. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Assays contained 11 μm 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid and 10 μm α,β-glycinamide in a 1-cm cuvette. Cellular FPGS activity was determined using (6S)-tetrahydrofolate as a substrate (26Antonsson B. Barredo J. Moran R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For some experiments, FPGS was partially purified as described previously and kinetic experiments were performed using a charcoal-adsorption based assay with either aminopterin or DDATHF as substrates (27Moran R.G. Colman P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For determination of FPGS and GARFT activities, enzyme assays were performed on a high speed supernatant fraction produced by centrifugation for 30 min at full speed in a Beckman Airfuge (about 200,000 × g) or for 1 h in a Beckman Ti50 rotor at 160,000 × g. γ-Glutamylcarboxypeptidase (conjugase) activity was measured by the release of glutamic acid from (6R)-DDATHF tetraglutamate, which was tritium-labeled in the second through fourth side chain glutamate moieties. For conjugase assays, 8 × 107cells were suspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 50 mm 2-ME, and the cells were broken by 3 × 20 strokes of a hand-held Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Microfuge, and the supernatant was used for assays. Protein (0–30 μg) was incubated with 100 μm(6R)-DDATHF-[3,4-3H]Glu3 (0.08 μCi/assay) in lysate buffer for up to 30 min and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of a suspension of activated charcoal in 10 mm glutamate, 10 mm 2-ME, and 150 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.0. The charcoal had been pretreated with Dextran T-70 (27Moran R.G. Colman P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were centrifuged in a Microfuge for 5 min and the supernatant added to scintillation fluid for determination of radioactivity. Log-phase cells, grown in RPMI 1640 medium at a final concentration of 2.0 μm folic acid, were treated with (6R)-[3H]DDATHF for 16 h in the presence of 32 μm hypoxanthine and 5.6 μmthymidine. In some experiments, cells were depleted of intracellular folates by 6 days of exponential growth in RPMI 1640 medium formulated without folic acid and supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 32 μm hypoxanthine, and 5.6 μm thymidine. Cellular folates were reduced to less than 0.02% of control by this procedure (22Moran R.G. Werkheiser W.C. Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3569-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with (6R)-[3H]DDATHF, cells were harvested by centrifigation and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 5% FCS. A known number of cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (Pic A reagent, Waters Instruments, Milford, MA), sonicated for 8–10 1-min pulses in a Heat Systems Ultrasonics sonic disruptor using a cup horn attachment, and the broken cell suspensions were subsequently boiled for 3 min. The samples were filtered through a Microcon 10 filter (Amicon Corp.) and an aliquot was analyzed by HPLC. Recoveries from filtration were noted and used to adjust subsequent calculations. (6R)-DDATHF polyglutamates were separated on a 10 × 0.32-cm column of 3-μm pelicular C18 reverse phase column (Applied Biosystems) as described above. Fractions of 200 μl were collected, radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and the identity of labeled peaks was determined from the retention times of chemically synthesized polyglutamate derivatives of (6R)-DDATHF. For measurement of the total pool of folate derivatives, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium formulated without folic acid to which was added 10% dialyzed FCS and either 2.0 μm [3H]folic acid or 60 nm folinic acid spiked with high specific activity (6S)-[3H]5-formyltetrahydrofolate. After 1 week of exponential growth in labeled folate, the specific activity of the intracellular folates becomes equivalent to that in the medium, and pool size can be estimated by the level of intracellular radioactivity (22Moran R.G. Werkheiser W.C. Zakrzewski S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3569-3575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifigation, and the washed cell pellet was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH. The cell density of an aliquot of the third wash was determined electronically. The lysate was neutralized with HCl and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Standard labeled compound was counted under the same conditions to allow counts/min to be directly converted to pmol of intracellular folates. Cellular levels of 10-CHO-H4PteGlun, and the sum of the H4PteGlun and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun pools were estimated using a modification of procedures (28Kesavan V. Doig M.T. Priest D.G. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 12: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Schmitz J.C. Grindey G.B. Priest D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) based on the entrapment of 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun by excess thymidylate synthase and [3H]FdUMP as a macromolecular ternary complex. The content of H4PteGlun and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun was determined by this method, then the cellular levels of 10-CHO-H4PteGlun were determined indirectly by quantitating the additional H4PteGlun formed in the presence of excess GARFT and glycinamide ribonucleotide. Briefly, cell pellets containing 4 × 106 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of boiling 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% 2-ME, and 1% freshly prepared sodium ascorbate. After 3 min, the suspensions were brought to 0 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min in a refrigerated Microfuge. The pellets were extracted again and the extracts were combined. Aliquots of extract were added to 125 μl of a solution containing 10 mIU of pure L. casei thymidylate synthase, 0.16 μm [3H]FdUMP, and 20 μmformaldehyde in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% 2-ME and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, or 200 μl of this same solution containing, in addition, 1 mIU of recombinant mouse GARFT (4Sanghani S.P. Moran R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10506-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and 10 μm α,β-glycinamide ribonucleotide. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the tubes were boiled for 10 min to denature the ternary complex formed, 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin was added as carrier, and protein was precipitated by the addition of 4 ml of 8% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The final pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of 1 n NaOH, neutralized with 750 μl of 0.1 n HCl, 0.2 m KCl, and radioactivty was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Standard curves were simultaneously run using both (6S)-H4PteGlu and 10-CHO-H4PteGlu as controls. RNA from cell lines was extracted using the Triazol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), denatured with glyoxal, and separated by size on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Biotrans, ICN, Irvine, CA) and hybridized with either a 1.7-kilobase probe representing the downstream sequences of the mouse L1210 cell FPGS cDNA (30Spinella M.J. Brigle K. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or an 800-base pair probe corresponding to the glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase domain of the polyfunctional GARFT mRNA (probe pQ0.8 (31Kan J.L.C. Jannatipour M. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Probes were random labeled to a specific activity of about 2 × 109 cpm/μg and were used at a concentration of 1 μCi/ml hybridization solution (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA). All blots were hybridized at 65 °C and filters were washed to a stringency of 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C; a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was used to normalize for RNA loading. Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with prewarmed PBS containing 5% FCS, and once with transport buffer (107 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.9 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 7 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) (32Sirotnak F.M. Goutas L.J. Jacobsen D.M. Mines L.S. Barrueco J.R. Gaumont Y. Kisliuk R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For studies on influx rate, cells were resuspended in 0.25 ml of transport buffer at a density of 107 cells/ml at 37 °C. Transport was initiated by the forceful addition of 0.25 ml of radiolabeled folates in prewarmed transport buffer and quenched at the indicated times by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 5% FCS. Cells were then washed an additional two times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 5% serum, and the final pellets were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH, neutralized with HCl, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For measurement of folic acid transport, cells were treated with 10 μmtrimetrexate at 37 °C for 10 min prior to harvest, to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (33Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For studies on (6R)-DDATHF efflux, cells were preloaded with radiolabeled drug for 20 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 5% serum, resuspended in drug-free medium at 37 °C, and aliquots of cell suspension were withdrawn with time and processed as above for determination of intracellular label. Sublines of murine leukemic L1210 cells were selected by continuous exposure to stepwise increments in concentration of (6R,6S)-DDATHF. Whereas the parental L1210 cells were half-maximally inhibited by 2.8 × 10−8m (6R,6S)-DDATHF, L1210/D0.5 and/D3 grew in 0.5 and 3 μm selecting agent, respectively, with no detectable change in growth rate (doubling time of 10–12 h) (Fig. 1). Despite several months of additional selection in 10 μm (6R,6S)-DDATHF, more highly resistant cells did not emerge, although a cell line with a slower growth rate, the L1210/D10 cell, was isolated (Fig. 1). The resistance of L1210/D10 cells to (6R,6S)-DDATHF was found to be stable for at least 9 months during continued growth in the absence of drug; the sensitivity of L1210/D3 cells to (6R)-DDATHF was also found to be stable after growth for 6 months in drug-free media. The highly resistant L1210/D3 cell line"
https://openalex.org/W2065636888,"Efficient synthesis of many small abundant RNAs is achieved by the proficient recycling of RNA polymerase (pol) III and stable transcription complexes. Cellular Alu and related retroposons represent unusual pol III genes that are normally repressed but are activated by viral infection and other conditions. The core sequences of these elements contain pol III promoters but must rely on fortuitous downstream oligo(dT) tracts for terminator function. We show that a B1-Alu gene differs markedly from a classical pol III gene (tRNAiMet) in terminator sequence requirements. B1-Alu genes that differ only in terminator sequence context direct differential RNA 3' end formation. These genes are assembled into stable transcription complexes but differ in their ability to be recycled in the presence of the La transcription termination factor. La binds to the nascent RNA 3' UUUOH end motif that is generated by transcriptional termination within the pol III termination signal, oligo(dT). We found that the recycling efficiency of the B1-Alu genes is correlated with the ability of La to access the 3' end of the nascent transcript and protect it from 3'-5' exonucleolytic processing. These results illuminate a relationship between RNA 3' end formation and transcription termination, and La-mediated reinitiation by pol III."
https://openalex.org/W2093144322,"<i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia is a hallmark disease associated with AIDS. An abundant glycoprotein, termed gpA, on the surface of <i>P. carinii</i> is considered an important factor in host-parasite interactions. The primary structure of ferret <i>P. carinii</i> gpA contains a carboxyl-terminal sequence characteristic of a signal for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Here we report the capacity for this gpA carboxyl sequence to direct attachment of a secreted protein, human growth hormone (hGH), to the membranes of COS cells. A control fusion protein (hGHDAF37) was obtained which, under the direction of the GPI signal from decay accelerating factor, directs hGH cell surface expression. A construct (phGH2-1A30) was created similar to hGHDAF37 by fusing hGH to the putative GPI signal sequence encoded in the terminal 30 residues from a ferret <i>P. carinii</i> gpA cDNA clone. By indirect immunofluorescent staining, hGH was detected on the surface of COS cells transfected with phGH2-1A30; this surface location was confirmed by confocal laser cytometry. Metabolic labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]ethanolamine and subsequent immunopurification of hGH from cells transfected with phGH2-1A30 confirmed that a lipid moiety characteristic of a conventional GPI anchor was linked covalently to hGH, and cell surface hGH2-1A30 fusion protein was sensitive to enzymatic cleavage by phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C. Furthermore, hGH2-1A30 recombinant protein cofractionated with 5′-nucleotidase, a classical GPI-anchored membrane marker. Together, these results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal residues of ferret<i>P. carinii</i> gpA constitute a biologically functional GPI consensus domain, thus providing a potential mechanism for antigenic variation of <i>P. carinii</i> gpA during <i>P. carinii</i>pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2065902697,"Factor B and C2 are serine proteases that carry the catalytic sites of the complement C3 and C5 convertases. Their protease domains are activated by conformational changes that occur during convertase assembly and are deactivated upon convertase dissociation. Factor B and C2 share an 8-amino acid conserved sequence near their serine protease termini that is not seen in other serine proteases. To determine its importance, 24 factor B mutants were generated, each with a single amino acid substitution in this region. Whereas most mutants were functionally neutral, all five different substitutions of aspartic acid 715 and one phenylalanine 716 substitution severely reduced hemolytic activity. Several aspartic acid 715 mutants permitted the steps of convertase assembly including C3b-dependent factor D-mediated cleavage and activation of the high affinity C3b-binding site, but the resulting complexes did not cleave C3. Given that factor B and C2 share the same biological substrates and that part of the trypsin-like substrate specificity region is not apparent in either protein, we propose that the conserved region plays a critical role in the conformational regulation of the catalytic site and could offer a highly specific target for the therapeutic inhibition of complement.

Assembly of the AP C3 convertase begins with the association of factor B with C3b in the presence of Mg2+. This association permits factor B to be cleaved at a single site by factor D, which produces the Ba and Bb fragments. Ba dissociates from the complex, whereas Bb and Mg2+ remain bound to C3b. C3bBb, the active AP C3 convertase, is capable of catalyzing C3 cleavage. Association of C3bBb with additional C3b yields the AP C5 convertase, C3bC3bBb, which cleaves C5. Both the C3 and C5 convertases can be further stabilized by association with properdin. Dissociation of Bb from either complex results in irreversible loss in C3b-binding capacity and C3 and C5 protease activity.Factor B is a 90-kDa single-chain mosaic glycoprotein composed of three different types of protein modules (6Mole J.E.

Chem. 1984; 259: 3407-3412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1) The amino-terminal region, which constitutes most of Ba, features three complement control protein modules, found in tandem arrays in many complement proteins and frequently carrying binding sites for C3b and closely related C4b (7Kristensen T.

Proc. 1991; 46: 2463-2469Google Scholar); 2) the middle region is a von Willebrand factor type A module that also occurs in several members of integrin family, often serving as a ligand-binding site and a metal-binding site (8Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) the carboxyl terminus is a serine protease (SP) domain similar to that of trypsin (9Perkins S.J. Smith K.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C2, the complement classical pathway analog of factor B, is similar in structure to factor B (10Bentley D.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Whereas the factor B and C2 SP domains closely resemble trypsin in primary structure, their regulation features an unusual interplay between the SP domain and the adjoining type A domain. Although both factor B and Bb are capable of cleaving small molecule substrate analogs (11Kam C.-M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the capacity to cleave C3 is acquired only through C3 convertase assembly (to C3bBb) and is sustained by continuous association with C3b. Moreover, association with additional C3b (C3bC3bBb) is required for C5 convertase activity. This general activation scheme, which also occurs in the case of C2, is in contrast with that utilized by typical serine proteases in which the amino terminus generated by cleavage of the zymogen translocates to the protein interior, rearranging the specificity pocket (12Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 13Freer S.T. Kraut J. Robertus J.D. Wright H.T. Xuong N.H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The highly conserved amino-terminal sequence that mediates the typical activation mechanism does not occur in factor B or C2 (see discussion in Ref. 5Volanakis J.E. Arlaud G.J. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 49-82Crossref Google Scholar).Electron microscopic examination of Bb and C3bBb have indicated that Bb is a dumbbell-shaped structure, with only one lobe binding to C3b (14Smith C.A.

Thus it is likely in C3bBb that the factor B type A domain is in contact with C3b whereas the SP domain is not, and SP activation is regulated by a conformational signal that propagates from the type A ligand-binding site to the SP catalytic site. In this report, a highly conserved sequence in the factor B and C2 SP catalytic region, not observed in other trypsin-like SP, is partially characterized, and its possible role in interdomain signaling is discussed.RESULTSIn an effort to understand the structural basis for the regulation of the factor B and C2 SP domains, we compared the amino acid sequences of factor B and C2 to those of other trypsin-like serine proteases. In the case of trypsin and chymotrypsin, important determinants of substrate specificity are clustered near the COOH terminus (21Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 22Perona J.J. Hedstrom L. Rutter W.J. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In factor B and C2, at least one of the typical trypsin-like specificity determinants is absent (Fig. 1), and in its place a common sequence of eight identical amino acids (RDFHINLF) was observed. That conserved factor B/C2 element was not found in any other serine protease examined (9Perkins S.J. Smith K.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar).Based on its level of conservation, we hypothesized that RDFHINLF plays an important role in the function of the factor B/C2 serine protease. To test this hypothesis, each of the eight conserved residues of human factor B was replaced by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutant proteins were examined (Fig. 2). Whereas substitutions were permitted at most sites, the substitution of Asp-715 severely reduced hemolytic activity in all five cases. Activity was also affected in two of three Phe-716 substitutions: F716Y had normal hemolytic activity levels, F716W was reduced to 23% that of wild type, and hemolytic activity of F716A was nearly abrogated.Figure 2Relative hemolytic activity of single amino acid substitutions of the Arg-714 to Phe-721 region of human factor B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three Asp-715 substitutions were selected for further examination: D715E was chosen because it retained the wild type negative charge, D715N because it retained some of the wild type side-chain structure, and D715A because it removed most of the wild type side-chain. Factor B forms were treated with factor D and C3b in the presence of Mg2+ in a fluid phase reaction, and the results were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3 A). All of the mutants underwent C3b-dependent cleavage, the first indication that the earliest steps of convertase assembly, the low affinity interaction between factor B and C3b and subsequent recognition and cleavage by factor D, were proceeding normally. Mutant F716A, which lacked hemolytic activity, was also examined by this method, and C3b-dependent cleavage was also observed (Fig. 3 B)Figure 3C3b-dependent factor D-mediated cleavage of factor B mutants. Factor B forms (indicatedabove the lanes) were incubated with factor D alone in theodd-numbered lanes, and with factor D and C3b in theeven-numbered lanes.

This is indicated by a factor D-dependent increase in factor B binding to immobilized ligand (17Tuckwell D.S. Xu Y. Newham P. Humphries M.J. Volanakis J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Wild type factor B bound C3b in the presence of properdin, which stabilizes C3bBb (3Volanakis J.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 9-82Crossref Google Scholar), with binding increasing severalfold when factor D was also supplied (Fig. 4). Asp-715 mutants also exhibited factor D-dependent increases in binding activity (Fig. 4), a strong indication that both factor D cleavage and high affinity bond formation occurred normally. C3b-binding was not detected with F716A (Fig. 4).Figure 4Factor D-dependent binding of factor B forms to immobilized C3b in the presence of properdin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Once factor D-mediated cleavage occurs and the high-affinity complex is established, assembly of the C3 convertase is complete, and the serine protease domain is capable of catalyzing the cleavage of C3. To determine whether the Asp-715 mutants are capable of C3 cleavage, a fluid phase assay was employed. CVF, an analog of human C3b, was used as ligand because the resulting C3 convertases are 50-fold more stable than those that incorporate C3b (23Lachmann P.J. Halbwachs L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1975; 21: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar), and the 715D mutants undergo factor D-dependent CVF-binding at the same rate as wild type factor B (Fig. 5). Biotinylated C3 was used as substrate, and the C3b product was resolved from C3 by gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 6, C3b was formed with wild type recombinant factor B but not with the Asp-715 factor B mutants.Figure 5Factor D-dependent binding of factor B forms to immobilized CVF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6C3 convertase activity of wild type and mutant factor B. In the complete reactions (even-numbered lanes) factor B forms (indicated above the lanes) were incubated with CVF, factor D, and biotinylated C3 substrate.

The single C3 cleavage site lies in the α chain (113 kDa), producing 104- and 9-kDa products. The 113-kDa substrate chain and the 104-kDa product chain, marked C3 and C3b, respectively, indicate relative convertase activity. The unmodified C3 β chain (75 kDa) is present in each lane although the 9-kDa product migrated out of the gel.

At least one mAb is available that recognizes Bb but not factor B zymogen. In an effort to map the anti-Bb neo-antigenic site, an M13 peptide display library was utilized. The library was suspended in microtiter wells coated with antibody, and wells were washed. Bound phage were eluted and amplified, the selection procedure was repeated two more times, and individual isolates were sequenced. All isolates (seven of seven) yielded the identical sequence, HMRLSQWPLLKP, which is similar to a single factor B site overlapping the SP conserved region (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7Correlation of the conserved SP sequence with an anti-Bb mAb neo-epitope.

Mutant proteins were cleaved by factor D, Bb generation was assessed by Western blot, and Bb samples were analyzed using a commercially available Bb-specific ELISA that utilizes the anti-human Bb mAb. Of six mutant Bb forms, the five hemolytically defective mutants were recognized at lower efficiency than wild type, and the one hemolytically normal mutant was recognized at the wild type level (Fig. 7 B). Most affected was BbF716A, which was recognized about 25% as effectively as wild type Bb.DISCUSSIONFactor B and C2 share an 8-amino acid conserved sequence (RDFHINLF) near the SP carboxyl terminus that is not seen in other trypsin-like serine proteases. A panel of factor B mutants was assembled, each with a single amino acid substitution in this region. Whereas most substitutions were functionally neutral, all five different substitutions of Asp-715 as well as one Phe-716 substitution exhibited severely reduced hemolytic activity.The initial association between factor B and C3b is a low affinity interaction. The C3b-dependent cleavage of factor B by factor D produces a high affinity ligand-binding site in the type A domain. All of the Asp-715 mutations examined permitted C3b-dependent factor D cleavage. In vitrobinding studies indicated that the high affinity ligand-binding conformation occurred in at least several of these cases. High affinity binding was dependent on factor D activity, and the formation of high affinity complexes proceeded at rates similar to those of wild type factor B. Nevertheless, whereas C3 convertases appear to assemble, C3 cleavage was not detected with any of the Asp-715 substitutions examined. This shortcoming is likely the primary defect of the Asp-715 mutations. It is not clear from the present study whether the Asp-715 mutations would also interfere with C5 cleavage directly because assembly of the C5 convertase depends on a functioning C3 convertase. The F716A mutant also permitted C3b-dependent cleavage, but high affinity C3b-binding was abolished. Thus, F716A is defective in convertase assembly.The conserved SP sequence, RDFHINLF, distinguishes the human complement proteases factor B and C2 from other serine proteases. It is encoded by a single exon (24Campbell R.D. Porter R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4464-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that encodes the translational stop codon as well as 214-SWG, found in the S1 binding pocket of trypsin and chymotrypsin (Fig. 1). Several non-human factor B and C2 forms were examined for the presence of the conserved sequence. Remarkably, the sequence was found in all reported factor B/C2 forms of mammals, amphibians, and fish, in several cases without substitution (Fig. 8). Preserved since the evolution of bony fish, RDFHINLF is likely involved in a fundamental role that has little tolerance for subtle structural changes, especially in the first three positions. Given that factor B and C2 share the same biological substrates, C3 and C5, and that parts of the trypsin-like S1 pocket and/or its neighboring loop are not apparent in factor B and C2 amino acid sequences, we propose that the conserved region has a critical role in substrate specificity. Residue Asp-715 could be directly involved in substrate recognition.Figure 8Conservation of the conserved SP sequence in the factor B and C2 primary sequences of other species.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 2263-2269PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Residue Phe-716 appears to be of structural significance: Its replacement with alanine inhibits mAb recognition at a proximal site and high-affinity ligand binding at a distal site. Interestingly, substitution of Phe-716 with aromatic amino acids Tyr and Trp permitted at least partial functional activity, which suggests the possibility of its participation in cation-π interactions (25Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar).Although it is unclear why factor B/C2 might have evolved with a different specificity determinant, this novel element may facilitate the unusual conformational regulation of SP function. By this model, RDFHINLF is a key part of a conformationally regulated SP specificity determinant that is controlled by ligand interactions in the type A domain. Its absence in lamprey factor (Fig. 8) suggests its approximate evolutionary origins and indicates that it is likely unique to factor B and C2. In any case, the conserved region could offer a highly specific target for the therapeutic inhibition of complement.Several SP mutations reduced Bb-specific mAb recognition, with the most extreme effects observed with the F716A mutation. The corresponding neoepitope, partially characterized using phage display methods, overlaps the SP conserved sequence. Two simple interpretations are possible. 1) Expression of the mAb recognition site and the possible activation of the conserved sequence requires conformational changes that occur upon factor B cleavage and the release of the Ba region; and 2) Ba could physically block an already existing mAb recognition site and possibly the site of the conserved sequence. Given the likely close proximity between the mAb neoepitope, the conserved sequence, and the SP active site, either explanation could also account for the impact that factor B cleavage and Ba release has on SP catalytic activity.Recently, Tuckwell et al. (17Tuckwell D.S. Xu Y. Newham P. Humphries M.J. Volanakis J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) described a factor B type A domain mutant that is unable to make or sustain the high affinity Bb conformation, although capable of ligand-dependent factor D-mediated cleavage. That mutant, Ch1, is a sequence substitution of a putative Mg2+-binding loop located distal to the type A/SP connection (26Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 27Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Similar functional behavior is reported here in the case of the SP mutant F716A. The cleavage of C3bB by factor D precipitates a conformational change from a low affinityligand-binding catalytically inactive state to a high affinity ligand-binding catalytically active state. Both the Ch1 and F716A mutations appear to block this transition. We propose that these two physically distant mutants indicate an inter-domain signaling mechanism that alters the structure of the SP specificity determinants in response to the ligand-binding state of the type A domain. The complement system consists of about 30 proteins that participate in both innate and acquired immunity (1Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 2Carroll M.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 545-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The complement response is initiated through the activation of several distinct pathways (3Volanakis J.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 9-82Crossref Google Scholar). Each pathway converges in the assembly of the C3 and C5 convertases, multicomponent serine proteases that mark targets for immune clearance or cell lysis (3Volanakis J.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 9-82Crossref Google Scholar) and direct antigen selection by B lymphocytes (4Dempsey P.W. Allison M.E. Akkaraju S. Goodnow C.C. Fearon D.T. Science. 1996; 271: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar).

Here, we show that bovine Tg inhibited 125I-labeled transforming growth factor-beta1 (125I-TGF-beta1) binding to cell-surface TGF-beta receptors in mink lung epithelial cells with an IC50 of approximately 300 nM. After disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) modification, reduction/alkylation, treatment with 8 M urea, 0. 1% SDS, or acidic pH (pH 4-5), Tg exhibited a approximately 5-10-fold increase of 125I-TGF-beta1 binding inhibitory activity with IC50 of approximately 30-60 nM. This inhibitory activity was an intrinsic property of the Tg and could not be segregated from Tg protein by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by immunoprecipitation using antiserum to Tg. Untreated Tg did not affect DNA synthesis but blocked the TGF-beta-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in mink lung epithelial cells. After DSS activation, Tg possessed TGF-beta agonist activity and inhibited DNA synthesis of mink lung epithelial cells and rat thyroid cells. The activated Tg also exerted a small but significant TGF-beta agonist activity in transcriptional activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These results suggest that Tg possesses an authentic TGF-beta activity which can be induced by chemical modifications and treatments with denaturing agents and acidic pH."

DNA topoisomerases are nuclear enzymes that are able to break and reseal the sugar-phosphate backbone bonds of DNA and thereby adjust the topological states of DNA (1Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 2Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 3Osheroff N. Pharmacol.

The existence of multiple topoisomerases in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes has been documented. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I catalyzes the removal of both positive and negative supercoils by transiently breaking one strand of the DNA double helix and therefore changing the linking number of DNA in steps of one (5Champoux J.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar). This mechanism clearly distinguishes the type I from type II enzymes. DNA topoisomerase II catalyzes the strand passing reaction by making transient double-strand breaks and consequently changing the linking number of DNA in steps of two (4Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 6Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent relaxation of negative and positive supercoils, knotting, unknotting, catenation, and decatenation of DNA circles. DNA topoisomerase II is essential for cell viability, and a number of functions have been ascribed to this protein (7DiNardo S. Voelkel K. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 8Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 9Uemura T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1737-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the third subfamily of DNA topoisomerases was originally identified from a hyper-recombination mutant that causes an increase in recombination between repetitive DNA elements (10Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Null mutation of the topoisomerase III (TOP3)1 gene displays its pleiotropic phenotypes including slow growth, hyper-recombination, and a defect in sporulation. cDNA sequence of the yeast TOP3 gene revealed that it encodes a DNA topoisomerase homologous to Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I (10Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical studies with purified yeast TOP3 have shown that it partially relaxes negative but not positive supercoils, and its binding activity has a strong preference for single-stranded DNA (11Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a mutation of yeast SGS1 (slow growth suppressor) gene suppresses growth defect as well as increased genomic instability of TOP3 mutant (12Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the SGS1gene revealed that the SGS1 protein is highly homologous to theE. coli RecQ DNA helicase (12Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 13Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 936-945Crossref Google Scholar). Two-hybrid analysis revealed that SGS1 protein physically interacts with TOP3, indicating that these proteins may function as a complex (12Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This action mechanism is similar to that proposed for the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius reverse gyrase, which contains both a helicase-like domain and a bacterial DNA topoisomerase I-like domain combined in one polypeptide (14Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Tour C.B.D.L. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Kim et al. (15Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) recently reported that the yeast TOP3 gene and EST1 gene, encoding a putative telomerase, are positioned head-to-head on chromosome XII. This arrangement suggests that the two genes may be co-regulated and functionally related. Yeast cell lacking TOP3 shows a shortening of telomeric repeats and a high frequency of loss of the subtelomeric sequences (15Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Human TOP3 (hTOP3) cDNA has recently been cloned and shown to consist of 976 amino acids (16Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This gene locus has been mapped to chromosome 17p11.2–12. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of the hTOP3 with yeast TOP3, and E. colitopoisomerase I and III, revealed that for the region present in all four polypeptides, the human protein resembles yeast protein more than the two E. coli enzymes. Fritz et al. (17Fritz E. Elsea S.H. Patel P.I. Meyn M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4538-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CAT4.5 human cDNA partially suppresses multiple aspects of the ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) phenotype upon transfection into A-T fibroblast. The CAT4.5 insert is an intronic fragment fused to a nearly full-length cDNA of the hTOP3gene. Both the CAT4.5 vector and an antisense hTOP3construct inhibited spontaneous and radiation-induced apoptosis in A-T cells, whereas overexpression of a full-length TOP3 cDNA failed to suppress apoptosis. The results suggested that the hTOP3 may be deregulated in A-T cells and involved in maintaining genomic stability, perhaps in concert with the Bloom′s or Werner′s syndrome DNA helicase (18Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.-Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 19Yu C.-E. Oshima J. Fu Y.-H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). The recent study on targeted disruption of the mouse TOP3 gene revealed that this gene is essential in early embryogenesis (20Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The requirement of mouse TOP3 for viability might be due to its plausible roles in DNA replication and its interaction with the RecQ/SGS1 family of DNA helicases (20Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although endogenous expression of hTOP3 gene was found in multiple somatic tissues (17Fritz E. Elsea S.H. Patel P.I. Meyn M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4538-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the hTOP3 gene at the promoter level are not known. In this report, we describe the structural organization and functional characterization of the hTOP3 gene promoter. Our data demonstrate that the hTOP3 gene contains a single transcription initiation site and lacks a canonical TATA box near the initiation site. Functional analysis of the regulatory region of the hTOP3 promoter identified strong cis-acting elements, at −326 to −275 from the transcription initiation site, for high level expression of the hTOP3 gene. The functional significance of the cis-acting elements and their transcription factors is discussed. Approximately 10 μg of HeLa cell genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and ligated to the BamHI-digested pBluescript according to standard protocols (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.23Google Scholar). A portion of the ligation mixture was used as a template for amplification with two primers: the T7 standard sequencing primer served as the vector-specific primer, and the second primer was specific for the hTOP3 gene-specific primer-1 (5′-CCTTCTCTCCGCCTCATGCGACCGT-3′) complementary to nucleotide +113 through +89 from the translation initiation codon (16Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The first PCR products were reamplified with the T7 primer and the nested gene-specific primer-2 (5′-TCTTCGGGCCGTCGCAGCCACCGGA-3′) complementary to nucleotide −23 through −47 from the translation initiation codon (see location of primers in Fig. 1 B). The amplification products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR amplification product was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy sequencing method (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). In order to test further the specificity of amplification products, the above procedure was repeated with PstI-digested HeLa cell genomic DNA. A 20-nucleotide antisense primer with sequence 5′-GCTGGCCTTTGGAGCTTCAG-3′ was synthesized corresponding to the cDNA region 222–203 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon (16Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide was radiolabeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiolabeled primer (1 ng) was added to 15 μg of total cellular RNA isolated from HeLa cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 mm spermidine. The reaction mixtures were heated at 65 °C for 20 min and hybridized at 37 °C for 2 h. One unit of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) was added to the mixture, and the reaction was continued at 42 °C for 30 min. After completion of the reaction, samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The extension products were dissolved in a denaturing dye solution and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. The size was determined by comparison with a DNA sequencing ladder. Total cellular RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using Tri reagent (Molecular Research Center). RNA samples (10 μg/lane) were separated on an 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and vacuum-transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20× SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). After fixation of RNA on the membrane by alkaline treatment, the membrane was prehybridized at 42 °C for 5 h in 5× SSPE, 10× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, 50% formamide, and 2% SDS. To measure the hTOP3 mRNA level in different human tissues, the hybridization was performed using a filter blotted with 2 μg of mRNA prepared from different human organs (MTN blot,CLONTECH). A probe consisting of a 1.1-kbPstI fragment of the hTOP3 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific activity of 1 × 108 cpm/μg using random primer DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was hybridized with the probe at 65 °C for 12–18 h and then washed serially twice in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min, twice in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min, and once in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min. Control hybridization was carried out using labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe for the cell line Northern blot and using β-actin probe for the multiple tissue Northern blot. A series of plasmids containing various sizes of the 5′-flanking region of the hTOP3 gene were constructed by inserting DNA fragments between the KpnI and BglII sites of the vector pGL2 (Promega). For a directional cloning, DNA fragments were prepared by PCR reactions using the following synthetic oligonucleotides incorporating 5′-KpnI and 3′-BglII sites: for the 5′-ends of the inserts, 5′-CGGGGTACCGGATCCTGCTACCGCGGCGCCG-3′ (−326 to −303 from the transcription start), 5′-CGGGGTACCTCCGCGCCGCGTGACCCGGAAG-3′ (−274 to 253), 5′-CGGGGTACCGATTAAAAAGTCATGAGAAAGAGG-3′ (−227 to −204), 5′-CGGGGTACCGCAAGAAGGAGTCCGATTAACC-3′ (−176 to −153), 5′-CGGGGTACCGGGGCGGAGTGAGACGGGGGCGG-3′ (−125 to −103), 5′-CGGGGTACCGGACGAGGGGCGCGGGACAGTC-3′ (−74 to −53), and 5′-CGGGGTACCGGGGCGCGCGCCTGGCGGAAGTA-3′ (−26 to −4), and for the 3′-ends of the inserts, 5′- GAAGATCTCCCGCCTTCTCCAGCTACTTC-3′ (+12 to −9), 5′-GAAGATCTTCACTGAGCCTTTCCCGTGCCGC-3′ (+82 to +60). Amplified DNA fragments were digested with KpnI and BglII and inserted into the immediate upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Cells plated onto six-well plates were grown to 50–70% confluence prior to transfection. 2 μg of test constructs were cotransfected with 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each plasmid containing hTOP3 promoter-luciferase fusion gene was diluted into 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE was added to 0.1 ml of serum-free medium. Plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE were then mixed together and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to form DNA-liposome complexes. The complexes were added to 0.8 ml of serum-free medium, mixed gently, and placed on top of the cells. Following incubation of the cells for 6 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, 1 ml of growth medium containing twice the normal concentration of serum was added. After an additional 48 h incubation, the cells were lysed in 0.15 ml of lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using the luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems according to the manufacturer′s recommendation (Promega). Amounts of lysates employed for the luciferase activity assays were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 × 107 cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were quantitated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was 6 mg/ml. For gel mobility shift assay, duplex probes were end-labeled by filling in with Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP. Approximately 1 ng of the labeled probe was mixed with 2.4 μg of nuclear protein in a total of 20 μl of the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). After incubation in ice for 20 min, the reaction mixture was separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (40 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. For competition experiments, the molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA was added prior to the addition of labeled probe as specified. For supershift experiments, 0.2 μg of antibody was added to the mixture 20 min prior to the addition of labeled probe, and the mixture was further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. All antibodies used in these experiments were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The 5′-flanking region of the hTOP3 gene was cloned using a gene-specific primer based on the known sequence of hTOP3cDNA (23Shyamala V. Ames G.F.-L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). BamHI-digested HeLa cell genomic DNA was ligated to the linear pBluescript treated with the same restriction endonuclease. The ligation mixture was subjected to PCR amplification using a specific primer-1 annealing to the known 5′-end sequence of the hTOP3 cDNA and the standard sequencing primer T7 annealing to the unknown end. To increase the specificity of the amplification, the first PCR products were reamplified using the T7 primer and the nested gene-specific primer-2 (see location of primers in Fig. 1). The amplification products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of the same gel using a 32P-labeled 5′-untranslated region of hTOP3cDNA further confirmed the specificity of the amplification products (data not shown). By using this method, a 376-bp region upstream of the known 5′-end of the hTOP3 cDNA previously published (16Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was obtained (Fig. 1). The same process was performed with PstI-digested HeLa cell genomic DNA, and an additional 938-bp upstream region was obtained and sequenced (Fig. 1). To determine the transcription initiation sites of the hTOP3gene, primer extension was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A radiolabeled antisense primer was hybridized to total RNA isolated from HeLa cells, and the extension products were analyzed on a sequencing gel (Fig. 2). As deduced from the extension products, the major transcript is being initiated from the guanine residue located 304 bp upstream of the ATG codon. Accordingly, this base was designated hereafter as +1 bp unless otherwise stated and extended the 5′-end of hTOP3 cDNA previously reported by 52 bases (16Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The same primer extension product was obtained using total RNA isolated from other human cell lines (data not shown). The identification of the transcription initiation site revealed that the 5′-untranslated region of hTOP3 mRNA is 304 bp. By adding this region to the 2,928 bp of the open reading frame and to the 575 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence (16Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the size of hTOP3 mRNA was estimated as 3.8 kb. This was further confirmed by Northern analysis of the transcription product of the hTOP3 gene. Blot containing total RNAs from five human cell lines was hybridized with a probe consisting of a 1.1-kb PstI fragment of the hTOP3cDNA. One distinct hTOP3 transcript of about 3.8 kb was detected, and the level of hTOP3 mRNA was approximately identical in all cell lines examined (Fig. 3 A). Control hybridizations with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe confirmed nearly equal mRNA amounts in each lane. Northern analysis of hTOP3 transcript in multiple normal somatic tissues showed that hTOP3 mRNA is present as a 3.8-kb transcript and is expressed to a similar level in all tissues except for the weak levels of expression in lung and kidney (Fig. 3 B). The fast migrating band in the skeletal muscle is known to be an artifact. (While our paper was being prepared, Fritz et al. (17Fritz E. Elsea S.H. Patel P.I. Meyn M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4538-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported the Northern analysis of hTOP3 mRNA in multiple tissues that overlaps with the result of Fig. 3 B in this study.) In order to determine the promoter activity and localize important regulatory regions within the 5′-flanking sequence of the hTOP3 gene, a series of deleted promoter region-luciferase fusion plasmids were constructed (Fig. 4 A). These plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells, and the luciferase activities were measured from the cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both the −1,262/+82 and −326/+82 fusion constructs promoted high levels of luciferase expression. In contrast, 5′-deletions of various lengths from −274 to −74 resulted in a reduction of promoter activity to about 30–43% that of the −326/+82 construct. These results clearly indicate that a positive regulatory element(s) is located between −326 and −275 and that this region is essential for a high level expression of the hTOP3 gene. Transfection of the −26/+82 fusion construct resulted in a lower level of luciferase activity (30%) as compared with that of the −74/+82 construct. This suggested the presence of another positive regulatory element(s) between −74 and −27. The −74/+12 construct showed a much lower luciferase activity when compared with that of the −74/+82 construct, whereas the −26/+12 construct did not have any measurable promoter activity. Based on these results, the Sp-1-binding site located downstream of the transcription initiation site may be essential for the minimal promoter activity of the hTOP3gene (see Fig. 1 for location of downstream Sp-1-binding site). To extend the study of hTOP3 promoter activity to various human cell types, we transfected the −326/+82 construct into SW-48 (colon) and MCF-7 (breast) cells. A similar level of luciferase activities was shown in these cells to that obtained in HeLa cells (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that hTOP3 promoter is similarly expressed in the different cell types examined. In order to demonstrate a nuclear protein factor(s) specific for binding to the 52-bp region extending from −326 to −275 in the hTOP3 promoter, the nuclear protein-DNA interaction was detected by reduced electrophoretic mobility on a native polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 5 A, two major complexes (complexes A and B) and one weak complex (complex B′) were formed with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (lane 2) (see below for the explanation of the complex B′ between complex B and free probe). The specificity of these complexes for the sequence was shown by a competition experiment, in which the complexes were completely abolished by competition with a 40- or an 80-fold excess of an unlabeled wild-type probe (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the same molar excess of a nonspecific DNA fragment failed to compete (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the 52-bp region contains cis-elements for transcription factor binding. Computer analysis of the 52-bp cis-element using MatInspector program (version 2.1) revealed the presence of putative regulatory consensus sequences. In order to identify the nuclear proteins involved in the formation of the protein-DNA complexes, two mutated oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as competitors in the mobility shift assays. M1 oligonucleotide contained mutated sequences in the YY1 core-binding element (CCAT), and M2 oligonucleotide was mutated in the E box (CACATG) as shown in Fig. 5 B. The complex A selectively decreased in the presence of the excess M1 oligonucleotide, and this inhibition was dose-dependent with respect to the amount of the M1 oligonucleotide used in the assay, but the complexes B and B′ were not affected by the M1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3–6). Conversely, preincubation with the excess M2 oligonucleotide selectively eliminated complexes B and B′ but did not affect complex A (lanes 7–10). In conjunction with supershift data using anti-YY1 antibody (see below, Fig. 6 B), these results indicated that the complex B was formed with YY1. The complex B′ most likely contained proteolytic degradation products of YY1, as it was removed by a M2 oligonucleotide and supershifted by the anti-YY1 antibody (Fig. 6 B). YY1 has been previously reported to be susceptible to proteolytic degradation (24Lu S.-Y. Rodriguez M. Liao W.S.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6YY1 and USF1 bind to the cis element of the hTOP3 promoter. A, the 52-bp radiolabeled duplex probe (1 ng) was incubated without (lane 1) or with 2.4 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extracts (lane 2). Lanes 1 and 2 in the following panels were as in A. Competition was performed with 40- and 80-fold molar excesses of unlabeled duplex oligonucleotides containing AP1 (lanes 3 and 4), CREBP (lanes 5 and 6), USF1 (lanes 7 and 8), OCT1 (lanes 9 and 10), and c-Myc/Max (lanes 11 and 12) consensus sequences.

The duplex oligonucleotides containing the binding consensus sequences of AP-1, CREBP, USF1, OCT1, and c-Myc/Max were prepared and used as competitors. In the competition experiments shown in Fig. 6 A, the complex A was completely eliminated by the unlabeled authentic USF1-binding oligonucleotide (lanes 7 and 8) and c-Myc/Max-binding oligonucleotide (lanes 11 and 12). In contrast, the complexes B and B′ were not affected by any of the competitor oligonucleotides used. Wild type oligonucleotide completely abolished the formation of all complexes (lanes 13 and 14).

https://openalex.org/W2075666111,"In most hepatoma cells, the high-K m GLUT2/glucokinase proteins are replaced by the ubiquitous low-K m GLUT1/hexokinase type I proteins. In the mhAT3F hepatoma cells, the stimulatory effect of glucose on gene expression and glycogen accumulation was not maximal at 5 mmol/liter glucose. This response to high glucose is observed in mhAT3F cells, where GLUT2 was expressed, but not glucokinase (assessed by Northern blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). A low-K m hexokinase activity (19.6 ± 3.8 milliunits/mg of protein) was present, but a high-K m (40 mmol/liter) hexokinase activity (13.9 ± 2.5 milliunits/mg) was also detected in mhAT3F cells. The high-K m hexokinase activity was dependent on both ATP (or PPi) and glucose in the assay and was recovered in a 10–50-kDa fraction after filtration. A 30-kDa protein was detected using an anti-glucokinase antibody and localized by confocal microscopy at the same sites as glucokinase in hepatocytes. In FAO cells, the high-K m hexokinase activity and 30-kDa protein were not found. We conclude that a high-K m hexokinase activity is present in mhAT3F cells. This might explain why the effects of glucose on gene expression were not maximal at a glucose concentration of 5 mmol/liter. A 30-kDa protein identified using an anti-glucokinase antibody may be responsible for this activity present in mhAT3F cells. In most hepatoma cells, the high-K m GLUT2/glucokinase proteins are replaced by the ubiquitous low-K m GLUT1/hexokinase type I proteins. In the mhAT3F hepatoma cells, the stimulatory effect of glucose on gene expression and glycogen accumulation was not maximal at 5 mmol/liter glucose. This response to high glucose is observed in mhAT3F cells, where GLUT2 was expressed, but not glucokinase (assessed by Northern blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). A low-K m hexokinase activity (19.6 ± 3.8 milliunits/mg of protein) was present, but a high-K m (40 mmol/liter) hexokinase activity (13.9 ± 2.5 milliunits/mg) was also detected in mhAT3F cells. The high-K m hexokinase activity was dependent on both ATP (or PPi) and glucose in the assay and was recovered in a 10–50-kDa fraction after filtration.

In the context of liver genes, the effect of glucose is potentiated by all stimuli able to favor glucose metabolism. For most genes, insulin, by increasing glucokinase gene expression, stimulates glucose phosphorylation and metabolism and potentiates the effect of glucose on liver pyruvate kinase, fatty-acid synthase, and glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription (5Argaud D.

Indeed, liver Glut2 gene expression is inhibited by insulin bothin vivo (7Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pégorier J.P. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem.

J. 1993; 293: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of glucokinase does not seem to be required for glucose stimulation of Glut2 gene transcription since theGlut2 gene is stimulated in primary cultures of newborn rat hepatocytes that lack glucokinase (13Rencurel F. Waeber G. Antoine B. Rocchiccioli F. Maulard P. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In most hepatoma cells, the effect of glucose on gene expression is lost (14Meienhofer M.C. De Medicis E. Cognet M. Kahn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This could be attributed to a partial dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells since the liver-specific proteins glucokinase and GLUT2 are replaced by the ubiquitous proteins hexokinase type I and GLUT1. By contrast, GLUT2 is still expressed in the mhAT3F cell line, whereas the phosphorylation of glucose is mediated by hexokinase type I and not by glucokinase (15Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Antoine B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Khan A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of glucokinase, the maximal effect of glucose on gene expression is reached at glucose concentrations >10 mmol/liter (17Antoine B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Le Guillou G. Leturque A. Vandewalle A. Khan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17937-17943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This was surprising because hexokinase type I is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate, and its maximal activity is reached at low glucose concentrations (1–2 mmol/liter) (18Wilson J.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, GLUT2 is not a rate-limiting step for liver glucose metabolism. This suggested that in mhAT3F cells, the phosphorylation of glucose was mediated by a high-K m hexokinase. The aim of this work was to elucidate the mechanisms displayed in the mhAT3F cell line to stimulate gene transcription in response to glucose concentrations exceeding the K m of hexokinase type I. Female Wistar rats (200–220 g) housed at 24 °C with light from 07:00 to 19:00 h were used. Hepatocytes were isolated by the method of Berry and Friend (19Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 606-620Crossref Scopus (3615) Google Scholar) from rats in the post-absorptive period, i.e. at 09:00 h. The dissociation of the cells was performed in Hepes buffer (137 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.7 mmol/liter KCl, 0.7 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, and 10 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.5) at 37 °C) containing 0.1% collagenase (1.36 units/mg; Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France) and 5 mmol/liter CaCl2. For each hepatocyte preparation, the cell viability estimated by trypan blue exclusion was >90%. Hepatocytes were suspended in medium 199 containing Earle's salts and 2.2 mg/liter NaHCO3 (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France) with penicillin (10 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and kanamycin (50 mg/ml) and supplemented with fetal calf serum (5%, v/v; Jacques Boy, Reims, France). Hepatocytes were plated on 100-mm plastic dishes (8–10 × 106 cells/dish). For attachment, cells were cultured for 4 h in medium 199 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 nmol/liter insulin (Actrapid, Novo, Copenhagen, Denmark), 100 nmol/liter dexamethasone (Soludecadron, Merck & Co., Riom, France), 2.2 mmol/liter glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.05% (v/v) serum albumin. The medium was then replaced by fresh medium 199 containing only 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. We used 5% fetal calf serum in the culture medium since, in preliminary experiments, we showed that fetal calf serum allowed the maintenance, for at least 48 h, of the Glut2 mRNA concentration at a level comparable to the one observed in liver before cell dissociation (data not shown). When the cultures were performed in the absence of glucose, 10 mmol/liter lactate and 1 mmol/liter pyruvate were added as oxidative substrates. Nevertheless, when the cells were cultured in the absence of glucose in the medium, hepatocytes produced glucose from lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids present in the culture medium, and the glucose concentration in the culture medium was 1.2 mmol/liter after 24 h of culture. The mhAT3F hepatocyte cell line was derived from the tumorous livers of transgenic mouse expressing simian virus 40 early genes under the control of the liver-specific antithrombin III promoter (15Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Antoine B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 Glutamax medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 nmol/liter insulin, 1 mmol/liter dexamethasone, 1 mmol/liter triiodothyronine (Sigma), 30 nmol/liter Na2S2O3 (Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier, France), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. To study the glycogen content, cells were cultured overnight without glucose to deplete the glycogen stores, and then glucose was added in medium as required. The medium was removed after 24 h of culture for the hepatocytes or after confluency for the mhAT3F cells; the cells were then washed two times in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. Cells were scrapped into 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 0.15 mol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter Tris, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmol/liter NADP+, and 2 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol (pH 8) at 4 °C. The cell suspension was homogenized for 2 min in a Potter homogenizer surrounded by ice. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Western blotting was performed with 100 μg of protein from the supernatants. The cellular extracts prepared for hexokinase activity determination followed the same protocol, except that the buffer contained 100 mmol/liter KCl, 25 mmol/liter Hepes, 7.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 4 mmol/liter dithiothreitol (pH 7.4). Homogenates were vortexed and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Hexokinase activity was measured in 100 μl of cellular extracts prepared as described above, in the scraping buffer supplemented with 1 mmol/liter NAD, 4 mmol/liter ATP, and 100 or 0.5 mmol/liter glucose at pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 microunits of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Boehringer Mannheim), and the activity was followed at 340 nm for 15–20 min at 30 °C. One unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity represents the production of 1 μmol of NADH/min at 30 °C. Enzyme activity is expressed as milliunits/mg of protein. The activity of high-K m hexokinase was calculated as the difference between activities calculated at 100 and 0.5 mmol/liter glucose (20Vinuela E. Salas M. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1175-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m value for glucose was determined by measuring the hexokinase activities as a function of added glucose (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mmol/liter), and the results were drawn according to a Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot. The phosphoryl donor was determined at pH 7.4 by measuring the activity of high-K m hexokinase in the presence of 4 mmol/liter ATP, ADP, GTP, or PPi. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS1 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed and scrapped in homogenization buffer at room temperature. Cells were homogenized in a Potter homogenizer for 2 min at 4 °C, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Five ml of the supernatant was filtered on Centriplus 50 (Amicon, St Quentin Yvelines, France) and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. According to the manufacturer, the proteins were separated by their molecular mass with a molecular mass cutoff at 50 kDa. The recovered sample was filtered again on Centriplus 10 (Amicon) with a molecular mass cutoff at 10 kDa by centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C to concentrate the preliminary filtrate. The hexokinase assay was performed on 100 μl. To verify the molecular mass of the proteins in the sample, proteins were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE, and the blots were stained with Ponceau red. Ten μg of protein extracts prepared as described above was separated by Western blotting using SDS-PAGE (14% acrylamide). After an overnight incubation in 5% (w/v) albumin and Tris-buffered saline (TBS), the blot was washed for 20 min in TBS and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. A polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-glucokinase fusion protein produced in sheep was a kind gift from Dr. M. A. Magnuson (21Liang Y. Jetton T.L. Zimmerman E.C. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6999-7007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was incubated for 90 min at room temperature with the antibody diluted 1:1000 (v/v) in TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 3% (w/v) albumin. Then the blot was washed four times in TBS and 0.1% Tween and incubated for 60 min with the secondary antibody (an anti-sheep antibody) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). This secondary antibody was diluted 1:2000 (v/v) in TBS, 0.1% Tween, and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk. Again the blot was washed four times in TBS and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The peroxidase activity was revealed with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech detection system as described by the manufacturer. Blots were exposed for 5 min (Hyperfilm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France). This antibody can detect mouse and rat glucokinases as well. The anti-hexokinase type III antibody was a kind gift from Dr. J. Wilson (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). It was raised against a purified enzyme from rat Novikoff hepatoma (22Preller A. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total protein extracts prepared as described above for hexokinase activities was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to a membrane. After an overnight incubation with 5% (w/v) albumin and TBS, the blot was washed for 20 min in TBS and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The blot was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with the antibody against hexokinase type III diluted 1:200 in PBS, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. The washing and the detection procedures were identical to those described above, except that an anti-rat antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Poly(A)+ RNAs extracted from liver and mhAT3F and FAO hepatoma cells were reverse-transcribed and amplified with appropriate controls (23Heimberg H. De Vos A. Moens A. Quartier E. Bouvens L. Pipeleers D. Van Schaftingen E. Madsen O. Schuit F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7036-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using 0.5 μg of mRNA as template, primer extension was performed with 3 units of Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase (Promega) from 15 pmol of the 3′-primers in the N terminus and catalytic site of glucokinase and in hexokinase type I. The reaction proceeded for 10 min at 25 °C, for 2 min at 57 °C, and for 20 min at 70 °C and then was stopped by 5 min at 99 °C. The amplifications were performed with 2.5 μl of reverse-transcribed RNA and with 15 pmol of the 5′-primers of the domains to amplify. For each set of primers, controls without RNA and without T. Thermophilus DNA polymerase were performed. Specific primer sequences were in the N terminus of liver glucokinase (5′-GAGCCCAGTTGTTGACTCTG and 5′-TTGTCTTCACGCTCCACTGC), yielding an amplified fragment of 285 bp. Another set of primers selected in the catalytic region of glucokinase (5′-GCATCAGATGAAGCACAAGAA and 5′-AGAGGGGACTTTGAGATGGAT) gave a fragment of 190 bp (GenBankTM accession number M25807). The primers selected in hexokinase type I (GenBankTM accession number J04526) were 5′-GGACCATGATGACCTGCGGT and 5′-GTCAGCATGGAGTCTGAGATC; they gave an amplified fragment of 340 bp. The cycling profile of the PCR was 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min, 30 s at 65 °C; and 1 min, 30 s at 72 °C for 10 cycles. The amplified cycles were 30 s at 94 °C; 1 min at 60 °C; and 1 min, 30 s at 72 °C for 25 cycles in a GeneAmp Thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer, Roissy, France). Elongation was performed at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified fragments were separated on a 3% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Glycogen content was measured in confluent cells on 60-mm dishes after 24 h of culture under different experimental conditions. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl and scrapped into 0.2 mol/liter sodium acetate (pH 4.5). The cell homogenates were sonicated for 1 min (1 pulse/s). Cell homogenates (100 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 55 °C in the presence of amyloglucosidase to hydrolyze glycogen into glycosyl units. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 ×g, and glucose assay was performed on the supernatant. Results are expressed in micrograms of glycogen/mg of protein. Total RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). Northern blotting and hybridization were performed with 20 μg of total RNA as described previously (7Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pégorier J.P. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Glut2 cDNA probe was kindly supplied by Dr. B. Thorens (25Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The glucokinase cDNA probe was provided by Dr. M. A. Magnuson (26Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The poly(A)+ RNAs were obtained using the mRNA purification kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hepatocytes and mhAT3F and FAO cells were grown on Permanox four-chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc) overnight in the presence of 20 mmol/liter glucose as described above. The glucokinase was detected using the polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-glucokinase fusion protein produced in sheep. Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized for 4 min in PBS containing 0.1% (p/v) Triton X-100. Cells were incubated for 40 min in diluted antibody (1:2000 dilution in PBS and 0.2% gelatin) at room temperature, washed three times in PBS and 0.2% gelatin, and treated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (1:128 dilution; Sigma). The slides were mounted in glycerol/PBS mounting medium (Cytifluor), and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica confocal imaging system (TCS-4D) and an immersion lens (63×, numerical aperture 1.4 plan Apochromat). Micrographs were printed directly from the computer on a dye sublimation printer (Colorease, Eastman Kodak Co.). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test for unpaired data. When mhAT3F cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of increasing glucose concentrations (0, 5, and 17 mmol/liter), an accumulation of Glut2 mRNA was observed (Fig. 1). Furthermore, glycogen accumulated in mhAT3F cells with a dose-response curve similar to the one observed forGlut2 mRNA (Fig. 1). When mhAT3F cells were cultured in the absence of glucose, the concentration of glucose left in the medium after 24 h was 0.03 ± 0.01 mmol/liter. When mhAT3F cells were cultured in the presence of an initial concentration of glucose of 17 mmol/liter, the concentration of glucose left in the medium after 24 h was 8.65 ± 0.1 mmol/liter. The maximal level of Glut2mRNA in mhAT3F cells was reached at glucose concentrations higher than 5 mmol/liter, suggesting the presence of a high-K m hexokinase. To determine the type of hexokinase present in mhAT3F cells, we performed assays of hexokinase activity at two glucose concentrations: 0.5 and 100 mmol/liter. Two hepatoma cell types were used: mhAT3F, in which a stimulation of Glut2 gene expression in response to glucose was present (Fig. 1); and FAO, in which no response to glucose was detected (data not shown). Both hepatoma cell lines showed an elevated hexokinase activity (activity measured at 0.5 mmol/liter glucose) compared with rat hepatocytes (Fig. 2 A). The highest activity was observed in mhAT3F cells (19.6 ± 3.8 milliunits/mg of protein), and the lowest activity in hepatocytes (4.5 ± 0.09 milliunits/mg of protein). Unexpectedly, we detected a high-K m hexokinase activity in mhAT3F hepatoma cells (activity measured at 100 mmol/liter glucose minus activity at 0. 5 mmol/liter glucose). The high-K m hexokinase activity measured in mhAT3F cells was similar to the one attributed to glucokinase in rat hepatocytes (14.4 ± 3 versus 15.6 ± 0.3 milliunits/mg of protein) (Fig. 2 A). This hexokinase showed a K m for glucose of ∼40 mmol/liter (Fig. 2 B). It catalyzed the phosphorylation of glucose using either PPi or ATP as phosphoryl donor (Table I). Other nucleotides like GTP and ADP did not serve as substrates (Table I). The enzyme was found to utilize PPi much more efficiently than it does ATP (Table I).Table IHigh-Km hexokinase activities in mhAT3F cell extracts measured in the presence of different phosphoryl donorsPhosphoryl donors (4 mmol/liter)High-K mhexokinase activitymilliunits/mg proteinADP0.55 ± 0.05ATP18.5 ± 0.5GTP0.55 ± 0.05PPi34.0 ± 4.0 Open table in a new tab To determine if glucokinase was expressed in mhAT3F cells at a level that was not detected by conventional Northern blotting (Fig. 3 A), we performed a RT-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 3 B). We used isoform-specific primers hybridizing with specific regions coding for the amino-terminal and catalytic domains of liver glucokinase and not present in other hexokinase mRNAs. We used mRNA from mhAT3F (upper panel), rat liver (middle panel), and FAO hepatoma (lower panel) cells, as presented in Fig. 3 B. As shown in Fig. 3 B, with RNA extracted from livers, we detected a 285-bp band corresponding to N-terminal domain and a 190-bp band to the catalytic domain of liver glucokinase. We did not detect these bands with RNA extracted from mhAT3F cells. The catalytic domain of glucokinase was not present in FAO mRNA. We did detect a 340-bp band specific for hexokinase type I with RNA extracted from mhAT3F and FAO cells. This demonstrated that glucokinase was not expressed in mhAT3F cells (Fig. 3). Using an anti-hexokinase type III antibody, we found a large signal located at ∼100 kDa in lung extracts used as a positive control (Fig. 4). The hexokinase type III protein was not detected in mhAT3F cells and hepatocytes (Fig. 4). Using an antibody against glucokinase, we observed an immunoreactive band at 50 kDa in extracts from rat hepatocytes (Fig. 4) and mouse liver (data not shown). We did not obtain a 50-kDa signal with extracts from mhAT3F and FAO cells, suggesting that glucokinase was not present in these cell lines (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, a band around 30 kDa was detected with the polyclonal anti-glucokinase antibody in cellular extracts from mhAT3F cells. This band was not found in rat hepatocytes. Such a band was not observed in extracts from FAO cells, suggesting that this protein was specific for the mhAT3F cell line. To determine whether the 30-kDa protein recognized by the anti-glucokinase antibody in mhAT3F cells possessed a glucose phosphorylation activity, we measured the activity of hexokinase in fractions of protein selected by their molecular masses. To eliminate proteins with a molecular mass higher than 50 kDa, cellular extracts were filtered. We performed hexokinase assay on filtered extracts in the presence of 0.5 and 100 mmol/liter glucose (Fig. 5). A low-K mhexokinase activity was detected in the cellular extract; however, this activity was no longer found in the proteins under 50 kDa. A high-K m hexokinase activity, reminiscent of a glucokinase activity, was measured both in the cellular extract and in the 10–50-kDa mhAT3F proteins. We verified that this activity can be attributed to a hexokinase by performing the assay under the following conditions: 1) in the absence of ATP and in the presence of 100 mmol/liter glucose (0.3 ± 0.02 milliunits/mg of protein) and 2) in the presence of ATP and in the absence of glucose (1.5 ± 0.7 milliunits/mg of protein). Under these conditions, we detected very low hexokinase activities, suggesting that the enzyme required both ATP and glucose as substrates. We did not measure any hexokinase activity in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase alone, without cellular extracts, or in the presence of fructose (data not shown). Thus, the activity measured in the presence of 100 mmol/liter glucose was in accordance with the activity measured in crude extracts (14.6 ± 3.8versus 13.9 ± 2.5 milliunits/mg of protein). This enzyme activity could explain why the transcriptional effect of glucose on Glut2 was not maximal at glucose concentrations lower than 5 mmol/liter. The cellular localization of the 30-kDa protein in mhAT3F cells was determined by immunofluorescence using the antibody against glucokinase previously used for the Western blot experiments (Fig. 4). Images were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. As expected, glucokinase was mainly localized in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in cultured rat hepatocytes; glucokinase was also detected in the nucleus in other hepatocytes (Fig. 6). Glucokinase was not detected in FAO hepatoma cells (Fig. 6). On the contrary, the mhAT3F hepatoma cells did show a positive signal in the cytoplasm, near the plasma membrane, in some cells and in the nucleus in other cells (Fig. 6). This confirmed that the 30-kDa protein detected by the anti-glucokinase antibody was specific for mhAT3F cells. An identical localization was observed in hepatocytes and mhAT3F cells. In the liver, glucose phosphorylation is the limiting step for glucose metabolism since the glucokinase activity is 100-fold lower than the glucose transport capacity mediated by GLUT2 (6Asano T. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.-L. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Unger R.H. Science. 1991; 251: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In mhAT3F cells, which express GLUT2 but not glucokinase (16Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Khan A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar),Glut2 mRNA levels depended on glucose concentrations, as previously reported in hepatocytes (6Asano T. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.-L. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pégorier J.P. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A.

J. 1996; 314: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of GLUT2 could be necessary for the stimulation of gene transcription in response to glucose. This is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that pancreatic beta cells from Glut2 null mice had lost their capacity for stimulating insulin gene transcription in response to glucose (28Guillam M.-T. Hümmler E. Schaerer E. Wu J.-Y. Birnbaum M.J. Beermann F. Schmidt A. Dériaz N. Thorens B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the existence of a high-K m hexokinase in mhAT3F cells was hypothesized to explain the transcriptional response of GLUT2 to glucose concentrations higher than 5 mmol/liter and was tested. An additional argument favoring the presence of the high-K m hexokinase in mhAT3F cells was the dose-dependent accumulation of glycogen in response to glucose. In hepatocytes that overexpressed hexokinase type I after adenovirus infection, glycogen synthesis was unrelated to glucose concentration in the culture medium (29O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By contrast, in hepatocytes that overexpressed glucokinase after adenovirus infection, glycogen synthesis and lactate production were related to glucose concentrations in the medium (29O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These differences could be attributed to the cellular localization of these two hexokinases. A number of studies have shown that liver glucokinase is translocated from a bound to a free compartment in response to glucose, fructose, and sorbitol (30Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Agius L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Okuda J. Nonogaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The translocation occurs in response to metabolic signals that cause dissociation of glucokinase from its regulatory protein (33Van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. Da Cunha M.V. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) The synthesis of glycogen is very sensitive to a small increase in glucokinase activity and correlates more closely with the free glucokinase activity (34Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This suggested that mhAT3F cell expressed a high-K m hexokinase that shared some common characteristics with liver glucokinase. Moreover, aK m for glucose of 40 mmol/liter and an ATP dependence showed common kinetics with liver glucokinase (35Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A high-K m hexokinase activity was found in mhAT3F cells, but not in FAO cells, which is another hepatoma cell line. Using Northern blotting and RT-PCR, we showed that liver glucokinase was not expressed in mhAT3F and FAO cells. Thus, glucokinase was not responsible for the high-K m hexokinase activity detected in mhAT3F cells. Two other enzymes could possibly be responsible for glucose phosphorylation. The presence of a high-K m glucose phosphorylation was reported previously in extrahepatic tissue (36Davagnino J. Ureta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2633-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was attributed toN-acetylglucosamine kinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose at high glucose concentrations (K m = 370 mm) (36Davagnino J. Ureta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2633-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has a molecular mass of 55 kDa, close to the 50 kDa of glucokinase (36Davagnino J. Ureta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2633-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In diabetic rats, the activity of liver glucokinase decreased, whereas the liver N-acetylglucosamine kinase activity remained steady (37Reyes A. Rabajille E. Cardenas M.L. Niemeyer H. Biochem. J. 1983; 221: 311-315Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the activity we measured in mhAT3F cells was N-acetylglucosamine kinase, filtration experiments were performed. After elimination of proteins with molecular masses higher than 50 kDa and lower than 10 kDa, we still detected a glucose phosphorylation activity that was thus not related to N-acetylglucosamine kinase. We also observed a lower glucose phosphorylating activity in cells cultured in the presence of 17 mm glucose than in cells cultured in absence of glucose. Thus, the high-K m hexokinase activity observed in mhAT3F cells cannot be attributed to N-acetylglucosamine kinase because the activity of this enzyme was not expected to be altered under these experimental conditions. The high-K m hexokinase activity observed in mhAT3F cells could also be attributed to the phosphotransferase activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase system (38Foster J.D. Perderson B.A. Nordlie R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 215: 314-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This seemed very unlikely because the glucose-6-phosphatase is located in the microsomes, whereas the high-K m activity was recovered in a soluble fraction after filtration. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was measured at pH 7.4, a pH at which the phosphotransferase was unable to use ATP as a phosphoryl donor (39Nordlie R.C. Lueck J.D. Hanson T.L. Johns P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4807-4812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high-K m hexokinase activity was recovered in the proteins with molecular masses ranging from 50 to 10 kDa in mhAT3F extracts. In liver extracts, a major band at 50 kDa and a minor band at 30 kDa (considered as a degradation product of glucokinase) were detected with an anti-glucokinase antibody (40Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This degradation product was not detected here in rat hepatocytes, but a 30-kDa band was present in mhAT3F cells. We were unable to amplify by PCR any N-terminal glucokinase sequences in mhAT3F cells, contrary to what was observed in rat liver. Thus, the presence of an N-terminal truncated glucokinase protein is unlikely. This band at 30 kDa cannot be attributed to the murine origin of mhAT3F cells since the antibody against rat glucokinase readily detects mouse liver glucokinase. Moreover, rat liver glucokinase cDNA can hybridize on Northern blotting with mouse glucokinase mRNA (data not shown). The ATP- and glucose-binding sites of glucokinase are localized within 272 amino acids (41Schwab D.A. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and these domains are likely to be epitopes that can be recognized by an antibody against purified recombinant glucokinase. Moreover, in mhAT3F cells, this protein was localized in the cytoplasm with accumulations in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in some cells and in the nucleus of other cells. These images were very similar to those observed in hepatocytes. Taken together, these experiments suggest that a new protein whose function is to phosphorylate glucose at a K m for glucose of ∼40 mmol/liter in an ATP-dependent manner is present in mhAT3F cells. This protein has a molecular mass of 30 kDa, shares epitopes with glucokinase, and displays a similar cellular localization in hepatocytes and mhAT3F cells. We are grateful to Dr. Loranne Agius (University of Newcastle, Newcastle, United Kingdom) and Dr. Gilles Mithieux (INSERM U449, Lyon, France) for helpful advice during this work and to Dr. Bénédicte Antoine (INSERM U129, Paris, France) for providing the mhAT3F cell line."

Four of twenty-two mutants in linker analysis showed reduced promoter activities to 45, 30, 10, and 10%, respectively. Specific binding of region A (−4617/−4602) with nuclear extract was competed by a known Oct-1 oligo and supershifted by Oct-1 antibody. Specific binding of region B (−4549/−4535) was competed by a GATA oligo, but could not be supershifted by four GATA antibodies. Nevertheless, mutagenesis showed that critical bases in region B were identical to the GATA core motif, indicating that region B may bind to a novel GATA family transcription factor. The other two adjacent regions designated as region C (−4464/−4445) showed no known consensus binding sites, and their specific placental JEG-3 nuclear extract binding was not evident in nonplacental nuclear extracts and was not competed by a trophoblast specific element (TSE), indicating that region C is a novel placenta-specific element (PSE, CATTTCCTGAACTAGTTTTT). Footprinting localized the binding boundary of PSE-binding protein (PSEB), and three Gs were found to be important for specific PSE binding. UV cross-linking showed that PSEB had a molecular mass of ∼160 kDa, substituting the PSE with two previously reported placenta elements TSE or chorionic somatomammotropin enhancer factor 1 (CSEF-1) motifs resulted in markedly different promoter activities, indicating that PSEB is indeed different from TSE binding protein or CSEF-1. These results are the first demonstration that a novel PSE is the major element for placenta-specific enhancer activity in humanLIFR gene."

The establishment of regulatory programs that control gene expression spatially and temporally are paramount to cellular differentiation during the development of an organism.

MEF-2 was originally identified as a muscle-specific DNA binding activity (12Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The MEF-2 consensus binding site, CTA(A/T)4TAG, is found in the promoters and enhancers of many muscle and nerve-specific genes (10Molketin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the protein products of which are characterized by a common region of high sequence similarity consisting of a MADS domain and a MEF-2 domain (Fig. 1). The MADS box, which is shared with the yeast mating type determination factor MCM1, many products of plant homeotic genes such as agamous and deficiens, and the mammalian serum response factor (SRF), consists of 56 amino acids (18Shore P. Sharrock A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 19Riechmann J.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1079-1101PubMed Google Scholar). Just C-terminal to the MADS box is the 29-amino acid MEF-2 domain, which is unique to the MEF-2 family of transcription factors. MEF-2 proteins bind to DNA as dimers and mutational analysis suggested that dimerization is mediated by amino acids scattered throughout the entire MADS domain, while DNA contacts are mainly mediated by residues located within the first 30 amino acids (18Shore P. Sharrock A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the MADS box protein SRF bound to an oligonucleotide containing the core sequence CTAATTAG revealed that SRF binds to DNA as a homodimer (20Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The primary DNA-binding element is an antiparallel coiled coil of two amphiphatic α-helices (helix-1), one from each subunit. The basic residues of these two helices fit into the major grove of the DNA. The polypeptide chain continues from the N-terminal end of these α-helices to reach over the DNA backbone into the minor groove of the DNA. The rest of the dimerization interface of SRF is made up of a highly hydrophobic β-hairpin, the C-terminal α-helix, and the rather extended polypeptide structure connecting these two elements. The high sequence similarity to SRF within the regions of the N-terminal extension and helix-1 suggested that the orientation of the MEF proteins on the DNA and the details of the interactions are most likely very similar to those observed for SRF (20Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, while the DNA in the SRF complex was bent by 72° (20Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), circular permutation analysis of the complex of MEF-2C(2–117), which lacks the N-terminal methionine, and MEF site containing DNA revealed a bend of only 49° (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MEF-2C(2–117) discriminated poorly between a MEF site with an AT run of length 8 and a SRF site, in which the AT run is only 6 nucleotides long. Both crystallographic and theoretical evidence exists which suggest that MEF-2C should bind more avidly to a run of alternating thymines and adenines than to DNA containing the MEF site, TATAAATA (22Delcourt S.G.

However, MEF-2C(2–117) displayed no measurable specificity for AT runs with different nucleotide sequences. Because the inspection of the crystal structure of the DNA complex of SRF suggested an important function of the N-terminal methionine for specific DNA recognition, we report in this paper the DNA binding properties of GG-MEF-2C(1–117), which comprises the first 117 amino acids of MEF-2C including the N-terminal methionine. The specificity for DNA is significantly increased in the presence of Met-1 allowing the protein to discriminate between different AT-rich sequences in general and between a MEF and a SRF site in particular. GG-MEF-2C(1–117) bends all DNA sequences examined by 70°, a value which is comparable to the bending observed in the DNA complex of SRF. In agreement with the crystal structures of the DNA complex of SRF and of the MCM1·MATα2·DNA complex (20Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) our results support the notion that the N-terminal methionine of MEF-2C is central to anchoring MEF-2C to the ends of the AT run, thereby properly orienting the protein on the DNA most likely through stabilization of the conformation of Arg-3. An N-terminal fragment of the murine MEF-2C protein comprising amino acids 2 to 117 was produced in BL21(DE3)pLys cells (32Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) from the T7 promoter in the plasmid pJGetita as described previously (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K.

To construct the expression plasmid for the production of GG-MEF-2C(1–117), the two synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TATGGGTGG and 5′-TACCACCCA were annealed and ligated with the expression plasmid for MEF-2C(2–117), which had been digested with the restriction enzyme NdeI which is located at the initiator methionine codon. The cDNA insert in the expression plasmid pJGetMGG-MEF-2C(1–117) therefore coded for MEF-2C(1–117) with the additional tripeptide MGG at the N terminus. To construct the expression plasmid for the production of GG-MEF-2C(1–117)R(3)K, PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pJGetMGG-MEF-2C(1–117) was used (34Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The universal T7 primer and the 3′-oligonucleotide 5′-GAATCTTTTTCTTCCCCATACC were used in one PCR reaction and, in a second reaction, the primer Get3Far, which is located downstream of the MEF-2C cDNA on the vector, and the 5′-oligonucleotide, 5′-GGTATGGGGAAGAAAAAGATTC, were used. The two PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, combined in equimolar ratio, and three further cycles of PCR performed without primers. The primers T7 and Get3Far were then added and PCR was carried out for an additional 25 cycles. The final product was digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated to the T7 expression plasmid. All DNA sequences were confirmed using the dideoxy sequencing method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemicals). BL21(DE3)pLys cells containing the expression plasmids were grown at 37 °C on 2 times YT medium with 100 mg/liter of ampicillin and 50 mg/liter of chloramphenicol until the OD550 reached 0.5. Then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested 3 h after induction and kept frozen at −20 °C. The cells were lysed by thawing in the presence of 3 ml of water/g of wet cells and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cells were resuspended by vortexing, and 2 volumes of lysis buffer (100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) were added. The suspension was sonicated for 5 min on ice and the resulting lysate centrifuged at 17,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was then dialyzed against two changes of urea buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The dialysate was sonicated for approximately 10 min at room temperature (until the solution was clear) and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The filtrate was further purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography on a Resource-S sulfonate (Pharmacia) cation-exchange column (36Meierhans D. el Ariss C. Neuenschwander M. Sieber M. Stackhouse J.F. Allemann R.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11026-11036Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in urea buffer over 50 min. MEF containing fractions, which eluted at approximately 200 mm NaCl, were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged to 10 mm Tris, pH 7, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol through dialysis. The MEF-2C proteins were recovered through centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34. The pellet was washed with dialysis buffer, redissolved in 10 ml of 6.5 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mmammonium sulfate, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol by sonication, and dialyzed against five changes of 1000 ml of 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mmdithiothreitol. The proteins showed apparent homogeneity as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Edman sequencing confirmed the lack of the N-terminal methionine in all proteins as well as the identity of the first 8 amino acid residues. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy revealed molecular masses of 13,386 units for MEF-2C(2–117), 13,628 units for GG-MEF-2C(1–117), and 13,605 units for GG-MEF-2C(1–117)R(3)K, which corresponded well with the calculated masses of 13,377 units, 13,622 units, and 13,594 units for the recombinant proteins lacking the N-terminal methionines. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the UV absorption at 210, 215, and 220 nm (37Wetlaufer D.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The protein yields were approximately 5 mg of purified protein/liter of culture. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Microsynth or the Institute of Zoology at the University of Zurich, desalted on Sephadex, precipitated with ethanol, and used without further purification. Phosphoramidites of 6-deaza-2′-deoxyadenosine (P) and 2-amino-2′-deoxyadenosine were purchased from Glen Research and incorporated into synthetic oligonucleotides using standard chemistry on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Complementary strands were annealed by heat denaturation followed by slow cooling to room temperature. DNA sequences are given in Fig. 2. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J600 circular dichroism spectrometer at 25 °C using strain free quartz cuvettes with a path length of 0.5 cm. For every measurement proteins were freshly diluted from a stock solution into 1 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, which had been filtered and degassed prior to use. Spectra were measured for protein concentrations of 2 μm. The concentrations of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were 1 μm. CD spectra of DNA complexes are reported as difference spectra. In Fig. 3 the spectrum of the free DNA was subtracted from the spectra of the complexes, while the contribution from the free protein was subtracted from the spectra of the complexes in Fig. 4.Figure 4CD spectra of DNA in the complexes with GG-MEF-2C(1–117) are independent of the nucleotide sequence.

In essence, bacterially expressed proteins were serially diluted into EMSA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol). This solution was incubated in the presence of 10 nm labeled oligonucleotide for 10 min at ambient temperature. Samples were applied to 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.9 × TAE, pH 7.9. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat-S film at −70 °C. Quantitative data were obtained with a Packard Instantimager using system software. The fraction Φ of DNA bound was determined as the activity of the retarded band (corresponding to the protein DNA complex) divided by the sum of the activities of the retarded and unretarded (corresponding to the free DNA) bands. The best fit for the binding isotherm (Equation 1) was found under the assumption of one protein dimer binding to one double-stranded oligonucleotide as had been observed previously for MEF-2C(2–117) (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Meierhans D. Allemann R.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1997; 11: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Data fitting was performed using the programs SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) and Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). The plasmids pbMEF, pbMEF(-1T), pbMEF(-2A),-1T, pbMEF-D1, pbMEF-D(-1),1, pbMEF(-1G),1C were prepared by inserting, respectively, the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGATGCTGCTATAAATAGA GTG (pbMEF), 5′-CTAGATGCTGCTATATATAGAGTG (pbMEF(-1T)), 5′-CTAGA TGCTGCTAATAATAGAGTG (pbMEF(-2A),-1T), 5′-CTAGATGCTGCTATAATA GAGTG (pbMEF-D1), 5′-CTAGATGCTGCTATATAGAGTG (pbMEF-D(-1),1), and 5′-CTAGATGCTGCTATGCATAGAGTG (pbMEF(-1G),1C) between the XbaI and SalI restriction sites in plasmid pTK401 (39Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Cell. 1991; 66: 317-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were labeled by PCR amplification in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) using primers complementary to sequences flanking the restriction site cassette of pTK401 and purified by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel. To generate circularly permuted DNA fragments, the PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes MluI,BglII, ClaI, XhoI, EcoRV,BglI, RsaI, and BamHI as indicated in Fig. 6 A. The probes were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. EMSAs were performed essentially as described above, except that the samples were applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C and 17 V/cm for 3 h. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat-S film at −70 °C. The mobility of the MEF-2C DNA complexes, normalized to the mobilities of the free probes, was plotted against the flexure displacement of the probes, which was defined as the distance of the center of the MEF-2 site from the 5′-end of the probe divided by the total length of the probe (40Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Starting from a cDNA encoding the first 117 amino acids of MEF-2C (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Meierhans D. Allemann R.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1997; 11: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), a gene was constructed which at the 5′-end contained three additional base triplets coding for the tripeptide MGG (Fig. 1). This gene was expressed in E. coliand the gene product purified to apparent homogeneity. N-terminal Edman sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy revealed that the protein GG-MEF-2C(1–117) lacked the N-terminal methionine but contained two additional glycine residues just N-terminal to methionine 1 of MEF-2C (Fig. 1). Circular dichroism spectroscopy of recombinant GG-MEF-2C(1–117) showed that the protein was at least partially folded for all concentrations examined (100 nm to 1 μm) even in the absence of DNA (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of the shape of the CD spectrum indicated that the α-helical content of GG-MEF-2C(1–117) was approximately 23% (41Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). These observations mirrored the results obtained for MEF-2C(2–117) which lacks the N-terminal methionine (Fig. 3 B) (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The addition of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a binding site for MEF-2C did not induce a change in the conformation of GG-MEF-2C(1–117) or MEF-2C(2–117) (Fig. 3,A and B) (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly no conformational changes were observed when oligonucleotides of heterologous sequence were added (data not shown). The DNA binding affinities of GG-MEF-2C(1–117) with various double-stranded oligonucleotides (Fig. 2) were measured in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 5 A). A constant amount of DNA was titrated with increasing amounts of the protein. The fraction Φ of DNA bound was determined from such experiments as the activity of the retarded band (PD) divided by the sum of the retarded and the unretarded band (D) (Fig. 4, A-C). In agreement with the observations made for the DNA-binding reaction of MEF-2C(2–117) (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the best fit for the binding isotherm (Equation 1) was found under the assumption of one preformed MEF-2C dimer binding to one double-stranded oligonucleotide (n = 1). Φn=[P]/KDn/1+[P]/KDn(Eq. 1) 103 nm GG-MEF-2C(1–117) bound 50% of an oligonucleotide containing a MEF site (Table I), while we had previously measured aK D of 110 nm for the binding of MEF-2C(2–117) to MEF site DNA (Table I) (21Meierhans D. Sieber M. Allemann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence of the tripeptide GGM at the N terminus did not therefore alter the affinity for MEF site containing DNA. However, the measurement of the dissociation constants of GG-MEF-2C(1–117) and MEF-2C(2–117) with mutant DNA sites revealed that this tripeptide greatly enhanced the specificity of DNA binding (Table I and Fig. 5, B and C). While the affinities of MEF-2C(2–117) for the oligonucleotides MEF site, MEF-1T, MEF(-3T), and MEF(-2A),(-1T) (Fig. 2) were indistinguishable within experimental error, the presence of the N-terminal tripeptide GGM allowed the protein to discriminate between these binding sites which differ in the sequence of the AT core (Table I). The highest affinity binding (K D = 82 nm) was observed with a core region of four TA base steps. The inherently rigid A-tract DNA was bound by MEF-2C(2–117) and GG-MEF-2C(1–117) with, respectively, 7- and 10-fold reduced affinity. The interruption of the AT-rich core region through a GC step increased the amount of MEF-2C(2–117) needed to bind to DNA half-maximally by 10-fold. On the other hand almost 20 times more GG-MEF-2C(1–117) was needed to bind 50% of MEF(-1G),1C when compared with MEF site DNA.Table IDNA binding parameters for binding of MEF-2C(2–117), GG-MEF-2C(1–117), and GG-MEF-2C-R(3)K to various DNA sitesDNA sequence[P]1/2 (nM)MEF-2C(2–117)GG-MEF-2C(1–117)GG-MEF-2C-R(3)KMEF site110 (±20)103 (±9)164 (±23)MEF-1T130 (±25)82 (±5)161 (±17)MEF(-3T)118 (±11)112 (±28)NDMEF(-1T)117 (±23)203 (±14)194 (±37)MEF(-2A),(-1T)108 (±20)227 (±22)189 (±26)MEF-A tract742 (±163)1004 (±195)NDMEF(-1G),1C1072 (±200)1780 (±370)1560 (±308)MEF-D1129 (±26)207 (±32)NDMEF-D4109 (±11)135 (±12)NDMEF-D(-4),4(SRF)339 (±73)1896 (±417)334 (±43)MEF-D(-1),1126 (±21)115 (±12)196 (±33)Protein concentration, [P]1/2, for which 50% of the DNA-binding sites are filled.

Strikingly, the discrimination against DNA-binding sites containing AT runs of reduced length is also increased significantly by the presence of the N-terminal methionine (Figs. 5, B and C). While MEF-2C(2–117) could not discriminate between AT-rich cores of length 7 and 8, GG-MEF-2C(1–117) showed a slight preference for the longer sequence (Fig. 2 and Table I). Reducing the length of the core region to 6 by removing the first and the last base pairs of the AT core of the MEF site DNA (Fig. 2), reduced the affinity for MEF-2C(2–117) approximately 3-fold, while an almost 20 times higher concentration of GG-MEF-2C(1–117) was needed to bind 50% of MEF-D(-4),4. However, when the central two base pairs of the MEF site DNA were removed to create MEF-D(-1),1, a binding site which contains a run of six alternating thymines and adenines, the binding affinity was almost as high as with MEF-1T, which contains a run of four TA base steps (Table I). The removal of the amino group in the 6-position of adenine through the substitution of purine for adenine in the core region of MEF site DNA had no measurable effect on the affinity for MEF-2C(2–117) (Table II). However, the replacement of adenine with purine in positions −3 or −4 reduced the amount of GG-MEF-2C(1–117) needed for half-maximal DNA binding by almost a factor of two, while a purine in position 1 or −1 only slightly increased the affinity for GG-MEF-2C(1–117). Replacing adenines in positions −1 or 1 of MEF site containing DNA with 2,6-diaminopurine reduced the affinity for both MEF-2C(2–117) and GG-MEF-2C(1–117) by 4–5-fold (Table II).Table IIEffect of purine and DAP substitutions o"
