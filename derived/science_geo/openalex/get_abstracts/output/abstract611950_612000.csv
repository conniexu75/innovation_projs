The consequences of their distinct ontogeny are unknown but critical to understanding and treating brain diseases. We created a brain macrophage transplantation system to disentangle how environment and ontogeny specify microglial identity. We find that donor cells extensively engraft in the CNS of microglia-deficient mice, and even after exposure to a cell culture environment, microglia fully regain their identity when returned to the CNS. Though transplanted macrophages from multiple tissues can express microglial genes in the brain, only those of yolk-sac origin fully attain microglial identity. Transplanted macrophages of inappropriate origin, including primary human cells in a humanized host, express disease-associated genes and specific ontogeny markers. Through brain macrophage transplantation, we discover new principles of microglial identity that have broad applications to the study of disease and development of myeloid cell therapies.

Microglia are vital residents of the brain parenchyma, where they play important but poorly understood roles in development, injury, and disease (Li and Barres, 2018Li Q.

Arising from yolk sac erythro-myeloid progenitors (YS EMPs) that colonize neural tissue during embryogenesis and undergo a distinct maturational process, microglia are unique among tissue macrophages in that they are thought to remain YS derived throughout life, without contribution from the fetal liver or definitive hematopoiesis (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F.

After insults such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, stroke, malignancy, or genetic depletion, however, microglia dramatically change their phenotype and are joined by infiltrating monocytes/macrophages from the circulation (Ajami et al., 2011Ajami B. Bennett J.L. Krieger C. McNagny K.M. Rossi F.M.V. Infiltrating monocytes trigger EAE progression, but do not contribute to the resident microglia pool.Nat.

These CNS-alien, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived occupants can resemble microglia in morphology and surface marker expression but appear to participate differently in disease pathogenesis, making it essential to further clarify their functions. Identification of a microglia-specific gene cassette has improved resolution of resident from infiltrating cells (Bennett et al., 2016Bennett M.L. Bennett F.C. Liddelow S.A. Ajami B. Zamanian J.L.

Although circulating monocytes can effectively differentiate into tissue macrophages in the lung and liver (Scott et al., 2016Scott C.L. Zheng F. De Baetselier P. Martens L. Saeys Y. De Prijck S.

Do microglia permanently change their identity following disease, or can they return to a homeostatic state? Like YS-derived cells, can macrophages derived from HSCs become microglia? The answers are critical not only to how microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells affect the brain, but also to the growing use of myeloid cell therapies such as HSC transplantation to treat brain disease in humans (Biffi et al., 2013Biffi A. Montini E. Lorioli L. Cesani M. Fumagalli F. Plati T. Baldoli C. Martino S. Calabria A. Canale S. et al.Lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy benefits metachromatic leukodystrophy.Science. 2013; 341: 1233158Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Since our goal was to precisely measure how ontogeny and environment affect microglial identity, we aimed to create a system for transplantation of myeloid cells across development into the brain. We took advantage of Csf1r−/− mice, which lack microglia (Dai et al., 2002Dai X.-M. Ryan G.R. Hapel A.J. Dominguez M.G. Russell R.G. Kapp S. Sylvestre V. Stanley E.R.

Peterson T.C. et al.Neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are induced by activated microglia.Nature. 2017; 541: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar), and found that directly injected myeloid cells extensively engraft in the brain parenchyma, allowing study of donor populations with varied ontogeny. Transplantation into Csf1r−/− hosts offers several advantages. It can be used to study donor cells of diverse origin and developmental stage, and does not require conditioning irradiation or chemotherapy. It yields large numbers of donor-derived microglia-like cells (MLCs) that have been conditioned by the brain parenchyma to express microglial genes in the absence of potentially confounding host macrophages, overcoming limitations of prior foundational approaches to understanding microglial identity (Bennett et al., 2016Bennett M.L.

Microglia in the adult brain arise from Ly-6ChiCCR2+ monocytes only under defined host conditions.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). By comparing multiple engrafted microglia types to MLCs from YS and HSC lineages, we found that microglial identity remains intact ex vivo, even following cell culture. We noted general similarity between MLCs derived from all donor lineages, but found striking ontogeny-dependent differences between HSC- and YS-derived populations, leading to discovery of durable markers of parenchymal macrophage ontogeny. We extended this approach to a humanized transplantation system and verified fundamental conclusions in human microglia and MLCs. In sum, we devised an experimental system to unravel the contributions of brain environment and ontogeny to macrophage identity in mouse and human. We recently demonstrated that cultured microglia have the capacity to engraft in the Csf1r−/− brain parenchyma, which otherwise lacks microglia, after intracerebral transplantation (ICT) (Bohlen et al., 2017Bohlen C.J. Bennett F.C. Tucker A.F. Collins H.Y. Mulinyawe S.B. Barres B.A. Diverse requirements for microglial survival, specification, and function revealed by defined-medium cultures.Neuron. 2017; 94: 759-773.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To further study intrinsic versus acquired properties of microglial identity, we compared three distinct microglia populations after ICT into the CNS between postnatal day 0 and 4 (P0–P4): (1) acutely isolated mature microglia (P21, ICT MG); (2) developmentally immature microglia (P5, ICT P5 MG), which lack expression of the full microglial gene cassette (Bennett et al., 2016Bennett M.L. Bennett F.C. Liddelow S.A. Ajami B. Zamanian J.L. Fernhoff N.B. Mulinyawe S.B. Bohlen C.J. Adil A. Tucker A. et al.New tools for studying microglia in the mouse and human CNS.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E1738-E1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar); and (3) cultured microglia (P18–P35, ICT Cultured MG), which undergo dramatic transcriptional changes in vitro including loss of expression of the microglial signature cassette (Bohlen et al., 2017Bohlen C.J. Bennett F.C. Tucker A.F. Collins H.Y. Mulinyawe S.B.

Pasillas M.P. et al.An environment-dependent transcriptional network specifies human microglia identity.Science. 2017; 356: 1-10Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). By 14 days after intracerebral injection, all donor microglia types extensively engrafted and ramified in the brain parenchyma, often filling entire sagittal sections (Figures 1B and S1A). When normalized to area of engraftment, transplanted microglia reached a similar density to endogenous microglia in a wild-type Csf1r+/+ (WT) host (Figure S1B). By flow cytometric analysis, engrafted cells were CD45+CD11B+ and expressed WT levels of TMEM119 (Figures S1C–S1E). By immunostaining, 100% were TMEM119+ in sections from 4–7 biological and at least 5 technical replicates each across the brain. As in WT mice, we found no TMEM119 staining in the meninges and choroid plexus of ICT mice (data not shown). Extent of donor cell engraftment varied—by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we retrieved fewer microglia from transplanted hosts than WT controls and occasionally observed minimal to no engraftment. Because the host strain for Csf1r−/− transplant experiments was FVB, for which no robustly expressed fluorescent reporters exist, we also verified that sorted engrafted microglia were WT at the Csf1r locus (Figure S1F). These data show that microglia from multiple developmental stages can occupy the postnatal brain, ramify, and express TMEM119 only when engrafted in the parenchyma. To better understand relationships between microglial ontogeny, environment, and transcriptional phenotype, we used optimized techniques to isolate RNA from highly pure parenchymal microglia after ICT into Csf1r−/− hosts based on TMEM119 immunoreactivity (Bennett et al., 2016Bennett M.L. Bennett F.C. Liddelow S.A. Ajami B. Zamanian J.L. Fernhoff N.B. Mulinyawe S.B. Bohlen C.J. Adil A. Tucker A. et al.New tools for studying microglia in the mouse and human CNS.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E1738-E1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Transcriptomic profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that by 14 days in vivo, microglia that had either lost expression of signature genes in vitro (ICT Cultured MG) or not attained full maturity (ICT P5 MG) expressed mature microglial signature genes at nearly normal levels, including Tmem119, P2ry12, Olfml3, and Sall1 (Figure 1C). More broadly, ICT cultured, P5, and adult microglia were highly similar to each other and to their WT counterparts. Of 1,827 differentially expressed genes in in vitro microglia, all but 16 returned to within 2-fold of WT levels after re-engraftment of cultured microglia in the CNS (Figure S1G). Volcano plot overlays demonstrate that differences between cultured WT microglia are largely restored after re-engraftment in the brain (Figure 1D). While transplanted microglia have statistically meaningful differences in gene expression compared to untransplanted WT microglia, these changes likely represent an “engraftment signature” from donor cell isolation, culture, and the Csf1r−/− host environment. Gene expression changes were generally of small magnitude and included several chemokines, tetraspanins, and G protein-coupled receptors, but not a signature of reactivity or specific functional process (Table S1). These experiments show that the Csf1r−/− CNS is sufficient to sustain, induce, and re-induce microglial identity, and that microglial identity potential persists despite dramatic transcriptional perturbations induced ex vivo. Given stable microglial identity despite highly plastic gene expression between adult, P5, and cultured microglia, we appreciated that ICT could clarify relationships between brain macrophage ontogeny and environment. In particular, we wondered whether HSC- or YS-derived macrophages originating outside the developed brain could become microglia in a permissive CNS environment capable of supporting homeostatic microglia. Therefore, we individually transplanted whole tissues and sorted myeloid cells into the Csf1r−/− CNS at P0–P4, including YS-derived cells from yolk sac and fetal brain, HSC-derived cells from blood and bone marrow (BM), and monocytes from the fetal liver, which, at embryonic day 13 (E13)–E14, contains a mix of HSC- and YS-derived cells (Hoeffel et al., 2015Hoeffel G. Chen J. Lavin Y. Low D. Almeida F.F. See P. Beaudin A.E. Lum J. Low I.

Tissue-resident macrophages originate from yolk-sac-derived erythro-myeloid progenitors.Nature. 2015; 518: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). We observed extensive engraftment of ramified IBA1+/TMEM119+ MLCs using all tissue types tested across both embryonic and postnatal lineages (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A–S2C, and S2F), though YS-derived MLCs (YS-MLCs) had a consistently more ramified morphology than HSC-derived MLCs (HSC-MLCs). We verified donor origin of MLCs using a GFP reporter after backcrossing the Csf1r−/− allele to C57BL/6 (Figure 2B), and additionally noted extensive coverage of the spinal cord by donor cells delivered by supratentorial injection (Figure S2D). By flow cytometry, nearly all CD45+CD11B+ cells were TMEM119 immunoreactive, although HSC donor tissues consistently showed lower intensity staining than WT (Figure 2C). Since we saw a small TMEM119-negative population in some cases, we again confirmed by immunostaining that, as with transplanted microglia, all parenchymal but no other IBA1+ MLCs were TMEM119+ (Figure S2G). All donor tissues engrafted to similar densities as microglia in Csf1r−/− brains, except for fetal liver, which reached a significantly higher density (Figure S2E). FACS plots, engraftment levels, and percent TMEM119-positive values are further detailed in Figure S2 to provide potential users a realistic assessment of the robustness of this system. An inherent limitation of the Csf1r−/− model is poor host viability, which required us to measure the effects of CNS residence in ICT experiments after 14 days. To better study the trajectory of effects of longer incubation, we also created a chemotherapy- and irradiation-free peripheral BM transplantation system that allows study of long-term MLC engraftment. Whereas Csf1r−/− mice do not typically survive past weaning age (Dai et al., 2002Dai X.-M. Ryan G.R. Hapel A.J. Dominguez M.G. Russell R.G. Kapp S. Sylvestre V. Stanley E.R.

Chen K. Zhu L. Pollard J.W. Conditional deletion of the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms proto-oncogene) in mice.Genesis. 2006; 44: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), simple intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of WT BM “rescued” approximately 50% of pups, leading to prolonged survival, tooth eruption, occasional fertility, and engraftment of donor-derived myeloid cells in multiple tissues including the brain parenchyma and liver (Figures 3A–3D, S3A, and S3B). By 1 month, the brain parenchyma of rescued mice showed complete, uniform coverage by donor-derived cells (Figure 3A). We harvested well-appearing rescued mice up to 1 year after transplantation and observed stable occupancy of the brain parenchyma by MLCs (Figure 3B). Taken together, these studies show that the CNS niche readily hosts macrophages from multiple donor tissues, including for long periods using BM. The surprising observation that intraperitoneally injected BM populated the Csf1r−/− brain without preconditioning led us to further characterize how donor cells might enter the brain. Since a prior study of macrophage repopulation by peripheral cells found evidence for increased BBB permeability (Varvel et al., 2012Varvel N.H. Grathwohl S.A. Baumann F. Liebig C. Bosch A. Brawek B. Thal D.R. Charo I.F. Heppner F.L. Aguzzi A. et al.Microglial repopulation model reveals a robust homeostatic process for replacing CNS myeloid cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 18150-18155Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we tested for the presence of increased levels of IgG and albumin in the brain, which are largely excluded from the parenchyma under homeostatic conditions. Quantitative region of interest (ROI) analysis of immunostained histological sections showed no evidence for increased albumin or IgG extravasation, and we did not observe focal areas of increased staining, suggesting “normal” BBB permeability (Figure S3C). Since multiple studies suggest that monocyte infiltration into the diseased or injured CNS is facilitated by CCR2 (Ajami et al., 2011Ajami B. Bennett J.L. Krieger C. McNagny K.M. Rossi F.M.V. Infiltrating monocytes trigger EAE progression, but do not contribute to the resident microglia pool.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, Dzenko et al., 2001Dzenko K.A. Andjelkovic A.V. Kuziel W.A. Pachter J.S. The chemokine receptor CCR2 mediates the binding and internalization of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 along brain microvessels.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9214-9223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether engraftment of MLCs was similarly CCR2 dependent in Csf1r−/− hosts. We found that, as with WT BM, i.p. injection of CCR2 Rfp/Rfp (Ccr2 knockout) BM (Saederup et al., 2010Saederup N. Cardona A.E. Croft K. Mizutani M. Cotleur A.C. Tsou C.-L. Ransohoff R.M. Charo I.F. Selective chemokine receptor usage by central nervous system myeloid cells in CCR2-red fluorescent protein knock-in mice.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13693Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) into Csf1r−/− mice leads to robust TMEM119+ MLC engraftment at 2 weeks, meaning that CCR2 is dispensable in this system (Figure 3E). Interestingly, we observed a range of RFP fluorescence levels in engrafted cells (Figure S3D), suggesting that either brain signals suppress CCR2 expression or more than one population of BM cells (as distinguished by CCR2 reporter expression) is capable of brain engraftment. We also noted a preponderance of RFP+ cells in a periventricular distribution (Figure S3E). Finally, to determine whether myeloid progenitors or HSCs were strictly required to create MLCs, we also transplanted BM monocytes that were stringently depleted of progenitor populations (Figure S3F) and observed abundant TMEM119+ parenchymal MLCs by 2 weeks (Figure 3F). The ability of both HSC- and YS-derived donor cells to engraft in the brain parenchyma and express TMEM119 only when engrafted attests to the potency of programming signals from the brain parenchyma. To comprehensively measure the ability of diverse transplanted cells to adopt a microglial transcriptional program, we purified parenchymal TMEM119+ MLCs using identical methods to transplanted microglia, allowing highly specific isolation of parenchymal macrophages. We transcriptionally profiled MLCs derived from E8 yolk sac, E12–E13 fetal brain, E13–E14 fetal liver, adult blood, and BM, comparing them to each other and to transplanted microglia. Among these highly purified transcriptomes, we observed a striking degree of similarity between engrafted cell types (Figures 4A and S4A–S4C). MLCs, irrespective of ontogeny, expressed many microglia signature genes, including Tmem119, Fcrls, Hexb, and Olfml3, at near-microglial levels (Figure 4A). Gene expression in all MLC types was well correlated (Spearman coefficients >0.6–0.8), and in exploratory analyses combining published datasets, MLCs were more closely related to microglia than to other tissue macrophages, monocytes, or neutrophils (Figures S4C and S4D). These data confirm the strong programming effects of the brain parenchyma on macrophages, and the intrinsic ability of even CNS-alien macrophages to respond to programming signals by expressing microglial genes. Although grossly similar, we found major ontogeny-dependent differences between HSC- and YS-MLCs. Principal component analysis showed that the transcriptomes of transplanted microglia, YS-MLCs, and fetal brain MLCs overlap with each other, distinct from blood, BM, and fetal liver MLCs (Figure 4B). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering similarly showed that YS-derived (YS, fetal brain) MLC gene expression is more closely related to transplanted microglia than HSC-derived (blood, BM) and mixed-origin MLCs (fetal liver) (Figure 4C). To focus on ontogeny-specific gene expression patterns, we pooled gene expression data from YS- and HSC-MLC donor groups, excluding fetal liver MLCs since E13–E14 liver contains a mix of YS- and HSC-derived cells (Hoeffel et al., 2015Hoeffel G.

https://openalex.org/W2807053207,"We tested the feasibility and safety of human-spinal-cord-derived neural stem cell (NSI-566) transplantation for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). In this clinical trial, four subjects with T2-T12 SCI received treatment consisting of removal of spinal instrumentation, laminectomy, and durotomy, followed by six midline bilateral stereotactic injections of NSI-566 cells. All subjects tolerated the procedure well and there have been no serious adverse events to date (18-27 months post-grafting). In two subjects, one to two levels of neurological improvement were detected using ISNCSCI motor and sensory scores. Our results support the safety of NSI-566 transplantation into the SCI site and early signs of potential efficacy in three of the subjects warrant further exploration of NSI-566 cells in dose escalation studies. Despite these encouraging secondary data, we emphasize that this safety trial lacks statistical power or a control group needed to evaluate functional changes resulting from cell grafting."
https://openalex.org/W2807291844,"Recent reports indicate that hypoxia influences the circadian clock through the transcriptional activities of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at clock genes. Unexpectedly, we uncover a profound disruption of the circadian clock and diurnal transcriptome when hypoxic cells are permitted to acidify to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Buffering against acidification or inhibiting lactic acid production fully rescues circadian oscillation. Acidification of several human and murine cell lines, as well as primary murine T cells, suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, a key regulator of translation in response to metabolic status. We find that acid drives peripheral redistribution of normally perinuclear lysosomes away from perinuclear RHEB, thereby inhibiting the activity of lysosome-bound mTOR. Restoring mTORC1 signaling and the translation it governs rescues clock oscillation. Our findings thus reveal a model in which acid produced during the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia suppresses the circadian clock through diminished translation of clock constituents."
https://openalex.org/W2806532541,"Cirmtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets ROR1, an oncoembryonic orphan receptor for Wnt5a found on cancer stem cells (CSCs). Aberrant expression of ROR1 is seen in many malignancies and has been linked to Rho-GTPase activation and cancer stem cell self-renewal. For patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), self-renewing, neoplastic B cells express ROR1 in 95% of cases. High-level leukemia cell expression of ROR1 is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We conducted a phase 1 study involving 26 patients with progressive, relapsed, or refractory CLL. Patients received four biweekly infusions, with doses ranging from 0.015 to 20 mg/kg. Cirmtuzumab had a long plasma half-life and did not have dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of ROR1 signaling was observed, including decreased activation of RhoA and HS1. Transcriptome analyses showed that therapy inhibited CLL stemness gene expression signatures in vivo. Cirmtuzumab is safe and effective at inhibiting tumor cell ROR1 signaling in patients with CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2784951640,"The olfactory bulb (OB) is the first site of synaptic odor information processing, yet a wealth of contextual and learned information has been described in its activity. To investigate the mechanistic basis of contextual modulation, we use whole-cell recordings to measure odor responses across rapid learning episodes in identified mitral/tufted cells (MTCs). Across these learning episodes, diverse response changes occur already during the first sniff cycle. Motivated mice develop active sniffing strategies across learning that robustly correspond to the odor response changes, resulting in enhanced odor representation. Evoking fast sniffing in different behavioral states demonstrates that response changes during active sampling exceed those predicted from feedforward input alone. Finally, response changes are highly correlated in tufted cells, but not mitral cells, indicating there are cell-type-specific effects on odor representation during active sampling. Altogether, we show that active sampling is strongly associated with enhanced OB responsiveness on rapid timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2805844509,"Neuronal activity regulates the transcription and translation of the immediate-early gene Arc/Arg3.1, a key mediator of synaptic plasticity. Proteasome-dependent degradation of Arc tightly limits its temporal expression, yet the significance of this regulation remains unknown. We disrupted the temporal control of Arc degradation by creating an Arc knockin mouse (ArcKR) where the predominant Arc ubiquitination sites were mutated. ArcKR mice had intact spatial learning but showed specific deficits in selecting an optimal strategy during reversal learning. This cognitive inflexibility was coupled to changes in Arc mRNA and protein expression resulting in a reduced threshold to induce mGluR-LTD and enhanced mGluR-LTD amplitude. These findings show that the abnormal persistence of Arc protein limits the dynamic range of Arc signaling pathways specifically during reversal learning. Our work illuminates how the precise temporal control of activity-dependent molecules, such as Arc, regulates synaptic plasticity and is crucial for cognition."

Do these behaviors require stability of individual neuron tuning or can the output of a given circuit remain constant despite fluctuations in single cells? This question is difficult to address due to the variability inherent in most motor actions studied in the laboratory. A notable exception, however, is the courtship song of the adult zebra finch, which is a learned, highly precise motor act mediated by orderly dynamics within premotor neurons of the forebrain. By longitudinally tracking the activity of excitatory projection neurons during singing using two-photon calcium imaging, we find that both the number and the precise timing of song-related spiking events remain nearly identical over the span of several weeks to months.

In this scheme, individual neurons are often thought to be highly redundant (Narayanan et al., 2005Narayanan N.S. Kimchi E.Y. Laubach M.

Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, networks have to maintain their tuning over time at the level of individual neurons, potentially limiting robustness (Marder et al., 2015Marder E. Goeritz M.L. Otopalik A.G. Robust circuit rhythms in small circuits arise from variable circuit components and mechanisms.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 31: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A major obstacle preventing the characterization of network stability is the confound of variability in the behavior itself, which can occur as the result of motor noise (Chaisanguanthum et al., 2014Chaisanguanthum K.S.

To circumvent these potential sources of bias, we examined a complex behavior notable for its rigid stereotypy: song production in an adult zebra finch. After a significant learning phase consisting of ∼105 repetitions (Tchernichovski et al., 2001Tchernichovski O. Mitra P.P. Lints T. Nottebohm F. Dynamics of the vocal imitation process: how a zebra finch learns its song.Science. 2001; 291: 2564-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), adult zebra finches flawlessly perform their song for the remainder of their lives (Immelmann, 1969Immelmann K.

Nottebohm F. Age at deafening affects the stability of learned song in adult male zebra finches.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5054-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with timing variability across renditions (song motifs) of less than 2% (Glaze and Troyer, 2006Glaze C.M. Troyer T.W. Temporal structure in zebra finch song: implications for motor coding.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 991-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because song relies on a small set of syringeal and respiratory muscles, only a specific combination of movements can achieve the correct singing behavior (Goller and Cooper, 2004Goller F. Cooper B.G. Peripheral motor dynamics of song production in the zebra finch.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2004; 1016: 130-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As a result, the songbird represents an ideal opportunity to examine the dynamics of premotor network patterns in the context of stable behavioral performance. Song production in the zebra finch is dependent on the activity of dedicated brain areas, most notably the cortical premotor region HVC (proper name). During singing, approximately half of the HVC premotor neurons are active at different moments in the song (with the remainder silent during singing) (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H.

Electrophysiological studies have shown that each HVC projection neuron can reliably produce a high-frequency burst of action potentials at a precise moment within the song with submillisecond precision across trials (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H.

However, because such recordings are limited to a few hours in the best cases (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S.

Long M.A. Motor origin of precise synaptic inputs onto forebrain neurons driving a skilled behavior.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), these methods could not be used to assess the stability of the network over longer periods of time. Recently, the activity of HVC projection neurons expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 was monitored longitudinally via a one-photon head-mounted endoscope, demonstrating a high degree of variability in song-related activity over the span of 5 days (Liberti et al., 2016Liberti 3rd, W.A.

Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Despite these apparent network changes, tracking individual neurons over time with the microendoscopic approach has been shown to be highly challenging, sometimes leading to errors in identifying individual neurons across sessions (Sheintuch et al., 2017Sheintuch L. Rubin A. Brande-Eilat N. Geva N. Sadeh N. Pinchasof O. Ziv Y.

To counteract this potential source of error, we used two-photon imaging, which has the distinct advantage of optical sectioning (Denk et al., 1990Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8306) Google Scholar), in the songbird brain (Graber et al., 2013Graber M.H. Helmchen F.

Roberts T.F. Mooney R. Imaging auditory representations of song and syllables in populations of sensorimotor neurons essential to vocal communication.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 5589-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), enabling us to monitor the activity of morphologically identified neurons over the span of several weeks in a recently developed head-fixed singing bird preparation (Picardo et al., 2016Picardo M.A. Merel J. Katlowitz K.A. Vallentin D. Okobi D.E. Benezra S.E. Clary R.C. Pnevmatikakis E.A. Paninski L. Long M.A. Population-level representation of a temporal sequence underlying song production in the zebra finch.Neuron. 2016; 90: 866-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using this method, we measured the timing of premotor responses longitudinally over the span of several weeks and found that individual cells rarely changed their activity patterns, suggesting that a stable projection network is the source of the stability of the behavior and supporting the network constancy hypothesis. Our data provide a striking example of neural circuit reliability that may represent a general strategy for enabling other behaviors featuring precisely timed expert movements. To address whether song-related network dynamics were stable across days, we monitored the activity of GCaMP6-expressing HVC neurons during directed singing in eight adult male zebra finches using two-photon calcium imaging (Figure 1). Three birds were newly imaged as part of this study, and data from an additional five birds were reanalyzed from our previous publication (Picardo et al., 2016Picardo M.A. Merel J. Katlowitz K.A. Vallentin D. Okobi D.E. Benezra S.E. Clary R.C. Pnevmatikakis E.A. Paninski L.

We imaged multiple sessions over an extended period of time, ranging from 8 to 60 days. Within individual birds, 339 neurons (9–68 per bird) fitting the profile of excitatory projection neurons (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S.

Although we could not selectively express our activity indicator in a specific excitatory cell class, it is likely that we frequently sampled from both major projection cell types in this study. Specifically, the anatomical features of the imaged neurons (Dutar et al., 1998Dutar P. Vu H.M. Perkel D.J.

For the remainder of the analysis presented here, we combine data from both groups. The requirement to return to the same neurons across sessions is a challenge inherent in longitudinal imaging (Crowe and Ellis-Davies, 2014Crowe S.E. Ellis-Davies G.C. Longitudinal in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 1708-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unlike single-photon approaches, the exquisite spatial resolution afforded by two-photon microscopy enabled us to use morphological features to track individual neurons over time (Driscoll et al., 2017Driscoll L.N.

Chen S.X. Komiyama T. Emergence of reproducible spatiotemporal activity during motor learning.Nature. 2014; 510: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). To align imaging planes (approximately 500 μm × 500 μm), we applied a motion correction algorithm to align the averages of all trials and manually annotated single neurons on the average image from across days (see STAR Methods). However, the possibility existed that a portion of the imaging plane containing our neuron of interest was not consistent across days as one might expect if the optical axis had shifted or a local aberration in the imaging pathway led to inconsistencies in the imaging plane. Such local warping could result in two possible sources of error, namely that the extracted fluorescence traces could simply reflect the absence of the neuron of interest or even the inclusion of a different neuron from a nearby plane. To address the former concern, we visually inspected the region of interest (ROI) for each cell-day, eliminating all cases in which the neuron was clearly outside of the focal plane, which comprised 5.6% of the total dataset. To address the latter concern, we performed a two-dimensional spatial correlation on all the pixels within a 100 μm × 100 μm square field surrounding each neuron across all days (Figures 1C and 1D). We also performed the same analysis across other neurons with different local environments as a negative control, leading to the removal of only 0.4% of our final dataset (Figure 1E; see STAR Methods). Using smaller spatial scales (e.g., 50 μm × 50 μm) did not qualitatively change these results (∼2% of the data rejected). We next calculated the song-related timing for each of our longitudinally recorded neurons for individual days. Based on previous electrophysiological reports that bursts are robust and stable on the timescale of our experiment (∼1 hr) (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. An ultra-sparse code underlies the generation of neural sequences in a songbird.Nature. 2002; 419: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S.

Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation.Nature. 2010; 468: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we assumed that burst times that give rise to each fluorescence trace for a given neuron should be invariant within an imaging session. We used a Markov Chain-Monte Carlo approach, extending a continuous time Bayesian deconvolution algorithm to account for multiple trials (Picardo et al., 2016Picardo M.A. Merel J. Katlowitz K.A. Vallentin D. Okobi D.E. Benezra S.E. Clary R.C. Pnevmatikakis E.A. Paninski L.

We approximated the posterior distribution of these shared times, allowing us to define not only the location of burst onsets but also their associated uncertainty (see STAR Methods). Typically, we acquired multiple song motifs within a session (6.5 ± 4.9 motifs per cell-day) to sharpen the temporal resolution of our estimates of single-neuron activity (Picardo et al., 2016Picardo M.A. Merel J. Katlowitz K.A. Vallentin D. Okobi D.E. Benezra S.E. Clary R.C. Pnevmatikakis E.A. Paninski L.

Using this approach, we were able to reliably extract precise onset timing in 99.3% of all cell-days. Our median uncertainty in the deconvolved burst onset time (σo) was 10.9 ± 6.4 ms (n = 1,872 bursts), or approximately 1%–2% of the duration of the song motif, reinforcing the notion that we could effectively monitor day-to-day activity changes within our network. Our first step was to determine whether the number of spiking events changed over time. In the vast majority of our deconvolved neurons (321 out of 333, 96.4%), the burst number remained stable across observations (4.5 ± 2.9 sessions spanning a range of 12.0 ± 7.4 days). Of the 12 cells that varied their burst number (Figure S1), four of these cases involved the complete elimination of spiking activity over time, transforming the neuron into a “silent” cell that was no longer active during singing (Epsztein et al., 2011Epsztein J. Brecht M. Lee A.K. Intracellular determinants of hippocampal CA1 place and silent cell activity in a novel environment.Neuron. 2011; 70: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, Long et al., 2010Long M.A. Jin D.Z. Fee M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation.Nature. 2010; 468: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The remaining neurons exhibited changing burst numbers that switched between single and multiple bursts. Because it had been previously demonstrated that HVC(RA) neurons are only capable of producing a single burst during the song while HVC(X) neurons can burst multiple times, these neurons likely belong to the latter category (Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. Singing-related activity of identified HVC neurons in the zebra finch.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). We next determined whether the timing of neural activity in our recorded projection neurons shifted across observation sessions. We compared the estimated burst onset times of both single bursting (n = 246, e.g., Figure 2A) and multiple bursting (n = 87, e.g., Figure 2B) cells across many days. We focused first on an individual bird (bird #102) from which we recorded 35 neurons (41 burst events) for more than 2 weeks (32.0 ± 10.4 days later). We plotted the results from the first and last imaging sessions for each cell (Figure 2C) and observed that the relative position of HVC bursting events remained consistent across time (Figure 2D), suggesting that sequential activity within HVC is surprisingly invariant in the adult zebra finch. To quantify the stability of all individual burst times, we next inspected the timing of song-related activity of the entire dataset (Figure S2), and consistent timing across sessions was clearly evident for each burst event (Figure 2E). We then quantified the extent to which the timing of individual neurons was altered across observations by defining a “distance score” for each burst based on the absolute differences in onset times on individual days relative to the median onset time normalized by their joint standard deviations (Figure S3). In only 32 out of 1,869 cases (1.7%), the distance score was greater than 3 (Figure 2E). These variable burst times were not biased toward any particular part of the song in either their original time or their final time (p > 0.5, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test for uniformity). To examine the temporal distribution for individual bursts, we centered observations for each day on their median values (Figure 3A). We found tightly clustered time points across observations with a median standard deviation of 13.4 ms and a median range of 30.4 ms, a small fraction of the duration of the total song motif length (1.5% and 3.5%, respectively) (Figure 3B). Because our ability to determine onset times varied widely across burst events, we reanalyzed our data, focusing on our most confident estimates (σo < 10 ms, 44% of burst events). These cases exhibited an even greater degree of stability (median standard deviation: 6.2 ms, median range: 12.4 ms), further confirming the invariant nature of the HVC network sequence. We next asked whether the small number of changes that we observed in HVC burst timing could reflect a consistent drift within the network that is evolving over time, albeit at a slower pace than reported previously (Liberti et al., 2016Liberti"
https://openalex.org/W2806725873,"The Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine that is overexpressed in a number of cancer types, with increased MIF expression often correlating with tumor aggressiveness and poor patient outcomes. In this study, we aimed to better understand the link between primary tumor expression of MIF and increased tumor growth. Using the MMTV-PyMT murine model of breast cancer, we observed that elevated MIF expression promoted tumor appearance and growth. Supporting this, we confirmed our previous observation that higher MIF expression supported tumor growth in the 4T1 murine model of breast cancer. We subsequently discovered that loss of MIF expression in 4T1 cells led to decreased cell numbers and increased apoptosis in vitro under reduced serum culture conditions. We hypothesized that this increase in cell death would promote detection by the host immune system in vivo, which could explain the observed impairment in tumor growth. Supporting this, we demonstrated that loss of MIF expression in the primary tumor led to an increased abundance of intra-tumoral IFNgamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and that depletion of T cells from mice bearing MIF-deficient tumors restored growth to the level of MIF-expressing tumors. Furthermore, we found that MIF depletion from the tumor cells resulted in greater numbers of activated intra-tumoral dendritic cells (DCs). Lastly, we demonstrated that loss of MIF expression led to a robust induction of a specialized form of cell death, immunogenic cell death (ICD), in vitro. Together, our data suggests a model in which MIF expression in the primary tumor dampens the anti-tumor immune response, promoting tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2806280791,"Mounting evidence suggests that alterations in cholesterol homeostasis are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) or multiple fragments generated by proteolytic processing of APP have previously been implicated in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. However, the physiological function of APP in regulating lipoprotein homeostasis in astrocytes, which are responsible for de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation in the brain, remains unclear. To address this, here we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate isogenic APP-knockout (KO) human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and differentiated them into human astrocytes. We found that APP-KO astrocytes have reduced cholesterol and elevated levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) target gene transcripts and proteins, which were both downstream consequences of reduced lipoprotein endocytosis. To elucidate which APP fragments regulate cholesterol homeostasis and to examine whether familial AD mutations in APP affect lipoprotein metabolism, we analyzed an isogenic allelic series harboring the APP Swedish and APP V717F variants. Only astrocytes homozygous for the APP Swedish (APPSwe/Swe) mutation, which had reduced full-length APP (FL APP) due to increased β-secretase cleavage, recapitulated the APP-KO phenotypes. Astrocytic internalization of β-amyloid (Aβ), another ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, was also impaired in APP-KO and APPSwe/Swe astrocytes. Finally, impairing cleavage of FL APP through β-secretase inhibition in APPSwe/Swe astrocytes reversed the LDL and Aβ endocytosis defects. In conclusion, FL APP is involved in the endocytosis of LDL receptor ligands and is required for proper cholesterol homeostasis and Aβ clearance in human astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2806708252,"Unfractionated heparin (UFH), the standard anticoagulant for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, carries a risk of post-operative bleeding and is potentially harmful in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-associated antibodies. To improve the activity of an alternative anticoagulant, the RNA aptamer 11F7t, we solved X-ray crystal structures of the aptamer bound to factor Xa (FXa). The finding that 11F7t did not bind the catalytic site suggested that it could complement small-molecule FXa inhibitors. We demonstrate that combinations of 11F7t and catalytic-site FXa inhibitors enhance anticoagulation in purified reaction mixtures and plasma. Aptamer-drug combinations prevented clot formation as effectively as UFH in human blood circulated in an extracorporeal oxygenator circuit that mimicked CPB, while avoiding side effects of UFH. An antidote could promptly neutralize the anticoagulant effects of both FXa inhibitors. Our results suggest that drugs and aptamers with shared targets can be combined to exert more specific and potent effects than either agent alone."

https://openalex.org/W2806358974,"Peptidergic sensory neurons play a critical role in nociceptive pathways. To precisely define the function and plasticity of sensory neurons in detail, new tools such as transgenic mouse models are needed. We employed electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to characterize in detail dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing an inducible CGRPcre-ER (CGRP-cre+); and compared them to DRG neurons expressing Nav1.8cre (Nav1.8-cre+), TRPV1cre (TRPV1-cre+) and TRPV1-GFP (V1-GFP+). Tamoxifen effectively induced CGRPcre-ER production in DRG. ≈87% of CGRPcre-ER-expressing neurons were co-labeled CGRP antibody. Three small and two medium-large-sized (5HT3a+/NPY2R- and NPY2R+) neuronal groups with unique electrophysiological profiles were CGRP-cre+. Nav1.8-cre+ neurons were detected in all CGRP-cre+ groups, as well as in 5 additional neuronal groups: MrgprD+/TRPA1-, MrgprD+/TRPA1+, TRPV1+/CGRP-, vGLUT3+ and ≈30% of trkC+ neurons. Differences between TRPV1cre and Nav1.8cre reporters were that unlike TRPV1-cre+, Nav1.8-cre+ expression was detected in non-nociceptive vGLUT3+ and trkC+ populations. Many TRPV1-cre+ neurons did not respond to capsaicin. In contrast, V1-GFP+ neurons were in 4 groups, each of which was capsaicin-sensitive. Finally, none of the analyzed reporter lines showed cre-recombination in trkB+, calbindin+, 70% of trkC+ or parvalbumin+ neurons, which together encompassed ≈20% of Nav1.8-cre- DRG neurons. The data presented here increases our knowledge of peptidergic sensory neuron characteristics, while showing the efficiency and specificity manipulation of peptidergic neurons by the CGRPcre-ER reporter. We also demonstrate that manipulation of all C- and A-nociceptors is better achieved with TRPV1-cre reporter. Finally, the described approach for detailed characterization of sensory neuronal groups can be applied to a variety of reporter mice."

The meteoric rise in stem-cell-derived organoid technologies has ushered in a new era of “organoid medicine.” Here we discuss how an organoid center can accelerate the translation of laboratory proof-of-principle experiments into clinical practice by developing and utilizing shared platforms for commercial and medical applications. Organoids hold great promise to revolutionize 21st century healthcare through transforming drug development, precision medicine, and ultimately, transplantation-based therapies for end-stage diseases (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014Lancaster M.A. Knoblich J.A. Organogenesis in a dish: modeling development and disease using organoid technologies.Science. 2014; 345: 1247125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). However, in order to realize the full potential of “organoid medicine,” a number of major hurdles need to be overcome. The biological complexity of organoids is a strength, but variability between organoids and cost of industry-scale manufacturing represent challenges for translation. The goal of this forum is to discuss these challenges and to highlight the importance of centralized efforts to accelerate the realization of organoid medicine. One of the ultimate goals is to use organoid tissue for transplantation. Successful preclinical efficacy studies with organoids generated from human adult stem cells (ASCs) or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have led to several exciting programs aimed at therapeutic uses (Dekkers et al., 2013Dekkers J.F. Wiegerinck C.L. de Jonge H.R. Bronsveld I. Janssens H.M. de Winter-de Groot K.M. Brandsma A.M. de Jong N.W. Bijvelds M.J.

For example, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) in Japan is planning to conduct a first-in-human trial of intestinal organoids for treatment against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since 2014, TMDU has been elected as a center of excellence (CoE) by the Japanese agency for medical research and development (AMED), with substantial strategic funding ($1 to $4 million per year per institution over 10 years) to accelerate translation of epithelial-organoid-based therapeutics. Work over the last 4 years has established clinical-grade protocols that include crypt isolation, organoid generation and expansion, and quality-control methodologies. Pending institutional review board (IRB) approval, TMDU plans to initiate a clinical study as early as this year.Table 1Comparison of State-of-the-Art Organoid CentersTMDUThe HUBINTENSYCUCuSTOMMissionOrganoid txOrganoid biobankOrganoid txOrganoid txOrganoid medicineOrganIntestineMultipleIntestineLiverMultipleIndicationInflammatory bowel diseaseNAShort gut syndromeMetabolic liver diseaseNACountryJapanEUEUJapanUSStem Cell SourceASCASCASCPSCPSC/ ASCFunding sourceAMEDNDHorizon2020AMEDCCHMC/ PhilanthropyFirst in Human2018-NDND2020-NDCore facility-NDND-+Industry partners+ND+++Accelerator infrastructure----+cGMP facility+NDND++ Open table in a new tab There are similar consortium-based efforts in the EU to clinically translate organoid-based technologies. One effort being led by the INTENS team, an EU-based consortium, is aimed at developing a transplantable/anatomizable adult-stem-cell-derived intestinal construct for treating short bowel syndrome (SBS) (http://www.intens.info/project/workplan/). INTENS is a cross-institutional collaboration including over 9 commercial and academic partners. A second effort is led by Hubrecht Organoid Technology (the HUB), founded by the Hubrecht Institute, KNAW, and University Medical Center Utrecht, in the Netherlands. The HUB has developed a robust diagnostic tool that links patient-specific genetic and phenotypic information to preclinical and clinical drug responsiveness (Sachs et al., 2018Sachs N. de Ligt J. Kopper O. Gogola E. Bounova G. Weeber F. Balgobind A.V. Wind K. Gracanin A. Begthel H. et al.A living biobank of breast cancer organoids captures disease heterogeneity.Cell. 2018; 172: 373-386.e310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Thus, adult-stem-cell-derived epithelial organoid medicine will soon become a reality. At the moment, there is only one institution geared toward PSC-derived organoid transplantation. The vascularized liver bud organoid transplantation initiative at the Yokohama City University (YCU) Advanced Medical Research Center was established for the treatment of pediatric metabolic liver disease. Production of vascularized liver bud organoids requires cGMP parallel production and assembly of multiple cell-fate lineages (Takebe et al., 2017Takebe T. Sekine K. Kimura M. Yoshizawa E. Ayano S. Koido M. Funayama S. Nakanishi N. Hisai T. Kobayashi T. et al.Massive and reproducible production of liver buds entirely from human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 2661-2670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and preclinical animal experiments must address miscellaneous safety issues including carcinogenesis after transplantation. To facilitate this, the center relies on the collaborative efforts of over 8 companies and 3 academic institutions for developing semi-automated manufacturing systems. Each group brings a distinct expertise, including cGMP protocols, robotics, culture media, matrices, culture plates, microscopy systems, logistics, delivery devices, cryopreservation, or animal models. As product components, manufacturing strategy, know-how, and IP portfolio can be re-used for many other organoids, such integral efforts will eventually benefit each partner working in a different manufacturing space. This is, however, a challenging model, as individual components are heavily interdependent. As a USA-based example tackling organoid medicine translation, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center has established a Center for Stem Cell and Organoid Medicine (CuSTOM). CuSTOM integrates over 15 collaborative research faculty groups using a diversity of organoid platforms in collaboration with a number of industrial and philanthropic partners. Based on its strong endoderm development expertise, the initial aims of CuSTOM include the development of a gastrointestinal and liver organoid system for drug testing and transplantation. One major distinction between CuSTOM and other initiatives is an organoid-specialized infrastructure that includes high-end scientific cores, a blanket IRB, streamlined processes for generating patient-derived-iPSCs, a cGMP facility, and an accelerator laboratory focused on clinical and commercial translation with a designated space to host industry collaborators. The mission is to accelerate the pace of the organoid-based discovery-translation cycle. Distinct from the traditional pharmaceutical model, organoid-based diagnostics and therapeutics face a number of significant challenges prior to successful translation, particularly due to the multi-functional and structurally complex nature of organoids. However, the diverse skill sets required to address these key challenges are by far broader than any single academic lab or single collaborative company. Thus, organoid medicine can be realized through an effective acceleration strategy that integrates these diverse skill sets. We herein discuss the challenges associated with acceleration and highlight the importance of targeting four different phases of organoid transformation cycles (Figure 1) that can potentially be united by establishing an organoid center. Decades of research using model organisms have provided a foundational knowledge of embryonic organ development that has informed directed differentiation strategies of PSCs toward multi-lineage 3D organoids. The close proximity of strong developmental and regenerative biology programs will be essential for engineering next-generation organoids with organ-level complexity. Recently, developmental paradigms have informed generation of vascularized (Takebe et al., 2013Takebe T. Sekine K. Enomura M. Koike H. Kimura M. Ogaeri T. Zhang R.R. Ueno Y. Zheng Y.W. Koike N. et al.Vascularized and functional human liver from an iPSC-derived organ bud transplant.Nature. 2013; 499: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) and innervated organoids (Workman et al., 2017Workman M.J. Mahe M.M. Trisno S. Poling H.M. Watson C.L. Sundaram N. Chang C.F. Schiesser J. Aubert P. Stanley E.G. et al.Engineered human pluripotent-stem-cell-derived intestinal tissues with a functional enteric nervous system.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and it is anticipated that similar efforts could be used for incorporating other essential components such as immune cells and lymphatics. Perhaps more critically, while human PSC-derived organoids have an impressive array of organ functions, they still do not have the full, broad-spectrum functionality of their adult counterparts. One reason for this could be the speed at which human organoids develop relative to human fetal gestation. Thus, generating more functional and complex tissues is essential for modeling major diseases and ultimately for transplantation-based therapies. To accelerate the advancement of organoid development, evolving scientific tools including clonal genome editing, high content imaging, and single cell genomics are critical to the study of cell behaviors such as migration, cell-cell interactions, and tissue organization during embryogenesis (Sasai, 2013Sasai Y. Cytosystems dynamics in self-organization of tissue architecture.Nature. 2013; 493: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Institutions that invest in research cores with capabilities for stem cell genomic manipulations, multi-omics, and the supporting bioinformatics, 4D imaging, mechano-characterization, in vivo modeling, and in silico modeling are at a distinct advantage. Obtaining reference sample data to benchmark organoids with in vivo counterparts will be important for the eventual reverse engineering that will be needed to discover factors that will promote organoid maturation. In humans, considerable metabolic and physiological maturation occurs during the third trimester and shortly after birth; however, little is known about the molecular pathways that drive this process. Given the challenges associated with ethical approval, limited sampling access, and high-volume data management, broader cross-institutional collaborative networks with clinicians will be ideal. These efforts will be potentially facilitated by exciting ongoing initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas project (Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Stubbington M.J.T. Regev A. Teichmann S.A. The Human Cell Atlas: from vision to reality.Nature. 2017; 550: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Personalized medicine is one of the tremendous translational opportunities provided by stem-cell-derived organoids, and it depends on the ability to study patient-specific clinical characteristics. One of the most successful personalized prototypes was reported by teams from the Netherlands, led by the HUB. Precision testing was performed on patient-derived organoids to select effective drugs for treating cystic fibrosis (Dekkers et al., 2013Dekkers J.F. Wiegerinck C.L. de Jonge H.R. Bronsveld I. Janssens H.M. de Winter-de Groot K.M. Brandsma A.M. de Jong N.W. Bijvelds M.J. Scholte B.J. et al.A functional CFTR assay using primary cystic fibrosis intestinal organoids.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). As another example of personalized therapy, a cancer organoid bank was also recently established for comprehensive drug screening (Sachs et al., 2018Sachs N. de Ligt J. Kopper O. Gogola E. Bounova G. Weeber F. Balgobind A.V. Wind K. Gracanin A. Begthel H. et al.A living biobank of breast cancer organoids captures disease heterogeneity.Cell. 2018; 172: 373-386.e310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Development of therapeutic prototypes with organoids is thus a critical process for harnessing translation. However, most of the academic laboratories face challenges in defining the specific target area of their prototype, and this challenge may eventually benefit individual industry partners working in various therapeutic spaces toward different commercialization goals. Thus, early functional collaboration with industry partners can help academic labs narrow down their organoid prototyping focus. Organoid prototyping requires insight from bioengineering and material sciences to optimize reproducibility, standardize processes for organoid manufacturing, and design platforms for screening or transplantation. For example, INTENS organizes a consortium-type collaboration to deliver an organoid-based autologous tissue engineering construct to SBS patients for functional bowel reconstruction, overcoming organ shortage and avoiding the need for immunosuppression. Recent advances in organoid research have come from synergistic interactions between biologists and bioengineers controlling fluid flow and the mechanical properties of the organoids. Encapsulation of engineered tissues is becoming a standard for PSC-based therapy applications in order to ensure safety, which also would be an important consideration for organoid transplantation. One potential mechanism to promote this collaboration will be through “centralization,” where industry and academic scientists work side-by-side on projects of common interest and benefit by residing physically in the same space. For example, in the cell therapy arena, a new successful partnership between CiRA (the Center for iPS Research and Application, Kyoto University) and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, known as T-CiRA, was initiated at the end of 2015. This particular collaboration brings together Takeda’s pharmaceutical expertise with the expertise of academic stem cell researchers to clinically translate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. This partnership is also distinct from other prevailing biomedical collaborations, as academic investigators can physically work inside the Takeda research center and interact with Takeda research and development scientists, including bioengineering specialists (Karagiannis et al., 2017Karagiannis P. Onodera A. Yamanaka S. New models for therapeutic innovation from Japan.EBioMedicine. 2017; 18: 3-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To maximize the impact of organoid prototyping, we envision that similar efforts—namely, an “accelerator laboratory” recently installed in CuSTOM—will be an effective strategy to organically catalyze organoid-centered collaboration between groups with complementary expertise. This accelerator laboratory will likely host academics with interests in prototyping and company collaborators, as well as shared personnel and infrastructure, all facilitating organoid-centered prototype product development. A major step toward translation includes establishing biobank libraries of clinical-grade organoids from stem cells of healthy and diseased controls. We propose that this would be facilitated by streamlined institutional stem cell cores and broad centralized IRBs with databases containing both clinical and genetics data. The databases would be coordinated by a centralized oversight group that manages the storage and shipping of specific tissues and maintains patient data in the registry. This system can provide tissues and de-identified data to researchers developing disease-specific organoid prototypes to study population level variability. We advocate for broad cross-institutional consent for the collection of tissues to optimize the collection of rare condition samples. Establishment of in vivo transplantation assays requires animal models, traditionally immunocompromised mice (non-obese, diabetic, severe combined immunodeficiency interleukin-2Rɣnull [NSG or NOG]). More recently, the field has moved to humanized murine models, wherein a human immune system is reconstituted in the mice. However, larger animal models, such as pigs, need to be established before organoid transplantation in humans can occur. This will require teams of clinicians, engineers, and basic scientists working together to establish reproducible procedures and assays that mimic known human responses to therapies in healthy and diseased states. Current challenges include access to immunosuppressed animals and housing facilities following transplantation, all within in a single institution, as currently available methods for organoid shipment to a distant animal facility limit potency when organoids are transplanted. Ultimately, all tissue for transplantation will need to be generated using scalable cGMP methodology that addresses the challenges related to reproducibility and quality control. Pioneering attempts in cell-based therapy, such as hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cell therapy, have highlighted key manufacturing and regulatory challenges; however, many of these principles are simply not applicable to organoids. Therefore, early access to cGMP facilities is crucial—trying to adapt organoid protocols optimized with gel and culture media containing animal products could result in going back to the drawing board and delaying clinical translation by years. Teams at TMDU and YCU tackled this by supporting non-pharma collaborators as they developed a manufacturing pipeline of cGMP-level multi-cellular organoid products. Thus, academic-industry-medical partnerships are important at the early research and development stages so that research prototypes can be efficiently translated into FDA-compliant products and procedures. Commercialization for both current and novel medical therapeutic approaches will be a key step in making organoid medicine a reality, starting with drug development. The pharmaceutical industry loses billions of dollars annually due to the failures of drug candidates identified in initial screens; this is followed by nearly one-third of drugs being withdrawn from the market, often because of toxicity and inadequate efficacy. This low success rate is due in large part to the reliance of preclinical screens on mouse models and transformed cell lines that do not replicate human physiology. Organoid-based drug assays offer a potential solution to improve predictive accuracy of safety and efficacy in preclinical studies. The total addressable market (TAM) for toxicity screening is estimated to be $9.8 billion with a 14.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (according to a recent BCC research report), whereas drug discovery has a $60B TAM with 11.3% CAGR. Importantly, the organoid platforms being developed for drug screening can also be relevant in the research tool market (TAM: $8.4B, 17.6% CAGR) and the organoid therapeutic market (TAM: $18B, 35% CAGR). Current market estimates for organoid therapy are limited but could potentially expand after organoid transplant therapy demonstrates clear efficacy in first-in-human trials. Organoid centers should provide legal and commercial advisors to support process validation studies that are essential for commercialization but are not funded by typical research grants, facilitating the establishment of new companies or industrial collaborations. In order to effectively translate the promising potential of organoid medicine, the academic proof-of-principle is rapidly evolving. Although numerous questions and challenges remain, it is anticipated that bridging current gaps is achievable in a timely manner if approached using a shared-accelerator model. The promise of effectively treating patient-specific diseases by organoid medicine is within reach. The goal is to arrive at this point in the most efficient manner.

Ethiopia is among the 30th highest TB burden countries for MDR-TB with 14% prevalence among previously treated cases. The focus of this study was on determining drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among MDR-TB suspected cases and associated risk factors.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa from June 2015 to December 2016. Sputum samples and socio-demographic data were collected from 358 MDR-TB suspected cases. Samples were analyzed using Ziehl-Neelsen technique, GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay, and culture using Lowenstein-Jensen and Mycobacterial growth indicator tube. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23.A total of 226 the study participants were culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, among them, 133 (58.8%) participants were males. Moreover, 162 (71.7%) had been previously treated for tuberculosis, while 128 (56.6%) were TB/HIV co-infected. A majority [122 (54%)] of the isolates were resistant to any first-line anti-TB drugs. Among the resistant isolates, 110 (48.7%) were determined to be resistant to isoniazid, 94 (41.6%) to streptomycin, 89 (39.4%) to rifampicin, 72 (31.9%) to ethambutol, and 70 (30.9%) to pyrazinamide. The prevalence of MDR-TB was 89 (39.4%), of which 52/89 (58.4%) isolates were resistance to all five first-line drugs. Risk factors such as TB/HIV co-infection (AOR = 5.59, p = 0.00), cigarette smoking (AOR = 3.52, p = 0.045), alcohol drinking (AOR = 5.14, p = 0.001) hospital admission (AOR = 3.49, p = 0.005) and visiting (AOR = 3.34, p = 0.044) were significantly associated with MDR-TB.The prevalence of MDR-TB in the study population was of a significantly high level among previously treated patients and age group of 25-34. TB/HIV coinfection, smoking of cigarette, alcohol drinking, hospital admission and health facility visiting were identified as risk factors for developing MDR-TB. Therefore, effective strategies should be designed considering the identified risk factors for control of MDR-TB."
https://openalex.org/W2805200921,"Aberrant transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling is a hallmark of the stromal microenvironment in cancer. Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3), shown to inhibit TGF-β signaling, is downregulated in prostate cancer and upregulated in the stroma in benign prostatic hyperplasia, but the function of stromal Dkk-3 is unclear. Here we show that DKK3 silencing in WPMY-1 prostate stromal cells increases TGF-β signaling activity and that stromal cell-conditioned media inhibit prostate cancer cell invasion in a Dkk-3-dependent manner. DKK3 silencing increased the level of the cell-adhesion regulator TGF-β–induced protein (TGFBI) in stromal and epithelial cell-conditioned media, and recombinant TGFBI increased prostate cancer cell invasion. Reduced expression of Dkk-3 in patient tumors was associated with increased expression of TGFBI. DKK3 silencing reduced the level of extracellular matrix protein-1 (ECM-1) in prostate stromal cell-conditioned media but increased it in epithelial cell-conditioned media, and recombinant ECM-1 inhibited TGFBI-induced prostate cancer cell invasion. Increased ECM1 and DKK3 mRNA expression in prostate tumors was associated with increased relapse-free survival. These observations are consistent with a model in which the loss of Dkk-3 in prostate cancer leads to increased secretion of TGFBI and ECM-1, which have tumor-promoting and tumor-protective roles, respectively. Determining how the balance between the opposing roles of extracellular factors influences prostate carcinogenesis will be key to developing therapies that target the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2805153744,"We employed multi-electrode array recording to evaluate the influence of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) on spike-timing dynamics in prefrontal networks of monkeys as they performed a cognitive control task measuring specific deficits in schizophrenia. Systemic, periodic administration of an NMDAR antagonist (phencyclidine) reduced the prevalence and strength of synchronous (0-lag) spike correlation in simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. We employed transfer entropy analysis to measure effective connectivity between prefrontal neurons at lags consistent with monosynaptic interactions and found that effective connectivity was persistently reduced following exposure to the NMDAR antagonist. These results suggest that a disruption of spike timing and effective connectivity might be interrelated factors in pathogenesis, supporting an activity-dependent disconnection theory of schizophrenia. In this theory, disruption of NMDAR synaptic function leads to dysregulated timing of action potentials in prefrontal networks, accelerating synaptic disconnection through a spike-timing-dependent mechanism."

The aim of the current study was to determine the impact of therapeutic Treg administration on systemic and cardiac inflammation and remodeling in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) -induced myocarditis. Therefore, syngeneic Treg cells were applied intravenously in CVB3-infected mice 3 d after infection. Compared with CVB3 + PBS mice, CVB3 + Treg mice exhibited lower left ventricle (LV) chemokine expression, accompanied by reduced cardiac presence of proinflammatory Ly6ChighCCR2highCx3Cr1low monocytes and higher retention of proin flammatory Ly6CmidCCR2highCx3Cr1low monocytes in the spleen. In addition, splenic myelopoiesis was reduced in CVB3 + Treg compared with CVB3 + PBS mice. Coculture of Treg cells with splenocytes isolated from mice 3 d post- CVB3 infection further demonstrated the ability of Treg cells to modulate monocyte differentiation in favor of the anti-inflammatory Ly6ClowCCR2lowCx3Cr1high subset. Treg-mediated immunomodulation was paralleled by lower collagen 1 protein expression and decreased levels of soluble and insoluble collagen in LV of CVB3 + Treg compared with CVB3 + PBS mice. In agreement with these findings, LV systolic and diastolic function was improved in CVB3 + Treg mice compared with CVB3 + PBS mice. In summary, adoptive Treg transfer in the inflammatory phase of viral-induced myocarditis protects the heart against inflammatory damage and fibrosis via modulation of monocyte subsets.—Pappritz, K., Savvatis, K., Miteva, K., Kerim, B., Dong, F., Fechner, H., Müller, I., Brandt, C., Lopez, B., González, A., Ravassa, S., Klingel, K., Diez, J., Reinke, P., Volk, H.-D., Van Linthout, S., Tschöpe, C.

https://openalex.org/W2806189034,"Incorporation of the rare amino acid selenocysteine to form diselenide bonds can improve stability and function of synthetic peptide therapeutics. However, application of this approach to recombinant proteins has been hampered by heterogeneous incorporation, low selenoprotein yields, and poor fitness of bacterial producer strains. We report the evolution of recoded Escherichia coli strains with improved fitness that are superior hosts for recombinant selenoprotein production. We apply an engineered β-lactamase containing an essential diselenide bond to enforce selenocysteine dependence during continuous evolution of recoded E. coli strains. Evolved strains maintain an expanded genetic code indefinitely. We engineer a fluorescent reporter to quantify selenocysteine incorporation in vivo and show complete decoding of UAG codons as selenocysteine. Replacement of native, labile disulfide bonds in antibody fragments with diselenide bonds vastly improves resistance to reducing conditions. Highly seleno-competent bacterial strains enable industrial-scale selenoprotein expression and unique diselenide architecture, advancing our ability to customize the selenoproteome."

H2 antigen, as recognized by UEA-I lectin, is apparently not expressed in high-mass HMOs. Beyond affinity, sterical and valency effects contribute more to virus-like particle binding, as revealed for oligovalent fucose conjugates of α-cyclodextrin and oligofucoses from fucoidan. Accordingly, high-mass HMOs with oligovalent fucose can exhibit stronger binding capacities compared with monovalent fucose HMOs. The above features were revealed for the most clinically relevant and prevalent GII.4 strain and are distinct from other strains, like GII.10 (Vietnam 026, AF504671), which showed a preference for blood group Lewis-a positive glycans.

https://openalex.org/W2806018109,"Many cellular processes depend on a precise structural organization of molecular components. Here, we established that neurons grown in culture provide a suitable system for in situ structural investigations of cellular structures by cryo-electron tomography, a method that allows high resolution, three-dimensional imaging of fully hydrated, vitrified cellular samples. A higher level of detail of cellular components present in our images allowed us to quantitatively characterize presynaptic and cytoskeletal organization, as well as structures involved in axonal transport and endocytosis. In this way we provide a structural framework into which information from other methods need to fit. Importantly, we show that short pleomorphic linkers (tethers and connectors) extensively interconnect different types of spherical vesicles and other lipid membranes in neurons imaged in a close-to-native state. These linkers likely serve to organize and precisely position vesicles involved in endocytosis, axonal transport and synaptic release. Hence, structural interactions via short linkers may serve as ubiquitous vesicle organizers in neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2805952037,"The study of plant remains in archaeological sites, along with a better understanding of the use of plants by prehistoric populations, can help us shed light on changes in survival strategies of hunter-gatherers and consequent impacts on modern human cognition, social organization, and technology. The archaeological locality of Pinnacle Point (Mossel Bay, South Africa) includes a series of coastal caves, rock-shelters, and open-air sites with human occupations spanning the Acheulian through Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA). These sites have provided some of the earliest evidence for complex human behaviour and technology during the MSA. We used phytoliths-amorphous silica particles that are deposited in cells of plants-as a proxy for the reconstruction of past human plant foraging strategies on the south coast of South Africa during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, emphasizing the use and control of fire as well as other possible plant uses. We analysed sediment samples from the different occupation periods at the rock shelter Pinnacle Point 5-6 North (PP5-6N). We also present an overview of the taphonomic processes affecting phytolith preservation in this site that will be critical to conduct a more reliable interpretation of the original plant use in the rock shelter. Our study reports the first evidence of the intentional gathering and introduction into living areas of plants from the Restionaceae family by MSA hunter-gatherers inhabiting the south coast of South Africa. We suggest that humans inhabiting Pinnacle Point during short-term occupation events during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 built fast fires using mainly grasses with some wood from trees and/or shrubs for specific purposes, perhaps for shellfish cooking. With the onset of MIS 4 we observed a change in the plant gathering strategies towards the intentional and intensive exploitation of dry wood to improve, we hypothesise, combustion for heating silcrete. This human behaviour is associated with changes in stone tool technology, site occupation intensity and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2806099740,"•Human subjects learn to detect patterns in sequences of images while undergoing fMRI•Behavior is well explained by a Bayesian pattern-learning model•Distinct networks track uncertainty about the pattern and the predicted image The brain is often able to learn complex structures of the environment using a very limited amount of evidence, which is crucial for model-based planning and sequential prediction. However, little is known about the neurocomputational mechanisms of deterministic sequential prediction, as prior work has primarily focused on stochastic transition structures. Here we find that human subjects’ beliefs about a sequence of states, captured by reaction times, are well explained by a Bayesian pattern-learning model that tracks beliefs about both the current state and the underlying structure of the environment, taking into account prior beliefs about possible patterns in the sequence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find distinct neural signatures of uncertainty computations on both levels. These results support the hypothesis that structure learning in the brain employs Bayesian inference.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find distinct neural signatures of uncertainty computations on both levels. These results support the hypothesis that structure learning in the brain employs Bayesian inference. One of the big questions of model-based learning (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J. Model-based influences on humans’ choices and striatal prediction errors.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1204-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) is how people learn and update the structure of the decision environment (i.e., a model, a mental map, or a transition rule). Learning contingencies between one’s actions and “states of the world” can be beneficial in achieving specific goals or earning higher rewards (Kool et al., 2016Kool W. Cushman F.A. Gershman S.J. When does model-based control pay off?.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12: e1005090Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Important examples of such contingencies are sequential events, which one often needs to memorize and retrieve daily (e.g., a sequence of turns on a road or steps in a recipe). While there has been much research into the neural representations of sequences and probabilistic reinforcement learning, there has been a lack of research on the neurocomputational mechanisms of deterministic sequence learning (i.e., learning of patterns in sequences of states), where the decision-maker can infer the underlying structure and use this knowledge to make better predictions. In particular, it is unclear how the brain distinguishes deterministic patterns from random sequences. This problem is fundamentally different from probabilistic learning, where one knows that two states are linked; the issue is just estimating the strength of that link (i.e., the probability). While many studies in behavioral psychology have explored sequence learning using the serial reaction time (SRT) task, comparing deterministic and probabilistic sequences (Martini et al., 2013Martini M.

Attentional load and implicit sequence learning.Psychol.

Ramoni M. Cohen P. Sequence learning via Bayesian clustering by dynamics.Sequence Learning. Springer, 2000: 11-34Crossref Google Scholar). Importantly, while many studies investigate sequences learned over many training blocks, we are interested in how subjects detect the presence of a predictable sequence. Evidence from many cognitive and neurobiological studies suggests that the brain employs a number of mechanisms that provide neural representations of sequences, including but not limited to learning of transition rules, chunking, and more complex tools such as learning of nested tree structures for understanding language (Dehaene et al., 2015Dehaene S.

In this type of model, the decision-maker updates their beliefs about coming states using a transition matrix that computes conditional probabilities of states given the previously observed state. On the other hand, a number of recent studies have suggested that the brain can also employ hidden structure learning using a space of causal structures and a set of prior beliefs, which are updated in a Bayesian fashion once some evidence toward one or the other structure is collected (Gershman and Niv, 2010Gershman S.J.

Discovering latent causes in reinforcement learning.Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 2015; 5: 43-50Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The neural underpinnings of structure learning remain an open question, although recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus (Aggleton et al., 2007Aggleton J.P. Sanderson D.J. Pearce J.M. Structural learning and the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 2007; 17: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and orbitofrontal cortex (Wilson et al., 2014Wilson R.C. Takahashi Y.K. Schoenbaum G. Niv Y. Orbitofrontal cortex as a cognitive map of task space.Neuron. 2014; 81: 267-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) (OFC) play central roles, with the hippocampus engaging in structure encoding and the OFC serving as a “repository” for structure representations. The exact role of these and other regions involved in structure learning (such as regions encoding state prediction errors, SPEs), however, is not yet fully understood. Here we combine these two approaches with an application to sequence learning. We are interested in whether stochastic transition models or deterministic structure models provide a better explanation for sequence learning, and how the best model might be implemented in the brain. To investigate these questions, we use a simple modified SRT task where subjects observe sequences of slowly revealed images and are incentivized to identify each image as quickly as possible. If the subjects detect patterns, they can respond before the images are fully revealed. This design allows us to measure learning using a continuous reaction time (RT) measure, without the need to collect additional measures (e.g., explicit confidence ratings). Across sequences we vary whether there is a pattern, and if there is, the length of the pattern. Varying the length of the patterns is important, since it helps to ensure that drops in RT and changes in brain activity are due to learning and not simply due to image number in the sequence. With this design, we find that subjects detect patterns more quickly than can be explained by the standard stochastic transition model. Instead, learning (represented by RTs) is best explained by a Bayesian pattern-learning model that assumes prior beliefs about types of structures, or patterns, that the decision-maker can encounter. In this model, subjects have beliefs about the identity of the next state, as well as the structure of the environment (what kind of pattern, if any). From these beliefs, we construct state- and structure-level measures of uncertainty (entropy) and study which regions of the brain track each of them. In summary, we provide a detailed model-based account of sequence learning in the human brain, identifying two distinct networks that separately encode uncertainty about the state and uncertainty about the underlying structure. We carried out an fMRI experiment, where adult human subjects performed a modified SRT task (Figure 1). As in a standard SRT task, prior to the experiment, subjects learned fixed one-to-one correspondence between three fingers and three images (a face, a hand, and a landscape). During the experiment, we showed subjects sequences of these images and asked them to respond to each image with the correct button press. We added two important modifications to the standard SRT design (STAR Methods). First, we incentivized both accuracy and RT with monetary rewards, with higher reward for accuracy. We aimed (successfully) to achieve maximal accuracy: subjects pressed the correct button in 97% of trials, while still responding to the RT incentive. Moreover, subjects correctly guessed the final image in 96% of sequences with patterns. This means that it is unlikely that subjects were guessing, which benefits our belief updating analyses, though it does preclude any analyses relating accuracy to neural activity or comparing correct and error trials. Second, we presented not the static images themselves but animations that smoothly transformed from a scramble of all images to a single image within 3 s (Figure 1). We did this so that subjects’ RTs would change substantially once they discovered a pattern (in a typical SRT experiment, the difference between full uncertainty and no uncertainty does not exceed 30 ms [Bornstein and Daw, 2012Bornstein A.M. Daw N.D. Dissociating hippocampal and striatal contributions to sequential prediction learning.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar], while in our experiment it exceeded 1 s). We organized the images into 50 short sequences of 12 images each and informed subjects that some of the sequences they could encounter in the experiment would have repeating patterns. We created 30 sequences with repeated patterns of length 2, 3, 4, and 6, and 20 sequences that had no apparent patterns (conditional probability of each image given previous history was close to 0.33); each subject experienced the same set of sequences. We did not use any cues to indicate the sequence type and presented all sequences in a pseudorandom order (see STAR Methods). As we expected, subjects responded faster to images in sequences with repeated patterns (1.05 s versus 1.4 s, t [24] = −17, p < 0.001), with RTs decreasing rapidly toward the end of the sequence (Figure 2A), and shorter patterns exhibiting earlier decreases in RT. We sought to identify a belief-updating model that would explain both the difference between the two conditions and the rate of the RT decrease in sequences with patterns. A common way to model beliefs about states of the world in a learning task is with a Markov transition matrix, which reflects conditional beliefs about future states based on previous history (Bornstein and Daw, 2012Bornstein A.M.

Sci. 2013; 24: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (typically, of the first order, where the conditional distribution depends only on one previously observed period). In a sequence with a repeating pattern, the posterior state distribution can depend on a longer history of states, so we used k-th order transition matrices, which are updated using a Dirichlet posterior (see STAR Methods). We use this model primarily as a benchmark, as it is considered a good approximation of the belief-updating process (Otto et al., 2013Otto A.R. Gershman S.J. Markman A.B. Daw N.D. The curse of planning: dissecting multiple reinforcement-learning systems by taxing the central executive.Psychol. Sci. 2013; 24: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We found the third-order matrix to be the best fitting model, meaning that the probability of seeing a particular image at a given point in time is based on the identities of the past three images. These probabilities are used to calculate the Shannon entropy of beliefs p(⋅) about states ai given observed history h,Ea=−∑ip(ai|h)logp(ai|h), and surprise,Sa=−log (p(ai|h)), which we use as predictors of RTs. However, this model does not support some qualitative characteristics of the data: for instance, it predicts rapid one-trial drops in RTs when the observer learns the pattern (Figure S1), while the data show more gradual decline over two to three trials (we also explored a version of the model with more gradual belief updating, but it demonstrated slow learning and provided a worse fit to the data; see STAR Methods). To confirm that the gradual decline in RTs was not just a result of averaging across subjects and pattern types, we also examined the individual subject data. We found no evidence for rapid one-shot learning (see Figure S2). We improved predictions of the transition matrix model by implementing a Bayesian pattern-learning model that assumes that subjects update both beliefs about the states of the world (images) and possible patterns (i.e., structures) (STAR Methods). The model assumes that all sequences can be classified into seven categories, or “structures”: patterns of length 1 to 6 (for instance, length 2, “hand-face-hand-face…,” or length 3, “hand-face-landscape-hand-face-landscape…”), and “no pattern” (i.e., randomly generated sequences with no discernible pattern). To decrease the degrees of freedom, we assumed that subjects had common prior beliefs about the distribution of these structures before entering the experiment. As a robustness check, we also estimated a model in which these priors correspond to the real frequencies of the seven possible structures in the experiment, and the results were similar. For each possible structure, the subject estimates its likelihood given the observed history. For instance, after a history of “hand-face-landscape-face,” the subject would assign probability 0 to patterns of length 1–3 but other non-zero probabilities to longer patterns and no pattern. The model assumes that subjects then use these posterior structure beliefs to calculate the probability that the next image is a face, hand, or landscape. In other words, subjects calculate beliefs about each specific state coming next in the sequence as a compound probability that takes into account both the probability of a specific structure given the observed history and the probability of each state given that structure. Here the beliefs about the underlying structure represent “structure learning,” while updating beliefs about t"

Methods Data in two waves of NHANES (2011–2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity). Results Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/m2), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40–42 kg. Conclusions Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors. Prospective studies are needed to address their causal relationship."

Edgar B.A. Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling mediates regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut.Cell. 2009; 137 (19563763): 1343-135510.1016/j.cell.2009.05.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative regulation of this pathway may affect the renewal of midgut tissue damaged by Vip3Aa toxin. Here, we show that Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa have a strong synergistic toxicity when tested together in bioassays against Chilo suppressalis larvae. C. suppressalis is an important rice pest in Asia, especially in China (33.Lu M.X. Cao S.S. Du Y.Z. Liu Z.X. Liu P. Li J. Diapause, signal and molecular characteristics of overwintering Chilo suppressalis (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).Sci.

This insect is susceptible to several Cry proteins, such as Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ca, Cry1Fa, and Cry2Aa toxins (34.Jiao Y. Yang Y. Meissle M. Peng Y. Li Y.

Transgenic crops expressing Vip3Aa toxin along with other Cry toxins, such as Cry1Ac, have prompted different groups to determine the potential synergism of Vip3 with other Cry toxins that can be used as pyramid toxins in transgenic crops (36.Guo S.

Microbiol. 1992; 58 (1444368): 3343-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism responsible for the synergism between Cry and Vip toxins has not been studied before. We found that Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa toxins do not share binding sites on brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) from C. suppressalis, but these two proteins showed a specific interaction between them that directly correlates with their synergistic activity in C. suppressalis. We identified the binding regions in Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa and show that their binding interaction is the basis for their synergistic activity. The finding that the synergism between Vip3Aa and Cry9Aa relies on their specific binding could result in the future development of improved toxin combinations for effective insect control. In a screening for B. thuringiensis toxins useful for the control of C. suppressalis, four Cry proteins (Cry1Ai, Cry1Ie, Cry9Aa, and Cry9Ee) and Vip3Aa were analyzed individually and in combination against this pest. These analyses showed that Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa had a synergistic effect against this pest, whereas other combination did not (data not shown). For the quantitative analysis of toxicity, these toxins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental procedures” (Fig. S1A). Bioassays against C. suppressalis larvae showed that both proteins have a moderate toxicity and that the toxicity of Cry9Aa was 53-fold higher than the Vip3Aa activity (Table 1). To determine the effect on toxicity of a mixture of Cry9Aa and Vip3A, toxicity assays were performed with a mixture of Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa (1:1 ratio). Table 1 shows that Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa display a significant synergistic interaction with a synergism factor (SF) value of 10.6-fold. We found that this combination of toxins induces synergism in other insect pests because the same combination of proteins at a 1:1 ratio induced synergism against Ostrinia furnacalis larvae, showing an SF value of 4.5-fold (Table S1).Table 1Bioassays of insecticidal activity of Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa toxins against C. suppressalis larvaeToxinsObserved LC50 in μg/g diet (95% confidence limits)Expected LC50 in μg/g dietSFCry9Aa0.70 (0.38–1.24)Vip3Aa37.41 (17.11–79.31)Cry9Aa + Vip3Aa0.13 (0.07–0.24)1.3710.6Cry9Aa-R495A/R496A/S497A4.02 (0.85–71.50)Vip3Aa-N364A/D365A/S366A163.66 (34.12–1975.17)Vip3Aa-K432A/T433A/L434A29.59 (13.68–47.99)Cry9Aa-R495A/R496A/S497A + Vip3Aa1.69 (0.37–35.06)7.264.3Cry9Aa + Vip3Aa-N364A/D365A/S366A0.12 (0.06–0.31)1.3911.6Cry9Aa + Vip3Aa-K432A/T433A/L434A1.07 (0.48–2.19)1.371.3 Open table in a new tab Saturation binding assays using increasing concentrations of biotinylated activated Cry9Aa or Vip3Aa toxins showed that the binding of these proteins to BBMVs from C. suppressalis larvae was saturable (Fig. 1, A and B). The controls in Fig. 1, A and B, are the highest concentration of biotinylated Cry9Aa (160 nm) or Vip3Aa (320 nm) proteins without BBMVs under the same conditions, showing no signal, suggesting that there was no precipitation of the two toxins and that the signals detected in the lanes with BBMVs are due to toxin binding to the BBMVs. Homologous binding competition assays using 40 nm biotinylated Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa proteins showed that both toxins were displaced by the corresponding unlabeled toxin, indicating that they bind specifically to the BBMVs from C. suppressalis (Fig. 1, C and D). The heterologous binding competition assays were also performed with 40 nm biotinylated Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa proteins. These assays showed that these toxins do not share binding sites because unlabeled Vip3Aa did not compete the binding of biotinylated Cry9Aa, and unlabeled Cry9Aa did not compete the binding of labeled Vip3Aa to C. suppressalis BBMVs (Fig. 1, E and F). To determine whether the synergistic activity relies on the interaction between Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa toxins, we analyzed the binding between these toxins by ligand blotting (Fig. 2A). In these assays, an excess of Cry9Aa or Vip3Aa toxins was loaded for SDS-PAGE, and after transfer to the membrane and blocking, the other biotinylated toxin was incubated with the membrane. The results showed a clear binding interaction between Cry9Aa and Vip3Aa toxins. In addition, the binding of Cry9Aa to Vip3Aa toxin was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), showing that the binding of biotinylated Cry9Aa with the Vip3Aa toxin fixed in the ELISA well plat"

This study is designed to provide conceptual insights on the biological potential and chemical characterization of H. salsugineum, which is endemic to Turkey. The qualitative and quantitative phenolic content of the extracts was characterized by HPLC-ESI-MSn. Biological efficiency was investigated by enzyme inhibitory assays (cholinesterases, tyrosinase, amylase, and glucosidase) and anti-cancer efficacy tests (anti-proliferative activities with the iCELLigence technology, colony formation and wound healing scratch assays). Phenolic acids (3-O-caffeoylquinic, 5-O-caffeoylquinic, and 4-O-caffeoylquinic acids) were the predominant group in the studied extracts, although several flavonoids were also detected and quantified. The extracts exhibited good inhibitory effects on tyrosinase and glucosidase, while they had weak ability against cholinesterases and amylase. Computational studies were also performed to explain the interactions between the major phenolics and these enzymes. The extracts displayed significant anti-cancer effects on breast carcinoma cell lines. Our findings suggest that Hypericum salsugineum could be valued as a potential source of biologically-active compounds for designing novel products."
https://openalex.org/W2805298856,"Controversy surrounds the molecular identity of mitochondrial K+ channels that are important for protection against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. Although KNa1.2 (sodium-activated potassium channel encoded by Kcn2) is necessary for cardioprotection by volatile anesthetics, electrophysiological evidence for a channel of this type in mitochondria is lacking. The endogenous physiological role of a potential mito-KNa1.2 channel is also unclear. In this study, single channel patch clamp of 27 independent cardiac mitochondrial inner membrane (mitoplast) preparations from wild-type (WT) mice yielded 6 channels matching the known ion sensi tivity, ion selectivity, pharmacology, and conductance properties of KNa1.2 (slope conductance, 138 ± 1 pS). How ever, similar experiments on 40 preparations from Kcnt2−/− mice yielded no such channels. The KNa opener bithionol uncoupled respiration in WT but not Kcnt2−/−cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, when oxidizing only fat as substrate, Kcnt2−/− cardiomyocytes and hearts were less responsive to increases in energetic demand. Kcnt2−/− mice also had elevated body fat, but no baseline differences in the cardiac metabolome. These data support the existence of a cardiac mitochondrial KNa1.2 channel, and a role for cardiac KNa1.2 in regulating metabolism under conditions of high energetic demand.—Smith, C. O., Wang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2805936804,"Objective Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy seen in the digestive tract, with symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, inflammation and ulcerations. Our aim was to investigate whether endogenous glucagon-like peptide -1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are implicated in intestinal healing after chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Design We used a transgenic mouse model Tg(GCG.DTR)(Tg) expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor in the proglucagon-producing cells. Injections with diphtheria toxin ablated the GLP-1 and GLP-2 producing L-cells in Tg mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil or saline and received vehicle, exendin-4, teduglutide (gly2-GLP-2), or exendin-4/teduglutide in combination. The endpoints were body weight change, small intestinal weight, morphology, histological scoring of mucositis and myeloperoxidase levels. Results Ablation of L-cells led to impaired GLP-2 secretion; increased loss of body weight; lower small intestinal weight; lower crypt depth, villus height and mucosal area; and increased the mucositis severity score in mice given 5-fluorouracil. WT mice showed compensatory hyperproliferation as a sign of regeneration in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide rescued the body weight of the Tg mice and led to a hyperproliferation in the small intestine, whereas single treatment was less effective. Conclusion The ablation of L-cells leads to severe mucositis and insufficient intestinal healing, shown by severe body weight loss and lack of compensatory hyperproliferation in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide could prevent this. Because both peptides were needed, we can conclude that both GLP-1 and GLP-2 are essential for intestinal healing in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2807059865,"Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase which plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulation of genes involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, invasion and self-renewal. Activity and biological function of EZH2 are regulated by posttranslational modifications. It is suggested that EZH2 stability may be regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is an enzyme catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc moieties to target proteins. In this study, we determined the impact of OGT on expression of EZH2 target genes FOXA1 and FOXC1, that are involved in breast cancer progression. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both EZH2 and OGT are targeted to the promoter regions of FOXA1 and FOXC1 and knockdown of EZH2 or OGT affects expression of studied genes in breast non-malignant (MCF10A) and cancer cells (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231). The results showed that OGT silencing affects EZH2 binding to FOXC1 promoter but the effect is cell-context dependent. Despite the slight decrease in EZH2 protein level in cells with OGT depletion, EZH2 binding to FOXC1 was increased. Moreover, OGT binding to promoter regions of FOXA1 and FOXC1 was increased in cells with knockdown of EZH2. Increased expression of FOXA1 and FOXC1 in cells with OGT deregulation was associated with increased acetylation level of histone H3. The results suggest that OGT is involved in regulation of FOXA1 and FOXC1 expression but its role is not associated with regulation of EZH2 protein stability."

However, these studies were performed using culture-free methods, with no attempt made to establish bacterial cultures from the beetle-nematode ecosystem and to investigate the effects of these microbes on life history traits in P. pacificus. Here, we establish and characterize a collection of 136 bacterial strains that have been isolated from scarab beetles and figs, another Pristionchus-associated environment, as a resource for studying their effect on various nematode traits. Classification based on 16S sequencing identified members of four bacterial phyla with the class of Gammaproteobacteria representing the majority with 81 strains. Assessing the survival of P. pacificus on individual bacteria allowed us to propose candidate groups of pathogens such as Bacillaceae, Actinobacteria, and Serratia. In combination with chemoattraction data, it was revealed that P. pacificus is able to recognize and avoid certain groups of pathogens, but not others. Our collection of bacterial strains forms a natural resource to study the effects of bacterial diet on development and other traits. Furthermore, these results will form the basis of future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of recognition and pathogenicity."

Here, using MS analysis and in vitro phosphorylation, we show that AMPK phosphorylates Nedd4-2 at the Ser-444 (Xenopus Nedd4-2) site critical for Nedd4-2 stability. We further demonstrate that the Pak-interacting exchange factor β1Pix is required for AMPK-mediated inhibition of ENaC-dependent currents in both CHO and murine kidney cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells. Short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of β1Pix expression in CCD cells attenuated the inhibitory effect of AMPK activators on ENaC currents. Moreover, overexpression of a β1Pix dimerization–deficient mutant unable to bind 14-3-3 proteins (Δ602–611) increased ENaC currents in CCD cells, whereas overexpression of WT β1Pix had the opposite effect. Using additional immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that treatment with AMPK activators promoted the binding of β1Pix to 14-3-3 proteins in CCD cells. However, the association between Nedd4-2 and 14-3-3 proteins was not consistently affected by AMPK activation, β1Pix knockdown, or overexpression of WT β1Pix or the β1Pix-Δ602–611 mutant. Moreover, we found that β1Pix is important for phosphorylation of the aforementioned Nedd4-2 site critical for its stability. Overall, these findings elucidate novel molecular mechanisms by which AMPK regulates ENaC. Specifically, they indicate that AMPK promotes the assembly of β1Pix, 14-3-3 proteins, and Nedd4-2 into a complex that inhibits ENaC by enhancing Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC and its degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2806948240,"Cytochrome P450 4B1 (4B1) functions in both xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. An ester linkage between Glu-310 in 4B1 and the 5-methyl group of heme facilitates preferential hydroxylation of terminal (ω) methyl groups of hydrocarbons (HCs) and fatty acids compared with ω-1 sites bearing weaker C-H bonds. This preference is retained albeit diminished 4-fold for the E310A mutant, but the reason for this is unclear. Here, a crystal structure of the E310A-octane complex disclosed that noncovalent interactions maintain heme deformation in the absence of the ester linkage. Consistent with the lower symmetry of the heme, resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy revealed large enhancements of RR peaks for high-spin HC complexes of 4B1 and the E310A mutant relative to P450 3A4. Whereas these enhancements were diminished in RR spectra of a low-spin 4B1-N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine complex, a crystal structure indicated that this inhibitor does not alter heme ruffling. RR spectra of Fe2+-CO HC complexes revealed larger effects of HC length in E310A than in 4B1, suggesting that reduced rigidity probably underlies increased E310A-catalyzed (ω-1)-hydroxylation. Diminished effects of the HC on the position of the Fe-CO stretching mode in 4B1 suggested that the ester linkage limits substrate access to the CO. Heme ruffling probably facilitates autocatalytic ester formation by reducing inhibitory coordination of Glu-310 with the heme iron. This also positions the 5-methyl for a reaction with the proposed glutamyl radical intermediate and potentially enhances oxo-ferryl intermediate reactivity for generation of the glutamyl radical to initiate ester bond formation and ω-hydroxylation."

Since in other studies this response has been shown to habituate during the scanning session, it is not clear if it may be of use in monitoring disease progression or remission, or in monitoring the effects of therapy, as habituation may confound normalisation of response. We investigated here amygdala activation in healthy participants exposed to displays of emotional facial expressions in a sample of N = 31 individuals assessed twice in an interval of three weeks. At this interval no habituation could be detected, suggesting the validity of this imaging assay in repeated assessments of amygdalar reactivity. However, the fusiform gyrus and the inferior frontal lobes showed decreases in activations that may be related to the role of these areas in encoding visual and emotional aspects of the stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2807579002,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an utmost complex disease that is pathogenetically linked to pancreas- intrinsic (e.g., duct obstruction), environmental-toxic (e.g., alcohol, smoking), and genetic factors. Studying such a complex disease naturally requires validated experimental models. In the past 2 decades, the various animal models of CP usually addressed either the pancreas-intrinsic (e.g., the caerulein model), the environmental-toxic (e.g., diet- induced models), or the genetic component of CP. As such, these models were far from mirroring CP in its full spectrum, and the correct choice of models was vital for valid scientific conclusions on CP. The quest for mechanistic, genetic models gave rise to models based on gene modification and transgene insertion, such as the PRSS1 and the IL-1β/IL-1β models. Recently, we witnessed the development of highly exciting models that rely on the importance of autophagy in CP, that is, the murine pancreas-specific Atg5 and LAMP2 knockout models. Today, critical com parison of these several models is more important than ever for guiding research on CP in an efficient direction. The present review outlines the characteristics of the new genetic models in comparison with the well-known classic models for CP, notes the caveats in the choice of models, and also indicates novel directions for model development.—Klauss, S., Schorn, S., Teller, S., Steenfadt, H., Friess, H., Ceyhan, G.

https://openalex.org/W2807152669,"Self-assembling peptide hydrogels offer a novel 3-dimensional platform for many applications in cell culture and tissue engineering but are not compatible with current methods of RNA isolation; owing to interactions between RNA and the biomaterial. This study investigates the use of two techniques based on two different basic extraction principles: solution-based extraction and direct solid-state binding of RNA respectively, to extract RNA from cells encapsulated in four β-sheet forming self-assembling peptide hydrogels with varying net positive charge. RNA-peptide fibril interactions, rather than RNA-peptide molecular complexing, were found to interfere with the extraction process resulting in low yields. A column-based approach relying on RNA-specific binding was shown to be more suited to extracting RNA with higher purity from these peptide hydrogels owing to its reliance on strong specific RNA binding interactions which compete directly with RNA-peptide fibril interactions. In order to reduce the amount of fibrils present and improve RNA yields a broad spectrum enzyme solution—pronase—was used to partially digest the hydrogels before RNA extraction. This pre-treatment was shown to significantly increase the yield of RNA extracted, allowing downstream RT-qPCR to be performed."
https://openalex.org/W2805728727,"Haloalkane dehalogenases catalyze the hydrolysis of halogen-carbon bonds in organic halogenated compounds and as such are of great utility as biocatalysts. The crystal structures of the haloalkane dehalogenase DhlA from the bacterium from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, specifically adapted for the conversion of the small 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) molecule, display the smallest catalytic site (110 Å3) within this enzyme family. However, during a substrate-specificity screening, we noted that DhlA can catalyze the conversion of far bulkier substrates, such as the 4-(bromomethyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-coumarin (220 Å3). This large substrate cannot bind to DhlA without conformational alterations. These conformational changes have been previously inferred from kinetic analysis, but their structural basis has not been understood. Using molecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate here the intrinsic flexibility of part of the cap domain that allows DhlA to accommodate bulky substrates. The simulations displayed two routes for transport of substrates to the active site, one of which requires the conformational change and is likely the route for bulky substrates. These results provide insights into the structure-dynamics function relationships in enzymes with deeply buried active sites. Moreover, understanding the structural basis for the molecular adaptation of DhlA to 1,2-dichloroethane introduced into the biosphere during the industrial revolution provides a valuable lesson in enzyme design by nature."
https://openalex.org/W2805692864,"Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF)β-TrCP-1 ubiquitin ligases play a central role in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis via proteolytic cleavage of many essential cell cycle regulators. In this study, we propose that centromere protein (CENP)-W, a newly identified kinetochore component, is a novel negative regulator of the SCFβ-TrCP-1 complex. CENP-W interacts with Cullin (CUL)-1 and β-Transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)-1 through highly overlapped binding sites with S-phase kinase-associated protein (SKP)-1. CENP-W is incorporated into the SCFβ-TrCP-1 complex to promote complex disassembly. Unlike other known regulators that increase SCFβ-TrCP-1 ubiquitin ligase activity by promoting complex reassociation, CENP-W-mediated complex disorganization induced β-TrCP1 degradation and consequently decreased its activity. The association between CENP-W and the SCFβ-TrCP-1 complex was prominent during the G2/M transition in the nucleus. Especially, CENP-W knockdown decreased the cell division cycle-25A protein level, leading to a delay in mitotic progression. We propose that CENP-W participates in cell cycle regulation by modulating SCFβ-TrCP-1 ubiquitin ligase activity.-Cheon, Y., Lee, S.

https://openalex.org/W2807592086,"Objectives We aimed to determine the prognosis after early MRI on clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture, hypothesising that MRI pathology is associated with more disability and that MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures are associated with slower return to work (RTW). Methods We conducted a follow-up study of a cohort of 469 patients, who were scanned in the period 2006 to 2010. The respondents constituted our cohort for disability analysis and the subset that was in the labour market at the time of the trauma constituted our sub-cohort for RTW analysis. Questionnaires included disability scores, job title, and lifestyle factors. Job titles were linked with a job exposure matrix to estimate occupational exposures. Register information was obtained on time until RTW. We used logistic regression analysis of disability and Cox regression analysis of time until RTW. Results The proportion that responded was 53% (249/469) for the disability analysis and 59% (125/212) for the RTW analysis. The mean age at follow up was 43.5 years, the mean time since trauma was 4.8 years, 53% had injury of the dominant hand, and 54% had MRI pathology. Men constituted 43% of the cohort and 56% of the sub-cohort. MRI pathology was not associated with more disability [e.g., for a 'Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand'-score ≥20 the odds ratio was 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.26–1.17)]. Patients without MRI pathology and with low occupational exposures were off work for an average of four weeks. Patients with MRI pathology or high occupational exposures were off work for twice as long time. Conclusion MRI pathology was not associated with more disability. For patients, who were in the labour market at the time of the trauma, MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures were associated with slower RTW."
https://openalex.org/W2806202712,"Xenon is frequently used as a general anesthetic in humans, but the mechanism remains an issue of debate. While for some membrane proteins, a direct interaction of xenon with the protein has been shown to be the inhibitory mechanism, other membrane protein functions could be affected by changes of membrane properties due to partitioning of the gas into the lipid bilayer. Here, the effect of xenon on a mechanosensitive ion channel and a copper ion-translocating ATPase was compared under different conditions. Xenon inhibited spontaneous gating of the Escherichia coli mechano-sensitive mutant channel MscL-G22E, as shown by patch-clamp recording techniques. Under high hydrostatic pressure, MscL-inhibition was reversed. Similarly, the activity of the Enterococcus hirae CopB copper ATPase, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, was inhibited by xenon. However, the CopB ATPase activity was also inhibited by xenon when CopB was in a solubilized state. These findings suggest that xenon acts by directly interacting with these proteins, rather than via indirect effects by altering membrane properties. Also, inhibition of copper transport may be a novel effect of xenon that contributes to anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2805177287,"A human induced pluripotent stem cell line (GPCCi001-A) created by our group was differentiated towards chondrocyte-like cells (ChiPS) via monolayer culturing with growth factors. ChiPS are promising because they have the potential to be used in tissue engineering to regenerate articular cartilage. However, their safety must be confirmed before they can be routinely used in regenerative medicine. Using microarray analysis, we compared the ChiPS to both GPCCi001-A cells and chondrocytes. The analysis showed that, compared to both GPCCi001-A cells and chondrocytes, the expression of genes engaged in DNA damage and in the tumor protein p53 signalling pathways was significantly higher in the ChiPS. The significant amount of DNA double strand breaks and increased DNA damage response may lead to incomplete DNA repair and the accumulation of mutations and, ultimately, to genetic instability. These findings provide evidence indicating that the differentiation process in vitro places stress on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The results of this study raise doubts about the use of stem cell-derived components given the negative effects of the differentiation process in vitro on hiPSCs."

Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys' BMI and girls' among newborns in each survey point (p>0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p<0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (p<0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0-6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p<0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (p<0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children's overweight and obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2806447316,"Background To accommodate training for unilaterally affected patients (e.g. stroke), the Lokomat (a popular robotic exoskeleton-based gait trainer) provides the possibility to set the amount of movement guidance for each leg independently. Given the interlimb couplings, such asymmetrical settings may result in complex effects, in which ipsilateral activity co-depends on the amount of guidance offered to the contralateral leg. To test this idea, the effect of asymmetrical guidance on muscle activity was explored. Methods 15 healthy participants walked in the Lokomat at two speeds (1 and 2 km/h) and guidance levels (30% and 100%), during symmetrical (both legs receiving 30% or 100% guidance) and asymmetrical conditions (one leg receiving 30% and the other 100% guidance) resulting in eight unique conditions. Activity of the right leg was recorded from Erector Spinae, Gluteus Medius, Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Gastrocnemius and Tibialis Anterior. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to assess whether ipsilateral muscle activity depended on guidance settings for the contralateral leg. Results Muscle output amplitude not only depended on ipsilateral guidance settings, but also on the amount of guidance provided to the contralateral leg. More specifically, when the contralateral leg received less guidance, ipsilateral activity of Gluteus Medius and Medial Gastrocnemius increased during stance. Conversely, when the contralateral leg received more guidance, ipsilateral muscle activity for these muscles decreased. These effects were specifically observed at 1 km/h, but not at 2 km/h. Conclusions This is the first study of asymmetrical guidance on muscle activity in the Lokomat, which shows that ipsilateral activity co-depends on the amount of contralateral guidance. In therapy, these properties may be exploited e.g. to promote active contributions by the more affected leg. Therefore, the present results urge further research on the use of asymmetrical guidance in patient groups targeted by Lokomat training."

Protein purification remains a key tool for many characterization studies. Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-binding messenger protein with over a hundred downstream binding partners, and is involved in a host of physiological processes, from learning and memory to immune and cardiac function. To facilitate biophysical studies of calmodulin, researchers have designed a site-specific labeling process for use in bioconjugation applications while maintaining high levels of protein activity. Here, we present a platform for selective conjugation of calmodulin directly from clarified cell lysates under bioorthogonal reaction conditions. Using a chemoenzymatically modified calmodulin, we employ popular click chemistry reactions for the conjugation of calmodulin to Sepharose resin, thereby streamlining a previously multi-step purification and conjugation process. We show that this ""next-generation"" calmodulin-Sepharose resin is not only easy to produce, but is also able to purify more calmodulin-binding proteins per volume of resin than traditional calmodulin-Sepharose resins. We expect these methods to be translatable to other proteins of interest and to other conjugation applications such as surface-based assays for the characterization of protein-protein interaction dynamics."

Plasmalogens are abundant in the central nervous systems of animals, suggesting they may play roles related to nerve transmission. However, their presence in single-cell animals, which do not have a nervous system, suggests that they have also evolved to fulfill other functions, as units of membrane structure and as participants in signaling. Sensitivity to ROS has also led to the proposal that plasmalogens could serve as protection against ROS; in this model, hydrolysis by an unknown ROS-consuming mechanism could be reversed by a well-known acyl-CoA–dependent reaction (2Zoeller R.A.

However, cyt c can also function as a peroxidase, which is induced by the binding of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (CL), resulting in a change in the conformation of the protein and a dramatic change in its redox potential from +260 to −400 mV. This abrogates its electron transfer function and shifts its activity to that of a peroxidase. Earlier work showed that activated cyt c can oxidize polyunsaturated linoleoyl-acyl chains in CL (5Tyurina Y.Y. Poloyac S.M. Tyurin V.A. Kapralov A.A. Jiang J. Anthonymuthu T.S. Kapralova V.I. Vikulina A.S. Jung M.Y. Epperly M.W. Mohammadyani D. Klein-Seetharaman J. Jackson T.C. Kochanek P.M. Pitt B.R. Greenberger J.S. Vladimirov Y.A. Bayır H. Kagan V.E. A mitochondrial pathway for biosynthesis of lipid mediators.Nat. Chem. 2014; 6 (24848241): 542-55210.1038/nchem.1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); although these chains do not contain the vinyl ether group, the unsaturated bonds and overall framework were sufficiently similar to that of plasmalogens to lead Jenkins et al. (3Jenkins C.M. Yang K. Liu G. Moon S.H. Dilthey B.G. Gross R.W. Cytochrome c is an oxidative stress-activated plasmalogenase that cleaves plasmenylcholine and plasmenylethanolamine at the sn-1 vinyl-ether linkage.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29530984): 8693-870910.1074/jbc.RA117.001629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to consider the possibility that activated cyt c could be the missing hydrolytic enzyme. This hypothesis was verified by testing the normal peroxidase conditions for cyt c—addition of CL and H2O2—and observing plasmalogen turnover. The authors then conducted a series of elegant experiments based on high resolution, high mass accuracy (HRAM) MS, compound derivatization, and stable isotopes to further validate these findings and investigate the catalytic mechanism. Using 18O-labeled O2, H2O, and H2O2, followed by MS of the reaction products, the authors show that oxygen from O2 is incorporated into the hydroxyl group, and oxygen from H2O is found at the aldehyde carbon of the resulting α-hydroxy long-chain aldehydes (Fig. 1). This differs from normal peroxidase mechanisms in that neither of the H2O2 oxygen atoms is incorporated into the product. Of great interest is the finding that the peroxidase activity of cyt c can be activated by oxidized CL in the absence of H2O2. Other negatively charged lipids such as PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 were also able to activate cyt c plasmalogenase activity. The reaction could be inhibited by a mAb against cyt c, as well as known inhibitors of cyt c’s peroxidase activity, cyanide and azide, confirming the role of the protein in the reaction (6Cadenas E. Boveris A. Chance B. Low level chemi-luminescence of hydroperoxide-supplemented cytochrome-c.Biochem. J. 1980; 187 (6250533): 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The authors place these results in the context of damage induced by oxidative stress to the myocardium, which is enriched in both mitochondria and plasmalogens. During infarction/reperfusion, mitochondria close to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)—a specialized type of ER found in muscle cells—can release cyt c, which can act on AA-rich plasmalogens in the SR. A similar process could take place at the muscle cell membrane. They also note that a number of studies have shown significant decreases in plasmalogens in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients as well as accumulation of α-hydroxyaldehyde, which correlates with the severity of the disease (7Weisser M. Vieth M. Stolte M. Riederer P. Pfeuffer R. Leblhuber F. Spiteller G. Dramatic increase of α-hydroxyaldehydes derived from plasmalogens in the aged human brain.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 90 (9450324): 135-14210.1016/S0009-3084(97)00089-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction may lay the groundwork for ensuing dementia. Recent animal and clinical studies provide further impetus for this mechanism, showing modest effects of plasmalogen administration on cognitive function in a rat model of AD and in female patients with mild cognitive impairment (8Yamashita S. Hashimoto M. Haque A.M. Nakagawa K. Kinoshita M. Shido O. Miyazawa T. Oral administration of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid containing a high level of plasmalogen improves memory impairment in amyloid β-infused rats.Lipids. 2017; 52 (28551706): 575-58510.1007/s11745-017-4260-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Fujino T. Yamada T. Asada T. Tsuboi Y. Wakana C. Mawatari S. Kono S.

The research by Jenkins et al. (3Jenkins C.M. Yang K. Liu G. Moon S.H. Dilthey B.G. Gross R.W. Cytochrome c is an oxidative stress-activated plasmalogenase that cleaves plasmenylcholine and plasmenylethanolamine at the sn-1 vinyl-ether linkage.J. Biol.

Since activated cyt c promotes oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in CL (3Jenkins C.M. Yang K. Liu G. Moon S.H. Dilthey B.G. Gross R.W. Cytochrome c is an oxidative stress-activated plasmalogenase that cleaves plasmenylcholine and plasmenylethanolamine at the sn-1 vinyl-ether linkage.J. Biol.

Now further interesting questions arise: The authors suggest that oxidized CL hydroperoxides replace H2O2 in the observed plasmalogenase activity. The mechanism by which oxidized CL accomplishes this task by itself will be of considerable interest. Do other plasmalogenases exist, using the same chemical mechanism or others, or is cyt c the only one? How does activated cyt c catalyze this reaction? Does this new, critical function prompt a reevaluation of what we know about cytochrome c's basic biology? It seems the resolution of one mystery has created many more.
