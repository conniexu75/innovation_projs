https://openalex.org/W2011736517,"Fibroblasts are subjected to changes of the mechanical force balance during physiological as well as pathological situations, such as wound healing, development of hypertrophic scars, and fibrogenesis. However, the molecular response and the changes in fibroblast gene expression upon mechanical stimulation remain poorly understood. As an in vitro model, human dermal fibroblasts were cultured within a three-dimensional network of fibrillar collagen either under high (stressed) or low tension (relaxed). cDNA microarray technology in combination with Northern blot analysis led to identification of mechano-responsive genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins, fibrogenic growth factors, protease inhibitors, components of focal adhesions, and the cytoskeleton. Application of biaxial strain to fibroblasts cultured on flexible silicone membranes revealed that the type of strain as well as the properties of the substrate induced different patterns of gene regulation. The transcriptional profile of mechanically induced genes in collagen lattices suggests that mechanical stimuli lead to a “synthetic” fibroblast phenotype characterized by induction of connective tissue synthesis while simultaneously inhibiting matrix degradation.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In contrast, dermal fibroblasts are less well characterized in their response to mechanical load, despite the fact that skin in its physiological state is constantly exposed to stretching and bending forces. Moreover, healing of skin wounds represents a special situation in which fibroblasts develop tensile forces against the granulation tissue matrix in order to bring the wound margins together and to obtain fast wound closure. It has been postulated that during wound contraction mechanically stressed fibroblasts differentiate into the specialized myofibroblast phenotype, characterized by expression of α-smooth muscle actin and formation of prominent stress fibers and of fibronexus junctions (2Gabbiani G. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1981; 54: 183-194PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 4Vaughan M.B. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The scar that finally develops is itself a tissue under increased mechanical forces, at least as long as scar resolution is not complete. The specialized cases of abnormal scarring, e.g. keloids, represent a further situation to which mechanical forces are of relevance; such lesions have long been known to develop in regions of the body that are subjected to relatively higher mechanical forces than others. Furthermore, fibroblasts in fibrotic skin lesions are thought to be subject to considerable mechanical tension.Thus, there are examples of physiological and disease conditions that strongly argue for the presence of mechanical forces acting upon skin fibroblasts. To analyze the effects of such forces, several experimental models have been designed that clearly demonstrated that fibroblasts respond to mechanical stress. In a classical experiment, it has been shown that fibroblasts develop forces against a malleable substrate, which was wrinkled by the cells (5Stopak D. Harris A.K. Dev. Biol. 1982; 90: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Further development of elastic membrane-based culture models has proven valuable because defined strains, e.g. static or stepwise or cyclic, can easily be applied. Such planar culture models have provided valuable insight into cellular responses to substrate deformation,e.g. induction of collagen and proteoglycan synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells (6Leung D.Y. Glagov S. Mathews M.B. Science. 1976; 191: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). However, for some cell types, including skin fibroblasts, cultures on such substrates does not sufficiently represent the three-dimensional network of ECM1 macromolecules with which these cells interact in vivo. Three-dimensional collagen lattices are more suitable culture models (7Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). To study the effects of mechanical stress on dermal fibroblasts, we compared retracting collagen lattices, in which collagen fibers are remodeled to a floating disc of one-tenth of the original diameter, and tension is very low and distributed isotropically to stressed lattices that cannot be retracted due to adherence of the collagen lattice to a nylon thread (or steel wire) placed at the inner perimeter of the dish (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter model, cells develop tension against the resisting matrix. By contrast, in the mechanically relaxed matrix of the retracting lattice, tension is self-generated as opposed to the externally applied stress generated by substrate deformation and is distributed anisotropically. The magnitude of force developed in similar restrained lattices has been measured and amounted to 0.25 g per million cells (9Delvoye P. Wiliquet P. Leveque J.L. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 898-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 40–60 dynes per million cells (10Brown R.A. Prajapati R. McGrouther D.A. Yannas I.V. Eastwood M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).A prerequisite for force generation is the presence of serum (11Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Guidry C. Grinnell F. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 79: 67-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TGF-β (13Montesano R. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4894-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), or platelet-derived growth factor (14Gullberg D. Tingstrom A. Thuresson A.C. Olsson L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The active substance in serum is lysophosphatidic acid, which stimulates contraction via cAMP, activation of Rho with inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase, and via Ca2+-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase (15Parizi M. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Within collagen lattices, fibroblasts utilize α2β1 integrin receptors to mediate cell-collagen contact (16Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Schiro J.A. Chan B.M. Roswit W.T. Kassner P.D. Pentland A.P. Hemler M.E. Eisen A.Z. Kupper T.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). α2β1-mediated contraction leads to activation of protein kinase Cζ and NFκB (18Xu J. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By their transmembrane nature, α2β1 receptors physically connect external collagen fibers with the actin filament network and thereby transmit forces and information required for contraction into the cells (19Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal networks must be intact, as cytochalasin-mediated actin microfilament disruption (11Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) as well as absence of intermediate filaments (20Eckes B. Dogic D. Colucci-Guyon E. Wang N. Maniotis A. Ingber D. Merckling A. Langa F. Aumailley M. Delouvee A. Koteliansky V. Babinet C. Krieg T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) severely impair contraction.Cytoskeletal structures were shown to change drastically depending upon mechanical load, i.e. fibroblasts in stressed matrices develop prominent α-smooth muscle actin-containing stress fibers (11Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) resembling myofibroblasts. Thus, mechanical forces influence the differentiation state of cells. In parallel, cellular morphology also changes; in relaxed lattices fibroblasts appear stellate with short processes, whereas in restrained lattices they are elongated, bipolar, and oriented along the lines of tension (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bellows C.G. Melcher A.H. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 50: 299-314PubMed Google Scholar). Cell proliferation is low in relaxed (7Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) and active in restrained lattices (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar).In view of these profound changes, an adaptation of gene expression profiles induced by mechanical stress is expected. As compared with relaxed lattices, overall protein synthesis is increased 4–6-fold in stressed collagen gels (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the following genes were found induced in fibroblasts in stressed as compared with mechanically relaxed collagen gels: α1(I) and α2(I) collagen, α1(III) collagen, all three α-chains of type VI collagen, fibronectin and β-actin, whereas elastin was only slightly induced andMMP-1 was strongly repressed (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar). These changes were regulated at a pretranslational level. Also using fibroblasts but a different experimental model, Chiquet and co-workers (1Chiquet M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) demonstrated induction by stress of collagen XII and tenascin-C mRNA as well as protein. Based on comparative promoter analyses, the authors (22Resnick N. Collins T. Atkinson W. Bonthron D.T. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) suggested a core sequence of GAGACC, which was initially detected to render a platelet-derived growth factor promoter in vascular endothelial cells responsive to shear stress, to be part of a stretch-responsive element.The aim of this study was to obtain a comprehensive overview on changes in gene expression induced by tensile stress in fibroblasts cultured in restrained (termed “stressed” in the following) versusmechanically relaxed (termed “relaxed”) three-dimensional collagen lattices. To address this, we applied a combination of techniques to identify differentially expressed genes at the level of steady-state mRNA. For a number of sequences thus identified, differential expression was verified by Northern blot hybridization.RESULTSIn order to achieve a comprehensive characterization of dermal fibroblasts subjected to tensile stress regarding induction or repression of genes, cells were cultured for 20 h in three-dimensional collagen lattices. Parallel cultures were either allowed to contract freely, i.e. these cells were cultured under isotonic conditions and not subjected to significant tensile stress (Fig. 1H). Furthermore, this will be referred to as the “relaxed” system. The other set was cultured in the presence of self-generated tension in lattices bound by circular nylon threads (stressed system, Fig. 1G). The time point of analysis (20 h) was chosen because by this time the relaxed cultures had reached maximal contraction (determined in preliminary experiments, not shown) and were regarded to be in mechanical equilibrium. From both sets of cultures, mRNA was isolated and used as starting material for different comparative analyses including hybridization to a cDNA microchip array comprising ∼7100 expressed sequences (known and anonymous cDNAs). This approach yielded a large number of potentially differentially expressed sequences. Induction or repression of individual sequences by mechanical force was verified by Northern blot hybridization.Potential Tension-inducible Genes Identified by cDNA Microarray AnalysisAs expected, the simultaneous hybridization of Cy3-labeled cDNA generated from stressed collagen lattices and a Cy5-labeled probe from the relaxed culture system to a cDNA microchip array yielded the most comprehensive information. Signals were rated according to “balanced differential expression,” which takes into account labeling efficiency as well as hybridization background. Signal intensities are expressed as x-fold Cy3:Cy5 intensities (stressed:relaxed). Positive numbers indicate higher expression in stressed lattices, and negative numbers indicatex-fold higher expression in relaxed lattices. 2-Fold or higher differences were considered significant. In total, we detected 60 known genes induced in mechanically stressed fibroblasts, whereas transcription of 64 known genes was found to be increased in the mechanically relaxed system if 3-fold or higher induction of gene transcription was considered.Table I shows a list of 57 genes with known functions that are all induced at least 2-fold in stressed fibroblasts. No anonymous sequences are listed here; a full list is available from the authors upon request. For clarity, these genes are grouped according to their involvement in specific cellular tasks or properties.Table ISelection of genes with known function induced in dermal fibroblasts grown in mechanically stressed lattices analyzed by cDNA microchip analysisDifferential expressionaDifferential expression by >2.0-fold, among ∼7100 cDNAs investigated.TranscriptGenBank™ accession numbersA.

Open table in a new tab In keeping with increased fibroblast proliferation in mechanically stressed lattices demonstrated by thymidine incorporation (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar), proliferation-associated and cyclin gene expression was induced (TableI, group A). Of the signal transducer/ion channel group (group B), Rho GTPase-activating protein and myosin light chain were induced, as would be expected from studies using specific inhibitors (15Parizi M. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Genes involved in nucleoside metabolism and in particular induction of RNA polymerase II, the enzyme responsible for mRNA synthesis, reflect a generally activated condition and are in agreement with induced cell proliferation and gene expression (group C).In the group of transcription factors (group D), high relative induction was observed for Id1 and Id3, known as dominant negative antagonists of helix-loop-helix transcription factors, e.g. MyoD. They function as general regulators of cell growth and negative regulators of differentiation (36Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Furthermore, mechanical tension altered gene expression of a variety of transmembrane proteins (group E). Interestingly, of all known genes found induced in this assay, the transmembrane protein human podocalyxin-like protein (PCLP), not yet described as expressed gene in fibroblasts, reached the highest score. PCLP was originally identified on podocytes in the kidney glomerulus as a ligand for L-selectin, with a proposed role in tethering and rolling of lymphocytes on endothelia (37Kershaw D.B. Beck S.G. Wharram B.L. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Thomas P.E. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15708-15714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Group F shows a list of growth factors significantly induced in mechanically stressed collagen lattices. The highest induction of transcription was detected for Cyr61 mRNA that encodes a secreted, cysteine-rich heparin-binding protein that shares striking structural homologies with the fibrogenic mediator connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (38O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). CTGF itself was detected at significantly increased levels in stressed lattices, confirming results generated by independent experiments (cDNA filter array, CLONTECH, data not shown) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3).Of note, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), a member of the VEGF protein family, was induced in fibroblasts subjected to tensile stress.Group G summarizes induced expression of different protease inhibitors, including PAI-2 with the second highest score achieved in this assay but also the functionally related PAI-1. The MMP-inhibitors, TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 were found slightly induced.The groups H–J consist of ECM proteins and structural components of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion sites. Agreeing with previous reports (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Tannheimer M. Koch M. Brunner A. Spring J. Martin D. Baumgartner S. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2093-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), collagen α1(I) and tenascin-C were induced. The microarray hybridization also confirmed induced expression of α-smooth muscle actin (group I), the isoform specifically expressed by myofibroblasts (40Serini G. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).In keeping with the concept that tension is transmitted through focal adhesions (41Maniotis A.J. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), induced expression of leupaxin, integrin-linked kinase, moesin, zyxin, and vinculin was observed (group J). Changes in focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton architecture were confirmed by immunostaining. In stressed collagen matrices vinculin is localized in small adhesion complexes at the cell margins (Fig. 1, C andE). Mechanical tension led to development of distinct actin stress fibers traversing the entire cell body (Fig. 1,A and E, visualized by TRITC phalloidin staining). In contrast, lack of tension induced total reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion architecture (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). Fibroblasts appeared rounded (Fig.1F), and vinculin was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm or in the perinuclear space (Fig. 1D), whereas actin stress fibers disappeared (Fig. 1B).Time Course of Expression of Selected GenesTo obtain insight into the mechanisms of gene induction in human dermal fibroblasts cultured in a different mechanical environment, and to confirm cDNA microchip hybridization results, we studied the response of various genes to self-generated tension in more detail (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). These genes were selected for further characterization due to their relevance in connective tissue metabolism (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) or high levels of differential expression demonstrated by microarray analysis (Figs. 5 and 6).Figure 5PAI-2, PCLP, and Fn14mRNA levels are regulated by mechanical tension and presence of ECM. Human dermal fibroblasts isolated from four different healthy donors were cultured as monolayers on plastic culture dishes (M) in stressed (+) and relaxed (−) collagen lattices for 20 h. Total RNA was prepared and analyzed for PAI-2, PCLP, and Fn14 expression by Northern hybridization. Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by hybridization with an oligonucleotide complementary to 18 S rRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Cdc-like kinase, SOD2, andSH3BP5 mRNA levels are regulated by mechanical tension and presence of ECM.

Our aim was to identify mechanisms whereby expression of one gene was dependent on previous regulation of another.Highest expression of α1(I) collagen was observed in monolayer cultures on plastic at 20 h, whereas expression in both collagen lattice types was lower (Fig. 2A). Tension-loaded gel cultures consistently produced stronger signals than relaxed gel cultures, confirming previous results (8Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar, 42Mauch C. Hatamochi A. Scharffetter K. Krieg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Elevated expression was already detected at 4 h of lattice culture, and signal intensity did not change significantly over 20 h. α1(VI) mRNA was also detected at increased levels after 4 h; however, a clear peak in expression was evident at 12 h, which declined after 20 h to the level seen at 4 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast to α1(I) collagen mRNA, the highest levels of α1(VI) mRNA were observed in stressed gels, not in monolayer cultures. Expression ofMMP-1 was low in monolayers at 20 h and lattices at 4 h, whereas the strongest induction was detected in relaxed lattices at 20 h, as indicated previously (19Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 43Mauch C. Adelmann-Grill B. Hatamochi A. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Decorin expression was equally low in monolayers at 20 h and early lattice cultures but increased significantly and to the same extent in both gel systems over 20 h.Figure 2Modulation of α1(I) collagen, α1(VI) collagen, decorin, andMMP-1 mRNA levels in stressed and relaxed collagen gels. A, human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in stressed (+) or relaxed (−) collagen gels for 4, 12, and 20 h. Expression levels of α1(I) collagen, α1(VI) collagen, decorin, andMMP-1 mRNA were analyzed by Northern hybridization. In parallel, cells were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes (M) for 20 h.

The isoforms β1 and β3 were both expressed at low levels in monolayers and induced by culture in collagen lattices (Fig.3A). TGF-β1 reached maximal expression levels at 12 h in collagen gels; at 20 h expression remained high only under tension, whereas it declined in the relaxed system. TGF-β3 mRNA was increased in stressed lattices at 12 and 20 h, but peak levels were lower than those of TGF-β1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, CTGF transcript levels were lower in both types of lattices than in monolayer cultures with highest expression at 4 h and declining until 20 h (Fig. 3A). At all time points, CTGF levels in stressed cells were higher than in relaxed cells. Thus, CTGF expression in the stressed fibroblasts does not seem to depend on previous up-regulation of TGF-β.In accordance with previous reports (16Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), α2 integrin mRNA was strongly induced in contracting lattices but only marginally elevated by tension in stressed lattices over 20 h. Expression of β1 integrin mRNA was low at 4 h in collagen lattices but increased at 12 h (Fig.4). Expression levels thereafter remained unaltered in both stressed and relaxed cultures and were comparable to expression in monolayer cultures. Of note, the housekeeping gene GAPDH, which is often used as an unmodified internal standard for mRNA expression, showed strong induction at 20 h in relaxed collagen gels and can therefore not be recommended as control for quantification of RNA levels in these systems.Figure 4Modulation of β1 and α2 integrin, and GAPDH mRNA levels in stressed and relaxed collagen gels.

In vitro, NO, peroxynitrite and HNE can cause direct permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, and this effect is inhibited by cyclosporin A, indicating involvement of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) in the permeabilization event. NO, peroxynitrite and HNE also permeabilize proteoliposomes containing the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), one of the key components of the PTPC, yet have no or little effects on protein-free control liposomes. ANT-dependent, NO-, peroxynitrite- or HNE-induced permeabilization is at least partially inhibited by recombinant Bcl-2 protein, as well as the antioxidants trolox and butylated hydroxytoluene. In vitro, none of the tested agents (NO, peroxynitrite, HNE, and tert-butylhydroperoxide) causes preferential carbonylation HNE adduction, or nitrotyrosylation of ANT. However, all these agents induced ANT to undergo thiol oxidation/derivatization. Peroxynitrite and HNE also caused significant lipid peroxidation, which was antagonized by butylated hydroxytoluene but not by recombinant Bcl-2. Transfection-enforced expression of vMIA, a viral apoptosis inhibitor specifically targeted to ANT, largely reduces the mitochondrial and nuclear signs of apoptosis induced by NO, peroxynitrite and HNE in intact cells. Taken together these data suggest that NO, peroxynitrite, and HNE may directly act on ANT to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis."

By using light sources that predominantly excite either photosystem I (PSI) or photosystem II (PSII), we studied the effects of excitation imbalances between both photosystems on nuclear PSI gene transcription in transgenic tobacco seedlings with promoter::β-glucuronidase gene fusions. Shifts from PSI to PSII light sources (and vice versa) induced changes in the reduction/oxidation state of intersystem redox components, and acclimation of tobacco seedlings to such changes were monitored by changes in chlorophyll a/b ratios andin vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence. The ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase gene promoter did not respond to these treatments, those from the genes for subunits PsaD and PsaF of PSI are activated by a reduction signal, and the plastocyanin promoter responded to both reduction and oxidation signals. Additional experiments with photosynthetic electron transport inhibitors 3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1′-dimethyl urea and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone demonstrated that the redox state of the plastoquinone pool controls the activity of the plastocyanin promoter, whereas subunit PsaD and PsaF gene transcription is regulated by other photosynthesis-derived signals.

Nuclear-encoded genes for structural components of the photosynthetic machinery are either new or a result of a gene transfer from the endosymbiotic ancestor of chloroplasts to the nucleus of the host cell (1Allen J.F. Raven J.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Martin W. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 3Martin W.

Dev. 1999; 9: 678-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The enormous differences in gene copy number between both compartments require a highly coordinated regulation in their expression during development and acclimation of the organism to environmental cues. This coordination is controlled by the nucleus at many levels (5Leon P. Arroyo A. Mackenzie S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) but also involves signals from the plastids, which influence the expression of nuclear genes for plastid proteins (6Oelmüller R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 229-239Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Taylor W.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 46: 445-474Google Scholar, 8Surpin M. Chory J.

The exact nature of the plastid-derived signal(s) is still elusive. Inhibition of either plastid transcription or translation or photo-oxidative destruction of chloroplasts prevents the transcription of several nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes (10Oelmüller R. Levitan I. Bergfeld R. Rajasekhar V.K. Mohr H. Planta. 1986; 168: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Rapp J.C. Mullet J.E. Plant Mol.

Other crucial components involved in this interorganelle cross-talk are intermediates and/or components of the tetrapyrrol biosynthesis pathway (14Johanningmeier U. Eur. J.

Kaiser W.M. Pyke K.A. Flügge U.-I. Chory J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1609-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). One of the central players in this scenario is light, and it seems to regulate the expression of several nuclear genes for plastid proteins via the same cis-active elements as the plastid-derived signal(s) (20Kusnetsov V. Bolle C. Lübberstedt T. Sopory S. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 631-639PubMed Google Scholar). Besides cytosolic photoreceptors plants sense changes in light quantity or quality via the modulation of the reduction/oxidation (redox) state of various chloroplast molecules involved in photosynthesis. This redox signaling provides a feedback link between the degree of photosynthetic efficiency and the expression of nuclear photosynthesis genes (21Durnford D.G. Falkowski P.G. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 229-241Crossref Google Scholar, 22Link G. Govindjee 7th Ed. Advances in Photosynthesis. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 1-52Google Scholar, 23Pfannschmidt T. Allen J.F. Oelmüller R. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 112: 1-9Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which helps to acclimate the photosynthetic process to varying environmental conditions. A few examples for this are known. Acclimation to different light intensities and temperatures of the unicellular algae Dunaliella tertiolecta and Dunaliella salina involves changes in the transcription of the nuclear-encoded chlorophyll-binding proteins of the light-harvesting complex (LHCB) genes, which are regulated by the redox state of the PQ1 pool (24Escoubas J.-M.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Dark/light shift experiments with transgenic tobacco revealed that photosynthetic electron transport controls also transcription of the pea ferredoxin (FED1) gene as well as FED1 mRNA ribosome loading (26Petracek M.E. Dickey L.F. Huber S.C. Thompsen W.F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2291-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport by DCMU also destabilizes the FED1 mRNA (27Petracek M.E. Dickey L.F. Nguyen T.T. Gatz C. Sowinski D.A. Allen G.C. Thompsen W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9009-9013Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Under high light stress, Arabidopsis showed an increase in the transcription of the nuclear APX genes (encoding cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases) probably controlled by the PQ redox state and H2O2 (28Karpinski S. Escobar C. Karpinska B. Creissen G. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 29Karpinski S. Reynolds H. Karpinska B. Wingsle G. Creissen G. Mullineaux P.M. Science. 1999; 284: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an interaction between photosynthetic electron transport and sugar regulation on nuclear photosynthesis gene expression has been postulated. In an Arabidopsis cell culture the observed increase in LHCB and PETE (encoding plastocyanin) transcription after sugar repletion was diminished in the presence of DCMU (30Oswald O. Martin T. Dominy P.J. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Illumination conditions that predominantly excite photosystems I (PSI) or II (PSII) generate an imbalance in excitation energy distribution between PSI and PSII, which results in a decrease of the photosynthetic efficiency. Such light quality gradients that typically appear in canopies of trees or forests, in dense plant populations, and aquatic environments are counterbalanced by plants with an initial short term response called state transitions, and a following long term response that causes a readjustment of PS stoichiometry. This readjustment requires changes in photosynthesis gene expression (31Allen J.F. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 9: 196-205Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Anderson J.M. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 625-639Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). With light sources that predominantly excite PSI or PSII we could demonstrate that the redox state of the PQ pool controls transcription of the chloroplast-encoded PS genes psbA and psaAB in mustard (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 34Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A.N. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar). However, at least half of the structural compounds of the photosynthetic apparatus are encoded in the nucleus (35Sugita M. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Chitnis P.R. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and nothing is known about how their expression is coupled to the changed expression in chloroplasts under varying light quality. In this study, we focus on the nuclear-encoded PSI genes PSAD (encoding subunit PsaD), PSAF (encoding subunit PsaF),PETE, and PETH (encoding ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase) to address the question of whether their expression also responds to changes of plastid redox parameters. These genes encode crucial components of the PSI complex. The subunits PsaD and FNR are located at the stromal side of the complex and provide an essential site for ferredoxin docking (37Lelong C.

The subunits PsaF and plastocyanin are located at the lumenal side. The mobile electron carrier plastocyanin transfers electrons from the cytochromeb6f complex to PSI, and PsaF provides a docking site for this protein (40Haehnel W. Jansen T. Gause K. Klösgen R.B.

Recent studies using promoter::β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions in transgenic tobacco revealed that these four promoter constructs respond to light and the plastid signal(s) (19Streatfield S.J. Weber A. Kinsman E.A. Häusler R.E. Li J. Post-Beittenmiller D. Kaiser W.M. Pyke K.A. Flügge U.-I. Chory J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1609-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43Bolle C. Sopory S.

Plant J. 1996; 10: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test whether promoter activation of these genes is coupled to the photosynthetic electron transport, we grew transgenic tobacco seedlings under the above mentioned PS-specific light sources. We found that the promoters of the genes PSAD, PSAF, and PETE but notPETH respond to light-induced redox signals from the plastid. Furthermore, inhibitor assays revealed that transcription of the genes PSAD, PSAF, and PETE is coupled to photosynthetic electron transport via different redox systems. This demonstrates that redox signals do not only operate within the chloroplast (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar) but also affect nuclear-encoded photosystem genes with the aim to coordinate nuclear and chloroplast PSI gene expression during PS stoichiometry adjustment. Plants were grown in a temperature-controlled growth chamber at 22 °C. Mustard seedlings (Sinapis alba L.) were grown on vermiculite in plastic boxes under continuous light. They were grown under PSI or PSII light for 7 days or 5 days in PSI light followed by 2 days of PSII light and vice versa as described (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 34Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A.N. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar). Tobacco wild-type (SamsunNN) and transgenic lines were germinated and grown on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium containing 1.35% sucrose and, in case of transgenic lines, 80 μg/ml kanamycin in Petri dishes. Generation of the transgenic lines used here have been described earlier (45Oelmüller R. Bolle C. Tyagi A.K. Niekrawitz N. Breit S. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen.

Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Promoter::GUS fusion constructs introduced into tobacco contained the following cis-active regions relative to the transcription start site (+1): −1802 to +55 (PSAD), −1074 to +163 (PSAF), −1126 to +60 (PETE), and −731 to +231 (PETH). Tobacco seedlings were grown for 18 days under continuous PSI or PSII light or 14 days in PSI light followed by 4 days in PSII light or vice versa. Spectral quality and light quantity of the PSI and PSII light sources have been described (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). White-light control plants were illuminated continuously for 7 days (mustard) or 14 days (tobacco) with 30 W white-stripe lamps (OSRAM) with a photon flux density of 100 microeinsteins. The electron transport inhibitors DCMU and DBMIB (Sigma) have been applied to the plants grown in Petri dishes by spraying 0.5 ml of indicated concentrations on the leaves using a 10-ml fine sprayer. Control seedlings were treated with the solvent without inhibitors. Wild-type seedlings were illuminated with white light until Chl fluorescence measurements were performed. Transgenic tobacco lines grown 14 days under PSI or PSII light sources were treated with inhibitors in the same way directly before the respective light switch to PSII or PSI light. The DBMIB treatment was repeated every 3–4 h during the last 96 h of experimentation. Stock solutions of DCMU were 10 mm in 50% ethanol and of DBMIB were 100 mm in 10% Me2SO in ethanol. The different inhibitor concentrations were prepared by dilution in sterile water directly prior use. In vivo Chla fluorescence parameters were measured with a pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer (PAM101/103, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Mustard seedlings were positioned solely under the emitter/detector unit, and tobacco seedlings were set together as a dense population on a Petri dish prior to the measurements. After dark acclimation (8–10 min) the measuring beam was turned on, and minimal fluorescence (Fo) was determined. Then leaves were exposed to a 500-ms flash of saturating white light (6000 microeinsteins) to determine maximal fluorescence (Fm), and the Fv/Fm ratio was calculated. Subsequently leaves were illuminated with 100 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 of actinic red light of 600 nm (Walz 102-R). Fluorescence was recorded in the saturation pulse mode by the application of saturating flashes every 30 s to determine maximal fluorescence of illuminated leaves (Fm′) until a stable fluorescence level (Ft) was reached. Actinic light was switched off, and far-red light (Walz 102-FR) was turned on to oxidize the electron transport chain and to determine minimal fluorescence (Fo′) in the light-acclimated state. The steady-state fluorescence Fs was calculated as Ft − Fo′ = Fs. The fluorescence quenching parameter qP (photochemical quenching) was calculated as qP = (Fm′ − Fs)/(Fm′ − Fo) (49Schreiber U. Schliwa U. Bilger W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). The effective quantum yield of PSII (φPSII) was calculated as φPSII = (Fm′ − Fs)/Fm′ (50Genty B. Briantais J.-M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 87-92Crossref Scopus (6999) Google Scholar). Plants were harvested under the respective growth light and kept on ice, and Chl concentrations were determined after grinding the material in liquid nitrogen and extracting the pigments with 80% buffered acetone (51Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chla and b were calculated according to Porraet al. (52Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). GUS activities in transgenic lines were determined by a standard protocol described by Lübberstedtet al. (48Lübberstedt T. Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 100 mg of fresh plant material was homogenized in an Eppendorf tube, and insoluble particles were removed by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C. The GUS activities were determined three times from each extract and expressed as pmol of 4-methylumbelliferone accumulation/min/g fresh weight. The acclimation of higher plants to light sources favoring either PSI or PSII can be monitored easily by determination of the Chl a/bratio, which represents a rough estimate of changes in PS stoichiometry (cf. Ref. 34Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A.N. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar). Tobacco seedlings were grown under PSI and PSII light (PSI and PSII plants) for 14 days, which resulted in an acclimation (Fig. 1A,1st acclimation) to the respective illumination conditions as indicated by a low Chl a/b ratio for PSI plants and a high ratio for PSII plants (Fig. 1A). A shift of the seedlings to the other light source forces the plants to acclimate to the new illumination conditions (Fig. 1A,2nd acclimation). Such shifts were shown to induce state transitions (34Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A.N. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar) and to influence the redox state of the PQ pool (53Tullberg A. Alexciev K. Pfannschmidt T. Allen J.F. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A shift from PSI to PSII light results in a more reduced PQ pool (Fig.1A, reduction signal), whereas a shift from PSII to PSI light induces a more oxidized state of PQ (Fig. 1A,oxidation signal). 96 h after the light shift, tobacco seedlings are completely acclimated to the new light conditions. This process occurs fast at the beginning (half-time 24 h) and significantly slower toward the end of the treatment. In vivo Chl a fluorescence measurements with fully acclimated tobacco plants confirm differences in the photosynthetic electron transport efficiency, which result from the different acclimations. Representative Chl fluorescence induction curves of PSI and PSII light-acclimated tobacco obtained by standard pulse amplitude-modulated fluorescence measurements (Fig. 1B) demonstrate a higher level in steady-state fluorescence Fs in PSI plants when compared with PSII plants. A more detailed analysis of photosynthetic parameters is given in TableI. Mustard, for which changes in PS stoichiometry in response to the same PSI or PSII light sources have been described (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 34Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A.N. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar), were used as a control. Both PSI and PSII plants show no significant changes in the maximal quantum yield after acclimation to the respective other light sources. In addition, the Fv/Fm value of both species is between 0.80 and 0.84 under all conditions tested, which is typical for dark-acclimated, healthy, and unstressed plants. However, the Fs/Fm ratio is high in PSI plants and decreases after acclimation to PSII light; the opposite reaction was observed in PSII plants after acclimation to PSI light. As a consequence the reduction state of the first electron acceptor of PSII, QA, expressed as 1 − qP, is significantly higher in PSI and PSII→PSI plants than in PSII and PSI→PSII plants. The Fs/Fm ratio is also regarded as a rough measure for the PQ redox state (30Oswald O. Martin T. Dominy P.J. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and our data indicate that it is more reduced in PSI and PSII→PSI-plants than in PSII and PSI→PSII plants. In contrast, the effective quantum yield, φPSII, is higher in PSII plants than in PSI plants and changes accordingly after a shift of the seedlings to the respective other light source. Taken together, these data indicate a limited electron transport capacity in PSI and PSII→PSI plants in comparison with the capacity measured in PSII and PSI→PSII plants. This is consistent with results from mustard; the PSII/PSI ratio is high after acclimation to PSI light and low after acclimation to PSII light (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 34Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A.N. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F.

Values represent means of 3–5 different plants out of three independent experiments (n = 9 − 15, ±S.E. is given). Photosynthetic parameters and measurements are described under “Experimental Procedures.” To analyze the putative impact of chloroplast redox signals on the expression of the nuclear PSI genes PETH,PSAF, PSAD, and PETE, transgenic tobacco lines harboring the PSI promoter::GUS gene fusions were grown under PSI or PSII light (Fig.2). The PETH promoter showed the same activity under all light sources tested. In contrast, thePSAF promoter exhibited higher activity in PSII light than in PSI light. 4 days under PSII light stimulates the promoter activity to the level detectable in continuous PSII light; however, no reduction in the activity was observed after a PSII→I light shift. ThePSAD promoter behaves similarly except that it exhibits lower activity under control white light. Similarly, thePETE promoter shows low activity under PSI light, high activity under PSII light, and activation after a PSI→II light shift. Furthermore, in contrast to the other lines, the GUS activity declined after a PSII→I light shift. Thus, at least three different response patterns to chloroplast redox signals can be distinguished. Sucrose has been shown to repress photosynthesis gene expression (54Smeekens S. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 2000; 51: 49-81Crossref Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and to interact with chloroplast redox signals (30Oswald O. Martin T. Dominy P.J. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because we grew seedlings on a medium containing 1.35% sucrose, we tested a possible role of sucrose by transferring seedlings to a sucrose-free medium before shifting them to the other light regime. The GUS activity was determined after 96 h. We found no qualitative changes; however, in general the GUS activities were 20–30% lower on the sugar-free medium (data not shown). Thus we conclude that sucrose has no effect on the light quality-dependent redox signals under our conditions. The electron transport inhibitors DCMU and DBMIB inhibit electron flow before and behind the PQ pool, respectively, thus resulting in the oxidation or reduction of it (55Trebst A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 675-715Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We sprayed these inhibitors exogenously onto the seedlings to show a coupling of the expression of PSI genes in the nucleus to the photosynthetic electron transport. Initially, we determined the optimal inhibitor concentrations by adjusting them such that their effects match the observed effects of the light sources on the Chl fluorescence parameters (Fig. 3). Treatment with DCMU (10 and 40 μm) resulted in a decrease in the φPSII value within 15 min. After 4 and 96 h these values decreased slightly, presumably because of a delayed inhibitory effect caused by the penetration of the substance. Detailed dose-response analyses uncovered that a concentration of 10 μm DCMU results in a reduction of electron transport, which is identical to the effect of a PSII→PSI light shift. In addition, a DBMIB concentration of 25 μm caused a similar effect as a PSI→PSII redox signal; however, the component is labile, and the photosynthetic parameters could only be maintained over the 96-h period when DBMIB was reapplied every 3–4 h. Spraying of control plants with the solvent alone had no effect on the photosynthetic electron flow or the expression of the reporter genes when compared with untreated plants (data not shown). With regard to the redox state of the PQ pool, we used the inhibitors as a reduction (DBMIB) or oxidation (DCMU) signal itself or as antagonists to the respective light-induced redox signals (Fig.4). The tobacco lines harboring thePETH promoter construct did not respond to any of the inhibitor treatments (data not shown), which is consistent with the results obtained with the light regimes. The other three promoter constructs responded to the inhibitor treatments, however, in a differential way. In all instances, DCMU inhibited the promoter activation by a reduction signal of PSII light on PSI plants. In addition, the DCMU alone down-regulated the promoter activity ofPSAD, PSAF, and PETE in PSII plants. Thus expression of these genes is coupled to photosynthetic electron transport in chloroplasts. The promoter activity of PSAD andPSAF is not down-regulated by PSI light in PSII plants, which is in contrast to the results obtained for PETE(compare with Fig. 2). The application of DBMIB in co-action with PSI light resulted in a down-regulation of PSAD andPSAF promoter activity. In contrast, the down-regulation ofPETE promoter activity by the PSI light-induced oxidation signal was inhibited to over 50% by the DBMIB treatment. Application of the drug alone on PSI plants, however, resulted in no significant reaction in all three cases. These data indicate that the promoter activity of PETE is controlled by the redox state of the PQ pool, whereas PSAD and PSAF gene expression is redox-controlled; however, a clear initiator component within the chloroplast could not be identified so far.Figure 4Effects of electron transport inhibitors in interaction with PS-specific light sources on PSI promoter activities. Growth conditions and inhibitor treatments were as indicated across the top. The identity of gene promoters is given inside the panels. The respective promoter activation of PSII light on PSI plants (compare with Fig. 1, reduction signal) was arbitrarily set to 100%, and changes in promoter utilization induced by switches between light sources and inhibitor treatments were expressed in percent. The values represent the mean of three independent experiments performed with 3–4 parallels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We demonstrate that chloroplast redox signals participate in light regulation of nuclear PSI genes by using PS-specific light sources originally established for mustard (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that tobacco seedlings represent a useful model organism for such studies. In addition, this is the first report describing the expression of nuclear PSI genes during photosystem stoichiometry adjustment. We show that redox signals previously found to control gene expression within chloroplasts also control gene expression in the nucleus. The four promoters analyzed in this study showed three different responses to the light sources: no response (PETH), activation (PSAF and PSAD), and reversible activation/inactivation (PETE). An inhibitor assay with DCMU and DBMIB confirmed the coupling of the promoter response to photosynthetic electron transport. The inhibitor effects were optimized such that they are comparable with the effects of the light sources and that they persist over the whole period of experimentation,i.e. 96 h. The pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer measurements demonstrate that the inhibitor concentrations mimic the light effects on photosynthetic electron transport. The optimal concentrations (10 μm DCMU and 25 μm DBMIB) differed from those used by Karpinski et al. (28Karpinski S. Escobar C. Karpinska B. Creissen G. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar); they used 4 and 14 μm, which were effective after infiltration intoArabidopsis leaf discs. Because we sprayed the inhibitors on the cotyledons, the effective concentrations within the tissue are not known, but they must be considerably lower when compared with the concentration applied by the infiltration technique. 10 μm DCMU, for instance, completely inhibits electron transport when applied to isolated chloroplasts (data not shown). DBMIB is a light-labile compound, and we found a complete loss of its inhibitory effect after 4 h. In liquid algae cell cultures its active time was reported to be between 6 and 24 h (56Durnford D.G. Prasil O. Escoubas J.-M. Falkowski P.G. Method Enzymol. 1998; 297: 220-234Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and inSynechocystis PCC6803 cultures a decline of 60% in inhibition of O2 evolution was reported after 1 h (57Alfonso M. Perewoska I. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the optimal concentration depends on the application and organism. We maintained the DBMIB effect by repeated application of the drug, comparable with a recent study withChlamydobotrys stellata (58Kovacs L. Wiessner W. Kis M. Nagy F. Mende D. Demeter S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 65: 231-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The PETH promoter construct did not respond to any applied redox signal. This lack of response is not caused by the relatively low expression of the construct, because the same transgenic lines showed clear induction of the reporter gene when dark-grown seedlings were transferred to light (20Kusnetsov V. Bolle C. Lübberstedt T. Sopory S. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 631-639PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating the sensitivity of the construct for light regulation in general. Responsiveness to chloroplast redox signals could be located at a different level than transcription during PETH gene expression. Further experiments will show if such responses exist. In contrast thePSAD, PSAF, and PETE promoter constructs are activated by PSII light-generated reduction signals that can be blocked by a DCMU-generated oxidation signal. This oxidation signal alone is also able to reduce the activity of all three promoters, demonstrating that they can be regulated by both reduction and oxidation signals. A PSI light-induced oxidation signal reduced thePETE promoter-driven GUS activity but had no influence on the GUS activities driven by the PSAD and PSAFpromoters. DBMIB treatment had only an effect in co-action with the PSI light-generated oxidation signal but not alone. In the cases ofPSAD and PSAF this results in a decrease of the GUS activities as observed after DCMU treatment. This suggests that these two promoters respond to redox signals originating between the PQ pool and PSI or to the electron transport capacity in general. In contrast, because DBMIB prevents the PETE promoter deactivation induced by PSI light, the redox state of the PQ pool seems to regulate this promoter. The different response pattern of the promoters can be caused by different sensitivities to chloroplast redox signals. Activation by a dark/light transition of seedlings is a strong environmental signal and represents an off/on mechanism. PSI and PSII light-induced redox signals are a different type of environmental signal, and responses to them represent a modulation mechanism under persistent illumination. The additive effect of PSI light and DBMIB onPSAF and PSAD promoter activity suggests the existence of a threshold value in these cases that may be not reached when PSI light or DBMIB suppress electron transport alone. The signaling redox components remain unclear; however, the inhibitor experiments demonstrate that PSAF and PSADpromoter activity is clearly connected to the photosynthetic electron transport. The chloroplast redox signals represent a new facet in the light regulation of nuclear photosynthesis genes. Results with dark-grown peaLIP1 and Arabidopsis COP1-4 mutants imply that the plastid-derived signal(s) is light-independent and not coupled to photosynthesis (13Sullivan J.A. Gray J.C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The chloroplast redox signals investigated in this study are both light-dependent and coupled to photosynthesis, thus representing a new type of plastid-derived signal. Physiologically, this light quality-dependent regulation of PSAD,PSAF, and PETE makes sense. The gene products ofPSAD and PSAF are structural components of PSI. Thus, chloroplast redox signals adjust the expression of nuclear PSI genes to the overall need of the photosynthetic apparatus and might be a course-regulated process. The fine-tuning of PS stoichiometry adjustment is then achieved by the rapid and direct redox-regulated synthesis of the PsaA and PsaB reaction center subunits (33Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar), which occurs in the same time scale as state transitions (59Allen J.F. Pfannschmidt T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 1402: 1351-1359Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, plastocyanin is not an integrated component of PSI, and the fine tuning of its expression might occur differently, in particular because this polypeptide operates as an electron transfer component between the two photosystems. The present study provides new insights into chloroplast-nuclear signaling. Our current investigations focus on the impact of redox signals on other nuclear genes, the velocity of signal transduction in comparison to inner chloroplast redox signals, and the way how these signals are transduced.

GABAA receptors composed of α and β subunits differ from receptors that additionally contain the γ subunit in regard to Zn2+ and benzodiazepine sensitivity and to single channel conductance (9Draguhn A.

Although receptors made from α, β, and γ subunits are thought to be pentameric (16Backus K.H. Arigoni M. Drescher U. Scheurer L. Malherbe P. Möhler H. Benson J.A.

Unitary dose-response curves for αβ receptors, single IC50 values for Zn2+ inhibition, and unitary single channel properties (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

A tetrameric rather than a pentameric structure has been proposed as one of several explanations for the lower average single channel conductance for the αβ receptor as compared with the αβγ receptor (22Angelotti T.P. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hevers W. Lüddens H. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 35-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). A powerful way to gain insight into the arrangement of subunits in a multimeric channel is to predetermine the alignment of subunits by gene fusion and to analyze whether the linked subunits are able to form functional channels. This approach was first successfully applied to potassium channels (24Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1990; 345: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 25Liman E.R. Tytgat J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23742-23745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later it was also used to study subunit stoichiometry of other ion channels, e.g. a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (27Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2667-2679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the mechanosensitive channel MscL ofEscherichia coli (28Sukharev S.I. Schroeder M.J. McCaslin D.R. J. Membr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7627-7630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All these channels have their N and C termini on the cytoplasmic side so that the linkage occurs intracellularly. Up to now it has only been used once with limited success in the field of ligand-gated ion channels, which have both C and N termini on the extracellular side. Applying it to a GABAA receptor, Imet al. (30Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) prepared a tandem construct where the α6 subunit is linked to the β2 subunit via 10 glutamine residues and studied functional expression in HEK293 cells. The connection between the two subunits included the signal sequence of the β2 subunit of 24-amino acid residues in length. The consequences of such a signal sequence in the middle of a protein are difficult to predict. We constructed here tandem constructs of α1 and β2 subunits for the first time in both arrangements α1-β2 and β2-α1. We determined the minimal length of the linkers necessary for the formation of functional channels. The constructs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes either alone or in combination with single subunits to establish subunit stoichiometry and arrangement of GABAAreceptors. We provide novel information on the architecture of GABAA receptors. Several α-β tandem cDNAs encoding a single polypeptide αβ with linkers of differing length were established in the pCMV vector. The tandem constructs consisted of the modified rat α1 subunit (31Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Lüddens H. Möhler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) including its signal sequence at the N terminus and the mature rat β2 subunit at the C terminus. The modified α1 subunit differs from the original rat subunit by insertion of one amino acid residue. Insertion of this residue confers reactivity to the monoclonal antibody bd24 (32Häring P. Stähli C. Schoch P. Takacs B. Staehelin T. Möhler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Lüddens H. Möhler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which was essential for Western blot analysis (shown in the “Results” section). The α1 subunit was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pCHAI vector as template and the primers CATAGAAGACACCGGGACGA as a vector-specific primer andXTTGATGTGGTGTGGGGGCTTT as a gene-specific primer. The latter was complementary to the last codons before the stop codon and had the first part of the sequence coding for the respective linker attached (X). The β2 subunit was amplified using pCB2 as template and the primers ACTGACACACATTCCACAGCT as vector-specific primer andYCAGAGTGTCAATGACCCTAGT as a gene-specific primer. The latter was complementary to the first codons of the sequence of the mature protein and had the second part of the sequence coding for the respective linker attached (Y). The obtained fragments contained the open reading frame of the gene and some additional vector-derived sequence preceding or succeeding. The fragments were cut in the vector-derived sequence by EcoRI or XbaI, respectively, to be ligated in a three-fragment ligation into the pCMV vector cut with EcoRI and XbaI. The sequence of the resulting plasmids was verified. In the α-0-β tandem, the last amino acid residue of the α1 subunit is directly attached to the first amino acid residue of the mature β2 subunit. In the other tandems the following amino acid sequences are present between the N-terminal α1 subunit and the C-terminal β2 subunit: α-7-β, Q7; α-10-β, Q10. The β-α tandem cDNAs were prepared similarly. The β subunit was amplified using CATAGAAGACACCGGGACGA as vector-specific and XGTTCACATAGTAAAGCCAATAGAC as gene-specific primer. The mature α subunit was amplified using ACTGACACACATTCCACAGCT as vector-specific and YCAGCCGTCATTACAAGATGAA as gene-specific primer. The linkers introduced into the different β-α tandems are the following: β10α, Q10; β15α, Q5A3PAQ5; β20α, Q5(A3P)2A2Q5; β23α, Q3(Q2A3PA)2AQ5. A long sequence of consecutive glutamine residues might exhaust the respective tRNA pool during protein synthesis and therefore lead to an early termination of the synthesized protein. Therefore, other amino acid residues were introduced. Alanine and proline residues were chosen for their properties to form no distinct secondary structure elements. Capped cRNAs were synthesized (Ambion, Austin, Texas) from the linearized pCMV vectors containing the different tandem constructs, the single α1, β2, and γ2 subunits, and from the vector pVA2580 (33Kuhn F.J.

A poly(A) tail of about 400 residues was added to each transcript using yeast poly(A) polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The concentration of the cRNA was quantified on a formaldehyde gel using Radiant Red stain (Bio-Rad) for visualization of the RNA and known concentrations of RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) as the standard on the same gel. cRNA combinations α1/β2/Na, α-β/Na, β-α/Na, α-β/β-α/Na, α-β/α1/Na, β-α/α1/Na, α-β/β-α/α1/Na, α-β/β2/Na and β-α/β2/Na, α-β/γ2/Na, and β-α/γ2/Na were precipitated in ethanol/isoamyl alcohol (19:1) and stored at −20 °C. For injection, the alcohol was removed, and the cRNAs were dissolved in water. Isolation of oocytes from the frogs, culturing of the oocytes, injection of cRNA, and defolliculation were done as described earlier (34Sigel E. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of the cRNA solution. For cRNA combinations of α1 and β2 subunits only, the cRNA solution contained each subunit or tandem construct at 75 nm. In the case of coexpression of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits, the cRNA solution contained α1 and β2 subunits or the respective tandem construct at 10 nm and the γ2 subunit at 50 nm. The voltage-gated sodium channel was always added to a concentration of 40 nm. The injected oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.34 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 18 °C for 2 days before the measurements. All measurements were done in medium containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 90 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 at a holding potential of −80 mV. For the determination of maximal current amplitudes 1 mm GABA (Fluka, Switzerland) was applied for 20 s. Sodium currents were determined by a potential jump from a holding potential of −100 to −15 mV (Fig. 1). The GABA-evoked peak current amplitude was standardized to the co-expressed sodium current amplitude of the same oocyte. The mean standardized current amplitude of at least three oocytes per subunit combination was then compared with the mean standardized wild type current amplitude. Current stimulation by diazepam was determined at a GABA concentration evoking 5% of the maximal current amplitude in combination with 1 μm diazepam (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Oocytes were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pepstatin, leustatin, antipain, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, each at 5 μg/ml) using a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenate was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (HybondECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Towbin et al. (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bands were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tandem cDNAs were constructed that consisted of the α1 and the β2 subunit of the GABAA receptor in both arrangements, α1-β2 and β2-α1 (Fig.2A). The N-terminal α1 (β2) subunit was taken in its precursor form to ensure insertion into the membrane mediated by the signal sequence. The C-terminal β2 (α1) subunit was depleted of its signal sequence because it is difficult to predict what consequences this stretch of 24 (27) mostly hydrophobic amino acid residues in the middle of the new fusion protein will have. To bridge the distance between the C terminus of the α1 (β2) subunit and the N terminus of the β2 (α1) subunit, we introduced synthetic linkers of different length to determine the shortest possible linker resulting in a functional fusion protein after expression in the Xenopus oocyte. Although the subunits of the GABAA receptor share the same topology and have a high sequence homology, they differ slightly in the number of amino acid residues after the fourth predicted transmembrane region at the C terminus as well as at the beginning of the N-terminal portion of the subunit. Therefore, linkers of different length were tested for the α1-β2 and β2-α1 construct separately. The function of the different tandem constructs was assessed after expression in Xenopus oocytes, either alone (Fig.2B, I and II), in combination with each other (Fig. 2B, III), or in combination with single α1 (Fig. 2B, IV and V) or β2 (Fig.1B, VI and VII) subunits. Expression of tandem constructs alone is predicted to yield receptors composed of an even number of subunits, whereas combination of tandem constructs with single subunits can additionally result in receptors with an uneven number of subunits. The first criterion for normal channel function was a GABA-evoked maximal current amplitude comparable with that of receptors made from single α1 and β2 subunits, the wild type receptor. These current amplitudes amounted to 1.5–8 μA. Expression of either α1 or β2 subunits alone failed to produce detectable currents. To compensate for differences in the expression level between the individual oocytes, GABA-induced current amplitudes were standardized to the current amplitude of the co-expressed voltage-gated sodium channel in the same oocyte. Constructs were examined for standardized maximal current amplitudes (Imax) and the apparent affinity for GABA (Ka). Only receptors performing very similarly to the wild type receptor regarding Imax andKa were considered fully functional. To evaluate whether the expressed tandem constructs were intact or subjected to proteolysis we analyzed the newly formed GABAA receptors by Western blotting. The monoclonal antibody bd24 against the N-terminal of the α1 subunit (31Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Lüddens H. Möhler H. Seeburg P.H. J.

A. 1985; 82: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was used. Fig. 3 shows that single α1 subunits of wild type receptors migrate at 50 kDa (lane 1). This specific band is missing in the α-10-β/β combination (lane 2), thus indicating the absence of monomeric α1 subunit and, therefore, of significant proteolysis of the linker. A very faint unspecific signal at the 50-kDa position is also seen for non-injected oocytes (lane 3). As indicated by a strong signal, the α-10-β tandem construct migrates at 120–140 kDa. The absence of any additional band with bd24 reactivity also excludes proteolysis elsewhere in the construct. A peptide containing bd24 reactivity that is larger than 29 kDa would have been seen. The β-23-α tandem construct could not be detected because the epitope for the antibody seems to include the free N terminus of the α1 subunit, which is blocked by the linker in this construct. The small quantity of channel expressed prevented detection with another antibody due to insufficient sensitivity. As described below, we also have functional evidence for the fact that proteolysis of both tandem constructs can be excluded. If the α1-β2 tandem construct was co-expressed with single β2 subunits, functional channels were formed provided the linker was long enough (Fig.4). With no additional linker but only the 13 amino acid residues after the fourth transmembrane region of the α1 subunit (α-0-β) connected to the N terminus of the β2 subunit, no current was detectable in injected oocytes. With a linker of 7 residues in length (α-7-β), we found standardized maximal current amplitudes that remained below those expressed from wild type receptors, whereas the tandem construct with a linker of 10 residues (α-10-β) resulted in similar standardized maximal current amplitudes. The dose-response curves of the α-7-β and the α-10-β tandem constructs were close to that of the wild type receptors (Fig. 5A). The two constructs resulted in channels with similar Kavalues of 9 ± 3 and 11 ± 2 μm, respectively, comparable with the combination of single α and β subunits with aKa of 9 ± 2 μm, pointing to an unchanged apparent affinity for GABA despite the covalent linkage.Figure 5Dose-response curves of tandem constructs co-expressed with single β2 subunits.A, the α-β tandem constructs with linkers of 7- or 10-amino acid residues in length resulted in channels with an unchanged apparent affinity for GABA. B, channels from the β-α tandem construct with a linker of 20-amino acid residues show a slightly reduced apparent affinity for GABA, whereas for channels from the construct with a linker of 23 amino acid residues, the apparent affinity is close to the one of the combination of single α and β subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the right panel of Fig. 4 the results of the analogue examination for the β2-α1 constructs are shown. There was almost no detectable current when we combined the constructs with linkers of 10- and 15-amino acid residues with single β2 subunits. A tandem construct with a linker of 20 residues produced receptors with standardized maximal current amplitudes similar to those of wild type receptors. However, the dose-response curve (Fig. 5B) was shifted to the right, i.e. the apparent affinity for GABA was reduced. With 64 ± 33 μm, theKa was about 7-fold higher than that of the wild type receptors. A tandem construct containing a linker of 23 residues also reached standardized maximal current amplitudes similar to wild type receptors. The GABA dose-response curve for these channels (Fig.5B) is characterized by a Ka of 20 ± 2 μm, which is close to the wild type receptor, with aKa of 9 ± 2 μm. The two functional tandem constructs α-10-β and β-23-α were analyzed further. When either the α-10-β or the β-23-α constructs were expressed alone, we hardly detected GABA evoked currents (Fig.6A). The co-expressed voltage-gated sodium channel showed the same expression levels in oocytes expressing tandem constructs or wild type receptors. Thus, the absence of RNase activity and the capability of protein expression in the individual oocyte was confirmed. Moreover we exclude proteolysis for either construct because proteolysis of the linker would in each case liberate α1 and β2 subunits, which in turn should result in functional channels. When α-10-β and β-23-α constructs were expressed in the same oocyte, the standardized maximal current amplitudes remained below 10% of the wild type current (Fig.6C). These results led to the conclusion that tetrameric receptors of the arrangement αβαβ, which is equal to the arrangement βαβα (see Fig. 2B, I andII) or of the arrangement αββα (see Fig.2B, III) do not correspond to a functional receptor made from single α and β subunits. The tandem constructs α-10-β and β-23-α were also coexpressed with single α1 subunits and analyzed for maximal current amplitudes. Almost no current was detected upon application of GABA (Fig.6B), whereas sodium currents were expressed in the same oocytes. The addition of a single α1 subunit to the combination of both tandem constructs α-10-β and β-23-α resulted in slightly elevated maximal current amplitudes as compared with the combination of α-10-β with β-23-α (Fig. 6C), but they were still far below those of the wild type receptors. This indicates an inefficient formation of functional channels in this case. Fig. 6D shows that both the α-10-β and the β-23-α tandem constructs could be complemented with single β2 subunits to form functional channels. This result matches the theoretical consideration that both tandem constructs yield the same arrangement when complemented with a single β2 subunit (compare Fig.2B, VI and VII). When the α-10-β tandem construct is complemented with a single γ2 subunit, the standardized maximal current amplitude amounts to about 26% compared with the wild type receptor (Fig.6E). Submaximal current amplitudes can be stimulated by diazepam by 134 ± 8% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) (not shown). The β-23-α tandem construct complemented with a single γ subunit results in functional channels with standardized maximal current amplitudes similar to wild type receptors (Fig. 6E). Submaximal current amplitudes of these receptors are also stimulated by diazepam by 360 ± 10% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) (not shown). In this study we have demonstrated the feasibility of covalent subunit linkage α1-β2 and β2-α1 for the GABAAreceptor channel. We have also established the minimal linker lengths required for functional expression. Our results strongly suggest a pentameric structure of the GABAA receptor composed of α1 and β2 subunits and exclude a tetramer. The technique described here may also be applied to the study of other ligand-gated ion channels. Tandem linkage of subunits is a powerful strategy to extract information about stoichiometry and arrangement of multimeric proteins. This approach has first been applied to the study of potassium channels (24Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1990; 345: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Later, Im et al. (30Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) made a tandem construct consisting of the GABAA receptor subunit precursors α6 and β2. They found that their α6-β2 tandem construct alone failed to produce functional GABA channels, but combination with either single α6 or γ2 subunits, but not β2 subunits, restored receptor function after expression in HEK293 cells. Functional expression was, however, very low in all these cases and did not exceed 0.2 nA even for the wild type subunit combination α6 and β2 (30Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present tandem constructs we omitted the signal sequence stretch of the second subunit, which might have unpredictable effects one.g. protein folding, insertion of the protein into the membrane, subunit assembly, or proteolysis of the connection between the subunits. We linked the α1 and the β2 subunits of the GABAA receptor in both arrangements and expressed the resulting tandem constructs α-β and β-α inXenopus oocytes. They were both shown to result in functional channels when complemented with β2 subunits. When the tandem constructs were expressed either alone or in combination with each other, no functional receptors were formed. Therefore, our most important conclusion here is that the GABAA receptor made from α1 and β2 subunits is not composed of an even number of subunits. We can exclude tetrameric receptors of the subunit arrangements αβαβ from the expression of each of the tandem constructs alone and the arrangement αββα from their co-expression. Only arrangements of a 1:1 stoichiometry of α and β subunits have been tested here because stoichiometries for αβ receptors of 3:1 or 1:3 have been shown to be unlikely (19Kellenberger S. Eckenstein S. Baur R. Malherbe P. Buhr A. Sigel E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Gorrie G.H. Vallis Y. Stephenson A. Whitfield J. Browning B. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6587-6596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings confirm the conclusion drawn from Western blot analysis that proteolytic cleavage in the sequence of the linker (Fig.7A) does not occur to a significant extent. The participation of only one subunit of the tandem construct in the functional receptor (Fig. 7B) can also be excluded. If either one or both of these events had occurred, the formation of functional pentameric receptors from the tandem constructs alone would have been observed. The observation that both tandem constructs form functional channels in combination with single β2 subunits but fail to do so in combination with single α1 subunits supports the view that a receptor made from α and β subunits is a pentamer composed of two α and three β subunits. This had also been proposed based on immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells expressing α1β3 receptors (18Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A receptor stoichiometry of three α6 and two β2 subunits has also been suggested (30Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This might indicate that the subunit stoichiometry of an αβ receptor depends on the specific subunit isoforms expressed together and/or on differences in the expression systems used. A further aim of this study was the design of optimal linkers between the subunits. The linkage of two subunits should position both next to each other in the receptor. When no functional channels can be detected, the forced neighborhood of the two subunits either prohibits proper channel formation, or the linker is too short. When, in contrast, functional channels can be expressed from linked subunits, their neighborhood may be assumed unless the linker is very long. In this case the two linked subunits do not necessarily locate next to each other in the receptor multimer. It is then possible for another subunit to position itself between the two linked subunits. We therefore determined the minimal linker length for both, the α-β and the β-α tandem constructs, necessary for the formation of functional channels. We found this length to be 10 and 23 amino acid residues, respectively. Shorter linkers altered the apparent affinity for GABA or the maximal current amplitude of the channel, probably by distorting the conformation of the resulting receptor. It should be noted that the α-7-β and β-20-α tandem constructs, which have linkers that are 3 amino acid residues or about 11 Å shorter, performed nearly as well as wild type receptors. Therefore, the optimal linker length may be somewhat shorter than 10 or 23 amino acid residues, respectively. In our calculation of the actual linker length we included the synthetic linker as well as the C- and N-terminal elongations of the respective subunits (TableI). We assumed an extended conformation of both with 3.6-Å per amino acid residue. In this case the total length of the subunit connection may be estimated to be maximally 83 and 97 Å in the α-β and the β-α tandem construct, respectively, which might be diminished by the existence of secondary structure elements. For the reasons mentioned above, we assume that the actual linker length is substantially shorter. It is of interest to estimate whether these respective linker lengths allow interspersing of an additional subunit. We can consider the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor an appropriate model for the structure of the GABAA receptor, as they both belong to the same superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. The three-dimensional structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been resolved to 4.6 Å (37Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). All the members of the superfamily share a high sequence homology and the same topology, and it is assumed that they also have a very similar overall shape. From the dimensions of the receptor we can estimate the minimal length of a peptide passing along the perimeter of one subunit to be about at least 54 Å if the N terminus is located at the membrane surface. This minimal length of 54 Å is unrealistic for the following reasons. First, the receptor surface is certainly not smooth, but irregular. Second, the N terminus of the second subunit of the tandem construct is not necessarily located at the membrane surface as the beginning of the connection is predicted to be. Most importantly, location of either the N terminus or the C terminus away from the opposed edges of the linked subunits would both result in a corresponding increase of the required minimal length. Comparing the maximal length of the subunit connections and the minimal length such a connection must have to surround an additional subunit and the restrictions made to these values, we consider it unlikely that another subunit is interspersing, but we cannot entirely exclude this possibility.Table ICalculation of the actual linker lengthProperties of the linkersNumber of amino acid residuesα-ββ-αC-terminal part of the first subunit predicted to extrude from the membrane131Length of the synthetic linker1023N-terminal elongation of the second subunit relative to the β2 subunit03Total number of residues2327 Open table in a new tab In initial experiments we combined the two tandem constructs α-10-β and β-23-α each with single γ subunits. In the case of the β-23-α tandem construct, the resulting channel exhibited the same maximal current amplitude as wild type receptors, whereas in the case of the α-10-β tandem construct, maximal current amplitudes remained below that of wild type receptors. The fact that both tandem constructs α-β and β-α resulted in channels sensitive to diazepam was very surprising. The binding site for benzodiazepines is thought to be located at the αγ subunit interface (38Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This defined interface is lost in one of the two arrangements I and II shown in Fig.7C. It is possible that the βγ subunit interface can take over benzodiazepine binding properties, as it has been observed that receptors expressed from only β and γ subunits are sensitive to benzodiazepines (39Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Möhler H. Malherbe P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). An alternative and more likely interpretation is based on a rearrangement of one of the tandem constructs. We suggest this rearrangement for the following reason. In the presence of γ subunits, receptors containing α and β subunits alone are no more formed (23Hevers W. Lüddens H. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 35-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), but the γ subunit seems to induce a subunit assembly leading to αβγ receptors (40Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 18Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the tandem constructs with the γ subunits might, thus, start with the formation of proper αγ or γβ subunit interfaces. Then the second subunit of the tandem would be integrated. In the case of the β-23-α tandem construct this happens very efficiently, resulting in channels with current amplitudes similar to wild type receptors. In contrast, the α-10-β tandem constructs have to reorient to adopt a β-α arrangement (Fig. 7C, II). The linker might now be too short and disturb the proper conformation of the subunits. It is also conceivable that the rearrangement proceeds inefficiently. Therefore, the maximal current amplitude is lower; nevertheless the proper binding sites for GABA and benzodiazepines, both, seem to be present. Thus, we propose the subunit arrangement βαγβα for the α1β2γ2 receptor. A rearrangement as proposed for the tandem construct α-β in the presence of a γ2 subunit would not result in additional subunit arrangements in the case of a tetrameric receptor but would add another possible subunit sequence in pentameric receptors composed of only α and β subunits. If one of the tandem constructs in Fig.2B, VI, reorients, an arrangement, ααβββ, which is not shown, will be formed. This additional arrangement can not be excluded from our data. The preparation of triple constructs containing the γ subunit and its co-expression with the β-α tandem construct will allow the study of the effect of single point mutations exclusively in one defined α or β subunit. For topological reasons it can be safely predicted that subunits linked in a triple construct are not able to rearrange. It will also be possible to study the positional effect of different subunit isoforms in the same receptor pentamer. In summary, we have demonstrated the feasibility of covalent subunit linkage for a ligand-gated ion channel. For the first time we have established the minimal linker lengths required for functional expression. Our results strongly suggest a pentameric structure of the α1β2 GABAA receptor and exclude a tetramer. This work provides a new perspective for the study of subunit arrangement also of other ligand-gated ion channels. We thank Dr. V. Niggli for carefully reading the manuscript."

IP3kins are members of the inositol polyphosphate kinase family, which consists of proteins sharing a conserved C-terminal catalytic region (4Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Animal IP3kins are the only inositol polyphosphate kinases thought to be regulated by calcium, both via direct interaction with calmodulin and by phosphorylation by calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) (12Communi D.

Thomas S. High S. Griffiths G. D'Santos C. Cullen P. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, nothing is known about targeting mechanisms for isoform A in neurons. Based on purification of the bovine and rat brain enzyme, IP3kinA activity and protein have been described as cytosolic (17Takazawa K. Passareiro H. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical studies employing antibodies against the purified rat brain enzyme revealed IP3kinA to be very concentrated on membranes and throughout the cytosolic matrix of dendritic spines (7Yamada M. Kakita A. Mizuguchi M. Rhee S.G. Kim S.U. Ikuta F. Brain Res. 1993; 606: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Go M. Uchida T. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Mailleux P. Onaya T. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 158: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the targeting of IP3kinA to the actin cytoskeleton in transfected HeLa cells and COS-7 cells and of endogenous IP3kinA to the dendritic spines of neurons is determined by the 66 N-terminal amino acids. We also observed a co-localization of IP3kinA and CaMKII isoforms in synaptically mature hippocampal cultures. This suggests that the association of F-actin and IP3kinA in hippocampus subserves a neuronal specific function of modulating highly localized intracellular calcium signals. Clone CP16 (21Takazawa K. Vandekerckhove J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), containing the full-length rat cDNA for IP3kinA, was used as a polymerase chain reaction template, and various primer sets were designed to amplify parts of the cDNA that were cloned into pEGFPC3 and -N1 vectors (CLONTECH) for expression as green fluorescent fusion proteins. All polymerase chain reaction was carried out as described previously (13Woodring P.J. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30447-30454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) in the presence of 10% Me2SO. The full open reading frame (aa 1–489) was amplified and cloned into pEGFPC3 with the following primer set: full sense (GAGAAAGTCCATGACCCTGCCCGGACACCCGAC) and full antisense (GAGAGGATCCTCATCTCTCAGCCAGGTTGGGC). The underlined regions depict HindIII and BamHI sites incorporated into the primers. All other primers contained the same 5′ GAGA sequence, HindIII/BamHI restriction sites, and as required contained added or deleted start or stop codons or extra nucleotides to preserve reading frame, according to the manufacturer's instructions. These primer sequences are as follows: (restriction sites and added start or stop codons not shown): aa 66–489, 66.sense (GTCCCTAACGGGCTCCCG), and full antisense, aa 1–33, full sense and 33.antisense (TCACTCCCCGACGCTCCGGCG); aa 34–66, 34.sense (CTGCGCCGCTCTTCGAAGCG) and 66.antisense (GACTTGTCCCCCACGCCGCTT); aa 1–66, full sense and 66.antisense; aa 34–459, 34.sense and full antisense; aa 109–489, 109.sense (TCGCACCTGCAGCAGCCA) and full antisense; aa 155–489, 155.sense (ACCAGCGAAGACGTGGGGCAG) and full antisense. Each of these constructs was tested in both the N-terminal and C-terminal GFP vectors to control for possible GFP-induced artifacts. Two of these constructs aa 1–489 and aa 66–489 were also cloned intoEcoRII/SalI sites of the pCMS-EGFP vector (CLONTECH) for expression without the GFP fusion attached. The open reading frame for rat γ-actin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA library made from hippocampal cultures (a gift of Dr. Hilmar Bading, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge) and cloned into pEGFPC3 at theHindIII/BamHI sites. All constructs were tested by restriction enzyme digest before use, and some (those used in the figures) were sequenced across the multicloning site to confirm identity and reading frame. Three Internet-based programs (nnPredict, SOPM, and PSA) were used to predict the secondary structure of the actin-association region of IP3kinA. These can be found at the BCM search launcher web site: searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/. The 1–66 actin association region (N66) of IP3kinA fused to the bacterial protein NusA was produced by subcloning into the pET43A vector (Novagen) at theBamHI/SalI sites. This vector also incorporates His6 before and after the multicloning site. A 1:50 dilution of Escherichia coli strain Rosetta BL21(DE3) (Novagen) harboring the construct was grown for 3 h at 37 °C followed by cooling to 18 °C and overnight induction in the presence of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The following day cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted in BugBuster reagent (Novagen) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cleared, soluble extract was mixed batchwise with Talon beads (CLONTECH), loaded into a column, and eluted with imidazole. Fractions containing purified protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, filtered, and then frozen as aliquots at −20 °C before use in co-sedimentation experiments. Actin co-sedimentation was carried out in actin binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, and 0.1 mm CaCl2), using F-actin purified from skeletal muscle acetone powder (a gift of John Kendrick-Jones, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) or from human platelets (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). NusA-N66 or NusA alone was mixed with various concentrations of F-actin and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h in an Airfuge (Beckman). Pellets were resuspended in the starting assay volume, and equal volumes of supernatants and pellets were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels; protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue. The F-actin binding curve was constructed by varying the concentration of skeletal muscle actin between 1.0 and 20 μm in the presence of a constant amount of NusA-N66 fusion protein (2.65 μm). Over this range of actin concentrations, the portion appearing in the pellet as F-actin varied between 39% at the lowest concentration and 79% at the highest. Because the effective F-actin concentration changes in this way, at each concentration of F-actin, we multiplied the concentration of actin added to the assay by the portion appearing in the pellet as F-actin to obtain the apparent F-actin concentration depicted on the binding curve. The risk of nonspecific trapping of protein in the pellet increases at high F-actin concentrations; however, even at the highest F-actin concentrations used, trapping of the truncated (non-F-actin binding) fusion protein fragments was negligible. Gels were dried and scanned, and then the density of the gel bands was determined using the gel-plotting macro of NIH image software (version 1.62). Only the largest (full-length) gel band for NusA-N66 was used for quantification. Curve fitting was done with KaleidaGraph software using the general form: y = m1·(M0 + m2). Hippocampal cultures were prepared from neonatal rats (age 12–24 h), as described previously (22Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanovic L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were dissociated with papain (Worthington), grown for 2 days in Neurobasal media with B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% horse serum, and then maintained thereafter in serum-free media for up to 5 weeks. Cerebellar granule cells were prepared by trypsin digestion of postnatal day 6–8 rat cerebella and then maintained as described for hippocampal cells, except that the KCl concentration in the media was increased to 25 mm and cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was present between 24 and 72 h after plating. Transfection of neurons was achieved with a modified calcium-phosphate technique (23Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that used a 1-h exposure of the cells to the DNA precipitate. Neurons were examined between 1 and 14 days after transfection. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by the same calcium-phosphate technique as for neurons, except that the exposure to the precipitate was for 8 h, with a 2-min glycerol shock at the end. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with the Fugene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HeLa and COS-7 cells were examined 1 day after transfection. We modified a published protocol (24Allison D.W. Chervin A.S. Gelfand V.I. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to extract soluble proteins and preserve the cytoskeleton. Twenty hours after transfection, HeLa cells or COS-7 cells plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 2.9 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl) containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ and 0.68 mmMg2+ and then incubated 5 min at room temperature in Brinkley reassembly buffer (BRB80, 80 mm Pipes/KOH, pH 6.8, 4% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing 1% Triton X-100. Cells were washed once in BRB80 without Triton X-100, fixed, and processed for microscopy as described below. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Hippocampal cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips for 5–35 days were washed twice with PBS containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ and 0.68 mm Mg2 followed by incubation in 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 30 min. All subsequent steps were carried out in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed briefly, and blocked for 1 h in 2% normal donkey serum, 2% fish skin gelatin (Sigma). Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h in various antibodies diluted in 2% donkey serum. Visualization was with affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3-coupled donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Fab fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). F-actin was visualized with Oregon Green 488- or Alexa 568-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were mounted on slides using Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes). Images of 1.5–1.8-μm confocal sections were captured on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a 63× objective. Before images of double-labeled cells were collected, the microscope pinholes were aligned with reference to a transfected neuron expressing GFP-IP3kinA and then double-stained with rabbit anti-IP3kinA (fluorescein isothiocyanate channel) and mouse anti-GFP (Cy-3 channel). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe, Mountain View, CA). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Adult rat forebrain was frozen on dry ice and then homogenized in ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4 containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine (each 1 mm), leupeptin, chymostatin, and antipain (each 1 μm). The homogenate was extracted for 30 min on a rotating wheel, followed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The extract (supernatant) was frozen at −70 °C. In some experiments, the thawed extract was centrifuged an additional time at 200,000 × g for 1 h before being used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation for one gel lane consisted of 150 μl of extract that was precleared for 1–2 h with 20 μl of packed protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before overnight incubation with 3 μl of IP3kinA antiserum or with 3 μl of normal rabbit serum. The next day beads were washed once in brain homogenization buffer without inhibitors containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, then twice in the same buffer without albumin, and then once in Tris-buffered saline before elution of beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were separated on 10% acrylamide minigels and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Following overnight incubation in primary antibodies, proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (25Yakunin A.F. Hallenbeck P.C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In one experiment, the protein profiles obtained after immunoprecipitation with either IP3kinA antiserum or control antiserum were compared by staining with Coomassie Blue. These appeared identical except for a 53-kDa band appearing in the IP3kinA lane only. The polyclonal antiserum made in rabbit against purified rat brain IP3kinA was described previously (18Takazawa K. Lemos M. Delvaux A. Lejeune C. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and used for immunohistochemistry and Western blots (6Mailleux P. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Brain Res. 1991; 539: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Go M. Uchida T. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Mailleux P. Onaya T. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 158: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); it was used at 1:1000 for immunofluorescence and 1:1500 for Western blots. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the α-subunit of CaMKII (catalog number MAB3119) and against synapsin (catalog number MAB355) were from Chemicon. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the β-subunit of CaMKII (Clone CBb-2) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Monoclonal antibody against actin (clone AC-40) was from Sigma. Latrunculin A (LTA) (Molecular Probes) was made as a 5 mmstock in Me2SO and diluted 1:1000 into the culture media. Our initial experiments to examine the targeting of IP3kinA, a neural specific protein, utilized HeLa cells as a more convenient vehicle for localizing the multiple constructs generated. Full-length IP3kinA (amino acids 1–459) fused N-terminal to GFP appeared to associate with the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton of HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). This localization was not an artifact of the GFP tagging, since the GFP could also be placed C-terminal to GFP (not shown); furthermore, untagged, full-length IP3kinA, when expressed in HeLa cells and stained with a polyclonal antibody to IP3kinA, produced a similar staining pattern (not shown). Double staining with fluorescent phalloidin revealed a high degree of co-localization with F-actin (Fig.1B). A series of truncated IP3kinA GFP constructs were made and expressed in HeLa cells. We first tested a 66–459-amino acid construct, which corresponds to a clone called C5 that was previously shown to produce a fully Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive enzyme in bacteria (21Takazawa K. Vandekerckhove J. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This construct, when fused to GFP, appeared completely cytosolic when transfected into HeLa cells (not shown), suggesting that the first 66 amino acids are necessary for targeting to the cytoskeleton. Further studies established that the first 66 amino acids were sufficient to target GFP to F-actin (Fig. 1, C and D). The cytosolic localization of construct 34–459 (Fig. 1E) suggested that the first 66 amino acids were necessary for co-localization with F-actin. Indeed, when the stretch of 66 amino acids was cut in half, neither 1–33 (Fig. 1G) nor 34–66 (Fig. 1I) could efficiently target GFP to F-actin. Although in all cases placing the GFP at either end of the construct produced similar results, some subtle differences were observed. First, the 1–33 construct (but never the 34–66 constructs) sometimes appeared to localize partially with F-actin in cells with very high expression levels, but this was only observed when the GFP was placed C-terminal to 1–33. Second, constructs with the GFP at the C terminus had easier access to the nucleus; construct 66–459 with GFP placed at the N terminus was excluded from the nucleus but entered the nucleus when GFP was placed at the C terminus. Constructs 109–459 and shorter entered the nucleus freely, regardless of the site of GFP tagging (not shown). Third, in a subset of cells with very high expression levels, the presence of the actin association region appeared to stabilize or promote the formation of F-actin, as judged by our ability to pick out some of the transfected cells on the basis of enhanced phalloidin staining. This phenomenon was explored further in the transfected hippocampal cultures (see below and Fig. 4). The amino acid sequence of the actin-targeting region was examined through the use of computer programs that predict secondary structure (Fig. 1, bottom). Three programs agreed that the stretch 31–49 has a high likelihood of forming an α-helix. This contrasts to the most N-terminal stretch of 27 amino acids, which contains 6 prolines. Another criterion for an association with the actin cytoskeleton is resistance to extraction with the detergent Triton X-100. We therefore expressed the GFP-(1–66) and GFP-(66–459) constructs in HeLa and COS-7 cells, and we then extracted them with 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature before fixation and staining with fluorescent phalloidin. In some cases, cells were pretreated with the actin-disrupting drug LTA (5 μm) for 15 min before extraction. The results of some of these experiments are depicted in Fig. 2. In both HeLa and COS cells, the 1–66 construct appeared to be highly resistant to detergent extraction (Fig. 2C), whereas the 66–459 construct was washed away so efficiently that it was impossible (HeLa cells) or difficult (COS cells; Fig. 2G) to determine which cells had been transfected with 66–459. Moreover, when HeLa cells expressing the 1–66 construct were pretreated with LTA for 15 min prior to extraction, no green fluorescent cells remained (not shown). These experiments demonstrate that the 1–66 region is likely to associate with F-actin directly and that disruption of F-actin is sufficient to liberate a cytosolic (Triton X-100-extractable) protein. We next determined if the first 66 amino acids of IP3kinA bound F-actin directly in a purified system. The actin association region was difficult to express in bacteria. Our initial attempts to produce His6-tagged 1–459 or 1–66 using the pQE-30 vector in the XL-10 gold strain of E. coliproduced no detectable fusion protein in either the soluble or inclusion body fractions. To overcome this problem, we fused the 1–66 region (N66) downstream of the solubility-enhancing NusA protein in the PET43A vector and expressed the construct in the BL21(DE3) strain carrying a plasmid coding for rare tRNAs. This vector also incorporates one His6 sequence between NusA and N66 and another His6 after N66 to facilitate purification. Although this strategy resulted in substantial full-length NusA-N66 fusion protein purified from the bacterial extracts (about 47% of the total purified in our best preparations), the remainder of the purified protein was truncated (Fig. 3A,lanes 5 and 7). Our co-sedimentation experiments (Fig. 3A) confirmed that only the highest molecular weight band (containing the full N66 stretch) was able to bind F-actin (Fig.3A, lanes 6 and 8) and also that NusA itself was not an F-actin-binding protein (lanes 2 and 4). Because skeletal muscle actin is known to have different properties than non-muscle actin when expressed in neurons (26Kaech S. Fischer M. Doll T. Matus A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9565-9572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested both skeletal muscle and non-muscle (platelet) actin; the results with either type of F-actin appeared identical, at least qualitatively (lanes 6 and 8). In order to estimate the affinity and stoichiometry of our fusion protein for F-actin, we attempted to carry out binding assays whereby we varied the concentration of NusA-N66 against a fixed concentration of skeletal muscle F-actin, used at just above the critical concentration (∼1 μm F-actin). However, because so much of the NusA-N66 protein was truncated (and unable to bind F-actin), we were unable to raise the concentration high enough in the assay to saturate the F-actin-binding sites (2.6 μm was the maximal concentration of apparently full-length NusA-N66 achieved in our assays). Then we tried titrating various F-actin concentrations against a maximal concentration of NusA-N66 (2.6 μm). F-actin binding assays done this way are theoretically possible, but there are a number of caveats that complicate the interpretation of the data (see below). Nevertheless, it was possible to generate a curve that resembled saturable binding and allowed us to estimate a rough stoichiometry of between 2 and 4 mol of actin per mol of fusion protein and to estimate the Kd to be 2.7 μm(Fig. 3B). At least two caveats apply. First, the lowest point on the curve was obtained near or below the critical concentration (1 μm actin was added to the assay, and only 39% appeared in the pellet as F-actin). Second, even at the highest F-actin concentration tested (20 μm), some of the full-length NusA-N66 fusion protein (0.98 μm) remained in the unbound fraction when theoretically all of the fusion protein should pellet with the actin if the actin concentration is raised high enough. Perhaps some the apparently full-length fusion protein was subtly modified so that it could no longer bind F-actin. The most reliable data on our curve lie in the points between 1 and 5 μm F-actin, where the average stoichiometry was 2.3 mol of F-actin per mol of fusion protein. These data serve as a rough guide for future studies using full-length, untruncated fusion protein in more conventional binding assays. Primary cultures of hippocampal cells (6–16 days in vitro) were transfected using a calcium phosphate procedure, fixed, and examined between 18 h and 14 days later. GFP-IP3kinA assumed the morphology of the F-actin in each of the various cell types in which it was expressed. The highest levels of expression were found in astrocytes, where fluorescence occurred mainly on spikey structures, stress fibers, and also cortical actin (Fig.4). Transfected astrocytes also produced the clearest confirmation of the observations made in HeLa and COS-7 cells that the 1–66 region of IP3kinA sometimes stabilizes or promotes actin polymers. In Fig. 4C, phalloidin staining for F-actin is clearly increased compared with neighboring untransfected astrocytes. In the same experiment, the cultures were also transfected with GFP fused to γ-actin. Surprisingly, cells overexpressing actin did not show increased phalloidin staining compared with their neighbors (Fig. 4, B and D), thus serving as controls for the specificity of the IP3kinA F-actin-promoting effect. It is important to note that most of the transfected non-astrocytic cells did not exhibit enhanced staining for F-actin and that there was a clear correlation between a cell having very high GFP-IP3kinA fluorescence and its having enhanced levels of F-actin. In our initial attempts to transfect neurons, we used short transfection times (20–48 h) and young neurons (3–9 days in culture). In these experiments, we found that (as was the case in HeLa cells,"

Using the N-terminal domain of ezrin as a bait, we found that p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) interacts with ezrin. We show that the two proteins coimmunoprecipitate from cultured cell lysates. However, FAK does not interact with full-length ezrin in vitro, indicating that the FAK binding site on ezrin is cryptic. Mapping experiments showed that the entire N-terminal domain of FAK (amino acids 1–376) is required for optimal ezrin binding. While investigating the role of the ezrin-FAK interaction, we observed that, in suspended kidney-derived epithelial LLC-PK1 cells, overproduction of ezrin promoted phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site, creating a docking site for FAK signaling partners. Treatment of the cells with a Src family kinase inhibitor reduced the phosphorylation of Tyr-577 but not that of Tyr-397, indicating that ezrin-mediated FAK activation does not require the activity of Src kinases. Altogether, these observations indicate that ezrin is able to trigger FAK activation in signaling events that are not elicited by cell-matrix adhesion.

ERM proteins are members of the erythrocyte protein 4.1 superfamily that are characterized by a conserved ∼300-residue globular N-terminal domain (FERM domain). This domain targets the ERM proteins to plasma membrane by interacting with phosphoinositides and proteins such as CD44, ICAMs, or EBP-50 (5Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S.

The C-terminal end of ERM proteins interacts with F-actin (10Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). ERM proteins are regulated by conformational changes. Full-length ezrin exists in a “closed” inactive form in which both membrane and F-actin binding sites are masked (11Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The masking of binding sites is due to an intramolecular interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains of the protein also referred to as N- and C-ERMAD for N- and C-ERM association domains, respectively (12Bretscher A. Gary R. Berryman M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16830-16837Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, abolition of the intramolecular interaction is required for exposure of these binding sites (13Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model of ERM activation is the finding that, when produced separately, the N and C termini of ERM proteins exhibit properties that are not observed with the full-length proteins (15Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 16Henry M.D. Gonzalez Agosti C. Solomon F. J.

Moreover, opening of the ERM proteins also leads to the formation of oligomers through intermolecular interaction between the N- and C-ERMADs. Ezrin dimers and higher oligomers are present in extracts of placental microvilli (13Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Physiological activation of the ERM is not completely understood but is likely to be a multistep process involving association with phosphoinositides (9Heiska L. Alfthan K. Grönholm M. Vilja P.

Phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal threonine residue (Thr-567 in ezrin) was shown to relieve the N-/C-ERMAD intramolecular association in vitro and to allow F-actin interaction when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is present (20Nakamura F. Huang L. Pestonjamasp K. Luna E.J. Furthmayr H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2669-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Matsui T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1259-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, phosphorylation of this threonine residue regulates a membrane-specific transition from inactive oligomers to active monomers (22Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that, by providing linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, ERM proteins control diverse actin-based cellular functions, including adhesion, morphogenesis, and motility. Simultaneous inactivation of all three ERM in epithelial cells and fibroblasts by antisense oligonucleotides caused disappearance of microvilli and altered cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion (23Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, overexpression of full-length ezrin in insect cells enhanced cell adhesion (17Martin M. Andréoli C. Sahuquet A. Montcourrier P. Algrain M. Mangeat P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Selective ablation of ezrin by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation impaired membrane ruffling and motility (24Lamb R.F. Ozanne B.W. Roy C. McGarry L. Stipp C. Mangeat P. Jay D.G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 682-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Overproduction of ezrin stimulates scattering and motility as well as tubulogenesis of polarized kidney-derived LLC-PK1 cells in response to hepatocyte growth factor (18Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Overproduction of ezrin N-terminal domain in these cells abrogated response to hepatocyte growth factor suggesting that this domain exhibits a dominant-negative activity (18Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently demonstrated that ezrin also mediates survival signals through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in epithelial cells (25Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which ERM proteins exhibit these diverse cellular functions are not fully understood. However, the tightly regulated ability of these proteins to interact with several targets suggests that ERM proteins function as scaffold factors by recruiting appropriate downstream effectors to specific subcellular domains. Because ERM cryptic binding sites are exposed in isolated N- and C-terminal domains, these domains constitute powerful tools to identify ERM partners. In this study, we report the identification of the p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) as a new partner for ezrin, using the N-terminal domain of ezrin fused to GST in an affinity purification assay. Using site-specific antibodies directed against FAK-phosphorylated tyrosine residues, we show that ezrin triggers FAK phosphorylation independently of cell matrix adhesion. Moreover, we demonstrate that ezrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 is independent of Src-kinase activity. Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells (CRL 1555) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Pig kidney-derived epithelial LLC-PK1 cells (ATCC; CL 101) were stably transfected and cultured as previously described (18Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). PP2 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-ezrin and rabbit polyclonal anti-VSV-G antibodies were previously described (15Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and mouse monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (clone 2A7) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK antibody C-20 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-FAK serum (SL38) and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody specific of Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK were previously described (27Toutant M. Studler J.-M. Burgaya F. Costa A. Ezan P. Gelman M. Girault J.-A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 119-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Tyr-577-phosphorylated FAK antibody was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The pGEX2T-based constructs used to produce GST-fused ezrin full-length, N- and C-terminal domains were previously described (28Andreoli C. Martin M. Leborgne R. Reggio H. Mangeat P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2509-2521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pBluescript-based vectors encoding full-length chicken FAK or its non-catalytic domain FRNK, FAK-(693–1053) were a kind gift from Dr. J. T. Parsons (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 29Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). pBS-FAK-(376–683) was obtained by PCR amplification of the corresponding codons and subcloning of the PCR products into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pBluescript polylinker. The sequence (GCAAAACCATGGCA) containing the initiation codon ATG was inserted upstream of theBamHI site to allow translation initiation. The pCDNA-mycHis6 construct used to produce myc-tagged FAK-(1–376) was made by an MscI-EcoRV deletion of the pCDNA-FAK construct (provided by Dr. J. T. Parsons) and addition of a C-terminal mycHis6 tag from pCDNA-mycHis6. An myc-tagged-FAK-(1–311) fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of the corresponding FAK sequence and subcloning into the pCDNA-mycHis6 vector. pGEX2T-FAK constructs used to produce GST fused to FAK amino acid sequences 1–126, 127–376, and 376–683 were obtained by subcloning the corresponding amplified FAK cDNA fragments into the BamHI-EcoRI sites. A PGEX2T-PTP-β plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. J. Ragab (INSERM U326, Toulouse). Recombinant GST and GST-Ezrin variants were produced inEscherichia coli and purified according to standard procedure. Radiolabeled FAK protein fragments were synthesized from the corresponding pBluescript and pCDNA-mycHis6 constructs using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions with the Redivue PRO-MIX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as35S labeling material. An extract was prepared from a human placenta obtained from a consenting patient. 25 g of frozen tissue was broken into small pieces in liquid nitrogen before homogenization in a blender in 25 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 1 mNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), pH 7.5. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The lysate obtained was then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer PD (50 mm Tris, 25 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmDTT, and a protease inhibitors mixture, pH 7.5). After dialysis, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and frozen at −80 °C in aliquots of 45 mg/ml proteins. Before each experiments, aliquots were centrifuged in the same conditions. GST or GST fused to the indicated ezrin domains immobilized on glutathione-coupled agarose beads (5–25 μl) were incubated with protein extracts for 2 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer PD. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer PD and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide) under reducing conditions. For peptide mass fingerprinting, the gel was Coomassie blue-stained and the bands were excised and subjected to trypsin proteolysis (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7816) Google Scholar). Molecular weights of the resulting peptides were then determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight analysis using a Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The peptide maps obtained were compared with the OWL, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, and Swiss data bases. A recombinant N-terminal fragment of ezrin was biotinylated with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate-biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemical Co.). For the overlay experiment, E. coli extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with the biotinylated N-terminal domain of ezrin and, subsequently, with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates (Promega). Subconfluent A431 cell grown in a 10-cm dish were serum-starved for 6 h. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5) for 15 min at 4 °C, and scraped, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. 10 μg of either polyclonal anti-ezrin antibody or an irrelevant antibody pre-adsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads, in the presence of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, was incubated with 1 ml of lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 40 μl of high salt radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) to elute coimmunoprecipitated FAK. Subconfluent LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected with a control plasmid or a plasmid producing wild-type human ezrin were starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without CaCl2 (DMEM*). Cells were then trypsinized, washed twice in DMEM* containing 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and counted. 2.5 × 105 cells were kept in suspension as isolated cells in DMEM* for at least 30 min before being collected by centrifugation. 2.5 × 105 suspended cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C to a 6-well plate coated with 100 μg of fibronectin. Subconfluent cells grown on a 6-well plate were serum-starved overnight prior to extract preparation. When indicated, PP2 (25 μm) was added to serum-starved adherent cells 30 min before lysis and to the medium of suspended cells. Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer, and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with site-specific antibodies directed against FAK-phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Endogenous FAK was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells using the SL38 anti-serum, and phosphorylation was carried out as previously described (27Toutant M. Studler J.-M. Burgaya F. Costa A. Ezan P. Gelman M. Girault J.-A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 119-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the assay contained 10 μm ATP and 1 mm DTT and the incubation time was 30 min. When indicated, the reaction was carried out in the presence of GST-ezrin (full-length: FL) or GST-EzNt (final concentration ∼1 μm). The kinase assay was performed as described above. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 14 mm. The reaction mixture was then incubated in the presence of recombinant GST, GST-EzNt (final concentration ∼1 μm), or vehicle at 4 °C for 10 min. Incubations were extended for 10 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of GST-PTP-β at a final concentration of ∼1 μg/μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were performed with antibodies directed against FAK, phosphotyrosine, or phosphorylated Tyr-397. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms by which ezrin participates in diverse cytoskeleton-related cellular functions, we searched for ezrin-interacting proteins that may mediate and/or regulate its function. For this purpose, the N-terminal domain of ezrin fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-EzNt) was purified fromE. coli (Fig. 1A). Affinity purification assays were then performed using immobilized GST or GST-EzNt as baits with a human placental extract because of the abundance of ezrin in this tissue (13Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig.1B). Only proteins in the upper part of the gel were analyzed because of partial proteolysis of the baits during incubation with the extract. In these conditions, at least six candidate ezrin binding proteins were detected with sizes ranging from 75 to 165 kDa. The triplet of proteins between 75 and 83 kDa was identified as the three ERM proteins, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). To identify the major band of 90 kDa, the pull-down assay presented in Fig. 1B was scaled up 10-fold and the band was analyzed by mass fingerprinting of its derived tryptic peptides. The 90-kDa band was found to contain a mixture of at least two polypeptides. Most of the tryptic fragments matched the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase found at focal adhesion sites (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Because FAK is a 125-kDa protein, we determined whether the 90-kDa protein corresponded to a proteolytic fragment of FAK. Western blot analysis of the pull-down experiment performed with an anti-FAK antibody showed the presence of two bands: one corresponding to the full-length FAK comigrating with the 125-kDa protein detected in Fig. 1B and the other corresponding to the 90-kDa fragment (Fig. 1C). We observed variable amounts of the 90-kDa band depending on the cell lysate preparation, indicating that this band corresponds to a proteolytic fragment of FAK. Neither the polypeptide comigrating with the truncated FAK nor the 165-kDa protein could be identified due to the low amount of tryptic peptides recovered. We next examined whether full-length ezrin or its C-terminal portion (residues 280 to 585) were also able to bind to FAK in vitro. The two ezrin variants were purified from E. coli as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1A), and their ability to interact with FAK was analyzed in an affinity adsorption assay. Neither the C-terminal domain of ezrin nor the full-length protein were able to interact with FAK, suggesting that ezrin N-terminal binding site for FAK is cryptic in the full-length protein (Fig. 1D). This interaction was sensitive to the salt concentration, because the amount of FAK recovered with the GST-EzNt beads dropped significantly when the ionic strength of the buffer was increased to 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether ezrin and FAK physically interacted in vivo, lysates from A431 epithelioid carcinoma cells were prepared. As shown in Fig. 1E, FAK could be detected in the ezrin immunoprecipitate but not in a control immunoprecipitate obtained with non-immune IgG. Estimation of the amount of FAK recovered indicated that ∼0.2% of the soluble pool of FAK coprecipitated with ezrin. Structurally, FAK is an atypical PTK organized in three major functional domains (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) (Fig.2C). FAK contains a central kinase domain followed by a C-terminal region that was found to contain a focal adhesion targeting sequence responsible for FAK localization to focal contact sites (31Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To identify the region of FAK interacting with ezrin, the ability of truncated FAK proteins to interact with GST-EzNt was tested using affinity adsorption assays (Fig.2A). We found that neither FAK-(693–1053) nor FAK-(376–683) were able to significantly interact with GST-EzNt. However, FAK-(1–376) exhibited a strong association with GST-EzNt, whereas a weaker interaction was observed between FAK-(1–311) and GST-EzNt (Fig. 2A). To further map the region of FAK required for ezrin binding and to determine whether this interaction was direct, we analyzed the ability of the biotinylated N-terminal domain of ezrin to interact with shorter N-terminal fragments of FAK in a blot overlay assay. We found that ezrin interacts with two non-overlapping fragments of the N-terminal domain of FAK-(1–126) and FAK-(127–376), suggesting the presence of at least two complementary binding motifs (Fig. 2, B andC). As expected from the affinity adsorption assay performed with GST-EzNt, FAK-(376–683) did not interact with ezrin. Altogether, these results indicate that the interaction between the N-terminal domain of FAK and ezrin is direct and that the integrity of the entire N-terminal domain of FAK is necessary for optimal binding. To determine whether the association of ezrin with FAK could contribute to the activation of FAK, we examined the level of FAK phosphorylation in a well characterized kidney-derived epithelial LLC-PK1 cell line overproducing VSV-G-tagged ezrin (E cells) (18Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated residue Tyr-397, the major FAK autophosphorylation site, we estimated the level of FAK activation in serum-starved E cells and in cells transfected with an empty vector (P cells) under adherent and non-adherent conditions. In suspended P cells, only residual Tyr-397 phosphorylation was detected, which is consistent with previous observations that FAK becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-397 in response to cell adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 32Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a significantly higher phosphorylation level of the Tyr-397 residue was detected in suspended E cells (Fig. 3A,sus). Three independent E clones were analyzed, and a good correlation was observed between the amount of ezrin present in the cells and the level of FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 (Fig.3B). The FAK phosphorylation level remained higher in E cells than in P cells at least 2 h after adhesion on fibronectin had begun (Fig. 3A, adh). However, the effect of ezrin overproduction on FAK phosphorylation became negligible in cells that had been allowed to adhere overnight (data not shown). Thus, in suspended cells, overproduction of ezrin induced FAK phosphorylation through a mechanism that does not require adhesion of the cells to matrix proteins nor serum stimulation. However, ezrin did not significantly contribute to FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation in fully adherent cells. To get insight into the mechanism of the ezrin-induced FAK phosphorylation observed in LLCPK-1 cells, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with immunoprecipitated FAK in the presence of various ezrin constructs. We found that neither the full-length protein nor the N-terminal domain of ezrin could stimulate the autophosphorylation activity of immunoprecipitated FAK (Fig.4A). We next examined whether ezrin could prevent FAK dephosphorylation rather than induce its phosphorylation. For this, we determined the ability of GST-EzNt to protect FAK from dephosphorylation by PTP-β phosphatase in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4B, the tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylated efficiently the residue Tyr-397, and its action was not altered by the presence of either GST or GST-EzNt. Thus, the activation of FAK cannot be simply the effect of the binding of the ezrin N-terminal domain to FAK. FAK autophosphorylation on Tyr-397 creates a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src, and thereby Src kinases phosphorylate other FAK tyrosine residues, including Tyr-577 present in the activation loop of the catalytic domain (33Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 34Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the Src kinases were involved in ezrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation, we examined the level of phosphorylation of the Tyr-577 residue using a phosphospecific anti-Tyr-577 antibody. We observed an increase in the phosphorylation of this residue in suspended E cells compared with control P cells (Fig. 5A). Treatment of suspended E cells with PP2, a Src kinase inhibitor, abrogated Tyr-577 phosphorylation confirming the requirement for Src kinases in Tyr-577 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). However, in suspended E cells treated with PP2, the level of Tyr-397 phosphorylation remained high whereas in adherent E cells treated with PP2, phosphorylation of Tyr-397 was reduced. This indicated that Src kinases are not required for adhesion-independent FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation mediated by overproduction of ezrin (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we constantly observed a slightly higher level of FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 in PP2-treated than in non-treated cells kept in suspension. Ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, has been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as determination of cell shape, cell adhesion, motility, and survival. Although a number of ezrin partners have been identified to date, the mechanisms by which ezrin exerts its functions are still unclear suggesting that other effectors of ezrin remain to be identified. We report here the identification of a novel partner of ezrin, p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase also involved in cell motility and survival. Moreover, we show that, when overproduced in LLC-PK1 cells, ezrin triggers FAK activation independently of cell matrix adhesion and growth factor stimulation. This observation suggests that ezrin can promote FAK activation through a mechanism that does not require activation of the cell by external stimuli. FAK activation, as measured by an overall increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, has been well documented as a response to integrin clustering and thus correlated with its recruitment to focal adhesion sites (35Guan J.-L.

However, a variety of other stimuli can trigger FAK phosphorylation. For example, FAK is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors with growth factors (37Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we report the activation of FAK by ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker. The mechanisms by which ezrin activates FAK are not yet understood. However, our experiments indicate that conformational activation of ezrin is a prerequisite to its interaction with FAK. Although endogenous ezrin and FAK were coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates, FAK interaction occurred only with the N-terminal domain of recombinant ezrin in vitro. This result indicates that the FAK binding site is masked in full-length ezrin likely due to an N-/C-ERMAD intramolecular interaction. Association of ERM proteins with a number of partners has been shown to require the opening of the ERM molecules and exposure of cryptic binding sites. Such regulation has been well characterized for the interaction of ezrin with RhoGDI and the adapter protein EBP50 (41Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 42Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the signals that lead to ezrin activation are not fully understood, active ezrin is localized to plasma membrane structures (22Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, plasma membrane recruitment of FAK might be a necessary step in its activation. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that, in suspended COS cells, constitutive membrane recruitment of FAK through its fusion to the T cell CD2 receptor causes FAK activation by autophosphorylation in trans and/or by its exposure to a membrane-associated activator (43Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ezrin promotes FAK activation through plasma membrane recruitment and clustering of the kinase. Although FAK is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine sites, phosphorylation of Tyr-397 is a critical step in the initiation of signal transduction mediated by FAK. Phosphorylation of FAK on this residue creates a high affinity binding site for Src homology 2 domains of a number of FAK signaling partners such as PI3K and Src kinases. The interaction with Src kinases and the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-576/Tyr-577 in the kinase domain activation loop enhances its catalytic activity. The results presented here indicate that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 triggered by ezrin is independent of Src-mediated activation loop in contrast to what is observed upon integrin-mediated adhesion. This observation represents a new example of Src-independent phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397. Indeed, it has recently been reported that phosphorylation of this residue is independent of Src kinase activity when G protein-coupled receptors are stimulated with agonists (40Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). FAK phosphorylation controls various cellular functions, including cell survival. Constitutive activation of FAK provided by its fusion with the T cell CD2 receptor is sufficient to protect suspended kidney epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from entering apoptosis and to promote anchorage-independent growth of these cells (44Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, attenuation of FAK expression leads to apoptosis in tumors cells (45Xu L.H. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that FAK can regulate the PI3K/Akt survival pathway (46Chan P.C. Lai J.F. Cheng C.H. Tang M.J. Chiu C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47Tamura M. Gu J. Danen E.H. Takino T. Miyamoto S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ezrin-mediated FAK activation contributes to cell survival in non-adherent conditions. Indeed, we previously established that ezrin phosphorylated on Tyr-353, one of the major sites of phosphorylation by the epidermal growth factor receptor (49Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transduces a survival signal through the PI3K/Akt pathway in LLC-PK1 cells (25Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that, in normal epithelial cells, ezrin membrane recruitment regulates the activity of the FAK/PI3K/Akt survival pathway. We are grateful to Dr. J. T. Parsons for providing us with chicken FAK cDNAs. We are thankful to J.-P. Le Caer for his help with protein identification by mass spectrometry. We also thank Drs. B. E. Elliott and P.

https://openalex.org/W1973509709,"In the G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint arrest, the cdc25-dependent activation of cyclin B/cdc2, a critical step in regulating entry into mitosis, is blocked. Studies in yeast have demonstrated that the inhibition of cdc25 function involves 14-3-3 binding to cdc25. In humans, two cdc25 isoforms have roles in G2/M progression, cdc25B and cdc25C, both bind 14-3-3. Abrogating 14-3-3 binding to cdc25C attenuates the G2 checkpoint arrest, but the contribution of 14-3-3 binding to the regulation of cdc25B function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that high level over-expression of cdc25B in G2 checkpoint arrested cells can activate cyclin B/cdc2 and overcome the checkpoint arrest. Mutation of the major 14-3-3 binding site, S323, or removal of the N-terminal regulatory domain are strong activating mutations, increasing the efficiency with which the mutant forms of cdc25B not only overcome the arrest, but also initiate aberrant mitosis. We also demonstrate that 14-3-3 binding to the S323 site on cdc25B blocks access of the substrate cyclin/cdks to the catalytic site of the enzyme, thereby directly inhibiting the activity of cdc25B. This provides direct mechanistic evidence that 14-3-3 binding to cdc25B can regulate its activity, thereby controlling progression into mitosis."

The major physiological role of copper is to serve as a cofactor to a number of key metabolic enzymes. In humans, genetic defects of copper distribution, such as Wilson's disease, lead to severe pathologies, including neurodegeneration, liver lesions, and behavior abnormalities. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to its role as a cofactor, copper can regulate important post-translational events such as protein phosphorylation. Specifically, in human cells copper modulates phosphorylation of a key copper transporter, the Wilson's disease protein (WNDP). Copper-induced phosphorylation of WNDP is rapid, specific, and reversible and correlates with the intracellular location of this copper transporter. WNDP is found to have at least two phosphorylation sites, a basal phosphorylation site and a site modified in response to increased copper concentration. Comparative analysis of WNDP, the WNDP pineal isoform, and WNDP C-terminal truncation mutants revealed that the basal phosphorylation site is located in the C-terminal Ser796–Tyr1384 region of WNDP. The copper-induced phosphorylation appears to require the presence of the functional N-terminal domain of this protein.

Either copper deficiency or copper accumulation is deleterious to cells, and the intracellular concentration of cooper is tightly controlled. Two homologous proteins, products of theATP7A (Menkes disease) and ATP7B (Wilson's disease) genes, are essential for transmembrane transport of copper in mammalian cells (4Vulpe C. Levinson B.

Mutations in these genes cause severe pathologies in humans associated either with inborn copper deficiency (Menkes disease) or with vast accumulation of copper in tissues (Wilson's disease).

Although the ability of copper to regulate these cellular events is firmly established, the precise molecular mechanisms through which copper acts are poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that in human cells changes in copper concentration are “translated” into alterations of the phosphorylation levels for at least one protein target, WNDP. Phosphorylation of WNDP in response to copper is likely to represent a regulatory event, because it is rapid, specific, and reversible and has association with another cellular process, the subcellular redistribution of WNDP. We conclude that protein phosphorylation could be one of the molecular mechanisms by which copper regulates its own metabolism. Human hepatoma (HepG2) and hepatocarcinoma (Hep3B) cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, and 1 mmsodium pyruvate (basal medium) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2/95% air incubator. At 75–80% confluency, the growth medium was replaced with fresh medium, to which chloride salts of copper or other metals were added at various concentrations (see the figure legends and “Results”). CuCl2, ZnCl2, CoCl2, and CdCl2 were added directly to the medium to the desired concentration (0.5–75 μm); iron was added as a complex with nitrilotriacetic acid. Following 1–12 h of incubation the medium was removed and cells were rinsed twice with PBS (10 mm Na2PO4, 1.76 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then collected using a rubber policeman. To test the reversibility of the copper-induced modification of the WNDP in vivo, cells grown in the basal medium were treated with 5 μm copper for 1 h and then the medium was removed. Cells were either stored at −20 °C (control) or rinsed and then incubated in the basal medium containing 15 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0.5–5 h. Following incubations, cells were collected in 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C, and solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer (1:1:1 (v/v) of 8 m urea:10% SDS:0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8) containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The lysates were separated by 7.5% Laemmli gel (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) using full-size gel plates (15 cm × 15 cm) and the extended time protocol (25 mA for 8 h or 75 mV for 16–18 h). These conditions were necessary to resolve differences in protein mobility, as shown in Figs. 1, 2, and5). Minigels, used for analysis of 32P incorporation (see below), do not resolve well these mobility differences.Figure 2The copper-induced modification of WNDP can be reversed in vivo and in vitro. A, Hep3B cells were incubated in the absence (C) or presence (Cu) of 5 μm copper for 1 h. Then cells were transferred into the basal medium containing cycloheximide (15 μg/ml) and incubated for various periods of time (chase in hours). Following cell lysis, the mobility of WNDP was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot, as described in the legend for Fig. 1. B, microsomal membranes were isolated from control cells and from cells treated with 5 μm copper for 1 h and then membranes were incubated with or without λ-phosphatase (PPase) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mobility of WNDP was compared using immunostaining with the a-ABD, as described in the legend for Fig. 1.

Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g, pellets were discarded, and supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C (Beckman GS-15R). Pelleted membranes were resuspended in the MHTB buffer, protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 25–30 μg were loaded on a full-size 7.5% Laemmli gel. Following electrophoretic separation, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described earlier (16Noll M. Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and WNDP was detected using antibody (Ab) a-ABD at 1:15,000 dilution. Hep3B cells at 75–80% confluency were incubated in phosphate-deficient MEM (ICN) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then, [32P]inorganic phosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) was added to the medium, and cells were incubated for another 3 h in the presence or absence of 5–10 μm copper added simultaneously with 32P. Then, the radioactive medium was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS, and membrane fractions were prepared as described above. COS-7 cells at 70–80% confluency were incubated in phosphate-deficient MEM for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, followed by 3 h incubation with [32P]inorganic phosphate (0.15 mCi/ml) in the presence or absence of 50 μm copper. Radioactive medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and membrane fractions were prepared as described above. The Ab a-ABD employed for these studies works best with the fully denatured WNDP. Consequently, to achieve efficient immunoprecipitation of WNDP, the metabolically labeled cells were first lysed with sample buffer containing 2.7 m urea, 3.3% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and the lysate proteins were separated by a 7.5% Laemmli gel. The portion of the gel containing proteins with molecular masses from 130 to 200 kDa was cut out, and proteins were eluted overnight with H2O. The following mixture (1/10 of the eluate volume) was added to the eluted proteins: 10× PBS, 10% milk, 1% Tween 20 and then a-ABD was added at 1:1000 dilution. The eluted proteins were incubated with the Ab for about 30 min at room temperature and then immobilized protein G (Pierce) was added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. Proteins bound to the immobilized protein G were pelleted by centrifugation and washed for 15 min with TBS, 0.1% Tween three or four times. The radioactivity associated with protein G was monitored using Cherenkov radioactive counting (Beckman) until it reached the steady level. The 32P-labeled protein was eluted from protein G by incubation at 50 °C for 10 min with Laemmli sample buffer and then separated by 7.5% Laemmli gel. Proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was air-dried and exposed to either Kodak BioMax MS film or to the CS Bio-Rad molecular imaging screen. The intensity of the 32P labeling was quantified using Molecular phosphoimager (Bio-Rad) and then the blot was stained with 0.08% Coomassie in 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol or with a-ABD, and the amount of protein in different samples was estimated using densitometry (Bio-Rad). Microsomal membranes prepared as described above were sedimented by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in either λ-phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij35, 2 mm MnCl2, pH 7.5; New England Biolabs) or in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for treatment with tyrosine-specific phosphatase PTP1 to a protein concentration of about 1 mg/ml. Protein samples were split in half, and phosphatase was added to one-half of the sample, whereas the other half served as a control; both samples were incubated for 30 min or 3 h at 30 °C. To stop the reaction, an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer was added, and proteins were separated by Laemmli gel. Incorporation of radioactive phosphate or alteration in the electrophoretic mobility of WNDP was analyzed as described above. a-ABD Ab was affinity-purified using Affi-gel 15 resin (Bio-Rad) coupled with the purified recombinant protein corresponding to the Lys1005–Lys1321segment of WNDP. The Ab was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, 10% ethylene glycol and then neutralized with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and used for cell staining. Cells were plated on glass coverslips and grown in the basal medium as described above. At 50–70% confluency, the growth medium was replaced with either fresh basal medium or with medium containing 10 μm CuCl2. Following 1–3 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, quenched by soaking in 0.2 m ethanolamine in PBS for 2 h, and then washed in PBS. Cells were preincubated with 5% milk in PBS for 1 h and then stained with affinity purified a-ABD diluted 1:250 in PBS, 1% milk, 0.2% Tween 20. Excess antibodies were removed by washing in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, and cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1:250 dilution. Excess antibodies were removed by washing in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with 50% glycerol in water. Slides were analyzed by a laser scanning confocal microscopy imaging system (Bio-Rad MRC 1000) using a Nikon 60× oil immersion lens and a krypton-argon ion laser; excitation wavelength of 488 nm. The mutants were generated by exchanging the C-terminal NheI-SalI fragment of the full-length WNDP cDNA with the shorter NheI-SalI fragments generated by PCR. The following primers were used for PCR: forward primer (for both mutants), 5′-TGGCTAGCATTCACCTTT-3′; reverse primer (for WNDP1384), 5′-CGGTCGACTCACCTCTCCAGGTCAGGCT-3′; and reverse primer (for WNDP1424), 5′-GCGTCGACTCAGCTGACCTGGTCCCATG-3′. The pMT2 plasmid alone (mock) or the pMT2 vectors containing the full-length or truncated WNDP inserts were then used for transfection of COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units per ml of penicillin-streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. When 50–70% confluent, cells were rinsed once with PBS and treated, for 45 min under growth conditions, with DNA/DEAE-dextran solution (2 μg of plasmid DNA, 250 μg of DEAE-dextran; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 1 ml of PBS. The cells were then incubated in growth medium containing 57 μg/ml of chloroquine (ICN) for 3 h under growth conditions. Next, the cells were treated with 10% Me2SO in PBS for 1.5 min and then rinsed with PBS. Growth medium was added, and the cells were grown under normal conditions for 24–36 h. Prior to copper treatment and metabolic labeling the growth medium was replaced by phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN), and cells were grown for an additional 4–12 h. Copper treatment, metabolic labeling, and immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described above for hepatocytes. The preliminary experiments with the G591D mutation revealed that this mutation decreases the expression level of the protein. Therefore, to compare the phosphorylation of the WT and G591D mutant the amounts of WNDP in both cell lysates were estimated before immunoprecipitation. Then, the lysates containing equal amounts of WNDP WT and Gly → Asp proteins were taken into the immunoprecipitation reaction; the difference in the lysate volume was compensated by the lysate from mock-transfected cells. To ensure that the larger volume of lysate does not lead to appearance of nonspecific bands, the corresponding volume of mock-transfected cell lysate was utilized as a control. The starting point of this work was our observation that treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with increasing concentrations of copper induced a change in the electrophoretic mobility of WNDP (Fig.1A). The upward shift of the WNDP band, detected by Western blot, was small and corresponded to the increase in the WNDP molecular mass of no more than 1–2 kDa. Because copper binding to the recombinant metal-binding domain of WNDP does not induce change in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein (data not shown), we hypothesized that the observed shift was due to copper-induced intracellular modification of WNDP with a small molecular moiety. A partial change in the WNDP mobility was observed as early as 5 min after exposure to copper (the shortest time interval tested), and the WNDP band was fully shifted up following 30–45 min incubations, as well as after 2-, 3-, and 4-h treatments (data not shown). After 12 h or overnight incubation, the WNDP immunostaining pattern was slightly different. In addition to the WNDP band with modified mobility, protein with original mobility was also present (Fig.1B), suggesting that chronic copper treatment led to a steady-state equilibrium between the modified and non-modified WNDP products. Remarkably, modification of WNDP in response to copper was induced with as little as 1–2 μm copper added to the growth medium (Fig. 1B), pointing to the presence in a cell of a sensitive copper detector. At concentrations of 75 μm and higher, copper becomes inhibitory for cell growth, consequently these high concentrations have not been used in further experiments. Treatment of cells with other metals, such as cobalt, cadmium, iron, and zinc, at concentrations up to 100 μmhad no effect on the WNDP mobility (shown in Fig. 1C are the results with iron-nitrilotriacetic acid and Zn2+treatments; the results with Co2+ and Cd2+ were identical), indicating that the modification of WNDP was copper-specific. Significantly, the copper-induced shift in the WNDP mobility was detected not only in two different hepatic cell lines, Hep3B and HepG2 (not shown), but also in primary retinal epithelium cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the observed effect is likely to represent a general phenomenon. The copper-induced modification of WNDP is reversible; substitution of the copper-containing medium with the basal medium results in time-dependent changes in the electrophoretic mobility of WNDP opposite to the changes induced by copper. In contrast to rapid modification of WNDP in response to copper, the reverse process takes about 4–5 h to complete (Fig.2A); in these experiments the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added to ensure that the appearance of the band with original mobility was not due to new protein synthesis. These data let us to conclude that within a cell endogenous WNDP responds to changes in copper concentration through reversible post-translational modification. WNDP has no consensus glycosylation sites within the putative extracytosolic loops, suggesting that the shift in the electrophoretic mobility was unlikely because of copper-induced glycosylation. The small increase in the WNDP apparent molecular mass was also likely to reflect addition of a small molecular moiety, such as fatty acid or phosphate. To determine the nature of copper-induced modification the fraction of microsomal membranes was isolated from control and copper-treated cells and subjected to various treatments. Incubation of the membranes with 1 mhydroxylamine had no effect on the mobility of either control or copper-treated WNDP (not shown), indicating that WNDP was not palmitoylated. In contrast, experiments with several phosphatases revealed that treatment with λ-phosphatase completely reversed the effect of copper (Fig. 2B) pointing to the possibility that the copper-related decrease in the WNDP mobility was because of copper-induced phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, metabolic labeling of hepatic cells was carried out. Hep3B cells were metabolically labeled with inorganic phosphate in the presence and absence of copper. WNDP was immunoprecipitated, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the control and copper-treated proteins was compared. Interestingly, both the control and copper-treated WNDP were labeled with [32P]phosphate (Fig. 3). However, the specific radioactivity of the copper-treated WNDP was consistently 2–2.5-fold higher than that of the control protein confirming that copper specifically stimulates phosphorylation of WNDP. Hyperphosphorylation of WNDP in response to copper could either be because of increased phosphorylation of a single site or because of modification of a new site. The 2-fold increase in the 32P labeling of WNDP in response to copper suggested that the modification of a new site is a likely possibility. This conclusion was confirmed in experiments with λ-phosphatase. Treatment with λ-phosphatase, which earlier was shown to reverse the copper-induced shift in the WNDP mobility (see Fig. 2B), decreased the amount of [32P] incorporated into WNDP in response to copper, bringing it close to the basal level (Fig.4). At the same time, λ-phosphatase had only a small effect on [32P] incorporated into WNDP in the absence of copper. These data, along with the quantitative copper-induced change in the mobility of WNDP, suggest the presence of two distinct phosphorylation sites, one that is modified under basal conditions and is insensitive to λ-phosphatase treatment and another that is phosphorylated in response to increasing copper concentrations and can be dephosphorylated with λ-phosphatase. It has been reported recently that addition of copper to HepG2 cells leads to the intracellular redistribution of WNDP from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to a vesicular compartment (the precise nature of this compartment remains to be characterized) (17Hung I.M.

Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether the copper-dependent change in the WNDP intracellular pattern can be observed in Hep3B cells, which were used primarily for this study, and whether there is a link between the level of phosphorylation of WNDP and its subcellular location. The intracellular distribution and phosphorylation of WNDP were analyzed (i) under basal conditions, (ii) following copper treatment, and (iii) following copper treatment and then 5 h of chase in the basal medium (Fig.5, A and B). As shown in Fig. 5, in the basal medium, where WNDP has a basal level of phosphorylation, the immunostaining of WNDP produced an asymmetric perinuclear pattern, consistent with the reported TGN localization of the full-length WNDP (17Hung I.M. Suzuki Y. Yamaguchi D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Addition of copper to the medium leads to hyperphosphorylation of WNDP and to small but consistent changes in the WNDP pattern. The intensity of the asymmetric staining decreases, and the pattern becomes more uniform, with a vesicle-like staining surrounding the nucleus. Importantly, dephosphorylation of WNDP (Fig.5, Chase) coincides with re-appearance of the asymmetrical TGN-like perinuclear staining, suggesting that the copper-regulated phosphorylation of WNDP is somehow linked to its subcellular localization. Analysis of the WNDP amino acid sequence revealed over 50 potential phosphorylation sites. To identify the regions of WNDP important for its basal and induced phosphorylation the following experiments were carried out. First, two C-terminal truncation mutants of WNDP were generated, WNDP1424 lacking the last 40 amino acid residues and WNDP1384 lacking almost the entire C-terminal tail. The C-terminal truncation mutants and the full-length WNDP were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and metabolically labeled with 32P inorganic phosphate. The expression of the truncation mutants was comparable with the expression of the full-length WNDP, and both mutants became phosphorylated in the basal medium (Fig. 6A), indicating that most of the C-terminal tail of WNDP was not important for basal phosphorylation. Second, we compared phosphorylation of the full-length WNDP and PINA (kindly provided by Dr. J. Borjigin). PINA is a product of alternative translation of the WNDP (ATP7B) gene, which lacks the N-terminal copper-binding domain and the first two transmembrane hairpins (19Borjigin J. Payne A.S. Deng J. Li X. Wang M.M. Ovodenko B. Gitlin J.D. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 3: 1018-1026Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 6B illustrates that in the basal medium PINA is phosphorylated similarly to WNDP indicating that the basal phosphorylation site is located in the C-terminal Met796–Ser1384 region, common for WNDP and PINA. The quantitative analysis of copper-induced phosphorylation in COS-7 cells was complicated by variability of the response. Although endogenous WNDP, which is present in low quantities in COS-7 cells, was hyperphosphorylated in response to copper (Fig.7), transiently expressed WNDP did not always show the expected copper-dependent increase of phosphorylation. Because such variability was not observed for phosphorylation of endogenous WNDP, we attributed the inconsistent results to protein overexpression, a hypothesis that we are currently testing. At the same time, measurements of 32P incorporation into PINA reproducibly showed lack of copper-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the N-terminal domain, which is missing in PINA, could be important for the copper-induced response. This conclusion was supported by analysis of the full-length WNDP containing the G591D substitution in its N-terminal domain. Earlier, Hamza et al. (20Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the G591D mutant had normal intracellular localization but did not interact with the intracellular copper donor HAH1 and therefore was unlikely to bind copper (20Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the ability of the G591D mutant to become phosphorylated was unaffected by the mutation, whereas the response to copper was impaired. These results further suggest that the proper folding and/or function of the N-terminal domain could play an important role for the copper-dependent phosphorylation of WNDP. The important metabolic role of copper became increasingly appreciated in recent years. Accumulation of copper in tissues leads to severe pathologies in humans; however the precise molecular consequences of fluctuations in copper concentrations in a cell remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that copper can regulate phosphorylation of protein(s) directly involved in cellular copper homeostasis. Specifically, we show that in a cell the Wilson's disease protein, a human copper-transporting ATPase, is phosphorylated and that increased copper leads to formation of a “hyperphosphorylated” WNDP. The hyperphosphorylation is removed from WNDP when cells are transferred into the basal medium (see Figs. 2 and 5), thus providing a direct demonstration of the intracellular copper-sensory mechanism at work. It is significant that copper-stimulated phosphorylation is observed at concentrations that do not exceed physiological concentrations of copper in human serum (10–20 μm) and is detected in different cell types. Protein phosphorylation is a widespread phenomenon playing a key role in the regulation of numerous cellular events contributing to cell growth, development, homeostasis, and cell death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that WNDP in a cell is phosphorylated. More importantly, the induced modification of WNDP is the first example of protein phosphorylation specifically regulated by copper. It could be caused by binding of copper to the metal-binding domain of WNDP with concomitant conformational change exposing a specific site for phosphorylation by a kinase (see also below). Alternatively, the copper-dependent phosphorylation could be because of a previously uncharacterized stimulating effect of copper on known kinase(s) or stimulation of a yet uncharacterized copper-dependent kinase. If this later scenario is correct, and there is a kinase-phosphatase system responsive to changes in copper concentration, then such a system may play a profound role in the response of neuronal and hepatic cells to the conditions of copper overload typical for Wilson's disease. A stimulatory effect of high copper concentrations on mitogen-activated protein kinase was reported for BEAS cells treated with various metals (21Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however the effect of copper on mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was small and not specific for this metal, in contrast to the highly specific effect of copper reported here. Our experiments on treating cells with various kinase inhibitors demonstrated that H89 (inhibitor of protein kinase A) and SB 203580 (mitogen-activated protein kinase homologue inhibitor) had no effect on copper-induced phosphorylation of WNDP. On the other hand, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (an inhibitor of casein kinase II) partially prevented the phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting that casein kinase II or a casein kinase II-like molecule could be involved in copper-induced phosphorylation of WNDP. The apparent presence of two separate sites for basal and copper-dependent phosphorylation in the WNDP molecule is particularly interesting. It is suggested by a quantitative shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the hyperphosphorylated WNDP and by different sensitivity of basal and induced phosphorylation to λ-phosphatase. The different effect of the N-terminal domain alterations on the basal and copper-dependent phosphorylation also agrees with the view that there are at least two distinct phosphorylation sites in WNDP. It seems likely that the basal and copper-induced phosphorylations play distinct roles in regulation of WNDP, possibly controlling the intracellular targeting of the protein and overall transport activity of WNDP or modulating the rate of copper release from the N-terminal domain, etc. Our studies offer the first hint to the possible role of copper-induced phosphorylation. It has been reported recently that copper regulates the intracellular localization of WNDP, stimulating its redistribution from TGN into the vesicular compartment (17Hung I.M. Suzuki Y. Yamaguchi D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 18Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The copper-dependent trafficking of WNDP is an event that apparently determines the rate of copper transport across the membrane by altering the number of transporters present in the membrane. Thus, it is particularly interesting that copper-induced phosphorylation of WNDP coincides with the re-distribution of this protein from TGN into the vesicular compartment, whereas dephosphorylation in response to copper withdrawal is accompanied by the return of WNDP to TGN (Fig. 5). It is tempting to speculate that these two phenomena are linked and that the WNDP trafficking is regulated by copper via reversible copper-dependent phosphorylation. This idea is also supported by close correlation between the concentration and time dependence of the induced phosphorylation observed in our studies and previously reported concentration and time dependence of the copper-induced trafficking of WNDP (18Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that copper-induced phosphorylation takes place only in the vesicular compartment, and upon return to TGN, WNDP became dephosphorylated. Future kinetic and mutagenesis studies will determine which of these hypotheses are correct. It seems very likely that the N-terminal domain of WNDP plays an important role in the copper-dependent phosphorylation of this protein. The N-terminal domain of WNDP binds copper specifically (22Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); therefore copper binding to this domain could be the first step triggering the phosphorylation event. Our recent studies revealed that copper binding to the N-terminal domain of WNDP decreases the interactions between the N-terminal domain and the ATP-binding domain of this protein (24Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The domain dissociation may therefore expose new sites on either domain, making them available for phosphorylation. In summary, we demonstrated that in human cells copper could control phosphorylation of distinct protein targets, specifically and in a reversible fashion. This novel physiological function of copper can be central to understanding the mechanisms by which copper transport is regulated in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2022114529,"The kinases Akt2, Akt3 and their myristylated variants, Myr-Akt2 and Myr-Akt3 were expressed by the RCAS vector in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Myr-Akt2 and Myr-Akt3 were strongly oncogenic, inducing multilayered foci of transformed cells. In contrast, wild-type Akt2 and Akt3 were only poorly transforming, their efficiencies of focus formation were more than 100-fold lower; foci appeared later and showed less multilayering. Addition of the myristylation signal not only enhanced oncogenic potential but also increased kinase activities. Myr-Akt2 and Myr-Akt3 also induced hemangiosarcomas in the animal, whereas wild type Akt2 and Akt3 were not oncogenic in vivo. Furthermore, Akt2, driven by the lck (lymphocyte specific kinase) promoter in transgenic mice, induced lymphomas. The oncogenic effects of Akt2 and Akt3 described here are indistinguishable from those of Akt1. The downstream targets relevant to oncogenic transformation are therefore probably shared by the three Akt kinases."

A synergistic effect was observed when chitin was degraded in the presence of both catalytic domains, suggesting different cleavage specificity of these domains. Analyses of degradation products from N-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides and their chromogenic derivatives with thin layer chromatography indicated that the N-terminal catalytic domain mainly hydrolyzed the second glycosidic bond from the nonreducing end of the oligomers, whereas the C-terminal domain randomly hydrolyzed glycosidic bonds other than the first bond from the nonreducing end. Both catalytic domains formed diacetyl-chitobiose as a major end product and possessed transglycosylation activity. Further analysis of degradation products from colloidal chitin with high performance liquid chromatography showed that the N-terminal catalytic domain exclusively liberated diacetyl-chitobiose, whereas reactions with the C-terminal domain led to N-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides of various lengths. These results demonstrated that the N-terminal and C-terminal catalytic domains functioned as exo- and endochitinases, respectively.

Hence, the biological degradation of chitinous materials is an important process for the recycling of nutrients in most environments. Chitin-hydrolyzing enzymes are classified into three categories (endochitinases, exochitinases, and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidases) according to the manner in which they cleave chitin chains (1Gooday G.W. Ratledge C. Biochemistry of Microbial Degradation. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 279-312Crossref Google Scholar). Endochitinases randomly cleave β-1,4-glycosidic bonds of chitin, whereas exochitinases cleave the chain from the nonreducing end to form diacetyl-chitobiose (GlcNAc2).N-Acetyl-β-glucosaminidases hydrolyze GlcNAc2into GlcNAc or produce GlcNAc from the nonreducing end ofN-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides. Many chitinases are composed of a catalytic domain joined to one or more chitin-binding domains (ChBDs),1 as in the case of various insoluble polysaccharide hydrolases including cellulases. This kind of substrate-binding domain is functional not only for accumulating catalytic sites on the surface of substrates but also for disrupting hydrogen bonds in the crystalline region of substrates and thereby facilitating subsequent hydrolysis by the catalytic domains (2Tomme P. Warren R.A. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Many chitinolytic bacteria, such as Bacillus circulans (3Alam M.M. Mizutani T. Isono M.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), have been found to produce more than one kind of chitinase. The efficient chitin degradation is assumed to be performed by the combination of these multiple chitinases. Synergistic effects on degradation of chitin or cellulose have been observed in the simultaneous action of different types of hydrolases (9Boisset C. Fraschini C. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Chanzy H.

In contrast to bacterial, fungal, and plant chitinases, information concerning chitinase from the third kingdom, archaea, has been quite limited. A chitin-degrading hyperthermophilic archaeon,Thermococcus chitonophagus, was isolated from a deep sea hydrothermal vent environment (12Huber R. Stöhr J. Hohenhaus S. Rachel R. Burggraf S.

We have previously reported the first characterization of an archaeal chitinase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 (previously reported as Pyrococcus kodakaraensis KOD1) (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chitinase (Tk-ChiA) had a striking multidomain structure composed of two catalytic domains and three ChBDs (Fig. 1), in which both the catalytic domains were classified into family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases (16Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). Two internal ChBDs (ChBD2 and ChBD3) possessing almost identical sequences were classified into family 2 of carbohydrate-binding modules, and an N-terminal ChBD1 was classified into family 12 of carbohydrate-binding modules. 2P. M. Coutinho and B. Henrissat; afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/cbm.html. RecombinantTk-ChiA displayed thermostable chitinase activity with an optimum temperature at 85 °C, and both catalytic domains were independently functional as chitinases. The presence of a chitinase with two catalytic domains has been observed from Chlorellavirus CVK2 (17Hiramatsu S. Ishihara M. Fujie M. Usami S. Yamada T. Virology. 1999; 260: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and PBCV-1 (18Sun L. Adams B. Gurnon J.R. Ye Y. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1999; 263: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, catalytic properties of the individual domains have not been well characterized in both cases. In this study, we focused on the enzymatic properties of the individual catalytic domains of Tk-ChiA and found that the chitinase from T. kodakaraensis KOD1 possesses dual catalytic domains with different cleavage specificity on a single polypeptide. Escherichia coli TG-1 and BL21(DE3) were used as hosts for expression plasmids derived from pET-25b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). E. coli TG-1 was cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C. NZCYM medium (10 g of NZ amine, 5 g of yeast extract, 1 g of casamino acids, 5 g of NaCl, and 2 g of MgSO4·7H2O in 1 liter of deionized water, pH 7.0) was used for cultivation ofE. coli BL21(DE3). Ampicillin, when needed, was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. DNA manipulations were performed by standard methods, as described by Sambrook and Russell (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) or Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Small scale preparation of plasmid DNA from E. coli cells was performed with the Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed with the ABI PRISM kit and Model 310 capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses were performed with GENETYX software (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). The expression plasmid for ChiAΔ5 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction as described below. Two oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-ACAACCCATATGTACGGGGTCGTCCCGGTTCTCGCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCAGATCTCAGCCGAGGTGCTGGAGAACAGTATC-3′ (underlining indicates an NdeI site and a BglII site in sense and antisense primers, respectively)) and λ phage DNA containing the Tk-chiA gene (20Ezaki S. Miyaoku K. Nishi K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 88: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were used as primers and template for DNA amplification, respectively. The amplified DNA (1,222 base pairs) was digested with NdeI and BglII and then ligated with the NdeI and BamHI sites of plasmid pET-25b(+). No mutation occurring in the sequence of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid was designated pET-ChiAΔ5. Expression and purification of ChiAΔ5 were performed with the same procedures as those described for Tk-ChiA (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations of Tk-ChiA, ChiAΔ2, ChiAΔ3, and ChiAΔ4 have been described previously (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified proteins were determined by protein sequencer Model 491 cLC (Applied Biosystems). Chitinase was assayed by a modification of the Schales procedure (21Imoto T. Yagishita K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1971; 35: 1154-1156Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar) with colloidal chitin as the substrate (final concentration, 0.17%). The preparation of colloidal chitin has been described previously (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay was performed at 80 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by cooling the samples in an ice-cold bath, and the amount of reducing sugar generated was measured. To measure chitinase activity toward other substrates, colloidal chitin was replaced by chitin (chitin Ex), chitosan 7B, chitosan 8B, chitosan 9B, and chitosan 10B (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan). Ethylene glycol chitin (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used at a concentration of 0.15%. The optimal temperature and pH for chitinase activity were determined as described previously (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thermostability of the enzymes was measured by monitoring the remaining activity after heat treatment (90 °C or 100 °C) of 93 μg/ml enzyme in 47 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) with or without 200 mm NaCl. The analyses of degradation products from colloidal chitin,N-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc2–6),p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-chitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc1–5-PNP), and chitosan pentamer (Seikagaku Corp.) by silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC) were performed as described previously (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation products from colloidal chitin at the early stage of the reaction were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a TSKgel Amide-80 column (4.6 × 25 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The producedN-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides were eluted with 65% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 80 °C and then detected by absorbance at 205 nm. A chitooligosaccharide mixture (Seikagaku Corp.) that contains equal weights of GlcNAc1–6 was used as a standard. The chitinase from T. kodakaraensisKOD1 (Tk-ChiA) is composed of two catalytic domains and three ChBDs (Fig. 1) (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although both the N-terminal and C-terminal catalytic domains (catalytic domains A and B, respectively) are classified into family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases, the similarity between the catalytic domains is very low (17% identity within 420 amino acids). According to the classification of family 18 bacterial chitinases (22Suzuki K. Taiyoji M. Sugawara N. Nikaidou N. Henrissat B. Watanabe T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), catalytic domains A and B belong to different subfamilies, subfamilies A and C, respectively. These facts suggested that the two catalytic domains might possess some different features. We have already characterized two deletion mutants of Tk-ChiA, ChiAΔ3 and ChiAΔ2, which contain catalytic domain A with ChBD1 and catalytic domain B with the repeated ChBDs (ChBD2 and ChBD3), respectively (Fig. 1) (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the study, when colloidal chitin was used as a substrate, the sum of the specific activities of ChiAΔ3 and ChiAΔ2 was nearly equivalent to that ofTk-ChiA, indicating no synergistic effect. Here, we performed experiments using chitin as a substrate (Fig.2). Activities of ChiAΔ3, ChiAΔ2, their combination, and Tk-ChiA were measured as μmol of reducing sugar released/nmol of catalytic domain. The results clearly indicated a synergistic effect between ChiAΔ3 and ChiAΔ2 because the activity of the combination of ChiAΔ3 and ChiAΔ2 was significantly higher than the specific activity calculated from individual activities during the reaction. The synergism coefficient,i.e. activity (ChiAΔ3 + ChiAΔ2)/(activity ChiAΔ3 + activity ChiAΔ2), at 60 min was 1.49. The activity ofTk-ChiA, just joining ChiAΔ3 to ChiAΔ2, was also higher than the calculated activity of the deletion mutants. Such synergism raised the possibility that catalytic domains A and B ofTk-ChiA harbored distinct modes of cleavage on chitin. To examine the properties of each catalytic domain without the influence of ChBDs, a new deletion mutant (ChiAΔ5) consisting of only catalytic domain A was constructed (Fig. 1). In ChiAΔ5, the initial Met residue was flanked to Tyr-148 located between ChBD1 and catalytic domain A because the longer mutant protein was partially degraded during purification procedures, leading to a protein with Tyr-148 at the N terminus. E. coli cells harboring expression plasmid pET-ChiAΔ5 were induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by heat treatment and column chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.3 A, lane 2). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified ChiAΔ5 was MYGVVPVLAD, which was identical to the predicted amino acid sequence. The other deletion mutant (ChiAΔ4) consisting of catalytic domain B was constructed and purified as described previously (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first investigated whether the catalytic domains ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4, which lacked ChBD(s), showed synergism toward the degradation of chitin. When the activities of ChiAΔ5, ChiAΔ4, and their combination were measured with chitin as a substrate, we could still observe a significant synergistic effect by ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 (Fig.2). The synergism coefficient was determined to be 1.51 at 60 min, which was equivalent to that of ChiAΔ3 and ChiAΔ2. The synergistic effect was also observed toward ethylene glycol chitin but was not observed toward colloidal chitin (data not shown). The optimal temperature of ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 for colloidal chitin was determined to be 85 °C and 90 °C, respectively. The optimal pH of ChiAΔ4 was 4.5, whereas ChiAΔ5 exhibited high levels of activity over a wide pH range from 4.5 to 8.0. ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 were stable at 80 °C for 60 min in the pH range from 5 to 9 and from 4 to 9, respectively, and the activities were increased up to 110% by additional salt (0.2–1.0 m NaCl or KCl). The half-life of ChiAΔ5 at 90 °C was 5 min, and the enzyme was completely inactivated within 1 min at 100 °C (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, ChiAΔ4 was extremely thermostable even at 100 °C, with a half-life of >7 h. Additions of 0.2 m NaCl did not affect the thermostabilities of ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 (data not shown). To determine the modes of cleavage by ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4, we analyzed the reaction products formed from colloidal chitin and variousN-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc2–6) with TLC (Fig. 4). When colloidal chitin was used as a substrate, only GlcNAc2 was detected in both cases. Hydrolysis of GlcNAc2 by ChiAΔ5 or ChiAΔ4 was not observed within 180 min; however, spots corresponding to GlcNAc could be detected after prolonged incubation (24 h), indicating that ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 possessed small degrees of activity toward GlcNAc2 (data not shown). GlcNAc3 was hydrolyzed to GlcNAc and GlcNAc2 by ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4. Although both enzymes formed GlcNAc2 as a major end product from GlcNAc4–6, obvious differences between ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 were observed in their intermediate products. ChiAΔ4 produced oligosaccharides that were 1 unit shorter than the starting substrate, such as GlcNAc5 from GlcNAc6 (Fig.4 B). This result indicated that ChiAΔ4 could liberate a GlcNAc unit from the reducing and/or nonreducing ends. In contrast, reactions with ChiAΔ5 did not lead to intermediates 1 unit shorter than the starting material (Fig. 4 A), indicating a distinct mode of cleavage. It had been confirmed that there was no thermal decomposition for these substrates. In an additional experiment, N-acetyl-chitooligosaccharide derivatives labeled at their reducing ends withp-nitrophenol (GlcNAc1–5-PNP) were used as substrates to distinguish the directions of oligosaccharides (Fig.5). GlcNAc-PNP was not hydrolyzed by both the enzymes. When GlcNAcn-PNP (n = 2–5) were used as substrates, the spots corresponding to GlcNAcn−1-PNP could not be detected in most cases, indicating that ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 did not cleave the first glycosidic bond from the nonreducing end. ChiAΔ5 produced mainly GlcNAc2 with a small amount of GlcNAc3 from GlcNAc4,5-PNP. In contrast, the spots corresponding to GlcNAc2–5 were detected from GlcNAc5-PNP by ChiAΔ4 at 1 and 3 min, demonstrating the cleavage at multiple sites in the substrate by ChiAΔ4. When GlcNAc2-PNP was hydrolyzed by ChiAΔ5, the formation of GlcNAc-PNP and GlcNAc3 was observed, suggesting a transglycosylation activity of ChiAΔ5. Therefore, reactions with each enzyme and high concentrations of GlcNAc3 (51.7 mg/ml) were carried out. TLC analysis of the reaction mixtures displayed the generation of GlcNAc4 and GlcNAc5 in each the reaction (Fig.6), indicating that ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 both harbored transglycosylation activity.Figure 6TLC of transglycosylation products by ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 from GlcNAc 3. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 2.59 mg of GlcNAc3 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) was incubated with enzyme (ChiAΔ5, 3 pmol; ChiAΔ4, 3 pmol) at 70 °C. The reaction mixtures were diluted and then analyzed.

Both enzymes formed GlcNAc2 as an end product from colloidal chitin (Fig. 4); however, it was not clear whether these GlcNAc2 products were produced directly from colloidal chitin or produced indirectly via longer oligosaccharide intermediates during hydrolysis. To clarify this, we analyzed the products from colloidal chitin at the early stage of the reaction (2, 4, 8, and 12 min) by HPLC. The weight of products was kept within 3% of that of the initial substrate in this experiment to avoid secondary hydrolysis. ChiAΔ5 produced mainly GlcNAc2, together with a small amount of GlcNAc3 (Fig.7 A). In contrast, ChiAΔ4 produced GlcNAc1–6, and we also detected faint signals that were probably derived from GlcNAc7 and GlcNAc8 at the retention times of 10.7 and 12.6 min, respectively (Fig. 7 B). The result of HPLC analysis supported the direct formation of GlcNAc2 from colloidal chitin by ChiAΔ5, whereas ChiAΔ4 liberated GlcNAc1–6from the high polymer substrate. It should be noted that GlcNAcn production rates from colloidal chitin with ChiAΔ5 were much higher than those seen with ChiAΔ4, as shown ininsets of Fig. 7. The specificities of ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 toward insoluble substrates (chitin and colloidal chitin) and soluble derivatives (ethylene glycol chitin and various degrees of deacetylated chitosans) were also determined as shown in TableI. The specific activities toward chitin were lowest among all substrates for both ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4. ChiAΔ4 showed lower activity toward colloidal chitin than ChiAΔ5, as was demonstrated by the HPLC analysis (Fig. 7, insets). Whereas the activities of ChiAΔ5 were similar toward colloidal chitin and chitosans with various degrees of deacetylation, ChiAΔ4 showed remarkably high levels of activity toward soluble ethylene glycol chitin, chitosan 7B, chitosan 8B, and chitosan 9B. Both ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 showed hydrolytic activities against the highly deacetylated chitin (>98%) chitosan 10B. These activities are most likely to be dependent on residual GlcNAc units in the substrate because hydrolyses of chitosan pentamer by ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 could not be observed (data not shown).Table ISpecific activities of ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 toward various substratesSubstrateSpecific activity1-aChitinase assays were performed under standard conditions.ChiAΔ5ChiAΔ4μmol/min/nmol of enzymeChitin0.06270.0505Colloidal chitin2.491.49Ethylene glycol chitin0.47713.9Chitosan 7B1-bApproximately 70% deacetylated.3.1616.8Chitosan 8B1-cApproximately 80% deacetylated.3.1118.5Chitosan 9B1-dApproximately 90% deacetylated.2.0816.6Chitosan 10B1-eMore than 98% deacetylated.2.281.401-a Chitinase assays were performed under standard conditions.1-b Approximately 70% deacetylated.1-c Approximately 80% deacetylated.1-d Approximately 90% deacetylated.1-e More than 98% deacetylated. Open table in a new tab The chitinase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon T. kodakaraensis KOD1, Tk-ChiA, possesses two catalytic domains on a single polypeptide (15Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the biochemical properties of the individual catalytic domains in detail. The results clearly indicated differences between the cleavage specificities of the two catalytic domains. From the analyses of hydrolysates ofN-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides with TLC (Figs. 4 and 5), we determined the cleavage sites in GlcNAc6 or GlcNAc5-PNP by ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4, respectively (see illustrations in Fig. 5). ChiAΔ5 showed exochitinolytic activity that mainly hydrolyzed the second glycosidic bond and slightly hydrolyzed the third one from the nonreducing end of chitin chains. On the other hand, ChiAΔ4 showed endochitinolytic activity that randomly hydrolyzed glycosidic bonds other than the terminal bond at the nonreducing end. Furthermore, we carried out HPLC analysis and successfully detected N-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides liberated from chitin at the early stage of hydrolysis, without the use of radiolabeled substrate. The results shown in Fig. 7 clearly indicate that ChiAΔ5 is an exochitinase, whereas ChiAΔ4 is an endochitinase, consistent with the conclusions from experiments usingN-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides as substrates. The absence of hydrolytic activities of ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 against chitosan pentamer indicated that both catalytic domains did not possess chitosanase activity. This result agrees with previous findings that family 18 chitinases catalyzed the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond via substrate-assisted catalysis that required the N-acetyl group of the substrate (23Honda Y. Tanimori S. Kirihata M. Kaneko S. Tokuyasu K. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. Fukamizo T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Hence, although ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 showed activity even toward chitosan 10B (>98% deacetylated) as shown in Table I, the activities must be dependent on the residual GlcNAc units in the substrate. Chitinase A1 from B. circulans WL-12 has been well studied and is one of the chitinases (besides the archaeal ones) most similar to catalytic domain A of Tk-ChiA (36% identity within 403 amino acids). Although it had been reported that chitinase A1 mainly hydrolyzed the second glycosidic bond from the nonreducing end of PNP-GlcNAc2–5, like ChiAΔ5 (25Sugiyama J. Boisset C. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), recent three-dimensional structural analysis of chitinase A1 suggested that GlcNAc2 units were continuously split off from the reducing end of the chitin chain in this enzyme (26Watanabe T. Ishibashi A. Ariga Y. Hashimoto M. Nikaidou N. Sugiyama J. Matsumoto T. Nonaka T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Seven aromatic residues were proposed to guide a chitin chain into the catalytic site in chitinase A1, and six of them were also conserved in the catalytic domain A of Tk-ChiA (Trp-372, Trp-251, Trp-523, Trp-184, Tyr-187, and Tyr-223). From these facts, catalytic domain A may also hydrolyze mainly the second glycosidic bond from the reducing end when high polymer chitin is a substrate. As described above, ChiAΔ4 (endochitinase type) could hydrolyze the bonds regardless of their positions in the high polymer chains, whereas the cleavage sites for ChiAΔ5 (exochitinase type) were limited at the ends of the chitin chains. The higher number of accessible cleavage sites for the endochitinase could explain the higher activities of ChiAΔ4 toward soluble ethylene glycol chitin, chitosan 7B, chitosan 8B, and chitosan 9B in comparison with those of ChiAΔ5 (Table I). The drastic decrease in activity toward chitosan 10B is likely to be due to the concentration of GlcNAc residues falling below the value needed for maximum velocity of the reaction. On the other hand, the activities of ChiAΔ5 were higher than those of ChiAΔ4 when colloidal chitin or chitosan 10B was used as a substrate. It is well known that the acid and alkaline treatments for preparations of the colloidal chitin and chitosan 10B are accompanied by low molecularization and a consequent increase of chitin ends (27Austin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 403-407Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Wang W. Bo S.Q. Li S.Q. Qin W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Indeed, the viscosity of chitosan 10B was approximately one-third of that of the other chitosans used in our experiments. The larger number of chain ends in these substrates for recognition and cleavage by ChiAΔ5 probably contributes to the similar levels of activity toward colloidal chitin and chitosan 10B with less GlcNAc residues when compared with those toward other chitosans. Due to its highly crystalline structure, chitin itself is hardly degradable. Indeed, the activities of ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 toward higher crystalline chitin were much lower when compared with other chitin derivatives. As shown in Fig. 2, ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 with different cleavage specificities exhibited a synergistic effect toward chitin. It can be assumed that the endochitinase (catalytic domain B) randomly produced ends of chitin chains accessible to the exochitinase (catalytic domain A), which then effectively released GlcNAc2 from the ends (Fig. 7, insets). Although many organisms produce more than one chitinase for efficient hydrolysis of chitin polymer (3Alam M.M. Mizutani T. Isono M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1996; 82: 28-36Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 5Tsujibo H. Hatano N.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the single polypeptide Tk-ChiA alone could achieve synergistic hydrolysis of chitin. We have observed no synergistic effect between ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 toward colloidal chitin as a substrate. The reason for this phenomenon is probably the existence of a sufficient number of the ends in colloidal chitin formed by the low molecularization described above, which allowed ChiAΔ5 to efficiently hydrolyze the chains without the assistance of an endochitinase. The deletion mutants, ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4, are thermostable chitinases, and ChiAΔ4 in particular exhibited extreme thermostability (Fig. 3 B). In addition, such thermostable enzymes generally possess stabilities not only toward heat but also toward detergents and organic solvents (29Owusu R.K. Cowan D.A. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1989; 11: 568-574Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These thermostable chitinases would be applicable as useful catalysts in the chitin industry. Moreover, ChiAΔ5 and ChiAΔ4 both possess transglycosylation activity (Fig. 6). These catalytic properties may be advantages in the efficient production ofN-acetyl-chitooligosaccharides with biological activity (30Suzuki K. Mikami T. Okawa Y. Tokoro A. Suzuki S. Suzuki M.

The deduced amino acid sequences of Pf_1168804 and Pf_1166613 are similar to the N-terminal region of Tk-ChiA divided at the middle of catalytic domain A and the C-terminal polypeptide without one of the two internal ChBDs, respectively. The two putative enzymes from HalobacteriumNRC-1, both composed of N-terminal ChBD and C-terminal catalytic domain, are similar to the N-terminal half of Tk-ChiA. Among all chitinases for which primary structures have been determined, catalytic domains A and B of Tk-ChiA are the most closely related to the putative chitinases from P. furiosus(72–83% identities). The deduced amino acid sequences translated fromchi and VNG0818C show comparatively higher similarities to catalytic domain A (43% and 33% identities, respectively) than to other chitinases from eucarya and bacteria. Further identification of archaeal chitinases would clarify whether archaeal chitinases comprise independent groups from eucaryal and bacterial enzymes in terms of primary structure. The structure of Tk-ChiA, which is composed of dual catalytic domains and triple ChBDs on a single polypeptide, is very interesting. The two catalytic domains possess different cleavage specificities, and their simultaneous action showed a synergistic effect on the hydrolysis of high molecular chitin. The ChBDs enhanced the hydrolytic efficiency of these catalytic domains against the insoluble substrate (Fig. 2). Moreover, the multidomain structure ofTk-ChiA is expected to be effective to concentrate the different kinds of catalytic domains (endochitinase- and exochitinase-type enzymes) side by side on the surface of chitin crystals. The advantages are similar to those obtained by the ”more evolved“ cellulosome in cellulose degradation. The biochemical evidence in this study provides a feasible physiological explanation for the unique structure of Tk-ChiA. This structure should contribute to efficient degradation of chitin, especially at the low enzyme and substrate concentrations found under natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1974618932,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have demonstrated a necessary role for sphingolipids in the heat stress response through inhibition of nutrient import (Chung, N., Jenkins, G. M., Hannun, Y. A., Heitman, J., and Obeid, L. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 17229–17232). In this study, we used a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to determine which endogenous sphingolipid is the likely mediator of growth inhibition. When cells were treated with exogenous phytosphingosine (PHS, 20 μm) or structurally similar or metabolically related molecules, including 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, C2-phytoceramide (PHC), and stearylamine, only PHS inhibited growth. Also, PHS was shown to inhibit uptake of uracil, tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Again this effect was specific to PHS. Because of the dynamic nature of sphingolipid metabolism, however, it was difficult to conclude that growth inhibition was caused by PHS itself. By using mutant yeast strains defective in various steps in sphingolipid metabolism, we further determined the specificity of PHS. The elo2Δ strain, which is defective in the conversion of PHS to PHC, was shown to have slower biosynthesis of ceramides and to be hypersensitive to PHS (5 μm), suggesting that PHS does not need to be converted to PHC. The lcb4Δ lcb5Δ strain is defective in the conversion of PHS to PHS 1-phosphate, and it was as sensitive to PHS as the wild-type strain. The syr2Δmutant strain was defective in the conversion of DHS to PHS. Interestingly, this strain was resistant to high concentrations of DHS (40 μm) that inhibited the growth of an isogenic wild-type strain, demonstrating that DHS needs to be converted to PHS to inhibit growth. Together, these data demonstrate that the active sphingolipid species that inhibits yeast growth is PHS or a closely related and yet unidentified metabolite.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as an excellent model system for studying sphingolipid-mediated signal transduction. First, compared with over 300 different kinds of sphingolipids found in mammalian cells, there is only a limited number of sphingolipid species in the yeast, which simplifies lipid analysis (2Hannun Y.A. Hannun Y.A. Sphingolipid-mediated Signal Transduction. R. G. Landes Co. and Chapman & Hall, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar, 3Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, the basic structure, biosynthesis, and metabolism of sphingolipids are well conserved between mammalian and yeast systems. Second, many yeast genes in the sphingolipid biosynthetic and metabolic pathways have been cloned, providing opportunities for studying the effects of endogenous sphingolipids using genetics tools. Finally, although this is not exclusive to sphingolipid studies, yeast genetics provide excellent tools to identify and characterize components in signal transduction pathways (4Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 5Levin D.E. Errede B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Evidence for conservation of the sphingolipid signaling pathway in yeast comes from several studies. These include demonstrating thatd-erythro-ceramide inhibited yeast cell growth in liquid culture and activated a protein phosphatase 2A that could be inhibited by okadaic acid (7Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Nickels and Broach (8Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) showed that ceramide inhibited yeast cell growth by arresting cell cycle at G1 phase and that ceramide-activated protein phosphatase is composed of three protein phosphatase 2A components encoded by theTPD3, CDC55, and SIT4 genes. More recent studies showed that upon heat stress, cellular levels of DHS1 and PHS rapidly increase severalfold within 10–20 min and then slowly return to basal levels over 30–60 min (9Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 10Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The levels of ceramide also increased severalfold but with slow kinetics corresponding to 60–120 min. On the other hand, the levels of complex sphingolipids show little if any change in response to heat stress. This increase in sphingoid bases derives primarily from de novo synthesis initiated by serine palmitoyltransferase. More recently, DHS and PHS were shown to inhibit yeast growth by inhibiting tryptophan import (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These studies suggest important signaling and regulatory functions for sphingoid bases, their phosphates, and/or ceramide, but they do not provide insight into which specific sphingolipids are involved in what specific cellular functions. In this report, we set out to determine which sphingolipid (among various sphingolipid species including 3-KDS, DHS, PHS, PHC, and PHS 1-phosphate) is the primary inducer of growth inhibition. Through pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that DHS inhibits growth, but it needs to be first converted to PHS to do so. PHS, on the other hand, does not need to be converted to PHS 1-phosphate or PHC, and PHS itself is sufficient to inhibit growth. Our data demonstrate that PHS inhibits growth in a specific manner, suggesting that this sphingoid base may play a specific role in growth regulation ofS. cerevisiae and that it targets a specific pathway responsive only to PHS and not to any of its known precursors or subsequent metabolites. All the yeast strains used in this study are isogenic to a normal laboratory strain JK9-3d (MAT a trp1 his4 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 rme1 HMLa; see Ref. 12Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

Recipes for media and yeast genetic methods followed standard protocols (15Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194Google Scholar).

Gene disruptions were carried out as described previously (17Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 18Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). In short, open reading frames were replaced by the polymerase chain reaction products consisting of the G418R or HygR gene cassettes flanked by 43-base pair sequence homology to targeted genes on both sides of an open reading frame. Each gene disruption was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, which was designed to amplify the specific chimeric junction of the target gene and the G418R or HygR cassette. PHS and STA were purchased from Sigma, and DHS from Biomol. KDS and C2-PHC were kind gifts from Dr. Alicja Bielawska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The quality of these sphingolipid derivatives was evaluated by thin layer chromatography. These lipids were dissolved in ethanol as 20 mm stock solutions and stored at −20 °C in the dark as described previously (19Chung N. Obeid L.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They were warmed to 30 °C before use. For solid medium, sphingolipid derivatives were added to the medium that had been autoclaved and cooled down to 50 °C, together with 0.05% Tergitol (Nonidet P-40; Sigma) to help even distribution of lipids in solid agar (20Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For liquid medium, warmed up stock solutions of the lipids were directly added to medium, vigorously shaken, and equilibrated before use. Tergitol did not affect the biological activities of sphingolipid derivatives in liquid culture, and the results shown here represent experiments with and without the use of Tergitol. Measurement of yeast growth was carried out as described previously (19Chung N. Obeid L.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, in liquid culture an overnight culture of cells at exponential growth phase was diluted into fresh medium containing indicated lipids or ethanol (0.1% at the final concentration) as a control. While incubating at 30 °C, with vigorous shaking, growth was monitored at a given time by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (A 600), and the numbers were converted into cell density (cells/ml), using a pre-configured conversion table, when necessary. On solid medium, a small amount of cells from a single colony was streaked by three successive uses of toothpicks, or exponential phase cells in liquid culture were plated onto medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days and photographed for the record. Uptake of amino acids or uracil was measured as described previously (21Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were grown to early-to-mid log phase (A 600 = 0.3–0.5) in YPD media, harvested, and resuspended in a modified buffer (10 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, plus 2% glucose), omitting 20 mm ammonium sulfate from the original recipe. Cell density was adjusted toA 600 = 0.3–0.4, for which the amount of substrates taken by cells at any given sampling does not exceed 10% of total available substrates to avoid possible saturation of uptake reactions. Sphingolipid derivatives or 0.1% ethanol were added, and the uptake was initiated with the addition of radiolabeled amino acid or uracil at the final activity of 1 μCi/ml. Two milliliters of assay cultures were withdrawn at the indicated times and placed immediately into ice-chilled tubes to stop uptake reactions. One milliliter was measured for absorbance at 600 nm; another was filtered through a pre-equilibrated, 0.45-μm Durapore membrane filter (Millipore), extensively washed three times with 2 volumes of the wash buffer (10 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, plus 2 mmcorresponding substrate), air-dried, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Counted values were normalized to cell density, and expressed as cpm/A 600 for total uptake activity. The reason for omitting ammonium sulfate from the original assay buffer is as follows. In the assay buffer containing ammonium sulfate, 20 μm PHS failed to show specific inhibition of nutrient uptake, and it required severalfold higher concentrations of PHS to inhibit uptake, as shown in a previous study (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, this inhibition was nonspecific because other structural homologs, including STA, also inhibited uptake activities at such high concentrations. When ammonium sulfate was omitted from the assay buffer, low concentrations of PHS (20 μm or lower) inhibited uptake activities in a specific manner. For Fig. 4 A, cells grown to log phase were harvested and resuspended in synthetic complete (SC) medium at 3 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were pretreated with 150 μm fumonisin B1 or mock-treated with water for 1 h before being labeled with withd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine (5 μCi/ml) for 30 min. For Fig. 5 A, cells were resuspended in SC-Ser medium supplemented with [3H]serine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals; 20 μCi/ml) and incubated for 6 h. Sphingolipids were extracted and resolved by TLC as described previously (22Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 A, extracted lipids were subjected to base hydrolysis to remove non-sphingolipid serine-labeled molecules before TLC analysis. The bands of PHS, DHS, and KDS were identified by comparing their R f values to known standards in several different solvent systems. Radioactive bands of sphingolipids and their derivatives were visualized by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after exposure to a tritium screen.Figure 5PHS does not need to be converted to PHC to inhibit growth. A, PHS accumulates in theelo2Δ mutant strain. The JK9-3d strain (ELO2) and isogenic elo2Δ and elo2Δ SEL1-1 strains were grown to an early log phase in SC (synthetic complete) medium, changed to SC-Ser medium supplemented with [3H]serine (20 μCi/ml), and incubated for 6 h, and sphingolipids were extracted and resolved by TLC. B, PHS does not need to be converted to PHC and is sufficient to inhibit growth.

Transformed cells were grown to an early-to-mid log phase and treated with indicated lipids for 2 h, and total proteins were extracted and quantitated, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (1Chung N. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The permease proteins were detected by using mouse monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin (Covance, 1:1,000). Previous studies (7Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) suggested that growth inhibition by sphingolipids and their derivatives is conserved in S. cerevisiae as well as in mammalian cells, and later (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) it was shown in liquid culture that PHS inhibits yeast growth. 2N. Chung, Y. A. Hannun, and L. M. Obeid, unpublished data. An additional study showed that yeast sphingolipids are necessary for heat-induced down-regulation of nutrient permeases (1Chung N. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not resolve questions regarding the specificity of growth inhibition by sphingolipids and what are the endogenous mediators of growth suppression. This is further complicated by the interconversion of these lipids. For example, PHS can be further converted to other sphingolipid species such as PHC, PHS 1-phosphate, or complex sphingolipid species including inositol phosphoceramide, mannose inositol phosphoceramide, and mannose diinositol phosphoceramide (Fig.1). Therefore, even when cells are treated with PHS, it is difficult to determine whether growth inhibition is caused by PHS or by other sphingolipid species that are converted from PHS (or precursors of the pathway). Moreover, DHS was claimed to have an equal or similar degree of growth inhibitory potential as PHS (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to determine whether PHS itself or other sphingolipid species inhibits growth. We first confirmed and extended previous observations by showing that PHS inhibits growth of a normal laboratory strain JK9-3d in both liquid and solid media (Fig. 2 A). In fact, cells in liquid medium were more sensitive to PHS than those in solid medium, such that 15–20 μm PHS was required to inhibit growth in solid medium, whereas 10–15 μm PHS was sufficient to attain a similar degree of growth inhibition in liquid medium (data not shown). This range of concentrations was comparable to the ranges of sphingosine and ceramide concentrations used for mammalian studies. On YPD medium containing 20 μm PHS, plating of more than 104 cells per 9-cm plate failed to yield any viable colonies; in liquid medium, more than 107cells/ml still showed immediate growth inhibition in response to 20 mm PHS (data not shown). This demonstration of growth inhibition by PHS in diverse experimental conditions enabled us to use multidisciplinary approaches, especially the genetic approach, to determine the specificity of PHS. PHS can be converted to PHC by ceramide synthase in vivo(24Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales Jr., T.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), raising a possibility that apparent growth inhibition by PHS could actually be due to PHC. Also, in mammalian cells, ceramide plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cellular senescence (25Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 26Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to test whether PHC has an equivalent function in yeast cells and, if so, whether PHC has a comparable potency to PHS. For this purpose, we used C2-PHC because we reasoned C26-PHC, a natural PHC to yeast, will not be efficiently delivered into cells due to strong hydrophobicity, and short chain ceramides such as C2- and C6-ceramide have been commonly used in mammalian studies. C2-PHC (20 μm) had little effect on yeast growth (Fig. 2 B). We then tested other sphingolipid derivatives that are structurally similar and/or metabolically related. At concentrations up to 100 μm, KDS and STA did not inhibit growth (Fig.2 B). It was noteworthy that DHS, at the 20 μmconcentration, showed weak but some degree of growth inhibitory effects (see below). In a previous study, PHS was shown to inhibit the growth of tryptophan-auxotrophic yeast strains and to inhibit tryptophan import (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, it was hypothesized that a primary cause of growth inhibition by PHS is inhibition of tryptophan import activities. Again, it was not shown whether inhibition of tryptophan import was specific for PHS; to the contrary, both PHS and DHS were suggested to be equally active in inhibiting tryptophan import (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We believe this is an important issue that needs to be resolved because it could help determine whether such inhibition involves specific mechanisms. Therefore, we measured tryptophan import activity in the presence of PHS or various analogs that were used for studying the specificity of growth inhibition. In this test, only PHS inhibited tryptophan import, whereas other analogs including DHS, KDS, C2-PHC, and STA (20 μm each) did not inhibit tryptophan import (Fig.3 A, left panel). The inhibition of tryptophan uptake activity by PHS primarily reflected the decrease in the levels of the general amino acid permease (Gap1) rather than a tryptophan-specific permease (Tat2; Fig. 3 B, right panel). Again, the decrease in the permease protein was specific for PHS, compatible with the decrease in the uracil permease levels by PHS (1Chung N. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). While experimenting with various different auxotrophic strains for PHS sensitivity, we found that, in addition to tryptophan-auxotrophic strains (trp1), certain other auxotrophs are also sensitive to PHS. At 20 μm PHS, any tryptophan-prototrophic strains (TRP1), regardless of other auxotrophic status, grew as well as they did in control medium (Fig. 3 B). Leucine-prototrophic strains (LEU2) were also found to be somewhat resistant to PHS. At 60 μm PHS, theTRP1 strains became partially sensitive and theLEU2 strains became as sensitive as auxotrophic strains. TheTRP1 LEU2 strains were more resistant to PHS than theTRP1 leu2 and trp1 LEU2 strains. However, all auxotrophic strains showed some degree of sensitivity to PHS, and only the TRP1 LEU2 HIS4 fully prototrophic strains showed full resistance to 60 μm PHS. From these observations, we concluded that the greater the auxotrophic requirement of a strain, the more sensitive it is to PHS. These results also suggested that PHS inhibits the import of multiple nutrients. To test this idea, we measured nutrient import activities for leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and uracil in the presence of 20 μm PHS (Fig. 3 C). PHS inhibited the import of all four nutrients. To assess the physiological significance of the above pharmacological studies, we next examined the specificity of growth inhibition by genetically modulating the levels of cellular PHS. As shown in Fig. 1, exogenous DHS could be converted to PHS, PHS to PHC, and PHC to PHS. The possibilities of such interconversions raise the question as to which endogenous sphingolipid derivative mediates the growth-inhibitory effects of exogenous PHS. Because we saw that at higher concentrations (40–60 μm) DHS inhibited growth to some extent, we first tried to resolve whether DHS is a bona fide inhibitor of yeast growth, or whether its conversion to PHS is necessary for growth inhibition. To answer this question, we used a mutant strain that is defective in the conversion of DHS to PHS. In previous studies (27Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11062-11068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,28Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the syr2 mutant strain was shown to be defective in the C-4 hydroxylation of DHS and dihydroceramide to PHS and PHC, respectively, and the SYR2 gene was proposed to encode a lipid hydroxylase. Therefore, we first determined whether thesyr2Δ mutant strain shows defects in the conversion of DHS to PHS in the JK9-3d strain background. When we tried to analyze sphingolipid profiles of the syr2Δ and isogenic wild-type strain using TLC after [3H]DHS labeling, we could hardly detect differences between the wild-type and the syr2Δstrains (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and3). The levels of DHS in the syr2Δ strain seemed to be higher than in the wild-type strain. In these studies, we could not detect free PHS, probably due to its rapid conversion to PHC or due to lack of direct hydroxylation of DHS. Therefore, we attempted to resolve this issue and trap PHS by utilizing fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase (24Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales Jr., T.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the wild-type strain was capable of converting DHS to PHS and accumulated PHS in the presence of fumonisin B1, whereas the syr2Δ strain failed to accumulate PHS. In other words, the use of fumonisin B1 enabled us to detect the accumulation of PHS in the wild-type strain but not in thesyr2Δ strain (Figs. 1 and 4 A, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, syr2 is defective in hydroxylation of exogenous DHS to PHS. If DHS is by itself sufficient for growth inhibition, this should be the case regardless of the status of the SYR2 gene. On the other hand, if DHS needs to be first converted to PHS to inhibit growth, DHS would inhibit the growth of only wild-type cells but notsyr2Δ mutant cells. Indeed, whereas PHS (20 and 40 μm) inhibited both the wild-type and syr2Δmutant strains, DHS (40 μm) only inhibited growth of the wild-type strain and failed to inhibit growth of the syr2Δstrain (Fig. 4 B). We have found that DHS is as efficiently as or better taken up than PHS by yeast cells and comparably metabolized into complex sphingolipids (data not shown). It is therefore unlikely that the requirement for high concentration of DHS for growth inhibition was due to slow internalization of DHS compared with PHS. Tetrad analysis of a syr2Δ /SYR2heterozygous diploid strain showed co-segregation of thesyr2Δ allele with resistance to 40 μm DHS. Also, when the syr2Δ mutant strain was restored with a single copy of the wild-type SYR2 gene, it became as sensitive to DHS as the original wild-type strain (data not shown). In conclusion, DHS does not by itself inhibit growth and requires conversion to PHS by Syr2p. Next we attempted to distinguish between PHS and PHC. PHS can be converted to PHC by ceramide synthase, and PHC can be reverted to PHS by ceramidase (24Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales Jr., T.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Treating cells with an excessive amount of PHS could shift the equilibrium toward PHC making it difficult to distinguish the effects of PHS from those of PHC. In the above section, we showed that C2-PHC only weakly inhibited growth, but the data were not conclusive since C2-PHC may not be an adequate substitute for the long chain natural PHC. To avoid using natural C26-PHC, which might cause solubility and permeability problems, we looked for other ways to differentiate the effects of PHS from those of PHC. The production of PHC requires two substrates: PHS and C24-or C26-very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) (Fig. 1). Therefore, if the supply of VLCFA is blocked, there will be less production of PHC from PHS even when PHS is present in excess. VLCFA is the result of serial addition of acetyl groups to the more commonly found normal length fatty acids like palmitic acid (C16). The key steps in thi"

We have previously shown that activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is necessary for PDGFR-induced DNA synthesis in these cells. The mechanism by which PI 3-kinase stimulates DNA synthesis is not known. One target of PI 3-kinase, Akt serine threonine kinase, regulates survival of many cells by inhibiting the actions of certain proapoptotic proteins. In this study, we investigated the role of Akt in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. PDGF increased Akt serine threonine kinase activity in a time- and PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Expression of dominant negative Akt by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer blocked PDGF-induced activation of endogenous Akt in mesangial cells, resulting in complete inhibition of DNA synthesis. On the other hand, inhibition of MAPK attenuated PDGF-induced DNA synthesis only partially. Inhibition of Akt also attenuated PDGF-inducedc-fos gene transcription, with concomitant inhibition of Elk-1-dependent transcription, indicating positive regulation of this early response gene by Akt. To further determine the role of Akt in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis, we investigated its effect on cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). PDGF stimulated CDK2 activity in mesangial cells and decreased the level of p27kip1cyclin kinase inhibitor protein. Expression of dominant negative Akt increased p27kip1 protein and resulted in inhibition of CDK2 activity. The increase in p27kip1 expression in response to Akt kinase inhibition was due to increased transcription of the p27kip1 gene. p27kip1 transcription similarly was decreased by expression of constitutively active Akt kinase in mesangial cells. These data provide the first evidence that Akt kinase regulates PDGF-induced DNA synthesis by regulating CDK2 activity and define Akt-mediated inhibition of transcription of p27kip1 as one of the mechanisms for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. Proliferation of mesangial cells requires platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR)-mediated signal transduction.

The increase in p27kip1 expression in response to Akt kinase inhibition was due to increased transcription of the p27kip1 gene. p27kip1 transcription similarly was decreased by expression of constitutively active Akt kinase in mesangial cells. These data provide the first evidence that Akt kinase regulates PDGF-induced DNA synthesis by regulating CDK2 activity and define Akt-mediated inhibition of transcription of p27kip1 as one of the mechanisms for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. platelet-derived growth factor platelet-derived growth factor receptor β mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol cyclin-dependent kinase 2 cyclin kinase inhibitor hemagglutinin multiplicity of infection myelin basic protein mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase Mesangial cells constitute one-third of the renal glomerular cell population. These cells proliferate in response to growth factor and cytokines during glomerular injury. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)1 increases proliferation of mesenchymal cells including mesangial cells (1Abboud H.E. Ann. Rev.

Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 573-590Google Scholar). Mice null for PDGF B-chain or PDGF receptor β (PDGFR) fail to develop mesangial cells, suggesting the requirement of PDGFR-mediated signal transduction in the development and survival of mesangial cells in the kidney (3Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 4Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar).Binding of PDGF to its receptor induces dimerization of the receptor molecules, with concomitant increase in intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in autophosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFR serves as the docking site for many signal transducing molecules that include proteins with Src homology 2, PTB, and PDZ domains (5Heldin C-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 6Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8352-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, activated PDGFR induces two major kinase cascades, Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk1/2 type mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (5Heldin C-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heldin C-H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). MAPK has been shown to be involved in PDGF-induced mitogenesis in fibroblasts (8Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). However, the requirement of MAPK in PDGF-induced mesangial cell proliferation has not been tested. The lipid-modifying enzyme PI 3-kinase, which contains Src homology 2 domains, binds directly to the phosphorylated tyrosines 740 and 751 of the PDGFR (2Abboud H.E. Bhandari B. Ghosh Choudhury G. Bonventre J. Schlondorf D. Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 573-590Google Scholar, 5Heldin C-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of these two tyrosines demonstrated that binding and subsequent activation of PI 3-kinase is necessary for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (9Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Using pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, we have recently shown that PDGF-induced PI 3-kinase activity regulates proliferation of mesangial cells (10Ghosh Choudhury G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PI 3-kinase regulates PDGF-induced DNA synthesis is not known.One of the downstream targets of PI 3-kinase is the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB (Akt) (11Franke T.F. Yang S-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The D3 phosphorylated inositides, produced by the PDGF-activated PI 3-kinase, bind to the N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of Akt, leading to its translocation to the plasma membrane (12Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two serine threonine kinases, phosphoinositide-dependent kinases 1 and 2, phosphorylate threonine 308 and serine 473 residues of Akt in the activation loop and in the regulatory domain, respectively, leading to full activation (13Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar,14Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that Akt phosphorylates a spectrum of proteins regulating diverse biological activities. Phosphorylation of the proapoptotic proteins Bad, caspase 9, and the forkhead family of transcription factors inhibit their activities (15Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation and inactivation of proapoptotic proteins by Akt leads to inhibition of apoptosis (13Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase by Akt inhibits apoptosis of human vascular endothelial cells (18Fulton D. Gratton J-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 19Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima i. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). These studies have established a role for Akt in promoting cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. However, the role of Akt in cell proliferation has not been investigated directly. In this study, we show that MAPK partially attenuates PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. Inhibition of Akt kinase activity, by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of a dominant negative Akt, blocks PDGF-induced DNA synthesis completely. Inhibition of Akt attenuatesc-fos gene transcription by inhibition of Elk-1 transactivation. We also provide the first evidence that Akt regulates PDGF-induced cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity by modulating p27kip1 cyclin kinase inhibitor (CKI) gene transcription and protein expression.DISCUSSIONThese studies represent the first direct demonstration that Akt serine threonine kinase activity is required for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis and c-fos gene transcription in glomerular mesangial cells. Our data also provide the first evidence that Akt regulates PDGF-induced CDK2 activity by modulating the expression of the p27kip1 cyclin kinase inhibitor.Accumulating studies in human and experimental animals suggest that PDGF plays an important role in proliferative and inflammatory glomerular diseases (37Iida H. Seiferrt R. Alperrs C.E. Gronwald R.G.K. Phillips P.E. Pritzl P. Gordon K. Gow A.M. Ross R. Bowen-Pope D.F. Johnson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, increased expression of PDGF B-chain and PDGFR has been associated with experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, and administration of antibody against PDGF B-chain blocks proliferation of mesangial cells, leading to amelioration of the disease (37Iida H. Seiferrt R. Alperrs C.E. Gronwald R.G.K. Phillips P.E. Pritzl P. Gordon K. Gow A.M. Ross R. Bowen-Pope D.F. Johnson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1992; 175: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Increased activity of PDGFR in glomerular disease in adult animals is reminiscent of the requirement for PDGFR in mesangial cell development during embryogenesis (3Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 4Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). PDGF stimulates pleotrophic effects in glomerular mesangial cells, including activation of phospholipase C, PLA2 MAPK, and PI 3-kinase (5Heldin C-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heldin C-H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 10Ghosh Choudhury G. Karamitsos C.

Science. 1989; 242: 1564-1570Crossref Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that MAPK partially regulates PDGF-induced mitogenesis in these cells (Fig. 1). We reported previously that PI 3-kinase activity is required for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells (10Ghosh Choudhury G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although MAPK is partially regulated by PI 3-kinase in mesangial cells (10Ghosh Choudhury G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation of the former does not fully account for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 1). These data indicate that two signal transduction pathways, MAPK and PI 3-kinase, initiated by PDGF act together to induce the DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. It is possible that part of the effect of PI 3-kinase on PDGF-induced DNA synthesis may involve MAPK. However, PI 3-kinase plays the predominant role in PDGF-induced mitogenesis (10Ghosh Choudhury G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now have demonstrated that PI 3-kinase employs its downstream target, Akt serine threonine kinase, to elicit this biological response (Fig. 2 and Fig.3).Akt kinase activity is stimulated by a variety of extracellular signals including growth factors and cytokines, T-cell receptor activation and integrin engagement, hyperosmolarity, hypoxia, and heat shock (42King W.G.

Known substrates of Akt include glycogen synthase kinase 3, mTOR, insulin receptor substrate 1, BAD, caspase 9, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, IκB kinase, Raf-1 protein kinase, Rac 1, phosphodiesterase 3B, BRCA1, and forkhead transcription factors (15Datta S.R.

Although this broad group of proteins has diverse biological responses, the role of Akt in relation to inhibition of apoptosis has been studied most extensively. These results are based on the observation that phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BAD leads to its quenching by 14-3-3 protein in cytosol, resulting in release of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (15Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4913) Google Scholar). However, recent results in different cell types indicate that phosphorylation of BAD by Akt is not sufficient to inhibit apoptosis (56Davis M.A. Lu Y. Fang X. Tang P. LaPushin R. Koul D. Bookstrin R. Stokoe D. Yung W.K.A. Mills G.B. Steck P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5285-5290PubMed Google Scholar, 57Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Kaay J.V.D. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P.

Another mechanism of cell survival is inhibition of caspase 9 activity following its phosphorylation by Akt (16Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 318-321Crossref Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). However, recently Akt phosphorylation of caspase 9 has been shown to be species-dependent. For instance, rat caspase 9 is not phosphorylated by Akt due to lack of a consensus phosphorylation site (60Fujita E. Jinbo A. Matuzaki H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These data argue against Akt-induced inhibition of caspase 9 as the major mechanism of cell survival. They are also consistent with our observation in rat mesangial cells that expression of dominant negative Akt, which blocks the endogenous Akt serine threonine kinase activity, does not affect cell viability. Since Akt can repress the genes that induce apoptosis via phosphorylation of the forkhead family transcription factors (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.J. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar), overexpression of dominant negative Akt may induce apoptosis by derepressing the transcription of these genes. This could explain why we observed inhibition of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in mesangial cells expressing dominant negative Akt (Fig.3 C). Activation of the caspases constitutes the common pathway that leads to apoptosis (61Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In the caspase cascade, the final executor protease is caspase 3. Therefore, we measured caspase 3 activity in lysates of mesangial cells using a fluorogenic peptide substrate. No difference in caspase activity was observed between mock- and Ad-DN Akt-infected cells (data not shown), indicating that overexpression of dominant negative Akt in mesangial cells does not induce apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that the inhibition of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis we observed in the presence of dominant negative Akt expression was not due to increased apoptosis of mesangial cells.One biological response to PDGF and many other growth factors is stimulation of early response genes, the activities of which are thought to be required for mitogenesis (27Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported earlier that PI 3-kinase regulates c-fos gene expression (29Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Since Akt is a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, it may be a candidate as the kinase that regulates the PDGF-inducedc-fos gene expression. Indeed, our data show that Akt activity modulates the PDGF-induced c-fos gene transcription in mesangial cells (Fig. 4 A). We showed previously that PDGF-stimulated c-fos gene transcription is mediated by the ETS domain transcription factor Elk-1 in mesangial cells (21Ghosh Choundhury G. Kim Y.-S. Simon M. Wozney J. Harris S. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10897-10902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Now we provide the first evidence that Elk-1-dependent transcription is regulated by Akt kinase (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that Akt regulation of c-fos gene expression may be due to Elk-1 transactivation.Activation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E-dependent kinases during early through late phase of G1 is required for cells to enter into S phase (30Singerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 31Sherr C.J. Roberts M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). Recent experiments, where cyclin D1 deficiency was functionally rescued by knocking in cyclin E, suggest that activation of CDK2, the only target of cyclin E, is necessary for the progression through the restriction point into S phase (32Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose this kinase in our study as the mediator of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. We show that PDGF increased CDK2 activity in mesangial cells (Fig. 5 A). In contrast to this observation, it was reported earlier that PDGF fails to increase CDK2 activity in Balb/c 3T3 cells (62Winston J. Dong F. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11260-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results indicate that cell type specificity of regulation of this kinase exists even with the same growth factor. Since CDK2 was activated by PDGF, and since CDK2 activity is required for passing through the G1 restriction point, we investigated whether CDK2 is the target of Akt kinase regulation. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of Akt blocked PDGF-induced CDK2 activity in mesangial cells (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that Akt serine threonine kinase regulates CDK2 activity in these cells.CDK2 activity can be modulated by the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21cip1 and p27kip1 (30Singerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 31Sherr C.J. Roberts M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). Studies in various cell types have shown that between these two CKIs, increased p27kip1abundance in quiescent cells is required for G1 arrest resulting from inhibition of CDK activity (62Winston J. Dong F. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11260-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 63Agarwal D. Hauser P. Mcpherson F. Dong F. Garcia A. Pledger W.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mitogens including PDGF have been shown to inhibit p27kip1 accumulation (66Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To confirm this observation, we also showed that the addition of PDGF decreased the level of p27kip1 in mesangial cells (Fig.5 C). Although quiescent mesangial cells contain increased p27kip1 protein compared with PDGF-treated cells, inhibition of Akt serine threonine kinase activity increased the amount of p27kip1 protein even further (Fig. 5, B andC). These data indicate that Akt serine threonine kinase negatively regulates p27kip1 expression in mesangial cells. It is interesting to note that another CKI, p21cip1, which also inhibits CDK2 activity, has been shown to be regulated by Akt in a positive manner (67Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8983-8995Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), suggesting that this kinase differentially regulates members of the same family of CKI.A major mechanism of p27kip1 protein expression is its degradation via proteasomal pathways (68Hengst L.

Phosphorylation of p27kip1 by CDK2 targets it for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (70Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of p27kip1 is also the target of 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation (71Trapasso F. Iuliano R. Boccia A. Stella A. Visconti R. Bruni P. Baldassare G. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9236-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since in mesangial cells both CDK2 and MAPK are stimulated by PDGF (Figs. 1 and 5 A), the reduced expression of p27kip1 protein in the presence of PDGF (Fig. 5 C) may be due to proteasomal degradation.A transcriptional regulation of p27kip1 has been described recently. AFX, a forkhead transcription factor, when overexpressed in cells lacking this protein, induced p27kip1 by increasing transcription (72Medema R.H. Kops G.J.P. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors are direct substrates of Akt, and phosphorylation by Akt inhibits their transcriptional activity (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.J.

Our data showing that PDGF stimulates Akt activity and reduces p27kip1transcription in mesangial cells (Figs. 2 and 6) indicated the presence of Akt-dependent transcriptional control of this CKI in these cells. In fact, inhibition of Akt kinase activity increased p27kip1 gene transcription (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, expression of constitutively active Akt blocked p27kip1transcription in mesangial cells (Fig. 6 B). Whether regulation of p27kip1 transcription by Akt is due to phosphorylation of FKHRL1 is yet to be established in mesangial cells. It has been shown that transfection of FKHRL1 into Ba/F3 pre-B cells induces apoptosis via increased expression"
https://openalex.org/W1977393834,"EphB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the Eph family and ephrin-B1 is one of its transmembrane ligands. In the embryo, EphB2 and ephrin-B1 participate in neuronal axon guidance, neural crest cell migration, the formation of blood vessels, and the development of facial structures and the inner ear. Interestingly, EphB2 and ephrin-B1 can both signal through their cytoplasmic domains and become tyrosine-phosphorylated when bound to each other. Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates EphB2 signaling and likely also ephrin-B1 signaling. Embryonic retina is a tissue that highly expresses both ephrin-B1 and EphB2. Although the expression patterns of EphB2 and ephrin-B1 in the retina are different, they partially overlap, and both proteins are substantially tyrosine-phosphorylated. To understand the role of ephrin-B1 phosphorylation, we have identified three tyrosines of ephrin-B1 as in vivo phosphorylation sites in transfected 293 cells stimulated with soluble EphB2 by using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. These tyrosines are also physiologically phosphorylated in the embryonic retina, although the extent of phosphorylation at each site may differ. Furthermore, many of the tyrosines of EphB2 previously identified as phosphorylation sites in 293 cells (Kalo, M. S., and Pasquale, E. B. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 14396-14408) are also phosphorylated in retinal tissue. Our data underline the complexity of ephrin-Eph bidirectional signaling by implicating many tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the ligand-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2072318475,"Stimulation of HIRcB fibroblasts with insulin leads to accumulation of active components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in endocytic compartments. However, the factors that regulate the mobilization of these components through the endocytic pathway and the relevance of this event to cellular signaling remain unclear. Here we report that Ras proteins are associated with lipid rafts in resting HIRcB fibroblasts. Ras is rapidly internalized into the endocytic compartment following stimulation with insulin. The redistribution of Ras is independent of its activation. Attachment of the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Ha-Ras to green fluorescent protein was sufficient to target this construct to the same loci as the endogenous Ras protein, indicating that Ras distribution is a consequence of the association of its lipid modified C terminus with membranes. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol delocalized Ras and blocked insulin-dependent Ras traffic. Cholesterol depletion also blocked insulin-dependent phosphorylation of MEK and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but had no effects on the translocation and activation of Raf-1. A second inhibitor of endocytosis, cytochalasin D, also blocked insulin-dependent MAPK phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that mobilization of active Raf-1 through the endocytic compartment is required for completion of the MAPK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2162278453,"Phospholipase D (PLD), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt are known to be involved in cellular signaling related to proliferation and cell survival. In this report, we provide evidence that PLD links sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-induced activation of the G protein-coupled EDG3 receptor to stimulation of PI3K and its downstream effector Akt in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. S1P stimulation of EDG3-overexpressing CHO cells but not vector-transfected cells induced activation of PLD, PI3K, and Akt in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Akt phosphorylation was prevented by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (2-(4-monrpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one), indicating that Akt activation was dependent on PI3K. S1P-induced activation of PI3K and Akt was abrogated by 1-butanol, which inhibited S1P-induced accumulation of phosphatidic acid by serving as a phosphatidyl group acceptor in the transphosphatidylation reaction catalyzed by PLD, whereas both PI3K and Akt activation were not inhibited by 2-butanol without such reaction. Co-expression of wild-type PLD2 with myc-Akt resulted in increased Akt activation in response to S1P. In contrast, co-expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD2 eliminated the S1P-induced Akt activation. The treatment of EDG3-expressing CHO cells with exogenous Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD, which caused an accumulation of phosphatidic acid, resulted in increases in PI3K activity and the phosphorylation of Akt, the latter of which was completely abolished by LY294002. Furthermore, S1P-induced membrane ruffling, which was dependent on PI3K and Rac, was inhibited by 1-butanol, but not by 2-butanol. These results demonstrate that PLD participates in the activation of PI3K and Akt stimulation of EDG3 receptor.

A potential role for S1P in cell proliferation and survival has been suggested based on its ability to antagonize the apoptosis-inducing effects of ceramide (32Goetzl E.J. Kong Y. Mei B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2049-2056PubMed Google Scholar) and to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase followed by activation of c-Fos, activations that are mediated via EDG3 and EDG5 (33An S. Zheng Y. Bleu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 288-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of S1P action underlying cell survival activity are not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that PLD participates in cell proliferation and antiapoptosis (34Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J.

However, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated that PI3K does play an important role in this signaling. More specifically, the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B has been found to be a critical downstream effector of PI3K in cell survival signaling (38Marte B., M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that S1P induces PI3K activation via EDG1, EDG3, and EDG5. S1P induced membrane ruffling and cell migration in a PI3K- and Rac-dependent manner (39Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PLD has also been shown to be involved in this membrane ruffling (40Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M.

Thus, it is of interest to determine whether PLD is involved in S1P-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and, if so, how. In the present study, we demonstrate that inhibition of PA accumulation and expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD2 strongly inhibit EDG3-mediated stimulation of PI3K and Akt, whereas exogenous PLD alone induces stimulation of PI3K and Akt. These observations indicate a novel role for PLD in the PI3K signaling pathway. Geneticin (G418) and Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD were obtained from Sigma, S1P was obtained from Matreya, Inc.

Antibodies to phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473) and Akt were obtained from New England Biolabs (Boston, MA), and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-PLD1 and anti-PLD2 antibodies were prepared as described previously (25Banno Y. Fujita H. Ono Y. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Kuzumaki N. Nozawa Y. J. Biol.

Monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10)-producing hybridoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence kit (ECL system) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Expression plasmids of wild-type human PLD1 and mouse PLD2 and their catalytically inactive mutants (K898R and K758R, respectively) in pCGN were kindly supplied by Dr. Michael A. Frohman (Institute for Cell and Developmental Biology, State University of New York), and Myc- and 6×His-tagged Akt plasmids (pUSE-myc-Akt) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified, CO2-controlled (5%) incubator. Before each experiment, cells were switched to the serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. Human EDG3 cDNA was cloned and ligated into expression vector pME18S as described previously (41Data S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). The stable transfectants of pME18S empty vector and pME18S-EDG3 were selected and maintained in the presence of 0.75 mg/ml G418 as described previously (42Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J.

For transient transfection experiments, cells were plated at 8 × 105 cells/plate in 60-mm plates and cultured for 24 h before transfection. Cells were incubated for 4 h with 2 ml of serum-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 3 μg of total DNA (1 μg of pUSE-myc-Akt and 2 μg of expression plasmid for a pCGN-wild-type or an inactive mutant of PLDs, or an empty vector) and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was changed to growth medium, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells were serum-starved by further incubation in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium for 24 h. Subconfluent cells were labeled for 24 h with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. Cells were washed and preincubated in HEPES-Tyrode buffer containing 0.3% 1-butanol (v/v) for 10 min. After stimulation of cells with S1P, the reactions were terminated by removing the assay buffer, followed by the immediate addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/methanol (2:5, v/v) mixture to the culture dishes. After extraction of cellular lipids, [3H]PBut was separated by TLC and measured as described previously (25Banno Y. Fujita H. Ono Y. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Kuzumaki N. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27385-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). [3H]PA was measured by the same method as described for the PBut formation, except that incubation was performed using HEPES-Tyrode buffer without 1-butanol. Cells were grown to subconfluence in 100-mm dishes and incubated in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium for an additional 24 h. Washed cells were then stimulated with S1P, harvested in an ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium cholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4), and then sonicated. Protein concentrations were assayed using the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation of Akt and the total amount of Akt were determined by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) and anti-Akt antibodies, respectively, and with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. After repeated washings, the antibodies were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system. Akt activity was assayed as described previously (43Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L.

Briefly, after treatment, cells were harvested in an ice-cold lysis buffer, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The lysate was incubated with 9E10 antibody against myc for 1 h and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose conjugated with anti-mouse rabbit IgG for 2 h. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer and then washed twice with a kinase buffer (20 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), respectively. The beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 0.4 mm Crosstide (Upstate Biotechnology) and 10 μl of ATP solution (0.5 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 75 mmMgCl2), and the reaction mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g, and 40 μl of the supernatant was then removed and placed in another tube. After 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant solution, the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant solution (40 μl) was spotted onto 2-cm2 pieces of P81 filter paper (Whatman), followed by extensive washing in 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid and then in acetone. Measurement of the associated radioactivity of the filter paper was carried out by liquid scintillation counting. After incubation with S1P, the cells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysate was incubated with 4 mg of PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 1 h and then incubated for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose conjugated with anti-mouse rabbit IgG as described by Ruderman et al. (44Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with a lysis buffer, once with 0.5 m LiCl/0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, once with distilled water, and then once with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The lipid kinase assay and lipid extraction were performed as described previously (45Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that micelles of PI were produced by sonication in an assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Phospholipids contained in the organic phase were separated by TLC in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (60:47:11:3.2, v/v). Spots containing [32P]PI3-phosphate (PI3P) were scraped off the plate and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cells cultured in 35-mm-diameter dishes on glass coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (39Okamoto H.

Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize F-actin. The cells were observed under a BX60 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). We first examined whether EDG3 mediated S1P-induced PLD activation. S1P stimulation increased PBut formation dose-dependently with a half-maximal effective concentration value of ∼10−7m in EDG3-CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1 A) and time-dependently with a plateau attained at 5 min (Fig.1 B). However, no significant increase in PBut formation was observed in response to S1P in vector-transfected control CHO-K1 cells. These results are indicative of EDG3 receptor-mediated PLD activation. S1P induced stimulation of the PI3K activity in time- and dose-dependent manners with a peak response at 5 min and a maximal concentration of 1 μm S1P, respectively (Fig.2, A and B). To assess the involvement of PLD in S1P-induced PI3K activation, we examined the effects of treatments with 1-butanol and 2-butanol on S1P-induced PI3K activation. In the presence of 1-butanol but not 2-butanol, PBut was efficiently produced at the expense of PA by the transphosphatidylation activity of PLD (Fig.3 A, top panel). This effect of 1-butanol was maximal at a concentration of 0.3% (v/v) (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). The presence of 1-butanol at 0.3% almost totally suppressed S1P-induced activation of PI3K (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, 2-butanol was without any effect on S1P-induced PI3K activation. These results indicate that the product of PLD, PA, is involved in S1P-induced PI3K activation.Figure 3Effects of 1-butanol and 2-butanol on PBut production and PI3K activation in S1P-stimulated EDG3-CHO-K1 cells. A, before stimulation with 1 μmS1P for 5 min, [3H]palmitate-labeled cells were incubated with different concentrations of 1-butanol or 2-butanol for 10 min. Production of PBut and PA was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three different experiments. B, before stimulation with 1 μm S1P for 5 min, EDG3-CHO-K1 cells were incubated with 1-butanol (0.3%) or 2-butanol (0.3%) for 10 min. The cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with PY-20 antibody. The immunocomplexes were assayed for PI3K activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are the mean ± SD of three different experiments in each duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4, S1P induced marked phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). The stimulatory effect of S1P on Akt phosphorylation was also dose-dependent, with a maximum response observed at 1 μm (Fig., 4B). Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (10 μm) suppressed S1P-induced Akt activation by >80% (Fig. 4 C), indicating that activation of Akt is mediated by PI3K. In contrast, PI3K inhibitors had no effect at all on S1P-induced PLD activation (Fig. 4 D). Treatment of cells with 1-butanol (0.3%) completely abolished S1P-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig.5 A), a finding that was consistent with inhibition by 1-butanol of S1P-induced PI3K activation (Fig. 3 B). The inhibition by 1-butanol of S1P-induced Akt activation was dependent on the concentration of 1-butanol (Fig.5 B), with a concentration-response relationship similar to those for PBut formation and inhibition of PA accumulation (Fig.3 A). 2-Butanol was again ineffective in inhibiting S1P-induced Akt activation. The involvement of PLD in S1P-induced Akt activation was further examined by transiently expressing wild-types and catalytically inactive mutants of PLD1 and PLD2. These catalytically inactive mutants have been shown to be devoid of activity both in vivo andin vitro when using phosphatidylcholine as a substrate, to be distributed intracellularly in a manner similar to that of the respective wild-type proteins, and to inhibit the activation of endogenous PLD when overexpressed (17Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the transfected cells, expression levels of transduced PLD gene products were higher than those of endogenous PLD1 and PLD2, as assessed by Western blotting analysis with specific anti-PLD1 and anti-PLD2 antibodies (Fig.6 A). We co-transfected cells with an expression vector for myc-tagged Akt and an expression vector for either the wild-type or the inactive mutant of PLD1 and PLD2 or the empty vector. We then immunoprecipitated myc-tagged Akt and performed an immunocomplex kinase assay using Crosstide as a substrate peptide. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the expression levels of myc-Akt protein in transfected cells were nearly identical among the samples, as assessed by Western blotting analysis with anti-Akt antibody. In vector-transfected cells, S1P stimulated Akt activity by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 6 C). Expression of wild-type PLD1 slightly increased basal and S1P-stimulated PLD1 activities. The effect of wild-type PLD2 expression was more prominent, resulting in an approximately 2-fold increase in S1P-stimulated Akt activity. Furthermore, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD2 almost completely abolished S1P-induced Akt activation. Expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD1 slightly inhibited basal and S1P-stimulated Akt activities. All of these results demonstrate that in EDG3-CHO-K1 cells, PA produced via the action of PLD2 rather than that of PLD1 participates in S1P-induced activation of Akt. S1P induced membrane ruffling in EDG3-CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 7, a andb). This action of S1P was inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 (data not shown), indicating the dependence of S1P-induced membrane ruffling on PI3K. 1-Butanol (0.3%) abolished S1P-induced membrane ruffling (Fig. 7 c), whereas 2-butanol was without effect (Fig. 7 d). These observations are consistent with the finding that PLD mediates S1P-induced PI3K activation (Fig.3 B). To gain further insight into the link between PLD and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, we examined the effects of PA generation induced by exogenous S. chromofuscus PLD (PLDSc) on the activities of PI3K and Akt. Treatment of cells with PLDSc caused increases in PA production in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8 A). The maximal PA generation by 10 units/ml PLDSc was ∼80% of that by 1 μm S1P (Fig. 8 B). As shown in Fig.9, treatment with PLDSc induced stimulation of PI3K activity in a dose-dependent manner, with activity reaching a maximum at 10 units/ml. The maximal increase in PI3K activity induced by PLDSc was ∼80% of that by 1 μm S1P; this relative potency of PLDSc was similar to that of PLDSc in PA generation. Treatment of cells with PLDSc also stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.10). The time course and dose-response relationship for Akt stimulation by PLDSc were similar to those of PA formation (compare Figs. 8 and 10). The PLDSc -induced Akt phosphorylation was abolished by pretreatment with LY294002, indicating that PLDSc-induced Akt activation is mediated by PI3K.Figure 9Stimulation of PI3K activity induced by exogenous S. chromofuscus PLD in EDG3-CHO-K1 cells. EDG3-CHO-K1 cells were incubated with various concentrations of PLDSc for 10 min, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20).

The tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) limit the activity of MMPs, which suggests their use for cancer gene therapy. Here we report that systemic administration of naked TIMP-4 DNA significantly inhibited Wilms' tumor growth in nude mice. TIMP-4, whose expression was lost in Wilms' tumor, inhibited the growth of G401 Wilms' tumor cells at a concentration lower than those required for MMP inhibition. This inhibition was associated with internalization of exogenous recombinant TIMP-4. Electroporation-mediated intramuscular injection of TIMP-4 expression plasmid resulted in sustained plasma TIMP-4 levels and significant tumor suppression. Our data demonstrate a tumor suppressive effect of TIMP-4 against Wilms' tumor and the potential utility of intramuscular delivery of TIMP gene for treatment of kidney derived cancers."

Palmitoylation of the V1aR occurs within the Cys371/Cys372 couplet located in the proximal C-terminal tail domain. Substitution of these residues in a [C371G/C372G]V1aR construct effectively disrupted receptor palmitoylation. Our data also indicate an additional palmitoylation site at another locus in the receptor, as yet undefined. [3H]Palmitate incorporation was agonist-sensitive and increased following exposure to [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP). Given the hydrophobic nature of the acyl chain, palmitoylation of the C terminus of G-protein-coupled receptors has been proposed to form an additional intracellular loop. Consequently, palmitoylation/depalmitoylation will have a profound effect on the local conformation of this domain. The V1aR palmitoylation status regulated both phosphorylation and sequestration of the receptor, and furthermore, palmitoylation, phosphorylation, and sequestration were all regulated by AVP. The palmitoylation-defective construct [C371G/C372G]V1aR exhibited decreased phosphorylation compared to wild-type V1aR, under both basal and AVP-stimulated conditions, and was sequestered at a faster rate. In contrast, the binding of four different classes of ligand and intracellular signaling were not affected by palmitoylation.

Palmitoylation is a reversible covalent lipid modification, occurring in the post-endoplasmic reticulum or pre-Golgi compartment, involving the attachment of a C16 fatty acyl chain to cysteinyl residues of a nascent protein via a thioester bond (3Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Investigating the role of palmitoylation has been undertaken for several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).1 However, the functional ramifications of palmitoylation are not predictable. Although no reliable consensus sequence for palmitoylation has been identified as yet, it has been found that many GPCRs contain one or more modified cysteine residues in the proximal region of the C-terminal tail (Fig. 1). Exceptions do occur. For example, the metabotropic glutamate mGluR1α receptor is not acylated (4Alaluf S. Mulvihill E.R. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in the human α2C-adrenergic receptor a phenylalanine replaces the conserved cysteine (5Regan J.W. Kobilka T.S.

Moreover, the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor completely lacks a C-terminal domain (6Davidson J.S. Flanagan C.A. Becker I.I. Illing N. Sealfon S.C. Millar R.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the precise role of palmitoylation for each GPCR, it is important to establish which cysteinyl residues are actually modified. Palmitoylation has been studied for a number of GPCRs, including those for biogenic amines, peptides, glycoproteins, and metabotropic receptors (Fig. 1). These studies can be divided into three main categories dictated by the rigor of the investigation: (i) GPCRs that have been shown directly to be palmitoylated by [3H]palmitate labeling and the locus of the modification established by mutagenesis of defined cysteinyl residues; (ii) GPCRs that have been shown to be palmitoylated but the precise locus of the modification has not been defined; and (iii) mutagenesis of cysteinyl residues within GPCRs that are merely putative palmitoylation sites, without establishing that they are actually derivatized. GPCRs that have been shown to be palmitoylated at specific cysteine(s) include rhodopsin (7Ovchinnikov Y.A. Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S.

The hydrophobic nature of the acyl chain suggests that the palmitate moiety of GPCRs would embed into the membrane to form a fourth receptor intracellular loop.

The neurohypophysial peptide hormone [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP) generates a plethora of physiological responses including increasing blood pressure, antidiuresis, glycogenolysis, adrenocorticotropin secretion and regulating testis function, insulin secretion, and mitogenesis in some cells (32Howl J. Wheatley M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The majority of these effects are mediated by the vasopressin V1areceptor subtype (V1aR) with the exception of antidiuresis (V2 receptor subtype, V2R) and adrenocorticotropin secretion (V1b receptor subtype, V1bR). In this study, we demonstrate that the V1aR is palmitoylated at the Cys371/Cys372 couplet within the C-terminal domain, and we establish that this modification is agonist-regulated and has biological significance. Disruption of V1aR palmitoylation resulted in decreased receptor phosphorylation and increased the rate of agonist-induced internalization but did not affect ligand binding, intracellular signaling, or receptor expression.

The two Cys residues (Cys371 and Cys372) corresponding to the putative palmitoylation site (Fig. 1) were mutated both individually and in combination. The Cys residues were mutated to Gly using a polymerase chain reaction approach (33Hawtin S.R. Wesley V.J. Parslow R.A. Patel S. Wheatley M.

For mammalian expression, the wild-type and mutant V1aRs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) utilizing unique 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI restriction sites. HEK 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Iscove's DMEM containing hypoxanthine (100 μm), thymidine (16 μm), 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% v/v CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. Briefly, the DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitate, containing 10 μg of plasmid cDNA for each dish, was prepared 30 min before use. After incubation for 16 h, the medium was replaced by growth medium, and cells were incubated for a further 48 h before harvesting. HEK 293T cell membranes were prepared as described previously (35Wheatley M. Howl J. Yarwood N.J. Davies A.R.L. Parslow R.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 73: 305-332PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit with BSA as standard. Binding assays were essentially as described previously (36Howl J. Wheatley M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,37Howl J. Langel Ü. Hawtin S.R. Valkna A. Yarwood N.J. Saar K. Wheatley M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) comprising membranes (50–300 μg of protein) diluted in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO2)2, 1 mg/ml BSA; pH 7.4), [[3,4,5-3H]Phe3]AVP (0.3–0.7 nm), and competing ligand at the concentration indicated in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Nonspecific binding was defined by a saturating concentration of unlabeled ligand (1 μm). After incubation for 90 min at 30 °C to establish equilibrium, bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Membrane pellets were washed twice with water and solubilized with 50 μl of Soluene 350 (Packard Instrument Co.) prior to addition of 1 ml of HiSafe3TM (Wallac) liquid scintillation mixture for counting. HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106cells/well in poly-d-lysine-treated 6-well plates and transfected as described above. AVP-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates was assayed as described previously (38Howl J. Rudge S.A. Lavis R.A. Davies A.R.L. Parslow R.A. Hughes P.J. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Wheatley M.

Essentially, 24 h post-transfection, medium was replaced with serum-free inositol-free DMEM containing 2.5 μCi/ml 2-myo-[3H]inositol. After 36 h at 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min, followed by the addition of AVP at the concentration indicated. Incubations were terminated by the adding 0.5 ml of 5% (v/v) perchloric acid containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml phytic acid hydrolysate. Cells were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants neutralized on ice with 1.2 m KOH, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm HEPES, and loaded onto 0.8-ml Bio-Rad AG1-X8 columns (formate form). After elution of inositol (10 ml water) and glycerophosphoinositol (10 ml of 25 mmNH4COOH), a mixed inositol phosphate fraction containing inositol mono-, bis-, tris-, and tetrakisphosphates was eluted (10 ml of 1.25 m NH4COOH containing 0.1 mHCOOH). Radioactivity was determined by the addition of 10 ml of Ultima-FloTM AF scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co.). CHO-K1 cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method as described above for HEK 293T cells. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized, diluted with selection medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and distributed in 100-mm plates. After 10–14 days, G418-resistant clones were picked using cloning rings (Sigma) and seeded into 48-well plates. Clones were expanded in 6-well plates and screened for the presence of the V1aR by ligand binding and second messenger assays. Clones containing the V1aR were expanded in 96-well plates to obtain single cell clones and re-screened. CHO cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 16 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, after which each well received 0.5 ml of binding buffer (described above) containing 2% (w/v) BSA, 1–2 nm[3H]AVP in the presence (nonspecific) or absence (total) of 1 μm AVP. Plates were incubated for 6 h on ice in the cold room before removal of the medium by aspiration. After two rinses with ice-cold PBS, 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH was added to each well to extract radioactivity. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the fluid from the plates was transferred to scintillation vials containing 8 ml of HiSafe3 scintillant mixture for counting. CHO cells were labeled with 400 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid in 1 ml of DMEM containing 1% (v/v) FBS for 16 h. The palmitic acid was initially dried under a stream of N2 before sequential dissolution in a minimum volume of Me2SO and finally in DMEM (1% v/v final concentration). Immunoprecipitation and analysis of vasopressin receptors was essentially as described previously (40Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized by the addition of 0.7 ml of RIPA buffer (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmEDTA, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.1% v/v SDS, 0.5% w/v deoxycholic acid) to each well on ice for 15 min. Solubilized receptors (600 μl) were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1 h at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were separated by incubating the mixture with protein A-Sepharose beads (180 μl) for 15 min at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and washed three times with ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA). Samples were adjusted for equivalent receptor number by whole cell binding assay (described above) to CHO cells under identical conditions. Samples were denatured by incubation at 65 °C for 2 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and resolved by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. The polyacrylamide gel was treated with EnhanceTM (Packard Instrument Co.) and dried, and radioactive bands were visualized by exposure to Kodak X-Omat film for 5 weeks at −70 °C. To examine the effects of AVP on palmitic acid incorporation, pre-labeled cells were incubated with 10 μm AVP for 15 min at 37 °C prior to receptor solubilization. CHO cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105cells/well. After 16 h, cells were treated with 1 μmAVP at 37 °C to promote agonist-induced receptor internalization. After appropriate time intervals, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS on ice to remove excess ligand and terminate sequestration. Ligand was stripped from receptors by exposing cells for two rapid 40-s acid washes, pH 5.0, with 5 mm acetic acid, 150 mmNaCl, followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS to restore physiological pH to 7.4. The number of receptors at the cell surface was assayed by whole cell ligand binding as described above. CHO cells were plated onto 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. After 16 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Krebs buffer, followed by the addition of 50 μCi/well of [32P]H3PO4. After 2 h at 37 °C, cells were exposed to 10 μmAVP for 15 min and then chilled on ice and washed with PBS. The receptor proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated as described above and analyzed by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Radioligand binding results are expressed as a percentage of the control (i.e. specific binding in the absence of the competing ligand). IC50 values were determined by non-linear regression after the fitting of Langmuir binding isotherms to experimentally determined data using the Fig. P. Program (Biosoft, Milltown, NJ). Dissociation constants (Kd) and concentration of receptor sites (Bmax) were calculated from IC50values according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (41Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar), using the experimentally determined value of affinity of [[3,4,5-3H[Phe3]AVP for each construct. EC50 values were determined by non-linear regression after fitting of logistic sigmoidal curves to experimental data. All data are quoted as the mean of three or more experiments ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. The V1aR possesses a cysteine couplet in the proximal region of the intracellular C-terminal tail domain. By analogy with other GPCRs, the location of these residues close to the seventh transmembrane domain suggests that Cys371 and Cys372 are putative palmitoylation sites (Figs. 1 and2). To assess the role of these cysteines in V1aR function, we constructed a series of mutant receptors in which the cysteines were replaced by glycine, individually and in combination. The C371G, C372G, and C371G/C372G receptor constructs generated were pharmacologically characterized after transient expression in HEK 293T cells and compared with wild-type V1aR. All receptor constructs were expressed at the same level of ∼0.5–1.5 pmol/mg protein (TableI). Four different classes of ligand were used to probe the pharmacology of the mutant receptors: (i) the cyclic natural agonist, AVP; (ii) cyclic antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2AVP; (iii) linear antagonist, PhAcD-Tyr(Me)2Arg6Tyr(NH2)9AVP; and (iv) non-peptide antagonist, SR 49059 (42Serradeil-Le Gal C.

The competition binding curves from these radioligand binding studies are shown in Fig.3. The Kd values are presented in Table I, corrected for radioligand occupancy. These data established that substitution of Cys371 and Cys372, either individually or in combination, produced only minor effects on the affinity of all four classes of ligand tested.Table IPharmacological profile of wild-type and mutant vasopressin receptorsLigandBinding affinities Kd(nm)V1aRC371GC372GC371G/C372GAVP0.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.7PhAcD-Tyr(Me)2Arg6Tyr(NH2)9AVP0.3 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2AVP0.6 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.2SR 490591.3 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.5Receptor expression (Bmax) (pmol/mg protein)0.8 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.4Wild-type and mutant V1aRs were expressed in HEK 293T cells and tested for their ability to bind AVP receptor ligands.

(n = 3) of three replicates. It was also important to establish if disruption of the cysteine couplet in the C-terminal tail of the V1aR affected the intracellular signaling capability of the receptor. The C371G, C372G, and C371G/C372G mutant V1aRs were characterized with respect to AVP-induced accumulation of InsP-InsP4. From the dose-response curves presented in Fig.4a, it can be seen that following challenge by AVP, all of the mutant V1aRs activated phosphoinositidase C in a manner comparable with wild-type receptor. In each case, maximum stimulation was observed at 10 nm AVP with EC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 nm (Fig. 4b). Consequently, ablation of the cysteine couplet in the proximal domain of the C terminus of the V1aR did not perturb either the ligand binding or intracellular signaling characteristics of the receptor. Prior to preparation of stable cell lines, a V1aR construct was engineered that incorporated a 9-residue influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) inserted immediately after the initiation methionine (Fig. 2). This sequence is recognized by the 12CA5 antibody and was introduced to facilitate downstream analysis. We have established previously that introduction of this sequence at this locus in the V1aR does not perturb ligand recognition or intracellular signaling (34Hawtin S.R. Wheatley M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 437SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cell lines were prepared exhibiting (i) stable expression of the HA epitope-tagged wild-type V1aR, and (ii) stable expression of the HA epitope-tagged C371G/C372G mutant. These were screened for both [3H]AVP binding and second messenger generation. The stable cell lines selected expressed the two receptor constructs at the same expression level of ∼2.5 pmol/mg protein.

https://openalex.org/W1985281162,"Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that noncovalently associates with a variety of cytokine receptors. Here we show that the in vitro translated N-terminal domains of Jak1 are sufficient for binding to a biotinylated peptide comprising the membrane-proximal 73 amino acids of gp130, the signal-transducing receptor chain of interleukin-6-type cytokines. By the fold recognition approach amino acid residues 36–112 of Jak1 were predicted to adopt a β-grasp fold, and a structural model was built using ubiquitin as a template. Substitution of Tyr107 to alanine, a residue conserved among Jaks and involved in hydrophobic core interactions of the proposed β-grasp domain, abrogated binding of full-length Jak1 to gp130 in COS-7 transfectants. By further mutagenesis we identified the loop 4 region of the Jak1 β-grasp domain as essential for gp130 association and gp130-mediated signal transduction. In Jak1-deficient U4C cells reconstituted with the loop 4 Jak1 mutants L80A/Y81A and Δ(Tyr81–Ser84), the interferon-γ, interferon-α, and interleukin-6 responses were similarly impaired. Thus, loop 4 of the β-grasp domain plays a role in the association of Jak1 with both class I and II cytokine receptors. Taken together the structural model and the mutagenesis data provide further insight into the interaction of Janus kinases with cytokine receptors."

However, the mechanisms that regulate the intestinal barrier function in response to IL-15 and the involved subunits of the IL-15 ligand-receptor system are unknown. We determined the IL-2Rβ subunit and IL-15-dependent regulation of tight junction-associated proteins in the human intestinal epithelial cell line T-84. The IL-2Rβ subunit was expressed and induced signal transduction in caveolin enriched rafts in intestinal epithelial cells. IL-15-mediated tightening of intestinal epithelial monolayers correlated with the enhanced recruitment of tight junction proteins into Triton X-100-insoluble protein fractions. IL-15-mediated up-regulation of ZO-1 and ZO-2 expression was independent of the IL-2Rβ subunit, whereas the phosphorylation of occludin and enhanced membrane association of claudin-1 and claudin-2 by IL-15 required the presence of the IL-2Rβ subunit. Recruitment of claudins and hyperphosphorylated occludin into tight junctions resulted in a more marked induction of tight junction formation in intestinal epithelial cells than the up-regulation of ZO-1 and ZO-2 by itself. The regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier function by IL-15 involves IL-2Rβ-dependent and -independent signaling pathways leading to the recruitment of claudins, hyperphosphorylated occludin, ZO-1, and ZO-2 into the tight junctional protein complex.

Although it is not clear whether intestinal barrier dysfunction is involved in the initiation or is the result of intestinal inflammation, it is likely that dysfunction of the intestinal barrier would perpetuate intestinal inflammatory responses. Cytokines, which regulate intestinal immune response, may perturb the intestinal barrier or could contribute to mechanisms that may have evolved to rapidly seal the intestinal monolayer to limit the influx of highly antigenic substances into the intestinal lamina propria.

However, the expression of the IL-15Rα subunit in a wide variety of different tissues suggests that the functional role of IL-15 is not limited to the regulation of lymphoid cells (30Anderson D.M.

Nevertheless, it is not clear whether IL-15 contributes to the perpetuation of inflammation or the regulation of intestinal tissue repair. Furthermore, IL-15 may be an important regulator of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. IL-15 is a potent activator of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (34Ebert E.C.

Nevertheless, T-84 cells respond to stimulation with IL-15 with an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) (9Stevens A.C. Matthews J. Andres P. Baffis V. Zheng X.X. Chae D.W. Smith J. Strom T.B. Maslinski W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1201-G1208PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the intestinal barrier function by IL-15 have not been determined. To study the regulation of tight junction formation mediated through the IL-15 ligand receptor system in intestinal epithelial cells, we stable transfected T-84 cells with IL-2Rβ and characterized the subsequent basal and IL-15-mediated regulation of tight junction-associated proteins. Human recombinant IL-15 was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the human IL-2Rβ was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Blocking antibodies directed against the IL-2Rβ subunit (MIK1β) were purchased from Accurate Chemical & Scientific Co. (Westbury, NY), and control mouse IgG2A was obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). For Western blot analysis, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To generate an expression vector encoding the IL-2Rβ subunit, cDNAs encoding extracellular and intracellular regions were subcloned separately. Reverse transcriptase-PCR to generate the cDNA for the NH2-terminal region of the IL-2Rβ subunit was carried out with reverse transcribed RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the primer pair 5′-CAG CAC CGG GGA GGA CTG GA-3′ and 5′-CGC CAG GGC TGA AGG ACG AT-3′ for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and theBamHI/SacI fragment was released for ligation. To generate the COOH-terminal region of the IL-2Rβ cDNA, nested PCR was carried out for 20 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min with first sets of primers of 5′-CTG CAA GGC GAG TTC ACG AC-3′ and 5′-AGC AGC AGT GGA GGT TTG GA-3′. A second PCR was carried out using a 1:100 dilution of the first PCR product as a template for 30 cycles with the second set of primers (5′-GGC TTT TGG CTT CAT CT-3′ and 5′-AGC TGC AAC TGG ACA CTG AG-3′) at 94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript KS+, and the SacI/XhoI fragment was released. Extracellular and intracellular parts of IL-2Rβ cDNA were ligated at the SacI site and ligated into a BamHI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Sequence was confirmed in both directions using the dideoxy termination method. The human colon cancer derived cell lines T-84 and Caco-2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T-84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1+/IL-2Rβ construct. IL-2Rβ subunit stable transfectants, designated T-84β, were established by selection in medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 weeks. T-84β cells and parental T-84 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well and were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of various concentration of recombinant human IL-15 at 37 °C for 24–72 h. Proliferation was assessed by MTS assay using CellTiter 96 Aqueous kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each assay was performed in triplicate. 20 μl of a fresh mixture of MTS tetrazolium compound and phenazine methosulfate was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The amount of formazan corresponds to the number of viable cells and was measured at an absorbance of 490 nm by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Wells containing medium, but no cells, were subtracted as background from the raw absorbance values. For sequential TER measurements, T-84 monolayers were maintained on 24-well Transwell collagen-treated permeable supports (Corning Coster, Cambridge, MA). We determined the IL-2Rβ-dependent regulation of TER during the assembly of tight junctions after replating T-84 cells to model the reconstitution of the intestinal epithelial barrier function during in intestinal wound healing. T-84 cells were plated at a concentration of 1.5 × 106/well. The cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IL-15 24 h later in the presence or absence of anti-IL-2Rβ or control antibodies, and the TER measurements were carried out at the indicated time points in triplicate samples. Millicell-ERS epithelial volt-ohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT) was utilized under temperature-controlled conditions at 37 °C with electrodes reproducibly placed. TER values were calculated by subtracting the contribution of the bare filter and medium. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. To isolate Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble protein fractions, confluent T-84 cell monolayers grown on 10-cm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, lysed in Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm sodium fluoride), and then passed through a 21-gauge needle ten times. The lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was considered the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. The pellet was solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer containing 1% SDS using an ultrasonic disintegrator, cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and referred to as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. The protein concentration of each sample was quantified by the Bradford method. Glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains, or detergent-insoluble glycolipid rafts, were isolated as described before with minor modifications (39Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 40Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 41Muehlhoefer A. Saubermann L.J. Gu X.

Four dishes of T-84 or T-84β96 cells (diameter, 10 cm) were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmMES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the lysate was gently processed in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer 10 times and cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was adjusted to 40% sucrose with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl supplemented with the protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and transferred to the bottom of a centrifugation tube. A sucrose step gradient with 30, 25, 20, 15, and 5% in MBS (2 ml each) was layered on top. After centrifugation in a SW 41 rotor (Beckman) at 39,000 rpm for 14–16 h at 4 °C, fractions of 1 ml each were taken, starting from the top and going to the bottom. Protein measurement of the cellular fractions was performed with BCA protein assay reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The samples were electrophoresed through a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After 1 h of blocking (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin), the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After washing in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with appropriate secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. The hybridized band was detected by an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thirty micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Magna NT, MicroSeparations Inc., Westbrough, MA) by capillary blotting. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime Random Primer Labeling Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 65 °C for 1 h. The membranes were washed with 1% SDS, 2× sodium chloride sodium citrate buffer. The blots were analyzed by autoradiography. The blots were sequentially hybridized with IL-15 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes as described previously (42Reinecker H.C. MacDermott R.P. Mirau S. Dignass A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1706-1713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). T-84 and T-84β96 cells were grown for 3 days with or without 100 ng/ml IL-15 on chamber slide culture chambers (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL). T-84 cells or T-84β96 cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were fixed for 10 min in 2% paraformaldehyde for immunostaining with antibodies recognizing occludin or for 30 s in aceton at −20 °C for the detection of claudin-1, claudin-2, ZO-1, and ZO-2. Thereafter, the cells were blocked with 1:200 PBS-diluted normal donkey serum for 1 h at 20 °C and incubated with 1:200 in PBS-diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, the monolayers were incubated at room temperature with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (1:500 in PBS) for 1 h in the dark at room temperature and analyzed with a confocal immunofluorescent microscope (Bio-Rad). An initial screen of 98 IL-2Rβ-transfected T-84 clones yielded two clones with a high expression of functional IL-2Rβ subunits. The low number of stable transfected clones reflects the difficulties in stably transfecting T-84 cells. Both IL-2Rβ subunit expressing T-84 cell clones (T-84β29 and T-84β96) exhibited a similar phenotype and were characterized by an increased resistance to separation by a 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% trypsin solution. T-84β29 and T-84β96 monolayers required 15–20 min of incubation to obtain single-cell suspensions instead of the 5–7 min of incubation time required for the parental T-84 monolayers. Both T-84β29 and T-84β96 cells form uniform, tightly packed monolayers within 3 days after separation at a 1:4 split ratio. Expression levels and membrane targeting of the IL-2Rβ subunit in stable transfected T-84 cells was analyzed in Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble protein fractions (Fig.1 A). As demonstrated in Fig.1 A, T-84β29 and T-84β96 cells expressed the IL-2Rβ subunit, whereas the IL-2Rβ chain was not detectable in parental T-84 cells. When analyzed densitometrically, the expression of the IL-2Rβ was 3-fold higher in T-84β29 cells than in T-84β96 cells (Fig.1 A). In both T-84β29 and T-84β96 cells, the IL-2Rβ subunit was highly enriched in Triton X-100-insoluble protein fractions, demonstrating that the stable expressed cytokine receptor was integrated into T-84 cell membranes (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression of cytokine receptors may lead to autonomous activation of signal transduction events. Therefore, we determined the basal activation of tyrosine phosphorylation in parental T-84 cells, T-84β29, and T-84β96 cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 B, T-84β29 cells demonstrated an enhanced basal level of phosphotyrosine kinase activity compared with the parental T-84 cells and T-84β96 cells when membrane-associated Triton X-100-insoluble protein fractions were analyzed (Fig. 1 B, lane 4 compared withlanes 2 and 6). The elevation of tyrosine phosphorylation in the T-84β29 cells correlated with the high level of IL-2Rβ subunit expression in Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction in this T-84 cell clone. To further characterize the membrane compartment containing the IL-2Rβ subunit, we separated postnuclear membrane protein fractions by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This method separates detergent-insoluble membrane fractions characterized by their specific lipid composition (40Simons K. Ikonen E.

As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, the IL-2Rβ subunit was present in low sucrose gradient fractions of T-84β96 cells. IL-2Rβ was present in membrane fractions corresponding to sucrose concentrations of 20–24%, with the highest concentration in the 20% sucrose gradient fraction (Fig.2 A). These low sucrose gradient fractions have been associated with detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membrane fractions or rafts (45Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, these membrane fractions are characterized by the presence of the scaffolding protein caveolin (46Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, Western blot analysis of these cellular compartments revealed that the expression of caveolin-1 was restricted to the same sucrose gradients as that of the IL-2Rβ. In the next set of experiments, we determined whether the expression of the IL-2Rβ subunit enhanced the responsiveness of T-84 cells to IL-15. In these experiments, we used T-84β96 cells, which had a base-line activation of phosphotyrosine kinase comparable with T-84 cells (Fig. 1 B). T-84 and T-84β96 cells were cultured for 15 min with or without IL-15. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, IL-15 stimulation was able to induce a strong up-regulation of phosphotyrosine kinase activity in T-84β96 cells after 15 min (Fig.2 B, lane 10). IL-15 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with a molecular mass of 100 kDa, as well as a number of proteins with molecular masses between 42 and 54 kDa in T-84β96 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 10). In contrast, IL-15 induced only a weak tyrosine phosphoryl"

TheLhx3 gene encodes two isoforms, LHX3a and LHX3b, that differ in their amino-terminal sequences. Humans and mice with defective Lhx3 genes are deficient in gonadotrope, lactotrope, somatotrope, and thyrotrope pituitary cells. We show that, whereas Lhx3b is highly expressed in theseLhx3-dependent cell types, high levels ofLhx3a expression are restricted to α glycoprotein subunit-expressing thyrotropes and gonadotropes. Cross-species comparison reveals the LHX3b-specific domain is more conserved than the LHX3a-specific domain. We demonstrate that the LHX3b-specific domain is a transferable inhibitor that reduces gene activation and DNA binding by homeodomain proteins. In addition, we identify a novel LHX3 protein (M2-LHX3) and determine that this molecule is generated by an internal translation initiation codon. The LHX3a- and LHX3b-specific coding sequences regulate differential usage of this internal start codon. Further, we identify the major activation domain of LHX3 in the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. M2-LHX3 is active because it retains this domain and binds DNA better than LHX3a or LHX3b.

Because of the limited number of human genes, it is likely that multiple strategies are used to generate proteins with sufficient regulatory capacity to coordinate cellular processes such as developmental and metabolic programs. The production of multiple proteins from a single gene vastly increases the functional complexity of the genome. Combinations of alternative RNA splicing, multiple promoter usage, RNA editing, alternate sites of translation initiation, and post-translational modifications enable expression of the genome to diverse “proteomes” necessary for the generation of unique cell types and tissues.LIM homeodomain (HD)1transcription factors comprise a subfamily of HD proteins that contain two amino-terminal zinc finger-like LIM motifs, which mediate interactions with other transcription factors and co-regulatory proteins, and a characteristic DNA-binding HD. Gene targeting experiments in mice have demonstrated that LIM HD class transcription factors regulate many aspects of mammalian organogenesis and are critical to cell lineage specification processes (2Hobert O. Westphal H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). For example, the LHX3 and LHX4 LIM HD proteins are essential for proper development of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. These factors are necessary for the differentiation and proliferation of the specific anterior pituitary cell types (3Sheng H.Z. Moriyama K. Yamashita T. Li H. Potter S.S. Mahon K.A. Westphal H. Science. 1997; 278: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The Lhx3 gene alone may control several aspects of these processes because it codes for two alternate isoforms, LHX3a and LHX3b (4Zhadanov A.B. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Westphal H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol.

The cell types of the mature gland are somatotropes that secrete GH, thyrotropes that release TSH, lactotropes that produce PRL, gonadotropes that synthesize luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, and corticotropes that secrete adrenocorticotropin. To form the pituitary gland and differentiate these cell types, neural ectoderm of the ventral diencephalon must first associate with a fold of ectoderm from the developing oral cavity. These early events, which establish the primordial pituitary structure known as Rathke's pouch, require the actions of both the LHX3 and LHX4 transcription factors. The developing pituitaries of mice lacking both the Lhx3 and Lhx4 genes fail to progress beyond the rudimentary pouch stage (3Sheng H.Z. Moriyama K. Yamashita T. Li H. Potter S.S. Mahon K.A. Westphal H. Science. 1997; 278: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Upon formation of this rudimentary pituitary, Lhx3 is required for formation of a definitive Rathke's pouch, pituitary cell commitment, and the emergence of the hormone-secreting cell lineages. In Lhx3knockout mice, pituitary development is arrested after the initial formation of Rathke's pouch, and the differentiated hormone-secreting cells, with the exception of a few corticotropes, are absent (8Sheng H.Z. Zhadanov A.B. Mosinger Jr., B. Fujii T. Bertuzzi S. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang E.J. Huang S.P. Mahon K.A. Westphal H. Science. 1996; 272: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phenotype of Lhx3 null mice is consistent with the clinical description of human patients with mutations in this gene; these patients display combined pituitary hormone deficiency but possess normal corticotrope function (9Netchine I.

Together, these studies indicate that Lhx3 is critical for both early structural events and for the specification and proliferation of the gonadotrope, lactotrope, somatotrope, and thyrotrope pituitary cell lineages.The Lhx3 gene produces two isoforms, LHX3a and LHX3b, that contain common LIM domains, HD, and carboxyl-terminal sequences but possess alternate amino-terminal domains (4Zhadanov A.B. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Westphal H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J.

Commun. 2000; 274: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the LHX3a isoform activates specific pituitary target genes, alone or in combination with the pituitary POU HD domain factor PIT-1, more effectively than the LHX3b isoform (5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in the gene activation properties of these factors correlate with their abilities to bind DNA regulatory elements; the b-specific domain inhibits DNA binding of LHX3 to specific DNA sites (5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we investigate the regulatory properties of the LHX3a- and LHX3b-specific domains. The LHX3b-specific domain sequence is highly conserved in mammals. The Lhx3a and Lhx3bisoforms are differentially expressed in specialized pituitary cell types, suggesting cell-specific functions. The LHX3b-specific domain is a transferable inhibitory domain that can repress the function of HD transcription factors. In addition, we describe a novel, functional LHX3 molecule, M2-LHX3, that is specifically expressed from theLhx3a transcript in pituitary cell lines, and examine the alternate protein translation mechanism utilized to generate this isoform. M2-LHX3 binds DNA regulatory elements better than LHX3a and LHX3b, and it utilizes a previously uncharacterized activation domain within its carboxyl terminus to induce transcription. TheLhx4 gene also produces an equivalent alternate protein, and we propose that other members of the LIM HD class of developmental regulatory genes use similar strategies to increase their coding capacities.DISCUSSIONGene regulatory proteins play critical roles in developmental and cellular homeostatic processes. Many reports have described transcription factor genes that code for multiple protein isoforms. For example, alternate forms of PITX2 (24Gage P. Camper S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 25Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PIT-1 (26Rhodes S.J. Rosenfeld M.G.

The production of additional proteins by alternative RNA splicing, multiple promoter usage, and alternate use of translation initiation codons enables expansion of the regulatory capacity of a single gene. For example, human PITX2 isoforms possess identical HDs and carboxyl termini but have different amino-terminal sequences that are generated by alternative splicing and the use of two promoters (32Arakawa H. Nakamura T. Zhadanov A.B. Fidanza V. Yano T. Bullrich F. Shimizu M. Blechman J. Mazo A. Canaani E. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Murray J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). PIT-1 isoforms, which contain insertions of 14 and 26 amino acids in the amino-terminal trans-activation domain, also are generated by alternative splicing (26Rhodes S.J. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Animal Sci. 1996; 74: 94-106Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, a shorter PIT-1 protein is formed by the use of an alternate translation initiation codon (34Voss J.W. Yao T.P. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12832-12835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several cases, transcription factor isoforms have been shown to possess different gene regulatory functions. SKN-1a and SKN-1i are POU HD factors expressed in the developing epidermis that possess unique amino-terminal domains generated by alternative splicing. Transfection assays demonstrate that SKN-1a can induce transcription from the cytokeratin 10 gene whereas SKN-1i cannot (28Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, PITX2 isoforms in zebrafish have distinct patterns of expression and play unique roles during mesendoderm and asymmetric organ development (35Essner J. Branford W. Zhang J. Yost H. Development. 2000; 127: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that two LHX3 isoforms, LHX3a and LHX3b, are generated from the Lhx3 gene, and that these factors differ only at their amino termini (4Zhadanov A.B. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Westphal H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol.

Genomics. 1995; 27: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), analysis of differentialLhx3 expression patterns in rodent pituitary cell lines (Fig. 1 and Ref. 5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggest that these proteins are generated by the use of two promoters. The studies presented here examine the amino acid conservation, pituitary cell type expression, and functional characteristics of alternate LHX3 proteins. In addition, we identify a third LHX3 protein, which is generated by the use of an internal translation initiation site.Lhx3 knockout mice do not develop a mature pituitary gland and only form a few corticotrope cells, suggesting that theLhx3 gene is required for the differentiation of the gonadotrope, lactotrope, somatotrope, and thyrotrope cell lineages (8Sheng H.Z. Zhadanov A.B. Mosinger Jr., B. Fujii T. Bertuzzi S. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang E.J. Huang S.P. Mahon K.A. Westphal H. Science. 1996; 272: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Similarly, patients with LHX3 gene mutations are deficient in each of the anterior pituitary hormones except adrenocorticotropin (9Netchine I. Sobrier M.L. Krude H. Schnabel D. Maghnie M. Marcos E. Duriez B. Cacheux V. Moers A. Goossens M. Gruters A. Amselem S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To gain insight into which LHX3 isoform is critical for differentiation of each pituitary cell type, we examined rodent pituitary cell lines for the presence of Lhx3a andLhx3b. Differential expression of the isoforms in these cell lines suggests the factors play different gene regulatory roles in the development of the distinct cell types. Consistent with previous reports describing activation of the αGSU gene by LHX3a (5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 60-69Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Lhx3a expression was identified in cell lines representing the gonadotrope and thyrotrope lineages. Although genes specifically regulated by the LHX3b isoform have yet to be identified, Lhx3b expression in cell lines representing the gonadotrope, lactotrope, somatotrope, and thyrotrope lineages is consistent with data from the Lhx3 null mice and suggests important functional roles for this factor in regulation of genes critical to development of these cells. Analysis of the alternate a- and b-specific amino-terminal domains in several mammalian species reveals that the amino acid sequence of the b-specific domain is more highly conserved than the a-specific domain. Together, the broad pattern of LHX3b pituitary cell type expression and the high degree of b-specific domain amino acid conservation suggest the LHX3b isoform is critical to anterior pituitary gland formation.We have shown previously that the LHX3b-specific domain prevents LHX3 from activating the αGSU gene by inhibiting its binding to the PGBE (5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the intrinsic regulatory function of this domain, we transferred the LHX3b-specific domain to related and unrelated DNA regulatory proteins. Transfer of the b-specific domain to LHX3a, LHX4, and PROP-1 impairs the trans-activation capabilities of these HD proteins. However, transfer of this domain to the non-HD proline and acidic amino acid-rich domain basic region leucine zipper transcription factor TEF does not affect its ability to activate the TSHβ gene. This contrasts with experiments where transfer of the amino-terminal SKN-1i domain to TEF inhibits its function by preventing DNA binding (28Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Importantly, transfer of the LHX3a-specific domain to LHX3b did not confer the ability to activate the tested LHX3a-responsive genes. Transfer of the LHX3b-specific domain to HD-containing proteins, such as LHX3a and PROP-1, inhibits the DNA binding ability of these molecules. The inhibitory nature of the b-specific domain appears to be an intrinsic mechanism that prevents DNA binding of a HD protein. Although corepressor proteins may interact with the LHX3b-specific domain to prevent genetrans-activation, EMSAs using purified LHX3 chimeric proteins suggest that the b-specific domain imparts structural constraints upon these factors that impair HD accessibility to target DNA elements. We previously have demonstrated that LHX3b operates similarly in both pituitary and heterologous cells (5Sloop K.W. Meier B.C. Bridwell J.L. Parker G.E. Schiller A.M. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sloop K.W. Parker G.E. Hanna K.R. Wright H.A. Rhodes S.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 60-69Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, it also is possible that pituitary-specific coactivator or corepressor proteins interact with the LHX3b-specific domain in a highly coordinated fashion to enable function of this isoform during pituitary development.An active, short isoform (M2-LHX3) is produced from the LHX3gene. This is the first study to identify this type of protein product from a LIM HD gene. We demonstrate that this protein is generated by the use of an internal start methionine at codon 134 (AUG134) in LHX3a. Interestingly, the conserved b-specific sequence restricts usage of this translation initiation codon. One of the important Kozak translation initiation consensus residues is a G at the +4 position (36Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis reveals the first LHX3b AUG (M1) contains a G at this position, whereas LHX3a M1 has a less favorable C at this site. Examination of the +4 position of the LHX3 isoforms from mammalian species identified in this study shows strict conservation of the G and C residues in the Lhx3b andLhx3a sequences, respectively. We suggest, that without a G at the +4 position, leaky ribosomal scanning of the LHX3a M1 occurs, which allows usage of AUG134 and production of the M2-LHX3 protein. Indeed, the first translation initiation site in the mouseLhx4 mRNA also does not contain a G at this position, which may allow production of the M2-LHX4 protein. A similar mechanism appears to enable generation of multiple PIT-1 (34Voss J.W. Yao T.P. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12832-12835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and EGR3 transcription factor (29O'Donovan K.J. Baraban J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4711-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) isoforms.The M2-LHX3 protein is present in the αTSH cell line and can bind to the PGBE located in the αGSU gene. This element is required to correctly restrict expression of the αGSU gene to pituitary gonadotropes and thyrotropes (37Brinkmeier M.L. Gordon D.F. Dowding J.M. Saunders T.L. Kendall S.K. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar). LHX2 and LHX3 previously have been shown to specifically bind to the PGBE in EMSA experiments (11Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19020-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Several of these studies demonstrate that multiple complexes bind to the PGBE in experiments using protein extracts from pituitary cell lines (11Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19020-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the unidentified complexes contain LHX2 or LHX3 and different combinations of LHX2/LHX3-interacting proteins (23Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19020-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, these complexes have not been disrupted or characterized with antibodies against LHX2/LHX3-interacting proteins such as NLI, SLB, or MRG1 (11Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19020-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the EMSA complexes described in these previous reports may be composed of full-length LHX2 or LHX3a in the higher migrating complexes and M2-LHX3 (or M2-LHX2) in the lower migrating complexes. In addition, the alternate translation initiation codon identified in this study is conserved in other LIM HD transcription factors and may be utilized to expand the regulatory properties of these genes. Indeed, our experiments demonstrate that this mechanism enables the production of a M2-LHX4 isoform.M2-LHX3 is capable of binding DNA regulatory elements and inducing gene transcription because this molecule contains the major LHX3trans-activation domain. However, the functional significance of the M2-LHX3 and M2-LHX4 proteins is unclear. Although it has been technically challenging to detect M2-LHX3 proteins in pituitary cell extracts using available antisera (data not shown), the increased DNA binding capacity of M2-LHX3 suggests that it may play important regulatory roles. Indeed, the M2-LHX3 molecule can synergize with PIT-1 to activate the PRL and TSHβ genes. Importantly, this activity requires a novel activation domain (C2) located within the carboxyl terminus. Identification of the C2 domain provides an explanation of data described in previous reports showing that LHX3a proteins with pituitary disease-causing LIM2 mutations still retain some ability to synergize with PIT-1 to activate thePRL promoter (18Sloop K.W. Parker G.E. Hanna K.R. Wright H.A. Rhodes S.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 60-69Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19020-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Alternately, because the M2-molecules do not contain intact LIM domains that are required for some LIM HD functions (9Netchine I. Sobrier M.L. Krude H. Schnabel D. Maghnie M. Marcos E. Duriez B. Cacheux V. Moers A. Goossens M. Gruters A. Amselem S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18Sloop K.W. Parker G.E. Hanna K.R. Wright H.A. Rhodes S.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19020-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), these forms of the LHX3 and LHX4 proteins might play dominant negative regulatory roles. In transfection assays, the M2-LHX3 has a reduced ability to activate the αGSUpromoter, a result similar to experiments examining the functions of LHX2 and LHX3 molecules with mutated or deleted LIM domains (13Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 60-69Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). M2-LHX3 does not contain the LIM2 trans-activation domain (17Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that appears to be important for LHX3a αGSUinduction. However, the C2 activation domain located within the carboxyl terminus is required to regulate the PRL gene. This domain also is necessary for activation of the αGSUpromoter. 2K. W. Sloop and S. J. Rhodes, unpublished data. The LHX3 molecule therefore contains multiple activation domains that are required for distinct activities.The studies presented in this report describe mechanisms utilized by specialized cell types to produce multiple regulatory proteins with distinct functions from a single gene. Elaborate regulation of theLHX3 gene at the levels of transcription and translation expands the functional capacity of this gene by generating at least three protein isoforms. Understanding LHX3 isoform expression and function furthers our knowledge of the pituitary cell proteome and suggests that these factors play distinct roles during mammalian pituitary development and function. DNA sequencing projects have revealed that the human genome consists of approximately one third of the previously estimated total number of genes (1The Genome International Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17495) Google Scholar). Because of the limited number of human genes, it is likely that multiple strategies are used to generate proteins with sufficient regulatory capacity to coordinate cellular processes such as developmental and metabolic programs. The production of multiple proteins from a single gene vastly increases the functional complexity of the genome. Combinations of alternative RNA splicing, multiple promoter usage, RNA editing, alternate sites of translation initiation, and post-translational modifications enable expression of the genome to diverse “proteomes” necessary for the generation of unique cell types and tissues. LIM homeodomain (HD)1transcription factors comprise a subfamily of HD proteins that contain two amino-terminal zinc finger-like LIM motifs, which mediate interactions with other transcription factors and co-regulatory proteins, and a characteristic DNA-binding HD. Gene targeting experiments in mice have demonstrated that LIM HD class transcription factors regulate many aspects of mammalian organogenesis and are critical to cell lineage specification processes (2Hobert O. Westphal H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 75-83"

https://openalex.org/W1501756998,"In hippocampus endocannabinoids modulate synaptic function and plasticity and increase tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 is generally a critical step for its activation, allowing the recruitment of Src family kinases, and phosphorylation of FAK and associated proteins. We have examined the mechanisms of the regulation of FAK by cannabinoids in rat and mouse hippocampal slices. Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, two endocannabinoids, and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK+6,7, a neuronal splice isoform of FAK, on several residues including Tyr-397. Cannabinoids increased phosphorylation of p130-Cas, a protein associated with FAK, but had no effect on PYK2, a tyrosine kinase related to FAK and enriched in hippocampus. Pharmacological experiments and the use of knockout mice demonstrated that the effects of cannabinoids were mediated through CB1 receptors. These effects were sensitive to manipulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that they were mediated by inhibition of a cAMP pathway. PP2, an Src family kinase inhibitor, prevented the effects of cannabinoids on p130-Cas and on FAK+6,7 tyrosines 577 and 925, but not 397, indicating that FAK autophosphorylation was upstream of Src family kinases in response to CB1-R stimulation. Endocannabinoids increased the association of Fyn, but not Src, with FAK+6,7. In hippocampal slices from Fyn -/- mice, the levels of p130-Cas were increased, and the effects of endocannabinoids on tyrosine phosphorylation, including of Tyr-397, were completely abolished. These results demonstrate the specific functional association of Fyn with FAK+6,7 in a pathway regulated by endocannabinoids, in which Fyn may play roles dependent and independent of its catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1971908494,"The shedding of membrane-associated proteins has been recognized as a regulatory mechanism to either up-regulate or down-regulate cellular functions by releasing membrane-bound growth factors or removing ectodomains of adhesion molecules and receptors. We have reported previously that the ectoenzyme of membrane type matrix metalloproteinase 5 (MT5-MMP) is shed into extracellular milieu (Pei, D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 8925–8932). Here we present evidence that MT5-MMP is shed by a furin-type convertase activity in the trans-Golgi network. Among proteinase inhibitors screened, only decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone, a known inhibitor for furin-type convertases, blocked the shedding of MT5-MMP in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone also prevented the activation of MT5-MMP, raising the possibility that the observed shedding could be autolytic. However, an active site mutant devoid of any catalytic activity, is also shed efficiently, thus ruling out the autolytic pathway. The shedding cleavage was subsequently mapped to the stem region immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain, where a cryptic furin recognition site, 545RRKERR, was recognized. Indeed, MT5-MMP and furin are co-localized in thetrans-Golgi network and the shed species could be detected inside the cells. Furthermore, deletion mutations removing this cryptic site prevented MT5-MMP from shedding. The resulting mutants express a gain-of-function phenotype by mediating more robust activation of proMMP-2 than the wild type molecule. Thus, shedding provides a potential mechanism to regulate proteolytic activity of membrane-bound MMPs. The shedding of membrane-associated proteins has been recognized as a regulatory mechanism to either up-regulate or down-regulate cellular functions by releasing membrane-bound growth factors or removing ectodomains of adhesion molecules and receptors.

The resulting mutants express a gain-of-function phenotype by mediating more robust activation of proMMP-2 than the wild type molecule. Thus, shedding provides a potential mechanism to regulate proteolytic activity of membrane-bound MMPs. a disintegrin and metalloproteinase matrix metalloproteinase membrane-type membrane type matrix metalloproteinase n Madin-Darby canine kidney phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction chloromethylketone trans-Golgi network endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein brefeldin A transmembrane Shedding or proteolytic release of membrane-bound molecules has been established as an important regulatory mechanism to down-regulate cell adhesive receptors such as l-selectin (1Springer T.A.

Given the diverse molecules shed from membranes, specific mechanisms must have been evolved to handle the specific shedding needs in various biological processes. For proteins bound to plasma membrane, two members of the adisintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)1 family, tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme/ADAM17 and Kuz/ADAM10, have been identified as efficient sheddases (see review in Ref. 9Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of inhibitors against the ADAMs, e.g.hydroxamate-based synthetic compounds or tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (9Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J.

Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of zinc-dependent and neutral pH optimal endopeptidases believed to play a critical role in the remodeling of extracellular matrix under both physiological as well as pathological conditions (11Massova I.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). To date, ∼25 MMPs have been reported and confirmed by cDNA cloning and chromosomal localizations (for review, see Refs. 11Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S.

Although the majority of the MMPs are secretory in nature, a growing list of newly identified MMPs appear to be membrane-bound by at least three distinct anchoring mechanisms: 1) type I transmembrane domains for MT1, -2, -3, and -5-MMPs (13Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar, 14Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol.

MT1-MMP, the archetypal membrane-bound MMP, mediates proMMP-2 activation, cell invasion, migration, fibrinolysis, collagenolysis, and angiogenesis when anchored on plasma membrane (13Sato H.

Truncation of the transmembrane (TM) domain renders MT1-MMP incapable of activating proMMP-2 in transfected cells (23Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), whereas a similarly TM-truncated MT1-MMP is capable of processing proMMP-2 when purified and assayed in vitro (25Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, the transmembrane domain along with its cytosolic domain may confer unique cellular localization required for the proper function of these membrane-bound MMPs (21Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 23Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol.

MT5-MMP is a brain-specific MT-MMP closely related to MT1, -2, and -3-MMPs both structurally and functionally (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). For example, it activates proMMP-2 when co-transfected in various cells (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Like MT1-MMP, recombinant MT5-MMP expresses proteolytic activities against extracellular matrix components such as proteoglycans (25Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MT5-MMP appears to have several unique features. It has a short half-life of ∼30 min at 37 °C (27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In fact, a synthetic inhibitor, BB-94, has to be included in conditioned media to keep the enzyme from autocatalytic decay, thus ensuring its integrity throughout the purification process at 4 °C (27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is shed readily from cell surface (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The shed species behaves like a secretory MMP and can be detected by gelatin zymography (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BB-94, an inhibitor known to block both MMPs and ADAMs, did not inhibit the shedding process, suggesting that MT5-MMP be shed by a novel mechanism independent of metalloproteinase activity. In this report, we demonstrate that MT5-MMP is shed by a furin-type convertase activity cleaving a cryptic furin recognition motif545RRKERR within its stem region. We propose that shedding provides a potential mechanism of down-regulation for MT5-MMP activity. Cell lines including MDCK and its derivatives were obtained and maintained as described (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Pei D. Yi J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The following stable lines were used: a stable cell line expressing full-length mouse MT5-MMP (F591) and a cell line expressing MT51–570F (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Pei D. Yi J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines, EA20 and EA24, were generated by stable transfection of pCR3.1MT5-MMPE252A into MDCK cells and characterized as described (28Pei D. Yi J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Laboratory chemicals and proteinase inhibitors were from Sigma or Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (CMK) was purchased from Bachem (Philadelphia, PA). Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-MT5-MMP antibody was described previously (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Anti-furin antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). BB-94 was a gift from British Biotech (Oxford, United Kingdom). Fresh dissected cerebellum tissues were homogenized in 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 m sucrose 10 mmEDTA, 5 μm BB-94, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 μm E64, 10 μm pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to separate the soluble protein supernatant from the membrane pellet, which was then resuspended in the same solution. Equivalent amount of proteins from pellet and supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-MT5-MMP antibody as described under “Cell Lines, Chemicals, and Immunological Reagents.” Cells transfected with the control vector or various forms of MT5-MMP were plated in six-well plates and allowed to grow to confluence. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and replenished with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone or supplemented with E64 (5 or 50 μm), aprotinin (10 or 100 μg/ml), pepstatin (5 or 50 μm), BB-94 (5 or 50 μm), CMK (50 μm), A23187 (500 nm), or brefeldin A (BFA, 5 μg/ml). The supernatants were collected 48 h later and analyzed by zymography and Western blotting as described (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as described (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Pei D. Yi J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were also extracted with saponin as described and analyzed by Western blotting (19Pei D. Kang T. Qi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33988-33997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The entire open reading frame of mouse MT5-MMP was isolated by Pfu-based PCR and cloned into a modified GFP construct as described (19Pei D. Kang T. Qi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33988-33997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The MT5Δ22::GFP and MT5-MMPΔ6 mutants carrying deletions of 22 residues Gln540–Thr561 or the 545RRKERR motif from the stem region of MT5-MMP were constructed by duplex PCR with the 5′ and 3′MT5-MMP primers (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and two mutagenic pairs of primers: TGG ATG GGC TGC AAG ATC GAT GAC GTG CCA GG, CTT GCA GCC CAT CCA GTC; and CAG AAG GAG GTA GAG CTG CCC CAG GAT GAT GTG, CTC TAC CTC CTT CTG CTT to loop-out the 22 or 6 residues (29Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were cloned into pCR3.1GFP or pCR3.1, respectively, and subsequently confirmed by double stranded DNA sequencing. Error-free mutants were then selected to generate stable cell lines from MDCK cells as described (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution with Triton X-100 (1%). The coverslips were then blocked with 1% normal donkey serum and stained with anti-furin or anti-MT5-MMP antibodies, followed by Rhodamine Red X- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (1 h each). The slides were then scanned in a Bio-Rad confocal system at the University of Minnesota Bioimaging Laboratory. The images were then further processed using Adobe Photoshop version 6. We have demonstrated previously that MDCK cells expressing the brain-specific MT5-MMP shed a gelatinolytic species into conditioned media at ∼27 kDa on zymography and a major species at ∼34 kDa plus several minor ones on Western blots in the absence of any proteinase inhibitor, a pattern similar to that generated by autocatalytic fragmentation of the 56-kDa full-length recombinant ectoenzyme (27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that MT5-MMP is also shed in natural settings, we profiled the expression of MT5-MMP in various regions of mouse brain and revealed by reverse transcription-PCR that it is expressed highly in cerebellum, modestly in cerebrum, but minimally in heart (Fig.1 A, middle panel of lanes 1–3). Consistently, Western blot analysis with anti-MT5-MMP antisera detected a major species at approximately 34 kDa in supernatants of tissue homogenates from cerebellum and cerebrum, but not heart (Fig. 1 A,upper panels, lanes 1 and2 versus lane 3). This soluble species from tissue homogenates is almost identical to the shed fragment of MT5-MMP from recombinant cells (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), suggesting that MT5-MMP is shedin vivo. When equivalent amounts of supernatants and pellets freshly prepared from cerebellum were analyzed simultaneously, the same 34 kDa was detected in the supernatants while a ∼65-kDa species along with several smaller and minor ones was detected in the membrane pellet (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 versus 1, arrow). These products were also detected in recombinant cells expressing MT5-MMP (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar), thus supporting the idea that MT5-MMP is shed in vivo in a similar fashion as observed in vitro. Furthermore, it is estimated that the 34-kDa species amounts to ∼40% of the total MT5-MMP present in the pellets and supernatants. These data argue that MT5-MMP is shed in natural settings as well. Since the MT5-MMP protein products detected in recombinant cells appear to recapitulate those detected in cerebellum as demonstrated in Fig. 1, we decided to focus on this establishedin vitro system to dissect the shedding process (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In fact, this strategy remains the only viable alternative since the primary cells isolated from mouse cerebellum apparently lost the expression of MT5-MMP at the mRNA and protein levels in culture (data not shown). To probe the proteolytic mechanism of shedding, we attempted to block shedding with various proteinase inhibitors. Control as well as MT5-MMP-transfected MDCK cells (F591) constitutively expressed MMP-9 migrating at approximately 92 kDa on zymography in Fig.2 A (lanes 1–14). A 27-kDa gelatinolytic species was secreted into conditioned media by MT5-MMP-transfected cells as reported previously (Fig. 2 A, lane 6,arrowhead) (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Proteinase inhibitors including aprotinin for serine proteinases (10 or 100 μg/ml), E64 for cysteine proteinases (5 or 50 μm), BB-94 for metalloproteinases (5 or 50 μm), and pepstatin A for aspartyl proteinases (5 or 50 μm) (30Leto G. Pizzolanti G. Tumminello F.M. Gebbia N. In Vivo. 1994; 8: 226-231Google Scholar) in serum-free culture media failed to block the shedding of the ∼27-kDa gelatinolytic species (Fig.2 A, lanes 6–14). BB-94 did not inhibit the shedding process as reported previously, even at concentrations as high as 50 μm, but apparently converted the smaller fragments into a ∼52-kDa species as detected by both zymography and Western blotting (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7, 8, 17, and 18 marked byarrows). Thus, this 52-kDa species should be considered as the primary product of shedding, which was autocatalytically fragmented into the smaller ones at 27 or 34 kDa, in agreement with our previous report that BB-94 stabilizes active MT5-MMP (27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consequently, BB-94 was always included in culture media to prevent autocatalytic fragmentation when analyzing MT5-MMP shedding. Since BB-94 blocks the activities of ADAMs, these data would rule out the ADAMs as the MT5-MMP sheddase, thus suggesting that MT5-MMP is shed by an unknown mechanism. Like other MT-MMPs, MT5-MMP contains a furin site and may be activated by furin in the TGN as demonstrated previously (29Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 31Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Indeed, MT5-MMP-transfected cells are capable of activating proMMP-2 (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that MT5-MMP must have been processed and activated. We analyzed cell-associated MT5-MMP products by Western blotting. In the absence of BB-94, only the 65-kDa pro species was detected (Fig.2 B, lane 1). The active species at ∼58 kDa became detectable with the addition of BB-94, which inhibited autocatalytic decay as described (27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). The minor and smaller ones are nonspecific and present in MDCK cells as well (data not shown). To implicate furin as the activator, a furin inhibitor, CMK, was included in the culture media as indicated in Fig. 2 B, a dose-dependent inhibition of MT5-MMP processing was observed (lanes 2–6), suggesting that MT5-MMP is processed by a furin-type convertase (32Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In the supernatants, we observed not only the expected conversion of the smaller species into the 52-kDa one (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and8) but also a dose-dependent decrease of the shed species (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–12) by Western blotting, indicating for the first time that a furin-type convertase activity is required for the observed shedding. Although CMK is expected to block the activation of MT5-MMP due to the presence of a consensus furin recognition site between its pro and catalytic domains (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), its efficient blocking of shedding is quite unexpected. Given the fact that active MT5-MMP autocatalytically fragments itself into smaller species (27Wang X. Yi J. Lei J. Pei D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is possible that CMK inhibited the shedding by blocking furin-mediated activation of MT5-MMP, thus preventing autocatalytic shedding. To rule out this possibility, we analyzed the shedding profile of a catalytically inactive mutant of MT5-MMP, MT5E252A. As shown in Fig. 3 A, this mutant carries a single point mutation converting Glu to Ala at the active site, rendering MT5-MMP inactive, as demonstrated by its inability to activate proMMP-2 (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Should shedding be autocatalytic, MT5E252A should not be able to shed its ectodomain. However, the ectodomain of MT5E252A was shed very efficiently into conditioned media when two independently derived cell lines, EA24 and EA20, were analyzed (arrows, Fig. 3 B, lanes 3,4, 7, and 8). In fact, the mutant protein was shed as a single species at ∼52 kDa in contrast to the smaller ones from wild type MT5-MMP in the absence of BB-94 (Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). Furthermore, BB-94 did not cause any upshift in molecular weight for MT5E252A as it did for the wild type molecule (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 6), reinforcing the notion that the smaller molecular mass species are derived autocatalytically from the ∼52-kDa species. Without any proteolytic activity, MT5E252A is more stable than the wild type molecule both inside and outside the cells, as indicated by the detection of the cell-associated 58-kDa processed product without BB-94 (arrowhead, Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 7 versus Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 7). In addition, we observed an intracellular species co-migrating with the shed 52-kDa species (Fig. 3 C, asterisk betweenlanes 1 and 2), suggesting that it may be generated intracellularly prior to secretion. We then estimated the percentage of shedding for MT5E252A at ∼30% at the steady state level (Fig. 3 C, lane 7 versus lane 1). Consistent with data for wild type MT5-MMP in Fig. 2, CMK blocked both the processing and the shedding of MT5E252A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 C, lanes 2–6 and 8–12), reinforcing the idea that MT5-MMP is shed not autocatalytically, but by a furin-type convertase in trans. The estimated IC50 for CMK to block shedding is ∼7 μm. These data demonstrate for the first time that furin or its related proprotein convertases could serve as a sheddase for membrane-bound molecules. As described earlier, MT5-MMP contains a furin motif, RRRNKR124 and, thus, may be processed by furin for zymogen activation (32Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 33Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Indeed, CMK inhibited the processing of MT5-MMP precursor as well as its shedding into media as shown in Figs.2 B and 3 C. These data raise the possibility that MT5-MMP and furin should co-localize in the TGN. To test this possibility, we performed double immunofluorescence staining with anti-MT5-MMP and anti-furin antibodies. Surprisingly, most of MT5-MMP signals are localized intracellularly within TGN (Fig.4 A, panel a), in contrast to the report that the archetypal MT1-MMP is primarily localized on plasma membrane (13Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). The staining pattern for furin, on the other hand, is localized in the TGN as reported previously (Fig. 4 A, panel c) (34Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). When overlaid, it is apparent that both furin and MT5-MMP are co-localized (Fig. 4 A, panel b). Similar staining patterns were observed between MT5-MMPE252A and furin (data not shown). These co-localization data argue that both the activation and shedding of MT5-MMP may occur in the TGN simultaneously. The near absence of MT5-MMP on cell surface as shown in Fig. 4 A suggests that most of the MT5-MMP molecules might have been shed prior to be presented onto plasma membrane with little MT5-MMP as membrane-bound forms beyond the TGN. The fact that MT5-MMP is co-localized with its sheddase, furin, in the TGN (Fig. 4 A) raises the possibility that shedding takes place, just like activation, in the TGN. Indeed, a cell-associated 52-kDa species, detected in Fig. 3 C (marked by an asterisk), closely resembles the shed species (also 52 kDa), and is sensitive to CMK treatment. Should this 52-kDa protein be the shed species prior"

In this study, we examined the regulation of ICER protein by phosphorylation and ubiquitination in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 and mouse pituitary AtT20 cells. We found that cAMP stabilized ICER protein by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Activation of the MAPK pathway increased ICER phosphorylation. ICER phosphorylation was abrogated by inhibition of the MAPK pathway either by cAMP or directly by the MAPK inhibitor PD098059. The MAPKs extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 physically interact with ICER and mediated the phosphorylation of ICER on a critical serine residue (Ser-41). A mutant form of ICER in which Ser-41 was substituted by alanine had a half-life 4–5 h longer than its wild-type counterpart. This alteration in stability was due to the inability of the Ser-41-mutant ICER to be efficiently ubiquitinated and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These results present a novel cell signaling cross-talk mechanism at the cell nucleus between the MAPK and cAMP pathways, whereby MAPK targets a repressor of the cAMP-dependent gene expression for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

In the classic pathway, activation of MAPK occurs by peptide growth factors that bind to a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. This results in the activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras that recruits a member of the Raf kinase family (Raf-1, A-Raf, or B-Raf) to the plasma membrane. Raf phosphorylates and activates the MEKs (MEK1 and MEK2), which in turn activates the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. The MAPK pathway is tightly regulated by and cross-communicates with other signaling pathways. The best-characterized signal that regulates the activation of MAPKs is cAMP. cAMP inhibits the growth of fibroblasts cells (3Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W.

Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), thus blocking the MAPK pathway. On the contrary, in phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells, cAMP induces activation of MAPK through PKA-induced activation of the Ras-related small G protein Rap1 (9Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The activated Rap1 is both a selective activator of B-Raf and an inhibitor of Raf-1. Thus, in cells with little or no B-Raf (e.g. fibroblasts), cAMP inhibits the MAPK pathway. In addition to cross-talk with the MAPK cascade at the cytosol, the cAMP/PKA pathway has a nuclear component. CREB and CREM are the two best-characterized families of transcription factors that mediate cAMP-driven gene expression (10Montminy M. Annu. Rev.

Inducible Gene Expression. 2. Birkhauser, Boston1993: 1-38Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation by PKA, CREB and CREM induce the transcription of CRE-containing genes. One of the induced proteins, ICER, is itself a product of the CREM gene (12Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P.

Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). cAMP strongly induces ICER expression by virtue of an intronic promoter in the CREM gene containing four CREs that in turns confers ICER-negative autoregulation. ICER strongly binds to CREs as a homodimer or heterodimer with CREB or CREM and represses gene expression. ICER consists of a family of four functionally indistinguishable isoforms, termed ICER-I, ICER-II, ICER-Iγ, and ICER-IIγ. In contrast to the rest of the CRE binding factors, ICER is not directly regulated by PKA phosphorylation because it lacks the PKA phosphorylation site. ICER has been linked to regulation of cell growth (13Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P.

This blockage is the result of the observed inhibition by ICER of various growth-related genes, such as cyclin A (15Lamas M. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Jansen E. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ICER dramatically inhibits the growth and DNA synthesis of mouse pituitary tumor AtT20 cells and human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells (14Razavi R. Ramos J.C. Yehia G. Schlotter F. Molina C.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This alteration in cell growth is coupled with a reduced ability of ICER-expressing cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner and to form tumors in nude mice. In this scenario, ICER has the characteristic of a tumor suppressor gene product that mediates the antiproliferative activity of cAMP. Therefore, ICER represents yet another mechanism for the regulation of cell growth via the cAMP pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that the MAPK pathway regulates ICER. We found that cAMP stabilizes ICER protein by inhibiting the MAPK cascade. This stabilization is the results of inhibition of ICER phosphorylation by the MAPK Erk and subsequent ICER degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. These findings present a novel cross-talk mechanism at the cell nucleus between the cAMP and MAPK pathway. Direct phosphorylation by ERK of a transcriptional repressor represents a previously undiscovered regulation of cAMP-mediated gene expression by the MAPK pathway. Several cell clones expressing a phosphorylation-mutant form of ICER-IIγ were generated from the established cell line of mouse pituitary tumor AtT20 cells. AtT20 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as recommended. These cell clones were established as described before (14Razavi R. Ramos J.C. Yehia G.

After immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the radioactive signals were quantified using Image-Quant software for the Instant Imager (Packard) apparatus. In vitro phosphorylation assays (kinase assay) were performed as previously described (9Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using the following oligonucleotides: serine 35, GTG ATG GCT GCA GCA CCA GGA AGC CTG; serine 38, GCT GCC TCA CCAGGG GGC CTG CAC AGT; serine 41, GGA AGC CTG CACGCT CCC CAG CAA CTA; serine 80, AAG TGT CTT GAGGCT CGA GTC GCA GTG; serine 104, AAA GAC ATT TGCGCG CCC AAA ACA GAT. All sequences are 5′-3′. For each oligonucleotide, a complementary strand was also synthesized. In some cases, a second mutation was introduced to produce a convenient restriction site for rapid screening. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. We have previously shown that in JEG-3 and AtT20 cells, cAMP cooperates with ICER to inhibit cellular growth (14Razavi R. Ramos J.C. Yehia G. Schlotter F. Molina C.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Lamas M. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Jansen E. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We wanted to study the nature of this cooperation. The regulation of ICER protein and RNA was determined after chronic (constant) or acute (1 h) treatment of JEG-3 and AtT20 cells with 8-Br-cAMP. In the experiment shown in Fig.1 A, it was found that the endogenous ICER protein was induced to similar maximal levels after 3 h in chronically or acutely treated JEG-3 cells. In acutely treated cells, the protein levels of ICER returned to baseline by 12 h after treatment. However, maximal levels of ICER protein were maintained for at least 12 h in the chronically treated cells. This prolongation of ICER protein cannot be attributed to differences in RNA levels, because the induction of ICER RNA was longer in acutely treated cells than in chronically treated cells (Fig. 1 B). In both acutely and chronically treated cells, ICER RNA was maximally induced after 3 h. In chronically treated cells, ICER RNA returned to basal levels by 4 h. In acutely treated cells, the induction was maintained until 8 h, possibly as a consequence of a lack of a strong negative autoregulation (12Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 23Lamas M. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cAMP stabilizes ICER protein. In order to test this hypothesis, the induction of ICER protein was determined in chronically and acutely 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells after inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by treatment with cycloheximide. In a manner similar to that shown in Fig. 1 A,ICER protein levels were found to return to basal levels in acutely treated cells but remained elevated in chronically treated cells after 12 h (Fig. 1 C). To further test whether cAMP altered ICER protein stability, we compared the half-life of transiently transfected ICER between 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells and untreated cells. We found that the half-life of transfected ICER was 4 h longer in cells chronically treated with 8-Br-cAMP as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1 D).

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of these phenomena and its implications on the regulation of ICER protein. Because cAMP and MAPK pathways cross-communicate (3Wu J. Dent P.

A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), we determined whether the MAPK pathway affected the kinetic of ICER protein inducibility by cAMP. JEG-3 cells were acutely treated with 8-Br-cAMP in serum-free medium, and the levels of ICER protein were determined at 9, 12, and 16 h after the addition of serum and in cells maintained in serum-free media. After 16 h, the protein levels of ICER were found to be 5 times higher in cells maintained in serum-free medium than in medium with 10% serum (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PD098059 completely abolished this serum-induced decline of ICER protein (Fig. 2 B) and doubled the half-life of ICER-IIγ (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the MAPK pathway might be involved in the regulation of the cAMP-mediated ICER protein stability. cAMP has been shown to either inhibit or activate the MAPK pathway according to cell type (3Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 4Cook S.J. McCormick F.

A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the regulation of MAPK pathway by cAMP in JEG-3 and AtT20 cells. Activation of the MAPK pathway was assessed by measuring the level of phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 and by measuring the kinase activity of ERK1 and ERK2 after immunoprecipitation. We observed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was strongly inhibited in cAMP-pretreated JEG-3 and AtT20 cells (Fig.3, A and B). As expected, the MAPK inhibitor PD098059 also inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 activation (Fig. 3, A and B). We then determined the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on the growth of JEG-3 and AtT20 cells. Activation of the cAMP pathway inhibited the growth of both these cell lines (Fig. 3 C). JEG-3 cells were more sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of cAMP compared with AtT20 cells. We attribute these differences to the fact that AtT20 cells express low levels of B-Raf (Fig. 3 D). B-Raf was shown to modulate cAMP activation of the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells (10Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). These data imply that JEG-3 and AtT20 cells are appropriate models to study the regulation of ICER protein stability by the MAPK pathway in cells in which cAMP antagonizes the MAPK pathway. Phosphorylation is a common posttranslational modification that may regulate ICER protein stability. ICER does not contain the consensus phosphorylation site for PKA (12Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and has not been shown to be phosphorylated as other CREM isoforms (11Lee J.S. Lalli E. Masquilier D. Schlotter F. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. 2. Birkhauser, Boston1993: 1-38Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of ICER protein was studied under conditions of high and low MAPK activity. We found that activation of the MAPK pathway by EGF or serum treatment induced the phosphorylation of both endogenous and ectopically expressed ICER protein (Fig.4). This induction of ICER phosphorylation occurred mostly in a discrete single tryptic phosphopeptide labeled phosphopeptide 3, and exclusively on a serine residue(s). Inhibition of the MAPK pathway by cAMP or PD098059 inhibited the MAPK-induced phosphorylation of ICER on phosphopeptide 3. The finding that basal levels of ICER phosphorylation were high and that inhibition of MAPK did not inhibit these basal levels suggests that ICER might be phosphorylated by other kinases not necessarily related to the MAPK pathway. Because EGF activates the mitogen-activated protein signaling pathway (25Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and inhibition of this pathway by cAMP and PD098059 reduces ICER phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B), we investigated whether ICER is a substrate for the MAPKs. The fact that PD098059 blocks the MAPK pathway by inhibiting MAPK kinase MEK phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK (24Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) suggested to us that one of these kinases directly phosphorylates ICER. From the outset, we suspected that MEK was not a suitable candidate, because in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, we found that ICER was uniquely phosphorylated on serine residues. To test which kinase was capable to phosphorylate ICER protein in vitro, we performed a kinase assay using bacterially purify ICER-IIγ protein (12Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-"

Raf activation increased the expression of Cdk2, Cdk4, cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E, p21(Cip1) and c-Myc and decreased the expression of p27(Kip1) which are associated with G(1) progression. However only the cell clones with moderate Raf activation, i.e. FD/Delta Raf-1:ER and FD/Delta A-Raf:ER, successfully underwent cell proliferation. The cell clones with the highest Delta Raf activity, FD/Delta B-Raf:ER, underwent apoptosis before cell proliferation. p21(Cip1) induced by Raf activation specifically bound with Cdk4/cyclin D complexes but not Cdk2/cyclin E complexes and this binding was associated with the increased Cdk4 activity. However, no binding of p27(Kip1) with either Cdk2/cyclin E or Cdk4/cyclin D was observed. Thus Raf mediated growth was associated with elevated p21(Cip1) expression, which may specifically bind with and activate Cdk4/cyclin D complexes and with decreased p27(Kip1) expression."
https://openalex.org/W2026738316,"The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) forms a tetrameric complex with G-CSF containing two ligand and two receptor molecules. The N-terminal Ig-like domain of the G-CSF-R is required for receptor dimerization, but it is not known whether it binds G-CSF or interacts elsewhere in the complex. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to show that residues in the Ig-like domain of the G-CSF-R (Phe75, Gln87, and Gln91) interact with G-CSF. This binding site for G-CSF overlapped with the binding site of a neutralizing anti-G-CSF-R antibody. A model of the Ig-like domain showed that the binding site is very similar to the viral interleukin-6 binding site (site III) on the Ig-like domain of gp130, a related receptor. To further characterize the G-CSF-R complex, exposed and inaccessible regions of monomeric and dimeric ligand-receptor complexes were mapped with monoclonal antibodies. The results showed that the E helix of G-CSF was inaccessible in the dimeric but exposed in the monomeric complex, suggesting that this region binds to the Ig-like domain of the G-CSF-R. In addition, the N terminus of G-CSF was exposed to antibody binding in both complexes. These data establish that the dimerization interface of the complete receptor complex is different from that in the x-ray structure of a partial complex.

G-CSF receptor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor cytokine receptor homology second structural domain of the receptors third structural domain of the receptors fibronectin type III interleukin monoclonal antibody median fluorescence channel wild type The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R)1 is a transmembrane protein that is expressed predominantly on cells of the neutrophil lineage and is important in transmitting signals for their proliferation, differentiation, and function (1Nicola N.A.

JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1997: 557-612Google Scholar). The extracellular region comprises six structural domains: an N-terminal Ig-like domain followed by five fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains (3Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorenson E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig.1A). The first two of the FNIII domains (called D2 and D3) form the cytokine receptor homology (CRH) module, which contains four cysteine residues in D2 and a WSXWS motif in D3. These features of the CRH module are conserved in members of the class 1 cytokine receptor family (4Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). This domain structure is also found in the closest homologue of the G-CSF-R, gp130, which is the shared signal transducing receptor chain of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The G-CSF-R and gp130 share 46% sequence similarity in the extracellular region (6Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ligands for the class 1 cytokine receptors have a conserved 4-α-helical bundle structure but little sequence similarity (7Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In the gp130 family of ligands and receptors, three binding interfaces have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 8Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, IL-6 interacts with the IL-6 receptor at site I and gp130 at site II. A second gp130 receptor interacts at site III, resulting in a hexameric complex of two components each of IL-6, IL-6 receptor, and gp130 (9Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23286-23289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the IL-6 family of ligands, site I is located at the end of the D helix, site II on the A and C helices, and site III at the N-terminal end of the D helix. Binding of G-CSF to the G-CSF-R results in the formation of a 2:2 complex, but the details of interactions in this complex are yet to be determined (10Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Horan T.P. Martin F. Simonet L. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the G-CSF-R complex is similar to the IL-6 receptor complex but without the site I interaction, because there is no equivalent protein to the IL-6 receptor in the G-CSF-R complex (12Layton J.E. Shimamoto G. Osslund T. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Boone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17445-17451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The main receptor-binding site on G-CSF has been shown by mutagenesis to include residues on the A and C helices (13Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q.L. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is equivalent to site II of IL-6 (Fig. 1D). This site interacts with the “elbow” formed by D2 and D3 of the CRH module (G-CSF-R site II), shown in the crystal structure of G-CSF in complex with the CRH module (15Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies also identified site II residues on G-CSF-R (16Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and showed that the interaction of Glu19 of G-CSF with Arg288 of the receptor was particularly important in the site II interface (12Layton J.E. Shimamoto G. Osslund T. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Boone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17445-17451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There is some evidence for an additional binding site in the G-CSF-R complex that is equivalent to site III in gp130 complexes. On G-CSF, mutagenesis has identified some residues that appear to form a second binding site near the N-terminal end of the D helix (13Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and we previously showed that Glu46 of G-CSF in the E helix (Fig.1D) probably interacted with the Ig-like domain (12Layton J.E. Shimamoto G. Osslund T. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Boone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17445-17451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain of G-CSF-R has been shown by several studies to be important for complex formation. Deletion of most of the Ig-like domain from the G-CSF-R resulted in a 20-fold loss of G-CSF binding affinity and a very low proliferation response in cells expressing the deletion mutant (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution of the Ig-like domain with that of gp130 (forming the (gp130-Ig)G-CSF-R chimera; Fig.1A) resulted in reduced binding affinity and no detectable activity (12Layton J.E. Shimamoto G. Osslund T. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Boone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17445-17451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain is also required for receptor homodimerization with G-CSF in solution (17Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and recently, a soluble Ig-like domain was shown to bind G-CSF (18Ishibashi M. Tokunaga H. Arakawa T. Tokunaga M. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that the Ig-like domain interacts with G-CSF at site III, resulting in receptor dimerization as shown schematically in Fig. 1B. The recently described crystal structure of a 2:2 complex of the CRH module of G-CSF-R (with no Ig-like domain) and G-CSF (shown schematically in Fig. 1C) shows the site II interaction but provides no evidence for a site III interaction (15Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The putative site III of G-CSF (Fig. 1D) is exposed in the crystal complex, suggesting that the observed dimerization interface is different from that formed by the complete receptor and may represent an intermediate in complex formation (15Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to identify the residues involved in the proposed site III on the Ig-like domain of the G-CSF-R. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify residues on the Ig-like domain that interact with G-CSF or are otherwise important for G-CSF-R complex formation. Secondly, we used anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and anti-G-CSF-R mAbs to determine the exposed and buried regions of the complex. Both of these approaches support the proposed site III interaction between G-CSF and the Ig-like domain of the receptor. After this work was completed, the crystal structure of domains 1–3 of gp130 in complex with viral IL-6 was published (19Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This complex is a tetramer of two viral IL-6 and two gp130 subunits. The tetramer is formed by site II binding and the interaction of site III of viral IL-6 with the Ig-like domain of gp130, as we have proposed for the complex of G-CSF with its receptor. These two complexes are likely to be very similar because of the related receptor structures and the ability of viral IL-6 to activate gp130 and G-CSF to activate the G-CSF-R without the requirement for an α-receptor (20Hoischen S.H. Vollmer P. Marz P. Ozbek S. Gotze K.S. Peschel C. Jostock T. Geib T. Mullberg J. Mechtersheimer S. Fischer M. Grotzinger J. Galle P.R. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have used the structure of the viral IL-6·gp130 complex to make a model of the G-CSF·G-CSF-R complex that has allowed us to more clearly interpret our results. Site-directed mutagenesis of the G-CSF-R cDNA in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed using either the method of Kunkel (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 82: 488-492Crossref Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) or a mutagenesis kit (Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Wild type (WT) and mutant G-CSF-R cDNAs were subcloned into pEFBOS expression vector (22Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar), and the WT G-CSF-R cDNA was also subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The WT and mutant G-CSF-R constructs were transfected into Ba/F3 cells by electroporation as described previously (16Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Usually six independent cell lines were selected for each mutant based on apparent monoclonality and, where possible, similar levels of receptor expression to WT as determined by flow cytometry screening. To assess receptor expression in transfected cell lines, the cells were stained with a mAb to the human G-CSF-R, LMM741, as described previously (16Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutant receptors were correctly folded, binding of five conformation-dependent mAbs was measured in a semi-quantitative assay, as described previously (16Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding of each mAb (median fluorescence channel (MFC) − background) was compared with that of LMM741 (non-conformation-dependent) and with the binding of the same pair to the WT receptor by calculating the ratio (MFC mAb/MFC LMM741) mutant G-CSF-R × (MFC LMM741/MFC mAb)WT G-CSF-R. The MFC of LMM741 binding to WT G-CSF-R was 49 ± 12 (mean ± S.D. of 12 assays). To determine data variability, the means and standard deviations of the MFC ratios for two other conformation-independent mAbs were calculated. For LMM852, this was 0.995 ± 0.072, and for LMM847, this was 0.995 ± 0.091 (n = 48), compared with the expected value of 1.0. On the basis of these data, a ratio of <0.7 was considered to be a significant reduction in binding. Proliferation of transfected Ba/F3 cells in response to G-CSF was determined in a 48-h tritiated thymidine incorporation assay, as described previously (16Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The assays were performed twice on at least three independent cell lines expressing each mutant G-CSF-R. The mean EC50 of the two assays was calculated for each cell line, and then the means ± S.E. of the EC50 values for the group of cell lines were calculated; thus errors represent variation between cell lines. This was greater than variation between assays. Tyr 1,3-G-CSF (gift from A. Shimosaka, Kirin, Japan) was iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce) either as described (23Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or with the modification described by Chizzonite et al.(24Chizzonite R. Truitt T. Podlaski F.J. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Nunes P. Stern A.S. Gately M.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1548-1556PubMed Google Scholar). The modification resulted in a slightly higherKd for WT G-CSF-R binding of G-CSF; therefore theKd values for mutant receptors were compared with WT G-CSF-R assayed with G-CSF iodinated by the same method. Binding assays were performed and analyzed as described previously (16Layton J.E. Iaria J. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29735-29741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In all cases, the Scatchard transformation of data gave an approximately linear plot with a best fit of single affinity binding. Binding of 37 anti- G-CSF mAbs to G-CSF mutants was tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (25Layton J.E. Morstyn G. Fabri L.J. Reid G.E. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Nice E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23815-23823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the mAbs were tested at 10 and 1 μg/ml using plates coated with WT or mutant G-CSF at 10 ng/well. Those mAbs that showed reduced binding to the mutant G-CSFs were then titrated to determine quantitatively the reduction in binding. The G-CSF mutants used were single Ala substitutions at Glu19, Arg22, Lys23, Gln25, Asp27, Lys40, His43, Glu46, and Arg166 (kindly provided by G. Shimamoto, T. Osslund, and T. Boone from Amgen). Residues 19–27 are in the site II region, and residues 40–46 are in the proposed site III. Arg166 is in the D helix and not expected to interact with the receptor. Ba/F3 cells expressing WT G-CSF-R or (gp130-Ig)G-CSF-R (12Layton J.E. Shimamoto G. Osslund T. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Boone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17445-17451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 or 1000 μg/ml G-CSF (respectively) or no G-CSF and 10 mm NaN3 to prevent receptor endocytosis and then washed. The cells at 4 °C were then incubated with mAbs at 10 μg/ml, washed, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Silenus, Amrad, Melbourne, Australia; 1:100), and then analyzed by flow cytometry. A model of the Ig-like domain of human G-CSF-R has been constructed using comparative modeling techniques with the program Modeller (26Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain of gp130 (Protein Data Bank entry 1I1R) (19Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) has been used as the structural template, with the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 2. Secondary structure elements of gp130 are determined from the x-ray coordinates using STRIDE (27Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). The arrangement of these β strands gives this domain an H-type Ig-like fold (28Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). The structure-based sequence alignment has been derived manually, by utilizing secondary structure elements and conserved motifs and residues. The four cysteine residues are modeled to form the same disulfide linkages as in gp130. Models were created with various sequence alignments in the C′ and D strands, but the best were created with the alignment shown in Fig. 2. For the final alignment 100 models were calculated from which the best was chosen in accordance with the Modeller energy function, ProsaII profiles (29Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), and Procheck assessment (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The ProsaII trace indicated no misfolding with a z score of −5.74, comparing favorably with that of gp130 (−6.23). To create a quaternary 2:2 G-CSF·G-CSF-R complex, a model of the first three domains of G-CSF-R was made. Human CRH module (D2 and D3) of G-CSF-R in complex with G-CSF via site II was modeled on the mouse G-CSF-R bound to human G-CSF (Protein Data Bank entry 1CD9) (15Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using Modeller. The sequence alignment of the human and mouse receptors (data not shown) reveals 65% identity and no insertions or deletions in the CRH module. The A-B loop was missing in the x-ray structure, so for this loop the NMR structure of D3 of the human G-CSF-R (Protein Data Bank entry 1CTO (31Yamasaki K. Naito S. Anaguchi H. Ohkubo T. Ota Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) was used as the template. The best structure was chosen in accordance with the criteria mentioned above. The G-CSF-R Ig-like domain was linked to the CRH module using the same interdomain angle observed in the gp130 structure. The quaternary G-CSF-R complex was created by superimposing the two receptors onto the two gp130 molecules (using domains 1 and 2). This superimposition also revealed very similar site II and III binding modes of G-CSF to G-CSF-R and viral IL-6 to gp130. To avoid steric clashes at site III, the distance between the G-CSF receptors was marginally increased. The available data about sites of interaction of cytokine receptors with their specific ligands indicated that the loop regions of FNIII domains rather than β strands were the most likely ligand-binding sites (32de Vos A.M.

An alignment of Ig-like domains was used to predict the β strands and loop regions of the G-CSF-R Ig-like domain. Residues in the predicted loops of the Ig-like domain that have charged, aromatic, or large hydrophobic side chains were chosen for alanine substitution by site-directed mutagenesis. The final alignment (Fig. 2) that was used for modeling (see later) differed slightly in the assignment of some β strand and loop regions. This final alignment has been used to indicate the positions of the mutations in the data (Table I and Fig.3). The mutated full-length receptor cDNAs were expressed in the murine pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, to enable measurement of the proliferative response to G-CSF and binding affinity for G-CSF, in comparison with the WT G-CSF-R. A panel of five conformation-dependent mAbs was used to determine whether or not the mutant receptors were correctly folded. Binding was measured by flow cytometry in a semi-quantitative assay and compared with three conformation-independent mAbs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Loss of binding of conformation-dependent mAbs could indicate complete unfolding of the domain or a more subtle alteration of β strands or loop regions. The data (Table I) were normalized with respect to level of receptor expression and level of binding of each mAb to WT G-CSF-R. The epitopes recognized by the conformation-dependent mAbs are on the Ig-like domain (groups 1 and 3) and D2 of the CRH module (group 2), whereas the conformation-independent mAb shown (group 4) recognizes the additional FNIII domains (23Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A change in conformation of the receptor would be likely to affect binding of several mAb groups, but a specific mutation of the epitope recognized by a mAb would affect only one mAb or group. An increase in binding was not seen with any of the mutants.Table IRelative mAb binding to G-CSF-R Ig-like domain mutantsMutation positionMutation to alanineMFC ratio of mAb bindingaMFC ratio with respect to LMM741 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Data for mutants where all mAb ratios were > 0.7 are not shown. Open table in a new tab mAb binding to Ba/F3 cells expressing G-CSF-R mutants was determined by flow cytometry. Two of the multiple mutants, in the A′ strand and E-F loop, showed total or almost total loss of all conformation-dependent mAb binding, which correlated with low expression, shown by the low median fluorescence channel of the positive control mAb, LMM741 (TableI). Thus these mutants were probably not properly folded. The mutant in the α helix of the B-C loop showed loss of only group 3 mAb binding, indicating that this region includes the binding site of group 3 mAbs. The C′ strand mutant showed borderline loss of binding with all mAbs and low level expression, suggesting some alteration in conformation. The D-E loop mutant showed no loss of binding. The G strand mutant showed partial loss of binding of all mAbs but good expression, suggesting that alteration of conformation was not severe. The function of the mutant receptors was assessed by determining proliferation in response to G-CSF and binding of G-CSF (Fig. 3). Because there was variation in the level of mutant G-CSF-R expression, we tested the response of cells expressing less than 1000 WT G-CSF-R (Fig. 3, WT-low). These cell lines were, if anything, more sensitive to G-CSF than those with higher receptor numbers; therefore there is no evidence that low receptor number alone (down to 700 receptors/cell) can account for reduced activity. The most interesting mutation was of the G strand. Although there was some loss of mAb binding to this mutant, there was a 23-fold reduction in proliferation and 2.3-fold reduction in binding affinity. With the other mutants, the loss of biological activity correlated with loss of mAb binding and therefore probably reflected indirect effects on receptor function. The E-F loop mutant gave an anomalous result with complete loss of mAb binding and no proliferation activity but unexpectedly only slightly reduced G-CSF binding affinity. To further investigate this result, one cell line (300 receptors/cell) was tested for proliferation at higher G-CSF concentration. It did respond, but with an EC50 of only 6400 pm (a 320-fold reduction in activity). This is the only mutant tested that has lost ability to bind conformation-dependent mAbs but could still bind G-CSF and give a (low) proliferation response. The A′ strand, G strand and E-F loop multiple mutation sites were selected for introduction of single residue alanine substitutions. The point mutations did not affect mAb binding except for three mutants shown in Table I (L15A, Q73A, and L86A). The small reduction of only group 1 mAb binding to the Q73A mutant indicates that Gln73contributes to the LMM711 binding site. Proliferation and binding data for all the mutants are given in Fig. 3. The mutant receptors were all expressed at over 2000 receptors/cell (Fig. 3). The only mutant showing a reduction in proliferative response with no loss of mAb binding was Q87A, showing that Gln87 is important for receptor function and may interact with G-CSF. The effects of the mutations on binding affinity were not significant (Fig. 3). Because mutations of single residues had only small effects, it was possible that there was a relatively large interaction surface between the Ig-like domain and G-CSF, with each contact residue contributing a relatively small amount of binding energy to the complex.

https://openalex.org/W2316680554,"The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a multifunctional protein that is mutated in many hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. We have cloned a homologue of the human BRCA1 gene from chicken; the gene encodes a 1749 amino acid protein that is 33% identical to human BRCA1. Phylogenetic analyses of the chicken and mammalian proteins indicate that the chicken gene is a bona fide BRCA1 orthologue, the first to be described from a non-mammal. Most of the chicken protein has diverged considerably from its mammalian orthologues, although the RING and BRCT repeat regions are highly conserved. This marked overall sequence divergence has allowed us to identify nine additional highly-conserved motifs (ranging from 8--56 amino acids in length) which are likely important for BRCA1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2138560059,"The mechanism of fatty acid-dependent uncoupling by mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) is still in debate. We have hypothesized that the anionic fatty acid head group is translocated by UCP, and the proton is transported electroneutrally in the bilayer by flip-flop of the protonated fatty acid. Alkylsulfonates are useful as probes of the UCP transport mechanism. They are analogues of fatty acids, and they are transported by UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. We show that undecanesulfonate and laurate are mutually competitive inhibitors, supporting the hypothesis that fatty acid anion is transported by UCP1. Alkylsulfonates cannot be protonated because of their low pK a, consequently, they cannot catalyze electroneutral proton transport in the bilayer and cannot support uncoupling by UCP. We report for the first time that propranolol forms permeant ion pairs with the alkylsulfonates, thereby removing this restriction. Because a proton is transported with the neutral ion pair, the sulfonate is able to deliver protons across the bilayer, behaving as if it were a fatty acid. When ion pair transport is combined with UCP1, we now observe electrophoretic proton transport and uncoupling of brown adipose tissue mitochondria. These experiments confirm that the proton transport of UCP-mediated uncoupling takes place in the lipid bilayer and not via UCP itself.

To explain the mechanism of FA-induced uncoupling, two major hypotheses have been advanced that differ primarily in the site through which protons are translocated. Klingenberg's group proposes a FA Buffer Model, in which the proton translocation pathway resides in the UCP structure (7Klingenberg M. Huang S-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S.

We propose a FA protonophore model in which the UCPs translocate the anionic FA head group from the matrix to the outer surface of the inner membrane. The FA carboxylate then picks up a proton and rapidly flip-flops back, to release the proton into the matrix (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol.

The UCPs thus catalyze a regulated protonophoretic cycle in which FA, and not UCP protein, serves as the carrier for protons. The FA protonophore model integrates uncoupling with the known anion transport function of UCPs (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol.

J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Indeed, the hypothesis developed out of the recognition that a particular class of anions, the long-chain alkylsulfonates, are ideal probes of UCP transport mechanism. We have studied sulfonates ranging in chain length from 1 to 16 (2, 18), but we have focused on C11-sulfonate, which is transported by UCP1 (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar, 18Jez̆ek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), UCP2 and UCP3 (4Jabůrek M. Vařecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jez̆ek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24272-24277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). C11-sulfonate is identical to laurate except for the head group, and it is transported withK m and V max values close to those obtained for laurate-dependent H+transport (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). Nevertheless, C11-sulfonate cannot catalyze proton transport, because its very low pK a prevents its flip-flop with protons across the lipid bilayer (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). Therefore, C11-sulfonate only participates in the half-cycle of uncoupling that involves UCP. Our basic argument on behalf of the model is that the UCPs contain a transport pathway for long-chain alkylsulfonates, and there is no known mechanism to prevent FA anion from using that pathway. This paper extends our studies of alkylsulfonates as probes of UCP transport mechanism. We describe two new protocols to drive UCP-mediated translocation of the C11-sulfonate head group across the membrane. We show that laurate and C11-sulfonate are mutually competitive substrates of UCP1, indicating that they share a common anion transport mechanism. We show that C11-sulfonate transport and laurate-dependent H+ transport are inhibited by GDP with the same K i. We also report for the first time that C11-sulfonate can be electroneutrally transported with a proton across the membrane as an ion pair with propranolol, an amphiphilic base. Ion-pair transport enables C11-sulfonate to uncouple BAT mitochondria and also to catalyze GDP-dependent, electrophoretic proton transport in proteoliposomes. These results provide new, independent evidence that anion translocation by UCP1 is necessary for uncoupling, whereas proton transport occurs spontaneously in the bilayer. 2A preliminary report of these results was presented in abstract form (37Vařecha M. Breen E. Jabůrek M. Garlid K.D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (.a): 237Google Scholar). BAT mitochondria were isolated from Syrian hamsters as described previously (21Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Sun X.

For studies on intact mitochondria, isolation medium contained 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP, adjusted to pH 7.4 at 25 °C with Tris base. During the final centrifugation, the isolation medium was supplemented with BSA (2 mg/ml), and ATP and dithiothreitol were omitted. Mitochondria were suspended at 50 mg of protein/ml in isolation medium lacking BSA, ATP, and dithiothreitol. BSA treatment was omitted when mitochondria were prepared to undergo endogenous FA removal using the carnitine cycle (22Jez̆ek P. Krasinskaya I.P. Smirnova I. Drahota Z.

The mitochondria were treated with additional BSA as follows: the mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 0.75 ml of isolation medium containing 100 mg/ml BSA and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The volume was adjusted to 30 ml with isolation medium and mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 10 min. This step was repeated twice. The final pellet was resuspended in isolation medium and mitochondria were stored in aliquots of 7.5 mg of protein at −20 °C. UCP1 was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes using previously described procedures (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar, 21Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Sun X. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen mitochondria were first washed with additional BSA (5 mg/ml) and then extracted with octylpentaoxyethylene in the presence of phospholipids. UCP1 was purified using the hydroxyapatite, Bio-Gel (Bio-Rad). The composition of phospholipids and internal medium were adjusted, and the protein/lipid mixture was incubated with Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) to remove detergent and form vesicles. External probe was removed by passage through Sephadex G-50–300 spin columns, which were pre-equilibrated with internal medium. Protein-free liposomes were prepared using the same protocol. Ion fluxes in proteoliposomes were measured using ion-specific fluorescent probes and a SLM Aminco 8000C spectrofluorometer. H+ ion fluxes were measured directly as changes in intraliposomal acid concentration, obtained from changes in SPQ fluorescence due to quenching by TES− anion (21Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Sun X. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). K+ fluxes were obtained from changes in fluorescence of PBFI due to complexation with K+ (21Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Sun X. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Jez̆ek P. Mahdi F. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10522-10526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Media compositions were designed to establish electrochemical gradients of K+ and H+ to drive transport of anions or H+ in the desired direction when valinomycin or CCCP were added. When fatty acid or alkylsulfonate transport driven by K+ diffusion potential was studied, the internal medium contained TEA+ salts and external medium contained K+ salts of TES buffer (30 mm, pH 7.2), SO4 (80 mm), and EGTA (0.6 mm). Transport was initiated by the addition of 25–100 nmvalinomycin. When alkylsulfonate transport driven by pH gradient was studied, internal medium contained TEA+ salt of TES buffer (22.5 mm, pH 7.95), and the external medium contained TEA+ salt of MES buffer (30 mm, pH 6.15). Both media contained TEA+ salts of SO4 (80 mm) and EGTA (0.6 mm). Transport was initiated by the addition of 100 nm CCCP. Each preparation was individually calibrated for fluorescence probe response, and the internal volume of vesicles was estimated from the volume of distribution of the fluorescent probe (21Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Sun X. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein content of liposomes was estimated by the Amido Black procedure (25Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Background leaks were estimated from the flux in the presence of saturating GDP (1 mm) in the intra- and extraliposomal media and used to correct the observed fluxes. Kinetic parameters referred to under “Results” were derived from the Hill equation fits to the corrected fluxes. Assay medium contained 50 mm KCl, 4 mm KPi, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 µm BSA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.25 µm cyclosporin A, 5 mm pyruvate, 5 mm malate, and 20 mm Tris-MOPS, pH 7.2. α-Glycerolphosphate could not be used as a substrate because low concentrations of C11-sulfonate inhibited the dehydrogenase (not shown). Prior to addition of substrates, endogenous FAs were removed by the carnitine cycle, which was initiated by the addition of 25 µm coenzyme A, 0.5 mml-carnitine, and 0.2 mm ATP. Oxygen consumption of 1 mg ml−1 BAT mitochondria was estimated using a Clark polarographic oxygen probe (Yellow Springs) in a thermostated chamber at 25 °C. ΔΨ was estimated using 2.5 µm Safranin O and 0.5 mg ml−1 BAT mitochondria at excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/576 nm, 8-nm slit width. SPQ and PBFI were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Alkylsulfonates were purchased from Research Plus, Inc. Sulfuric acid was purchased from Fisher. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or from sources listed previously (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). We routinely examine transport in liposomes to distinguish nonspecific effects of compounds used to study UCP. Fig.1contains data that address the concern that C11-sulfonate may cause “competitive removal” of FA from the liposomal membrane (7Klingenberg M. Huang S-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We examined the rate and extent of the flip-flop acidification that always occurs when lauric acid is added to liposomes (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar, 4Jabůrek M. Vařecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jez̆ek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25003-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (287) Google Scholar). FA partitions into the membrane, and the protonated head groups undergo flip-flop until equilibrium is reached (26Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 28Jez̆ek P. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both the rate and extent of total acid delivery, recorded by the SPQ probe, will depend on the amount of FA in the membrane. The traces in Fig. 1 A show that laurate causes release of quenching, indicating interior acidification. The rate of flip-flop equilibration is very rapid, being about 80% complete within 10 ms (29Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, the laurate flip-flop rate is not affected by the presence of 100 µm C11-sulfonate. The data in Fig.1 B show that the extent of proton delivery due to lauric acid flip-flop is also unaffected by C11-sulfonate. Thus, long-chain alkylsulfonates have no significant effect on either the rate or extent of proton delivery. From these results, we may safely conclude that alkylsulfonates neither remove FA from the membrane (7Klingenberg M. Huang S-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,8Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) nor do they affect FA partitioning. Indeed, lack of interference is the expected result, since 50 µm lauric acid in a suspension containing 0.5 mg of lipid ml−1 represents a mole fraction in the membrane of only 0.054, assuming a partition coefficient of 5.103 (30Simpson R.B. Ashbrook J.D. Santos E.C. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because long-chain alkylsulfonates have a high partition coefficient in the membrane, the head group moves across the membrane, and the hydrophobic alkyl tail remains in the hydrophobic barrier, as it does with FA (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). The conclusion that the head groups of long-chain alkylsulfonates are transported by UCP1 has been challenged on the basis that “C11-sulfonate … did not pass through UCP1 but was driven through the membrane … in a ternary complex formed with valinomycin and K+” (7Klingenberg M. Huang S-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We addressed this issue using two approaches. First, we examined the effects of valinomycin on transport of C11-sulfonate and laurate in liposomes and in UCP1-containing proteoliposomes with saturating GDP (1 mm) on both sides of the membrane, with the following results (data not shown): K+ flux increased linearly with concentrations of C11-sulfonate or laurate at constant valinomycin, and a linear response was also observed when valinomycin was varied. The magnitude of this ion pair transport was about the same with laurate and C11-sulfonate and amounted to less than 10% of theV max of GDP-sensitive transport through UCP. We routinely corrected for this nonspecific leak using the value obtained when saturating GDP was present on both sides of the membrane. The second approach takes advantage of the fact that there is more than one way to drive anion uniport across the membrane, as diagrammed in Fig. 2. For anion transport driven by a K+ diffusion gradient, charge transport is measured as K+ influx (Fig. 2 A). For anion transport driven by a H+ diffusion gradient, charge transport is measured as total acid influx (Fig. 2 B). As shown by the data in Fig.3, CCCP indeed drives C11-sulfonate uniport across the membrane, and this transport is sensitive to GDP, being maximally inhibited by GDP on both sides of the membrane. CCCP certainly cannot form ion pairs with sulfonate, so this experiment provides new independent evidence that C11-sulfonate is specifically transported by UCP1 (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar).Figure 3GDP-dependent C11-sulfonate uniport through UCP1 driven by pH gradient in the presence of CCCP. Shown are traces of charge transport, measured as total acid influx, as monitored by SPQ fluorescence. Addition of 100 nm CCCP (CCCP) caused a rapid internal acidification (no GDP), reflecting inward net transport of the C11-sulfonate head group, as diagrammed in Fig. 2 B. C11-sulfonate uniport was partially inhibited by 1 mmexternal GDP (GDP out only) and completely inhibited when 1 mm GDP was present on both sides of the membrane (GDPin+out). Proteoliposomes were prepared and pH gradient media were used, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This experiment is representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 4contains the C11-sulfonate dose dependence and GDP inhibition of charge transport measured as K+ influx in the valinomycin-K+ system (Fig.4 A), and as H+ influx in the CCCP-H+system (Fig. 4 B). The results using the two methods are qualitatively the same, including the random orientation of the nucleotide-binding sites, which leads to 50% inhibition by external GDP (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar, 17Jez̆ek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V max values in the two assays are different, because the driving forces are different. However, theK m values are very similar at 41 µm(K+ gradient) and 49 µm (pH gradient). These results confirm that C11-sulfonate uniport is mediated by reconstituted UCP1 (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). We measured the K i for GDP inhibition of transport at pH 7.2 by reconstituted UCP1 in the presence of 100 µmlaurate and 100 µm C11-sulfonate, with the results shown in Fig. 5. The observedK i values were nearly identical for the two anions: 15.8 ± 2.4 µm (n = 3) and 14.1 ± 2.2 µm (n = 3) for the inhibition of C11-sulfonate and laurate transport, respectively. Moreover, these values are in excellent agreement with values previously obtained for GDP inhibition of Cl− transport (15–21 µm) (17Jez̆ek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and H+ transport (13–17 µm) (19Jez̆ek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through reconstituted UCP1 at pH 7.2. Because UCP1 is randomly oriented in the vesicles (17Jez̆ek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), about half of the GDP-binding sites are inaccessible to external GDP. The experiments in Fig. 5 were carried out with 1 mm internal GDP to block these inaccessible sites. We also studied GDP inhibition kinetics in the absence of internal GDP, and the K i values for both solutes were the same, about 15 µm (data not shown). We showed previously that C11-sulfonate competitively inhibits laurate-induced H+ uniport mediated by UCP1 (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). To obtain the data in Fig. 6, we increased C11-sulfonate concentration as total anion concentration (C11-sulfonate plus laurate) was held constant. It can be seen that C11-sulfonate progressively inhibits laurate-dependent H+ uniport, whereas total charge transport remains constant. This means that laurate and C11-sulfonate are mutually competitive inhibitors and most likely share a common translocation pathway in UCP1 (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). Ion-pair transport of amphiphilic amines with amphiphilic anions in mitochondria was first described by Garlid and Nakashima (31Garlid K.D. Nakashima R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7974-7980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of the electroneutral ion pair was shown to induce uncoupling or net salt uptake with swelling, depending on experimental conditions. Although ion-pair transport of long-chain alkylsulfonates has not previously been demonstrated, this mechanism would enable the alkylsulfonates to cycle across the membrane, thereby delivering protons and permitting UCP1-mediated uncoupling. The mechanism of this novel uncoupling is described in the legend to Fig.7. As shown in Figs. 8and9, addition of C11-sulfonate and propranolol catalyzed electrophoretic H+ flux in liposomes containing UCP1. The traces in Fig. 8 A show ion pair transport in the bilayer, prior to addition of valinomycin. Propranolol equilibrated rapidly across the membrane, causing internal alkalization due to acid-base equilibration on the interior surface. Upon addition of C11-sulfonate, there is a relatively slow return to the original internal pH, reflecting ion-pair transport of propranolol-C11-sulfonate to equilibrium. The delivery and consumption of internal acid (mm total acid) by these two steps is given simply by, δ[H+]i(internal acidification)=−[BH]i++[S]i−(Eq. 1) where [BH]i+ and [S]i− are internalized propranolol and C11-sulfonate, respectively. It is important to note that propranolol exerts its effect on the bilayer and not on UCP1. Thus, these events occur at the same rate and to the same extent independently of GDP or UCP (Fig. 8 A). Moreover, propranolol had no effect on FA-dependent H+ flux mediated by UCP (data not shown).Figure 9Kinetics of C11-sulfonate-dependent H+ fluxes resulted from ion-pairing with propranolol in proteoliposomes containing UCP1. Concentration dependence of C11-sulfonate-dependent net H+ fluxes in the presence (▪) or absence (●) of 100 µm propranolol. Propranolol and C11-sulfonate were added to the proteoliposomes in assay medium, followed by addition of 100 nm valinomycin to initiate H+ influx, as in Fig. 8. The fluxes in the presence of 1 mm GDP inside and outside the proteoliposomes were subtracted. Inset,Eadie-Hofstee plot constructed for the net fluxes, ΔJ, yielded K m 53 µm andV max 2.59 µmol of H+min−1 (mg protein)−1. H+transport was measured in the presence of K+ gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This experiment is representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The traces in Fig. 8 B follow the events that occur after addition of valinomycin, and show that ion pair transport supports GDP-sensitive, electrophoretic proton transport. As described in Fig.7, C11-sulfonate anion is transported by UCP1; the anion is cycled back with protons through ion pair transport; and the cycle is completed by back-flux and protonation of propranolol base. This experiment provides strong evidence that uncoupling does not require H+translocation by UCP1, but rather requires H+ transport in the bilayer. Fig. 9 contains the kinetic measurements for UCP1-mediated uncoupling using C11-sulfonate and propranolol. No H+ flux is detectable in the absence of propranolol, because sulfonates are such strong acids that they cannot be protonated and therefore cannot complete the uncoupling cycle (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2515-2520Google Scholar). The V max andK m values obtained for C11-sulfonate were 2.6 µmol of H+ min−1 (mg protein)−1 and 48 µm, respectively. The net rate of H+transport, after correction for rates observed with saturating GDP on both sides of the membrane, is almost identical with the rate of ion pair transport (compare Fig. 8, A and B). This indicates that UCP-mediated proton flux is limited by the slow rate of ion pair transport in the bilayer. In the case of unsubstituted FA, FA-dependent H+ transport is never limited by FA flip-flop in the membrane. In separate experiments, not shown, we have obtained similar results with C9- and C15-sulfonates, which are analogs of decanoic and palmitic acids, respectively. As previously reported (2Garlid K.D.

Synthetic and recombinant versions of FUD were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and used in fluorescence anisotropy experiments.

Dimerization occurs via disulfide bonds at the extreme C terminus of each monomer. There are 12 type I finger modules, each of which contains about 45 residues and two conserved disulfide bonds (2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). Type I modules are located near the N and C termini of each monomer. The N-terminal type I modules are interrupted by a protease sensitive connecting sequence and two type II modules. Type II modules also have a pair of disulfides (2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). The majority of Fn consists of type III modules that contain about 90 residues and no disulfide bonds (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins.

Four examples of alternative mRNA splicing have been identified. Two occur with the splicing in or out of additional type III modules known as extra domains A and B. Another involves RNA encoding 120 residues termed the variable segment, can be included completely, partially, or left out (2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin.

Fn is readily cleaved into functional domains by controlled proteolysis (5Hynes R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Cue D. Southern S.O. Southern P.J. Prabhakar J. Lorelli W. Smallheer M. Mousa S.A. Cleary P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).F1 is one of a number of microbial adhesins known as microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) that bind Fn (19Joh D. Wann E.R. Kreikemeyer B. Speziale P. Höök M. Matrix Biol. 1999; : 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The external portion of F1 contains two types of repeats known as repeat domain 1 (RD1) and repeat domain 2 (RD2) (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RD2 consist of 37 amino acid residues repeated fully four times and partially a fifth time (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RD2 is similar to the Fn-binding D repeat region in the Fn-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus (20Signäs C. Raucci G. Jönsson K. Lindgren P.E. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Immediately N-terminal to the RD2 repeats is a 43-residue upstream fibronectin binding domain (UFBD) that is unique to F1 compared with other MSCRAMMs (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two known functional binding domains of F1 cross the homology boundaries of UFBD and RD2. A recombinant protein consisting of an RD2 and the adjacent UFBD completely blocks adherence of S. pyogenes to Fn (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Further analysis defined a functional upstream domain (FUD) as a 49-residue sequence that consists of the 43 residues of the UFBD and the N-terminal six residues of the first RD2 (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). FUD is the smallest sequence that retains the affinity of F1 for Fn (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second functional binding domain, known as the functional repeated domain (FRD), includes 44 residues of two contiguous RD2 repeats beginning and ending with the sequence MGGQSES (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recombinant FUD or a protein encompassing UFBD and RD5 blocks binding of iodinated Fn to F1-bearing S. pyogenes with ID50 concentration a 50% inhibitory of 0.5 nm, whereas RD5, a protein with four FRDs, blocks with an ID50 of 50 nm (21Hanski E. Jaffe J. Ozeri V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 408: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).We recently found that recombinant FUD and FUD-derived peptides are potent inhibitors of assembly of Fn by fibroblastic cells, a process that is initiated by binding of the N-terminal part of Fn to cell surfaces of fibroblastic cells (22Tomasini-Johansson B.R.

FUD is known to bind to the N-terminal region of Fn (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Huff et al. (23Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used fluorescence anisotropy to define interactions between soluble Fn or the N-terminal modules of Fn and the D repeats of S. aureusFn-binding protein. We describe a similar approach to quantify interactions between the binding sequences of F1 and Fn. Specifically, we measured interactions between a variety of proteolytic and recombinant pieces of Fn and a series of recombinant and synthetic peptides representing full-length and truncated versions of FUD. These experiments demonstrated that subsites within the 49 residues of FUD bind to specific N-terminal type I modules of Fn.DISCUSSIONWe characterized the interaction between Fn and the 49-residue FUD and 44-residue FRD sequences of Fl from S. pyogenes using a solution-phase fluorescence polarization assay and synthetic 49-mer, synthetic 49-mer derivatives, and recombinant dimeric fusion proteins as probes. Several important conclusions emerged. 1) Both the 49-mer and FUD bound tightly (K D of ∼20 nm) to the N-terminal fragment of Fn. 2) Optimal binding of the 49-mer to the N-terminal portion of Fn required modules I1 and/or I2. 3) Both probes also bound with lower affinity to parts of Fn that do not include I1 or I2 but are composed of other type I modules,viz. I6–I9 (recombinant FUD) or I6–I9 plus I10–I12 (synthetic 49-mer and recombinant FUD). 4) Although the 49-mer bound to the N-terminal portion of Fn lacking I4 and I5, a 42-mer lacking the N-terminal seven residues of the 49-mer did not. 5) Further truncation of the 49-mer abolished all binding.The increase in anisotropy upon binding to 70-kDa fragment of FITC-49-mer labeled at the N-terminal lysine was less than the increase upon binding of 49-mer labeled at the internal lysines. These findings indicate that FITC tethered at either the N terminus or the middle of the 49-mer is immobilized upon binding of the 49-mer to the 70-kDa N-terminal fragment, although to different degrees. The affinities of binding of purified singly labeled derivatives were similar within a factor of three. We do not know whether the differences are due to loss of binding affinity upon derivation of Lys-1 or gain of binding affinity upon derivation of Lys-31 or Lys-32. The increase in anisotropy also varied depending on the target in order: 70-kDa fragment = Fn > 27-kDa fragment. Such variation in change in anisotropy is consistent with the 27-kDa fragment being smaller than the 70-kDa fragment and with the 70-kDa fragment having segmental flexibility within Fn (30Williams E.C. Janmey P.A. Ferry J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14973-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 49-mer bound to recombinant Gap mutants of the 70-kDa construct lacking I4 and I5 but with less avidity than to intact 70-kDa fragment. A peptide lacking the N-terminal seven residues of the 49-residue sequence did not bind to the Fn construct having I1 and I2 but lacking I4 and I5. The six C-terminal residues derived from the first RD2 sequence have previously been demonstrated to be required for binding of FUD to Fn (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The findings, taken together, suggest that the entire lengths of the 49-mer and of modules I1–I5 contribute to binding. Proteins and peptides based on sequences from the Fn-binding MSCRAMM of S. aureus are in a random conformation in solution (31House-Pompeo K. Xu Y. Joh D. Speziale P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1379-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Far-UV circular dichroism of recombinant FUD indicates that it is in a random conformation also. 2J. Spanbauer and D. F. Mosher, unpublished observation. A 49-residue peptide in a random conformation would have a maximum length of 16 nm. This length approximates the length of an array of five type I modules (3Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,32Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the 49-mer binds in a single mode to modules I1–I5 of Fn such that specific subsites in the 49-mer interact with specific Fn modules.The specificity of binding of the 49-mer contrasts with the specificity of the three 38-residue D motifs found in the Fn-binding protein ofS. aureus. The third D motif binds best to modules I4 and I5 of the 27-kDa fragment of Fn, but with micromolar rather than nanomolar affinities (23Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When multiple D motifs, which each contain a sequence similar to the essential VETEDT sequence found at the C terminus of FUD (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), are expressed together, however, low nm affinities are achieved (23Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that the sequence PNYQFGGHNSVDFEEDT at C-terminal part of the D3 repeat, which is similar to the PNETGFSGNMVETEDT sequence at the C terminus of the 49-mer, converts from a disordered to a more ordered extended conformation on binding to recombinant I4–I5 (34Penkett C.J. Dobson C.M. Smith L.J. Bright J.R. Pickford A.R.C.I.D. Potts J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The comparisons of binding of 49-mer and 42-mer to Gap mutants indicate that the N-terminal seven residues of the 49-mer bind to I1 and/or I2. Thus, we speculate that binding of the 49-mer to I1–I5 is driven by an interaction of the N-terminal residues with I1 and/or I2 that is specific for the 49-mer and an interaction of the C-terminal residues with I4 and I5 that is similar to the interaction of D3 with I4 and I5. Peptides representing the N-terminal half of D3 bind with low affinity to recombinant I1–I2 (35Joh D. Speziale P. Gurusiddappa S. Manor J. Hook M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 258: 897-905Google Scholar). However, there is no obvious similarity between the N-terminal sequences of the 49-mer and D3.The type I module folds as two β-sheets stabilized by two disulfides and a hydrophobic core (3Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). One sheet has two strands (A and B); the second has three strands (C, D, and E). Neither the CB-7 fragment of collagen nor heparin competed for binding of the probes to the 70-kDa fragment of Fn. These findings indicate that the sites of interaction of FUD with the 70-kDa fragment are distinct from sites where collagen or heparin bind. In vitro mutagenesis studies indicate that important residues for the interaction of the 27-kDa fragment with heparin are within the D–E, or Ω, loops of type I modules (36Kishore R. Samuel M. Khan M.Y. Hand J. Frenzi D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17078-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lack of competition by heparin, therefore, suggests that the interaction between the FUD of F1 and Fn involve other parts of type I modules than the D–E loops. NMR studies of the binding of staphylococcal D3 to recombinant I4–I5 indicate that binding occurs on one face of the I4–I5 structure that includes both loops and strands (34Penkett C.J. Dobson C.M. Smith L.J. Bright J.R. Pickford A.R.C.I.D. Potts J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NMR studies also indicate that the I4–I5 module pair is fixed due to a well defined intermodule interface (32Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas the I1–I2 module pair is joined by a flexible linker without a discernible interface (33Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to learn how the 49-mer interacts with I1–I2versus I4–I5.Our solution phase binding results were, in general, compatible with previous studies of binding using competitive assays and recombinant FUD (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Hanski E. Jaffe J. Ozeri V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 408: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In competitive assays, recombinant FUD was found to compete for binding interactions of both the 27-kDa fibrin-binding fragment and the 40-kDa gelatin-binding fragment, but FUD competed best when the fragments were linked together as the70-kDa N-terminal fragment (15Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In our fluorescence polarization assay, recombinant FUD bound better to the 70-kDa fragment than to its 40-kDa gelatin-binding or 27-kDa N-terminal subfragments. The 49-mer, in contrast, bound to the 70-kDa fragment and 27-kDa subfragment equally well but did not bind to the 40-kDa subfragment. The 49-mer also bound to gelatin-binding 160/180-kDa tryptic fragments containing three C-terminal type I modules plus the four type I modules of the gelatin-binding region. These results suggest that synthetic 49-mer and recombinant FUD recognize and bind a general feature of type I modules. This general binding likely is polymodal in the sense that a given subsite in the 49-mer can interact with multiple type I modules and vice versa. The dimeric character of recombinant FUD in which the two 49-residue sequences are tethered near their N termini by a disulfide may constrain and alter the binding specificity of subsites within the recombinant protein for modules I1–I5 and thus account for the differences in binding activities of the recombinant FUDversus 49-mer.Synthetic 49-mer and recombinant FUD are both inhibitors of assembly of Fn and binding of 70-kDa N-terminal fragment of Fn to sites on the surface of fibroblasts where assembly takes place (22Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23430-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies of Fn-null fibroblasts lacking Fn matrix indicate that the effects of 49-mer and FUD are due to binding to soluble Fn or 70-kDa fragment (22Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23430-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ID50 for inhibition of binding of 4 nm Fn to fibroblasts by 49-mer or FUD is ∼10 nm (22Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23430-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), very similar to the K D values of binding estimated by the present fluorescence polarization assay. However, recombinant FRD and synthetic 42-mer, which bound to the 70-kDa fragment with affinities only slightly less than FUD or 49-mer as estimated by the fluorescence polarization assay, are poor inhibitors of the binding of 70-kDa fragment to fibroblasts, with ID50 values of >500 nm (22Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R. Ensenberger M.G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23430-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between the fluorescent polarization and fibroblast binding assays indicate that the specific mode of binding to Fn and not the affinity of binding determines whether a given sequence blocks binding of Fn to cells. In relation to bacterial adhesion and entrance into cells, the specificity of the FUD sequence for the five N-terminal modules of Fn may be important for the conformation of Fn bound to F1 on the surface of S. pyogenes. Rather than simply capturing Fn, the FUD sequence of F1 may bind the N-terminal region of one or both subunits of Fn with an exact polarity and thus determine whether other parts of Fn bind other parts of F1 and adopt conformations that would facilitate bacterial entry into epithelial cells. Fibronectin (Fn)1 is a 500-kDa dimer of 250-kDa subunits that are composed of three types of repeating homologous sequences, known as type I, II, and III modules (Fig. 1 A) (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar, 3Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Dimerization occurs via disulfide bonds at the extreme C terminus of each monomer. There are 12 type I finger modules, each of which contains about 45 residues and two conserved disulfide bonds (2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). Type I modules are located near the N and C termini of each monomer. The N-terminal type I modules are interrupted by a protease sensitive connecting sequence and two type II modules. Type II modules also have a pair of disulfides (2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). The majority of Fn consists of type III modules that contain about 90 residues and no disulfide bonds (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). Four examples of alternative mRNA splicing have been identified. Two occur with the splicing in or out of additional type III modules known as extra domains A and B. Another involves RNA encoding 120 residues termed the variable segment, can be included completely, partially, or left out (2Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-24Google Scholar). The final example involves exclusion of RNA encoding modules III-15 and I-10 known as the (V+C)− splice variant (4Burton-Wurster N. Gendelman R. Chen H. Gu D.N. Tetreault J.W. Lust G. Schwarzbauer J.E. Macleod J.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fn is readily cleaved into functional domains by controlled proteolysis (5Hynes R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These functional domains retain binding activity to substrates such as cells, extracellular matrix proteins, and bacteria (6Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, New York1989: 47-121Google Scholar). Many bacterial pathogens have exploited Fn as a means to adhere, colonize, and invade host tissue (7Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Group A streptococcus has traditionally been viewed as an extracellular pathogen responsible for human diseases of varying severity, ranging from nonsuppurative infections of the pharynx and skin to toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and sepsis (8Bisno A.L. Stevens D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that Group A streptococcus is capable of inducing its own entry into several eukaryotic cell types in vitro (9LaPenta D. Rubens C. Chi E. Cleary P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Entry of Group A streptococcus into cells also occurs in vivo and may contribute to bacterial persistence despite antibiotic therapy (13Österlund A. Popa R. Nikkila T. Scheynius A. Engstrand L.

Protein F1 of Streptococcus pyogenes is a major adhesin and invasin of Group A streptococcus that binds soluble and extracellular matrix-associated Fn with a high affinity by a mechanism involving two domains of the molecule (15Ozeri V.

The gating mechanism of these channels is mediated by a direct interaction of the Gβγ subunits of G protein, which are released upon inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor activation. This gating mechanism is further manifested by intracellular factors such as anionic phospholipids and Na+ and Mg2+ ions. In addition to the essential role of these components for channel function, phosphorylation events can also modulate channel activity. In this study we explored the involvement of redox modulation on GIRK channel function. Extracellular application of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), but not reduced glutathione, activated GIRK channels without affecting their permeation or rectification properties. The DTT-dependent activation was found to mimic receptor activation and to act directly on the channel in a membrane delimited fashion. A critical cysteine residue located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain was found to be essential for DTT-dependent activation in hetero- and homotetrameric contexts. Interestingly, when mutating this cysteine residue, DTT-dependent activation was abolished, but receptor-mediated channel activation was not affected. These results suggest that intracellular redox potential can play a major role in tuning GIRK channel activity in a receptor-independent manner.

The Na+-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate interaction can also serve as a mechanism for modulating by external ligands (20Rogalski S.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14855-14860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to the modulatory action of the various ionic species mentioned above, channel function can also be tuned by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Activation of TrkB receptors by neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor affects channel function via tyrosine phosphorylation (21Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and activation of cAMP formation via β2-adrenergic receptors facilitates channel function (22Mullner C.

These phosphorylation events may act by affecting the interaction of the Gβγ subunits with the channel by occluding the Gβγ binding site (23Medina I. Krapivinsky G. Arnold S. Kovoor P. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29709-29716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibitory signaling can occur via protein kinase C modulation by an as yet unknown mechanism (24Vorobiov D. Levin G. Lotan I. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Several studies have shown that redox signaling can serve as an additional mechanism to modulate ion channel activity to link the metabolic state of the cell to its electrical properties (for review see Refs. 27Peers C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 28Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Redox signaling has been found to affect the activity of several ion channels, such as theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, NR1 (29Sullivan J.M. Traynelis S.F. Chen H.S. Escobar W. Heinemann S.F. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 929-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, hslo (30DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4942-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ryanodine receptor (31Haarmann C.S. Fink R.H. Dulhunty A.F. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3010-3022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a voltage gated K+ channel, Kv1.4 (32Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the inwardly rectifying K+ channel, IRK1 (33Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the role of redox potential in mediating GIRK channel activity expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Exposure of GIRK channels to the membrane-permeable redox agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), but not impermeable glutathione (GSH), increased channel activity in a reversible manner when monitored under intact whole cell conditions. This effect of DTT was specifically attributed to an N-terminal cytosolic cysteine residue, as mutating this residue abolished DTT action without affecting receptor-mediated channel activation. In this study, we suggest that an increase of GIRK channel activity by redox signaling can serve as a protective cellular mechanism under hypoxic or ischemic insults. All channels and their mutants were subcloned into pGEMHE expression vector (34Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Oocytes were prepared as described previously (14Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Healthy-looking stage 5–6 oocytes were selected and micro-injected with 50 nl of cRNA of the various channel mutant cRNA alone (∼0.1–5 ng) or with human m2 muscarinic receptor (∼.5 ng), Gβ1γ2 (∼1 ng each), cβARK (C-terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase, ∼1 ng) (35Jing J. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Thornhill W.B. Reuveny E. Lotan I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or PTX-S1 (36Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (∼1 ng). All recordings were made 3–14 days post-injection. Site-directed mutagenesis was done based on polymerase chain reaction of full-length plasmid using the high fidelity Pfu polymerase (method by Stratagene). Positive clones were verified by sequencing. Currents through the expressed channels were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as previously described (14Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Oocytes were held at 0 mV unless otherwise indicated, and voltage ramps from −100 mV to +50 mV for 0.6 s were applied. The oocytes were washed for at least 2 min with 90K solution containing 90 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (KOH) before data collection. In all experiments presented, oocytes expressing less than 10 μA of current at −100 mV were used. Single-channel currents were measured by the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier as previously described (14Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The FVPP bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mmNa2H2P2O7, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaOH, pH 7.2,N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG) (37Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). DTT and GSH were diluted from 1 and 0.5 m stock solutions, respectively, before use. Data are presented as fold induction means ± S.E., and n denotes the number of oocytes assayed. A t test was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences between different populations. We were interested in testing the effect of the reducing agent, DTT, on GIRK1/4 channel function. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings of Xenopus oocytes expressing GIRK1 and GIRK4 display inwardly rectifying currents upon application of voltage ramp protocols from −100 to +50 mV. Upon the application of 10 mm DTT to the extracellular solution in the absence of expressed G protein coupled receptors and agonists of native receptors, a gradual increase in basal inwardly rectifying current is apparent that reaches a maximum steady state induction within 10 min of application and reverses upon DTT washout to base-line levels (Fig.1, A and B). The average induction of GIRK1/4 channel currents was 2.62 ± 0.20-fold (n = 12) (Fig. 1 C). The DTT-induced currents did not change the rectification characteristics monitored at +50 mV (Fig. 1, A and B) and did not change ion selectivity (K+ versusNa+, data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that the selective increase in membrane current by DTT is mainly due to an increase in activity of GIRK1/4 channels. In control experiments, DTT had no effect on uninjected oocyte basal current levels. To assess the dose dependence of DTT action on GIRK1/4 channel currents, we measured current levels in response to a series of DTT solutions of increasing concentrations. We found that the DTT concentration that induced 50% of the maximal increase in basal GIRK1/4 currents was 1.93 ± 0.89 mm, with a Hill coefficient of 0.84 ± 0.32 (Fig.1 D). To test whether DTT action is intracellular, we also tested the effect of the non-permeant reducing agent GSH on channel currents. GSH, at 10 mm, did not induce an increase in current (0.68 ± 0.05-fold (n = 6) induction), suggesting that the action site of DTT is intracellular (Fig.1 C). We also wanted to test whether the effect seen with DTT on GIRK1/4 channel currents was specific for the GIRK family. We therefore tested the effect of DTT using the same protocols as above on the G protein-independent inwardly rectifying K+ channel, IRK1. DTT had no stimulatory effect on the IRK1 currents but, rather, induced a slight inhibition 0.79 ± 0.17- fold (n = 6) (Fig. 1 D). The decrease in IRK1 currents by DTT has been seen before by Ruppersberg et al. (33Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We then tested whether the DTT effect depends on soluble components endogenously present in the oocyte cytosol. To further verify that the lack of GSH to induce channel activity was due to its inability to cross the plasma membrane, we performed single channel recordings on excised inside-out patches and tested the effect of 1 mm DTT or 10 mm GSH applied to the cytosolic face of the patch. Extensive washes of the inner face of the patches did not abolish the DTT or the GSH effect. Both DTT and GSH increased the probability of channel openings without affecting the single channel amplitude measured at −100 mV (Fig.2, A and B). Interestingly, extensive washout (for at least 5 min) was not able to reverse either the DTT or the GSH effects, and the channels remained as active as in the presence of the corresponding reducing agent. Thus, these results suggest that the action of DTT to induce channel activation is membrane-delimited, and the reversibility of this effect (as seen under whole cell measurements, Fig. 1 A) may depend on the cytoplasmic factor(s) that is absent in the excised patch. In native tissue, GIRK1/4 channels are activated by neurotransmitter receptor stimulation, and so we were interested in examining the nature of DTT channel induction in relation to activation by the type 2 muscarinic receptor (m2R). Oocytes were co-injected with GIRK1/4 channel and m2R, and the effect of DTT was tested in the presence and absence of receptor stimulation using 3 μmcarbachol. Receptor-mediated channel activity was measured after 30 s of application of carbachol in the presence and in the absence of 10 mm DTT (Fig.3 A). Carbachol application alone increased the GIRK1/4 currents by 6.6 ± 0.7-fold (n = 8), and carbachol application in addition to DTT increased the current by 6.7 ± 0.5-fold (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that DTT induction of the GIRK1/4 channel is not additive to receptor stimulation and, thus, may act on the same activation pathway or on a converged one. To further explore this possibility, we tested whether DTT is able to induce channel currents once channels are fully activated, independent of receptor stimulation. One way to fully activate the channels is by the co-expression of the channel with the Gβ1γ2 subunits of the G protein (4Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Application of 10 mm DTT to oocytes co-expressing GIRK1/4 channels and Gβ1γ2induced an increase in currents with 1.34 ± 0.11-fold (n = 5) induction (Fig.4 A), but as with receptor stimulation, this effect was occluded in that it was considerably smaller that the 2.6-fold induction seen in the absence of Gβγ. An alternate way to test the effect of DTT on fully activated GIRK1/4 channels is to use constitutively active, Gβγ-independent channel mutants (14Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These mutations, localized to the TM2 domain of the channel, lock the channel in its activated conformation. We tested two of these mutants, GIRK1(C179A)/GIRK4(C185A) and GIRK1(S170P)/GIRK4(S176P). Once again, DTT had a considerably attenuated induction of channel currents, with 1.24 ± 0.06 (n = 5) and 1.19 ± 0.07-fold (n = 8) induction for the two mutants, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The reduced ability of DTT to induce channel activity in activated channels suggests that the action of DTT may be to mimic Gβγ-dependent activation.Figure 4DTT is ineffective on fully activated channel and does not directly activate G proteins. A, bar graph summarizing the effect of 10 mm DTT application on fully activated GIRK1/4 channels by either co-expressing Gβ1γ2 subunits or on constitutively active GIRK1(C179A)/GIRK4(C185A) and GIRK1(S170P)/GIRK4(S176P) mutant channels. B, bar graph summarizing the full effectiveness of 10 mm DTT in activating GIRK1/4 channels co-expressed with the Gβγ binding domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (cβARK), the catalytic subunit ofpertussis toxin (PTX-S1), or Gαssubunit of the G protein. C, bar graphsummarizing the inability of 3 μm carbachol to activate GIRK1/4 channels co-expressed with either cβARK (C-terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase) or PTX-S1, demonstrating that either trapping Gβγ or preventing it from dissociating from the G protein trimer is sufficient to block m2R stimulation without affecting DTT induction (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two possibilities are likely to explain the above results. The action of DTT could be the consequence of direct reduction of the channel, and the second possibility involves DTT activation of either the G protein trimers to release Gβγ or of another second messenger system. To address the latter possibility, we tested the ability of DTT to induce channel currents under three different conditions that reduce the levels of free Gβγ in the oocyte. The first way was by co-expressing the catalytic subunits of pertussis toxin (PTX-S1). PTX-S1 induces ADP-mediated ribosylation of the Gαi/o subunit of the G protein and prevents the release of Gβγ. The second way to reduce free Gβγ levels in the oocyte was by expressing the C-terminal end of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (C-βARK), which has been shown to bind the Gβγ subunits of G proteins (38Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and, thus, to reduce channel activity (4Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The third way to reduce Gβγ levels was by the co-expression of Gαs, with the idea that an excess of Gαswill act as a large sink for free Gβγ subunits (39Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As expected, under the first two conditions, m2R activation was impaired (Fig.4 C). However, the DTT induction was not significantly affected (Fig. 4 B). DTT induction for co-expression with PTX-S1, C-βARK (C-terminal end of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase), or Gαs was 2.2 ± 0.2, 1.9 ± 0.3, and 2.9 ± 0.8-fold, respectively. These results suggest that DTT activates GIRK1/4 channels without a direct activation of G proteins. As discussed above, protein kinases may regulate GIRK channel activity. To rule out any involvement of protein kinase A or protein kinase C in DTT action, we used the potent nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H7). Oocytes expressing GIRK1/4 channels were incubated in 100 μm H7 for at least 20 min before recordings, and the action of DTT was then tested. Incubation with H7 failed to affect DTT stimulatory action, with DTT induction of 2 ± 0.3-fold. These results suggest that the action of DTT on the channel is not mediated through the activation of protein kinase A or protein kinase C in the oocytes. Recently, it has become evident that many proteins undergo specific post-translational modification on cysteine residues, mainly by the use of nitric oxide donors, to form nitrosylated cysteines (for review, see ref. 40Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Thus, another possible target for DTT action is the breakdown of a nitrosylated cysteine that participates in channel regulation. We explored this possibility using two independent approaches to modify nitric oxide levels; those approaches were either by using a nitrosothiol derivative that releases nitric oxide,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, or by direct inhibition of nitric oxide synthase usingNG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. These compounds had no affect on channel function, receptor activation, or basal channel activity (not shown). In addition, it is also worth noting that the critical negative residue essential for the acid-base catalysis of sulfahydryl nitrosylation, which should flank potential nitrosylated cysteines, is not present around cysteines in either GIRK1 or GIRK4 (41Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). These results thus suggest that GIRK channels are not regulated by nitrosylation, and the effect of DTT is probably not mediated through this pathway. The above results suggest that DTT may mediate channel induction via direct reduction of cytoplasmic cysteines of the channel molecule. GIRK1 and GIRK4 contain seven and eight cysteine residues, respectively, including two extracellular conserved residues at positions 123 and 156 in GIRK1 and at positions 129 and 162 in GIRK4. These cysteines are fully conserved in all inwardly rectifying K+ channels and have been shown to be important for the assembly of IRK-like channels (42Bannister J.P. Young B.A. Sivaprasadarao A. Wray D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 43Cho H.C. Tsushima R.G. Nguyen T.T. Guy H.R. Backx P.H.

Physiol. 1999; 438: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There is an additional cysteine located in the TM2 domain that is conserved in all members of the GIRK and K-ATP channel families. This cysteine has been shown to be involved in Gβγ-mediated gating conformation (14Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alignment of the Kir family members reveals another conserved residue at the intracellular N terminus of the channel, at positions 53 and 60 in GIRK1 and GIRK4, respectively. The remaining intracellular cysteines are located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of the channel (Fig.5 A). All six GIRK4 intracellular cysteines were replaced, and the channel mutants were co-expressed with wild type GIRK1 channel. We found that none of the single cysteine substitutions affected the ability of DTT to induce channel currents (Fig. 5 B). The following GIRK4 mutants co-expressed with GIRK1 were induced by DTT by: C60A, 1.98 ± 0.20 (n = 5)-fold; C216A, 3.32 ± 0.66 (n = 5)-fold; C316T, 1.85 ± 0.18 (n = 5)-fold; C362A + C363S, 1.84 ± 0.11 (n = 5)-fold; C389A, 1.86 ± .07 (n = 5)-fold (Fig. 5 C). Since removing individual cysteines from GIRK4 in the heteromultimeric context was not sufficient to affect DDT action, we wanted to test whether removing all intracellular cysteines in a homomultimeric context would have an effect. To simplify the possible mutant combinations we used a GIRK4 mutant, GIRK4(S143T), that has been shown to form functional homotetramers (36Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and tested the ability of DTT to induce its currents. Fig. 6 Arepresents a time course of DTT induction of the GIRK4(S143T) channel. DTT was able to induce GIRK4(S143T) channel currents in a similar manner to the GIRK1/4 heteromultimer with 2.3 ± 0.3-fold induction. We then removed all intracellular cysteines in the background of the S143T mutation and tested the effect of DTT (Fig.6 B). DTT failed to affect the homomeric GIRK4(S143T), lacking all six intracellular cysteines (C60A, C216A, C316T, C362A, C363S, and C389A), with 0.8 ± 0.23-fold induction (Fig.6 D), without affecting m2R activated currents (Fig.6 C). This first suggests that the action of DTT on induction of channel currents is probably mediated through the channel intracellular cysteines and, second, that the mechanism by which DTT induces activity and receptor-mediated activation are via two separate pathways. We set out to identify the cysteine residue responsible for DTT induction in the homomeric GIRK4(S143T) context. We therefore mutated all intracellular cysteines in groups according to their location in the linear sequence of the channel. All channel mutants that contained the C60A mutation failed to respond to DTT (Fig. 6 D). Thus, these results suggest that the cysteine residue at position C60 is involved in channel activation by DTT. Since in native tissues most of the GIRK channel combinations form heteromultimers, we also wanted to test whether mutating the analogous cysteines at position Cys-53 and Cys-60 in GIRK1 and GIRK4, respectively, would affect DTT induction. GIRK1(C53A)/GIRK4(C60A) mutant channels failed to respond to DTT, as seen in the homomultimeric context (Fig.7 A), without affecting the ability of carbachol to induce currents (Fig. 7 B). These results again suggest that the N-terminal cysteines at positions Cys-53 and Cys-60 in GIRK1 and GIRK4, respectively, play a critical role in DTT action without affecting receptor-mediated activation. In this paper, we report a novel mechanism to modulate GIRK channel gating; that is, reduction of a conserved cysteine residue in the N-terminal cytosolic domain. This form of gating may operate in parallel to the action of the classical"

Here, we show that the physiological inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, PAI-1, is also induced by MNNG in a p53-dependent fashion, because MNNG induced PAI-1 in p53-expressing cells but not in p53−/− cells. MNNG induced p53 phosphorylation at serine 15, resulting in stabilization of the p53 protein, and this phosphorylation event was central for p53-dependent PAI-1 transcription. Finally, we showed that PAI-1 transcriptional induction by MNNG required a p53-responsive element located at −136 base pairs in the PAI-1 promoter, because specific mutation of this site abrogated the induction. Because PAI-1 is a prognostic factor in many metastatic cancers, being involved in the control of tumor invasiveness, our finding that a genotoxic agent induces the PAI-1gene via p53 adds a new feature to the role of the tumor-suppressor p53 protein. Our results also suggest the possibility that genotoxic agents contribute to tumor metastasis by inducing PAI-1 without involving genetic modification. The alkylating agentN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) is a widely spread environmental carcinogen that causes DNA lesions leading to cell killing. MNNG can also induce a cell-protective response by inducing the expression of DNA repair/transcription-related genes. We recently demonstrated that urokinase-type plasminogen activator, an extracellular protease to which no DNA repair functions have been assigned, was induced by MNNG. Here, we show that the physiological inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, PAI-1, is also induced by MNNG in a p53-dependent fashion, because MNNG induced PAI-1 in p53-expressing cells but not in p53−/− cells.

Their activity is controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs), of which PAI-1 is the predominant physiological inhibitor (reviewed in Ref. 1Irigoyen J.P. Munoz-Canoves P. Montero L. Koziczak M. Nagamine Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 104-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The plasminogen/PA system plays a key role in cancer progression, presumably via mediating extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion. It is accepted that uPA initiates a cascade of proteolysis at the cell surface, which leads to the degradation of the extracellular matrix and thereby promotes cellular migration. This is supported by the fact that uPA and its specific cell surface receptor, uPAR, are highly expressed by invasive tumor cells or by surrounding stromal cells, and they are both independent prognostic indicators in human cancer. PAI-1 is the primary physiological inhibitor of uPA. It regulates both the proteolytic activity of uPA as well as the level of uPA-uPA receptor complex by promoting its endocytosis (2Conese M. Blasi F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 143-155PubMed Google Scholar, 3Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PAI-1 may inhibit vitronectin-mediated cell adhesion and migration through its avid interaction with vitronectin (4Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 5Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 6Loskutoff D.J. Curriden S.A. Hu G. Deng G. APMIS. 1999; 107: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the transfection of PAI-1 gene in tumor cell lines such as human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells resulted in a decrease in primary tumor size and decreased metastasis in vivo (7Soff G.A. Sanderowitz J. Gately S. Verrusio E. Weiss I. Brem S. Kwaan H.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2593-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, high levels of PAI-1 are a bad prognostic factor in a number of tumors including carcinomas of the lung, ovarium, breast, kidney, gastric system, and colon (8Pedersen H.

Welvaart K. van de Velde C.J. Lamers C.B. et al.Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PAI-1-deficient mice have been shown to be resistant to cancer invasion and vascularization (15Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In accordance with this observation, the administration of exogenous PAI-1 to these mice was found to promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. Very recently, several reports have shed some light into the apparent paradox that PAI-1 promotes tumor invasion. Bajou et al. (16Bajou K. Masson V. Gerard R.D. Schmitt P.M. Albert V. Praus M. Lund L.R. Frandsen T.L. Brunner N. Dano K. Fusenig N.E. Weidle U. Carmeliet G. Loskutoff D. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Foidart J.M. Noel A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PA/plasmin proteolysis, although essential, must be tightly controlled by PAI-1 during tumor angiogenesis, probably to allow vessel stabilization and maturation. Other studies have shown that PAI-1 may promote tumor growth through the inhibition of apoptosis, suggesting a novel function for PAI-1 (17Kwaan H.C. Wang J. Svoboda K. Declerck P.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because it seems that PAI-1 plays multiple roles, either beneficial or deleterious, in tumor progression, the involvement of PAI-1 in cancer deserves further investigation. Reports from over a decade ago indicated that environmental carcinogens such as the alkylating agents mechlorethamine andN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) could induce the production of plasminogen activator in U-87MG cells, an alkylation repair-deficient (Mer−) human glioblastoma strain, at much higher levels than in alkylation repair-proficient (Mer+) U-178MG cells (18Brdar B. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2282-2284PubMed Google Scholar). It was concluded that plasminogen activator induction in alkylation repair-deficient human cells was caused by unrepaired DNA damage and may represent a eukaryotic SOS-like function. In fact, most of the MNNG-inducible genes identified in mammalian cells seem to be involved in DNA repair in a way similar to that of the bacterial SOS response. We have shown recently that DNA-damaging agents such as MNNG induce the expression of uPA, an extracellular protease to which no DNA repair functions have been assigned thus far, and determined the mechanisms responsible for this induction (19Parra M. Lluis F. Miralles F. Caelles C. Munoz-Canoves P. Blood. 2000; 96: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the uPA inhibitor, PAI-1, in the cell-inductive response to DNA-damaging agents has never been investigated. Monofunctional alkylating agents such as MNNG and methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS) are widely distributed environmental mutagens and carcinogens that upon activation react with DNA and proteins generating adducts (20Peto R. Gray R. Brantom P. Grasso P. IARC Scientific Publication no. 57. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1985: 627-655Google Scholar, 21Singer B. Grunberger D.

Nucleic Acid Res. 1975; 15: 219-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Among the adducts,O-6-alkyl guanine (generated by N-alkylation of the DNA base) is the predominant cytotoxic and mutagenic lesion because of its mispairing properties, which eventually leads to chromosomal aberrations, point mutations, and cell killing (23Loveless A. Nature. 1969; 223: 206-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 24Eadie J.S. Conrad M. Toorchen D. Topal M.D. Nature. 1984; 308: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This lesion also appears to be involved in tumor induction in particular gastric carcinogenesis (25Kleihues P. Margison G.P. J. Natl.

Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, monofunctional alkylating agents not only cause cell destruction but also induce the transcription of many genes including genes coding for transcriptions factors such as c-fos, c-jun, junB, andjunD (29Dosch J. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1927-1935PubMed Google Scholar), for cell cycle regulatory proteins such as p53, p21, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor (30Fritsche M. Haessler C.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1902-1906PubMed Google Scholar), and for DNA repair proteins such asO-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) and DNA polymerase β (β-pol) (36Kaina B. Fritz G. Mitra S. Coquerelle T. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Ochs K. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Kaina B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1544-1551PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the response to DNA-damaging agents may have a protective function other than DNA repair (38Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 39Kaina B. Haas S. Kappes H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2721-2731PubMed Google Scholar). The main effect of genotoxic agents on the cell was believed to be chromosomal DNA damage, which in turn would provide the primary signal triggering the response (40Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Muller A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, genomic DNA has been ruled out as an absolute prerequisite for the induction of certain cytoplasmic signaling molecules including c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in response to UV or MMS, because this induction was also detected in enucleated cells (38Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 42Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M.

Wherever generated, the alkylating signal, similar to the UV-induced signal, seems to activate specific molecules that act as sensors of damage and initiate the cellular response to genotoxic stress (reviewed in Ref.44Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 is considered to be a sensor of DNA damage. It plays a central role in preserving genomic integrity by arresting cell cycle progression or activating apoptosis after genotoxic stress (reviewed in Refs. 45Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 46Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 47Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The regulation of p53 is complex and includes post-translational events such as phosphorylation and acetylation (48Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at several different serine and threonine residues in p53 has been shown to occur after cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents. The phosphorylation of serine 392 after UV exposure may be important for p53 oligomerization (48Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of N-terminal residues, in particular serine 15, after both ionizing and UV radiation is important for stabilizing p53 (49Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 50Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Chemopreventing agents such as restreverol and DNA-damaging therapeutic agents such as cisplatin have also been shown to induce serine 15 and serine 33 phosphorylation, and carcinogenic arsenic derivatives can also induce p53 phosphorylation of serine 15 (54, 55). Although the exact functions of specific phosphorylation events remain controversial, evidence indicates that they probably contribute to both the stabilization and activation of p53. N-terminal serine phosphorylations are believed to contribute to p53 stabilization by preventing the binding of its negative regulator MDM2 and rendering p53 more resistant to MDM2 (56Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 57Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition to potentially regulating MDM2 binding, the phosphorylation of N-terminal serines may be important for p53 interactions with the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300 and PCAF, thus potentiating the transcription of target genes (58Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 59Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the picture of p53 phosphorylation at N-terminal sites in response to genotoxic stress is incomplete. Certain reports have shown that alkylating agents such as MMS, MNNG, and mitomycin C, can induce an increase in p53 protein levels (33Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30619-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 61Grombacher T. Eichhorn U. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 62Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms underlying this effect (including phosphorylation) have not been understood fully. A recent study proposed that MMS and mitomycin C, but not MNNG, caused down-regulation of MDM2, which resulted in p53 stabilization (63Inoue T. Geyer R.K., Yu, Z.K. Maki C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). With this limited understanding, the mechanisms by which specific alkylating agents induce an increase in p53 need further investigation. In the present study we show that the monofunctional alkylating agent MNNG induces p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 but not at serine 392, correlating with the MNNG-induced stabilization of p53. We also demonstrate that MNNG is a potent inducer of PAI-1 gene expression. Specifically, we show that the PAI-1 gene is induced by MNNG in p53-expressing cells but not in cells lacking p53. This induction required a p53-responsive element, located at −136 bp in the PAI-1 promoter. Altogether, we provide a mechanism linking external MNNG stimulation with the induction of the endogenousPAI-1 gene via phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. Our results suggest that genotoxic agents may contribute to tumor metastasis by inducing PAI-1 without involving genetic modification. The murine NIH3T3 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. p53−/− and p53+/+ 3T3 cell lines were provided kindly by Dr. E. F. Wagner. For MNNG stimulation, the cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS for 16 h. The next day, cells were treated with MNNG (70 μm) for different periods of time. Alternatively, cells were UV-irradiated at 254 nm (30 J/m2). MNNG was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in a small amount of Me2SO and diluted with sterile water according to Kaina et al.(36Kaina B. Fritz G. Mitra S. Coquerelle T. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar); the MNNG stocks were stored in batches at −80 °C for up to 2 weeks. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the commercial Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx) based on the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (64Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNAs were size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes by capillarity, and UV cross-linked. Membrane prehybridization, probe hybridization, washes, and autoradiography were performed as described (65Munoz-Canoves P. Miralles F. Baiget M. Felez J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cDNA probes used for RNA hybridizations were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a standard random oligo-primed reaction using the commercial Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PAI-1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids, p1500-Luc, p800-Luc, p187-Luc, and p100-Luc (kindly provided by Drs. D. J. Loskutoff and A. J. van Zonneveld), contain 1500, 800, 187, and 100 bp, respectively, of the PAI-1 promoter region and 72 bp of 5′-untranslated region (+72) as described (66van Zonneveld A.J. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). p800-Luc(mt p53), containing a mutated PAI-1 p53-responsive element, was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on p800-Luc according to the manufacturer protocol. The p53-responsive element of the PAI-1 promoter, located at position −136, was mutated from ACACATGCCTCAGCAAGTCC to ACACATGCCTCAGAAATTCC. The pPG13-Luc plasmid contains 13 copies of a synthetic consensus p53-binding site linked to the polyoma virus early promoter (60Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). pCMV-p53 and pCMV-p53(S15A) plasmids, expressing p53 wild type and p53 containing an alanine in position 15, respectively, were provided kindly by Dr. D. W. Meek. Cells were cultured in 0.5% FBS, and at the indicated time points post-treatment, whole-cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared by lysing the cells in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. p53 protein was detected using a p53 antibody (FL-393) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-6243-G). To detect phosphorylated p53, the cell pellet was incubated 10 min at room temperature in 3 packed volumes of phospho-extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2supplemented with 40 μg/ml DNase I and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors) and sonicated. After incubation with the sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C, samples were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, phosphorylated p53 was detected using anti-phospho-p53 (serine 15) and anti-phospho-p53 (serine 392) antibodies (Cell Signaling-NEB, 9284S and 9281S, respectively). Immunoblots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For transient transfection assays, reporter plasmids were transfected using the liposome-mediated transfection reagentN-[-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded overnight on 6-well dishes. The next day, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of PAI-1-luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg of RSV-βGal, as internal control. After transfection, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS for 16 h before MNNG stimulation (70 μm), and reporter activities were analyzed after 8 h of MNNG treatment. When indicated, the cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 5 or 500 ng of p53 expression plasmids or empty vector alone together with 0.5 μg of internal control. Firefly luciferase activities were standardized for β-galactosidase activity used as internal control. All transfection/reporter assays were repeated at least three times, showing less than 25% variability. A Student's t test was used to validate the results. For stable transfection assays, NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 106 cells/100-mm dish in duplicate cultures and cotransfected the following day with 10 μg of PAI-1-Luc constructs and 1 μg of pRSV-neo plasmid usingN-[-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate transfection reagent. Two days later, G418 (Sigma) was added to the culture medium, and selection proceeded for 15 days. More than 300 colonies were pooled for each construct, expanded, and analyzed for luciferase activity, which was standardized to the transfection efficiency of each plasmid. To assess transfection efficiency, the gene copy number was measured by Southern blotting. Briefly, DNA was extracted, digested with SalI andXbaI, size-fractionated, and blotted. Hybridization was performed with α-32P-labeled luciferase probe as described in Ref. 67Miralles F. Ibanez-Tallon I. Parra M. Crippa M. Blasi F. Besser D. Nagamine Y. Munoz-Canoves P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. Nuclear extracts were obtained from NIH3T3 cells before and after MNNG treatment. The extraction of nuclear proteins was performed as described by Miralles et al. (68Miralles F. Ron D. Baiget M. Felez J. Munoz-Canoves P. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were washed twice in cold PBS and scraped, and the cellular pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol on ice. The cells were passed five times through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged to collect nuclei, which were subsequently resuspended in an equal volume of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol to allow the elution of nuclear proteins by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. All solutions contained the protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin at 1 μg/ml, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and benzamidine (1 mm). A Bio-Rad protein assay was used to determine the protein concentration. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 10 min at room temperature to titrate out nonspecific binding before the addition of 15,000–20,000-cpm labeled oligonucleotide, and the reaction was further incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. When indicated, nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.2 μg of anti-p53 antibody pAb421 (Calbiochem, Ab-1). When unlabeled competing oligonucleotides were added, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of the labeled probe. Samples were loaded on a pre-run 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 in 0.25× TBE) and electrophoresed at 200 V. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. The sequences of the sense strands of the oligonucleotides used in the EMSAs are: p53-PAI-1, 5′-ACACACATGCCTCAGCAAGTCCCAGA-3′ and IgkB, 5′-CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAG-3′. We recently demonstrated the inducibility of the uPA gene by the alkylating agent MNNG (19Parra M. Lluis F. Miralles F. Caelles C. Munoz-Canoves P. Blood. 2000; 96: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the inducibility of the uPA physiologic inhibitor, PAI-1, in the NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line. As shown in Fig.1A, treatment of NIH3T3 cells with MNNG increased PAI-1 transcript levels. PAI-1 mRNA induction was not caused by an unspecific up-regulation of RNA synthesis, because MNNG did not significantly modify the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in these cells. The increase in PAI-1 gene induction was time-dependent, reaching its maximum 2–4 h after MNNG treatment and decreasing thereafter (Fig. 1A,upper). To gain an insight into the mechanisms leading to increased PAI-1 mRNA expression in MNNG-treated cells, we studied the effects of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors on the PAI-1 transcript level in cells that were stimulated with the alkylating agent. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not inhibit PAI-1 mRNA induction by MNNG in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B); moreover, cycloheximide by itself induced PAI-1 mRNA, suggesting that MNNG stimulation of PAI-1 mRNA did not require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1B and data not shown). In contrast, PAI-1 mRNA induction by MNNG was abrogated in cells treated with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig.1B). These data suggested that increased PAI-1 transcription, rather than message stabilization, was the mechanism responsible for the MNNG-induced effect. We next examined the effect of MNNG on the activit"

Overexpression of Bcl10 in cultured cells was reported to promote apoptosis, however, the mechanism of regulation of apoptosis mediated by Bcl10 has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we analysed the apoptosis signaling pathway mediated by Bcl10, focusing on phosphorylation of Bcl10 and the dynamic interaction with its binding partners during apoptosis. Previously, we have demonstrated that Bcl10 potentially interacts with the other apoptosis regulator, TNF receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs). The present results showed that the complex formation of these molecules was regulated by phosphorylation of Bcl10, that is, phosphorylation of Bcl10 resulted in binding of Bcl10 to cIAPs and the dissociation of it from TRAF2. Moreover, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl10 enhanced apoptosis, suggesting that changes in the binding partners of Bcl10 were correlated to the promotion of apoptosis as mediated by Bcl10. Indeed, the mutant which was deleted from the binding site of Bcl10 for cIAPs, could not induce apoptosis. These findings indicate that Bcl10 is a mediator of apoptosis signaling, by switching over binding to cIAPs from TRAF2 through the events of Bcl10 phosphorylation."

The heterodimer, designed to be essentially catalytically inactive in one subunit due to a single point mutation (D101K), and the two parental homodimers were analyzed with seven different substrates, exemplifying three types of reactions catalyzed by glutathione transferases (nucleophilic aromatic substitution, addition, and double-bond isomerization reactions). Stopped-flow kinetic results suggested that the wild-type GST A1-1 behaved with half-of-the-sites reactivity in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, but steady-state kinetic analyses of the GST A1-D101K heterodimer revealed that this was presumably due to changes to the extinction coefficient of the enzyme-bound product. In contrast, steady-state kinetic analysis of the heterodimer with three different substrates of addition reactions provided evidence that the wild-type enzyme displayed half-of-the-sites reactivity in association with these reactions.

They achieve their function by conjugating a glutathione molecule to the electrophilic centers of potentially harmful xenobiotics or endogenous metabolic products, thereby improving the water solubility and excretion of otherwise hydrophobic compounds. The mammalian soluble GSTs have been divided into several classes (Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, Kappa, Sigma, Omega, and Zeta), primarily based on their sequence similarities (1Mannervik B. Ålin P.

It therefore appeared from these studies that the monomers are catalytically indistinguishable and that they are active concurrently. Furthermore, ligand binding experiments have shown that both active sites are accessible simultaneously (17Jakobson I. Askelöf P. Warholm M. Mannervik B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Jakobson I. Warholm M. Mannervik B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 288: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).However, active site titration of GST A1-1 with 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB) suggested that maximal saturation of GST A1-1 occurs at 1 mol of TNB/mol of dimer (22Widersten M. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7731-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Half-of-the-sites reactivity was also postulated for human GST T2–2, based on stopped-flow analysis of pre-steady-state kinetic data (23Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Chelvanayagam G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5432-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recently published crystal structure of the mouse Alpha class GST, mGST A4-4, showed that, although glutathione was bound in the active sites of both monomers, only one subunit appeared to be catalytically active at a time (24Xiao B. Singh S.P. Nanduri B. Awasthi Y.C. Zimniak P. Ji X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11887-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The active site in each monomer is composed of two binding sites: the G-site, in which reduced glutathione is bound, and the H-site, in which a variety of hydrophobic substrates can be bound (25Mannervik B. Guthenberg C. Jakobson I. Warholm M. Aitio A. Conjugation Reactions in Drug Biotransformation. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1978: 101-110Google Scholar). In the human Alpha class GST, GST A1-1, a network of hydrogen bonds and salt links mediates glutathione binding. For example, Tyr-9 and Arg-15 form hydrogen bonds to the thiolate group of glutathione and effect its activation (7Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L.

Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), while Asp-101 and Arg-131 form salt links to the N and C terminus, respectively, of the glutathione molecule (7Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Asp-101 and Arg-131 are located in the monomer adjacent to that in which the glutathione is bound, suggesting that they could play a role in signaling between the subunits. Several mutagenic studies involving different GSTs have shown that mutation of the conserved Asp-101 residue results in an enzyme that is severely compromised in its KMGSH(28Wang R.W. Newton D.J. Huskey S.E.W. McKeever B.M. Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19866-19871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Manoharan T.H. Gulick A.M. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Given that the GSTs readily form heterodimers, this provides the means to investigate the possibility of cooperativity between the subunits of GST A1-1 with a GST that is active in only one monomer. A D101K point mutant of GST A1-1 was therefore created. As expected, this single mutation impaired the binding of glutathione to the enzyme. A His-tagged variant of GST A1-1 as well as a heterodimer of the His-tagged A1 subunit and the D101K point mutant were also produced and studied with several different substrates of various sizes and characters. This allowed fundamental conclusions to be drawn about the number of reactive sites in the wild-type enzyme with a given substrate. The results show for the first time that GST A1-1 demonstrates both “half-of-the-sites” or “all-of-the-sites” (reviewed in Ref. 31Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 139-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reactivity, depending on the nature of the reaction. Furthermore, it was determined that the mode of reactivity was not dependent on either substrate size or on catalytic rate.DISCUSSIONThe phenomenon of cooperativity between the two subunits of the Alpha class enzyme GST A1-1 has now been investigated with a heterodimer that is essentially catalytically inactive in one subunit. This work was initiated by pre-steady-state studies of GST A1-1 with CDNB and glutathione, in which the wild-type enzyme displayed an apparent half-of-the-sites reactivity. This result contrasted with the additivity of kinetic properties of GST subunits demonstrated previously (12Mannervik B. Jensson H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9909-9912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Tahir M.K.

Furthermore, an earlier study of the formation of the Meisenheimer complex with GST A1-1 implied that this enzyme displays half-of-the-sites reactivity with TNB. TheA max for GST A1-1 with TNB was found to be ∼12,300 m−1 cm−1 (22Widersten M. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7731-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), compared with 21,200–27,000 m−1 cm−1 for other GSTs (33Johansson A.-S. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 40Graminski G.F. Zhang P.H. Sesay M.A. Ammon H.L. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6252-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that GST A1-1 may be unusual in having half-of-the-sites reactivity with CDNB and TNB.In order to shed further light on these phenomena, a heterodimer was produced and compared with the wild-type enzyme in various steady-state experiments. Initial specific activity measurements with CDNB demonstrated that the activity of the heterodimer corresponded to the mean of the activities of the two parental homodimers, consistent with the theory that the wild-type enzyme displayed all-of-the-sites reactivity. This conclusion was in agreement with the results from TNB-binding studies with the heterodimer (Fig. 4). The active sites of the heterodimer were saturated at half the maximal value of the GST A1-1 homodimer, implying that the wild-type enzyme must display all-of-the-sites reactivity toward TNB. Hence, the apparent half-site saturation of GST A1-1 with CDNB and TNB, seen in pre-steady-state and equilibrium experiments, was presumably an artifact caused by changes in the extinction coefficients of the glutathione-trinitrobenzene and GS-DNP conjugates upon binding to the active site of the enzyme.It should be noted that, although the experimentally determined heterodimer saturation curves were consistently somewhat lower than the theoretically predicted results in the reactions with CDNB, TNB, DCNB, and AD, this was not due to underestimation of the concentration of the heterodimer. The saturation curves of the heterodimer and GST A1-1 were essentially identical in addition reactions (Fig. 5 D and Table II), suggesting that the D101K mutation has a slight effect on the activity of the wild-type subunit of the heterodimer only in reactions that are catalyzed with all-of-the-sites reactivity.AD was the largest of the substrates used in this study and provided evidence that the half-of-the-sites reactivity detected with nonenal, NCA, and benzyl-ITC was mechanism-based and not a function of substrate size. The nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions of CDNB, and the closely related electrophile DCNB, demonstrate that a low overall catalytic rate or incomplete saturation of the enzyme by substrate are also not sufficient grounds for half-of-the-sites reactivity with GST A1-1. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the two molecules are quite similar, but the substitution of an NO2 group by Cl renders DCNB 3 orders of magnitude less reactive than CDNB. It was not possible to achieve saturation with DCNB under the available experimental conditions, but the results shown in Fig. 5 B are qualitatively similar to those obtained with CDNB and demonstrate that there is a marked difference between the catalytic parameters of wild-type GST A1-1 and the heterodimer.Additionally, despite the 10-fold greater catalytic efficiency of GST A1-1 with benzyl-ITC as opposed to nonenal or NCA, there was no noticeable difference between the catalytic parameters of GST A1-1 and the heterodimer with these three substrates (Fig. 5 D and Table II). Thus, the mode of reactivity of the enzyme (whether it is half-of-the-sites or all-of-the-sites) is not simply a function of catalytic rate. Neither is it a function of incomplete saturation of the enzyme by glutathione, since performing the AD reaction with a glutathione concentration 5-fold lower than the KMGSH (0.01 mm as opposed to 0.05 mm) gave qualitatively similar results to those shown in Fig. 5 C (data not shown). Furthermore, the mode of reactivity displayed by GST A1-1 was independent of the concentration of glutathione used when measuring kinetic parameters (Fig. 5).In striking contrast to the results seen in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution and isomerization reactions, GST A1-1 displayed half-of-the-sites reactivity (also known as total negative cooperativity) in the addition of glutathione to nonenal, NCA, and benzyl-ITC. This was evidenced by the essentially identical saturation curves of the GST A1-1 homodimer and the heterodimer with nonenal (Fig.5 D and Table II ).A recent crystallographic study of a murine GST A4-4 also suggested total negative cooperativity in the reaction with 4-hydroxynonenal (24Xiao B. Singh S.P. Nanduri B. Awasthi Y.C. Zimniak P. Ji X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11887-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was noted that, although glutathione was bound at both active sites of the dimer, the conjugate of glutathione and 4-hydroxynonenal was only found in one subunit. The “active” status was proposed to switch between the two subunits by means of a relay of interacting residues in a flip-flop mechanism (42Lazdunski M. Petitclerc C. Chappelet D. Lazdunski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 20: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Residues implicated in this relay were Arg-15, which is essential for the activity of mGST A4-4 with 4-hydroxynonenal (24Xiao B. Singh S.P. Nanduri B. Awasthi Y.C. Zimniak P. Ji X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11887-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Nanduri B. Hayden J.B. Awasthi Y.C. Zimniak P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and Arg-69, which is part of the dimer interface (7Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, a flip-flop mechanism cannot readily explain the half-of-the-sites reactivity obtained in the present study, since the GST A1-D101K heterodimer, in which the mutated subunit has essentially lost its ability to bind glutathione, displays the same activity as the wild-type GST A1-1 homodimer. Hence, the two subunits that are active in GST A1-1 are presumably randomly alternating in the catalysis of the addition reaction.Other recent evidence of cooperativity in the GSTs includes a study of temperature-mediated changes in hGST P1–1. At temperatures below 25 °C, this enzyme exhibited negative cooperativity with respect to glutathione binding, whereas at temperatures above 35 °C, the enzyme demonstrated positive cooperative interactions (44Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Ascenzi P. Nicotra M. Nuccetelli M. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. Bello M.L. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19276-19280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The change in cooperativity was believed to be due to conformational changes in the enzyme structure caused by the thermal fluctuations. Based on a comparison of the Meisenheimer complex formation with GST A1-1 at 5 °C and 30 °C, the half-of-the-sites reactivity detected with this enzyme does not appear to be temperature-mediated. Negative cooperativity and half-of-the-sites reactivity has also been proposed for the human Theta class GST, GST T2-2 (23Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Chelvanayagam G. Ricci G. J. Biol.

These investigators postulated the existence of half-of-the-sites reactivity in GST T2−2 when it was reacted with glutathione and menaphthyl sulfate, based on the amplitude of the burst phase obtained in pre-steady-state kinetics experiments. However, a comparison of the behavior of the GST A1-D101K heterodimer and GST A1-1 with CDNB and TNB in the present work clearly demonstrated that erroneous conclusions regarding binding stoichiometries are easily reached in spectrophotometric binding experiments, since the active site environment can significantly affect the extinction coefficients of enzyme-bound conjugates.Similarly, there have been many conflicting reports regarding half-of-the-sites and all-of-the-sites reactivity in other enzymes (for example, factor XIII, transaldolase, and Na+,K+-ATPase; Refs. 45Holbrook J.J.

Often the half-of-the-sites reactivity noted in previous reports was associated with a change in the quaternary structure of the enzyme (such as a shift in a tetramer-dimer equilibrium) or binding of an enzyme inhibitor or activator (52Hersh L.B.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 59Wallace L.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5320-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and was shown in this study to exhibit different modes of active-site reactivity without the addition of inhibitors or substrate analogs. The factor(s) that determine the mode of action of this enzyme therefore remain to be elucidated. In addition, the evolutionary significance of the ability of GST A1-1 to switch between half-of-the-sites and all-of-the-sites reactivity is intriguing, particularly as it would appear most efficient to catalyze detoxication reactions with all-of-the-sites reactivity.In conclusion, the issue of cooperativity or non-cooperativity in the GSTs is not so clear-cut as had been previously assumed. In the present study, it is demonstrated that one and the same enzyme could function either with half-of-the-sites or all-of-the sites reactivity, depending on the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, half-of-the-sites reactivity was shown not to be a simple function of substrate size, catalytic rate, or the level of saturation of the enzyme by glutathione. It remains to be seen exactly what the governing principles are to determine which of the different modes of reactivity are used, and how common this phenomenon is among other enzymes. The glutathione transferases (GSTs,1 EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of broad specificity detoxication enzymes found ubiquitously. They achieve their function by conjugating a glutathione molecule to the electrophilic centers of potentially harmful xenobiotics or endogenous metabolic products, thereby improving the water solubility and excretion of otherwise hydrophobic compounds. The mammalian soluble GSTs have been divided into several classes (Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, Kappa, Sigma, Omega, and Zeta), primarily based on their sequence similarities (1Mannervik B. Ålin P.

It therefore appeared from these studies that the monomers are catalytically indistinguishable and that they are active concurrently.

The crystal structure of the Clostridium symbiosum PPDK (in the unbound state) reveals a three-domain structure consisting of consecutive N-terminal, central His-455, and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal and central His-455 domains catalyze partial reactions 1 and 2, whereas the C-terminal and central His-455 domains catalyze partial reaction 3. Attempts to obtain a crystal structure of the enzyme with substrate ligands bound at the nucleotide binding domain have been unsuccessful. The object of the present study is to demonstrate Mg(II) activation of catalysis at the ATP/Pi active site, to identify the residues at the ATP/Pi active site that contribute to catalysis, and to identify roles for these residues based on their positions within the active site scaffold. First, Mg(II) activation studies of catalysis of E + ATP + Pi →E-P + AMP + PPi partial reaction were carried out using a truncation mutant (Tem533) in which the C-terminal domain is absent. The kinetics show that a minimum of 2 Mg(II) per active site is required for the reaction. The active site residues used for substrate/cofactor binding/activation were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Lys-22, Arg-92, Asp-321, Glu-323, and Gln-335 mutants were found to be inactive; Arg-337, Glu-279, Asp-280, and Arg-135 mutants were partially active; and Thr-253 and Gln-240 mutants were almost fully active. The participation of the nucleotide ribose 2′-OH and α-P in enzyme binding is indicated by the loss of productive binding seen with substrate analogs modified at these positions. The ATP, Pi, and Mg(II) ions were docked into the PPDK N-terminal domain crevice, in an orientation consistent with substrate/cofactor binding modes observed for other members of the ATP-Grasp fold enzyme superfamily and consistent with the structure-function data. On the basis of this docking model, the ATP polyphosphate moiety is oriented/activated for pyrophosphoryl transfer through interaction with Lys-22 (γ-P), Arg-92 (α-P), and the Gly-101 to Met-103 loop (γ-P) as well as with the Mg(II) cofactors. The Pi is oriented/activated for partial reaction 2 through interaction with Arg-337 and a Mg(II) cofactor. The Mg(II) ions are bound through interaction with Asp-321, Glu-323, and Gln-335 and substrate.

As shown in Scheme FS1, His-455 abstracts the γ,β-PP-unit from ATP and then, in the two subsequent steps, delivers a phosphoryl group to Pi and then to pyruvate. Kinetic studies have indicated that catalysis of the first two steps (E·ATP·Pi →E-PP·AMP·Pi →E-P·AMP·PPi) and catalysis of the third step (E-P·pyruvate → E·PEP) occurs at separate active sites (2Wang H.C.

During the catalytic turnover, His-455 must move from the active site located at the N-terminal domain to the active site located at the C-terminal domain. This movement can be modeled by rotating the two solvated interdomain linkers, which allows the central domain to swivel from the concave surface of the N-terminal domain to that of the C-terminal domain (see modeled structure shown in Fig. 1B) (4Herzberg O.

Mutant genes were prepared from the plasmid pACYC184-D12 (9Pocalyko D.J. Carroll L.J. Martin B.M. Babbitt P.C. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using a polymerase chain reaction-based procedure analogous to that described previously (6McGuire M. Huang K.

Mutagenic primers, 18–22 base pairs in length, were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. BglII and BstXI restriction sites were employed in the construction of the T253A, E279A, D280A, Q240A, R135A, R92A, R92K, K22A, and K22R PPDK mutants, whereasBstXI and KpnI restriction sites were used in the construction of the E323D, E323L, D321N, and Q335A mutants. The sequence analyses of the mutant genes were carried out by the Center for Agricultural Biotechnology at the University of Maryland. Wild-type and mutant PPDK genes were expressed in Escherichia coli JM101 cells, and the protein products were purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis) as described previously (6McGuire M.

Each mutant is stable to chromatography and storage. The only exception is the D321N mutant, which is susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. After 3 weeks of storage in 50 mm K+Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) at 4 °C, 60% of the D321N mutant had undergone the fragmentation process described previously (7Xu Y. Yankie L. Shen L. Jung Y.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2188-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mutant gene, encoding residues 1–533 in PPDK, was prepared and expressed as described above. The protein was purified in a yield of 4 mg/g cell. Its N-terminal sequence, determined by automated protein sequencing, is identical to that of the wild-type PPDK. The molecular mass of Tem533 was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry at the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility to be 58.6 ± 0.2 kDa. This value compares well with the theoretical molecular mass of 58,654 Da. The molecular mass of the native protein was determined by gel column chromatography to be ∼51 kDa. Thus, the mutant protein is monomeric. Initial velocities were measured as a function of the concentration of the varied substrate (in a range of 0.5–10-fold Km) at fixed, saturating concentrations of cosubstrates (0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP, 1 mm PPi) and metal ion cofactors (5 mm MgCl2 and 40 mmNH4Cl) in 20 mm imidazole (pH 6.8, 25 °C). The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the computer programs of Cleland (10Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The kcatvalue was calculated fromVmax/[E]. Vo=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])Equation 1 where Vo is the initial velocity; [E] is the enzyme concentration; [S] is the substrate concentration; Vmax is the maximum velocity, andKm is the Michaelis constant. The Ki values for the competitive inhibitor AMPPNP were determined from initial velocity data obtained at varying AMP concentrations and fixed, saturating concentrations of cosubstrates and cofactors. The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 2where Ki is the inhibition constant and [I] is the inhibitor concentration.Vo=Vmax[S]/[Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]]Equation 2 Reaction solutions (100 μl) initially containing 30 μm enzyme, 1 mm[14C]AMP, 1 mm PPi, 1 mm PEP, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NH4Cl, 0.2 mm NADH, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase in 50 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C) were quenched at specific times with 300 μl of 0.6m HCl. The protein was removed by centrifugal filtration (500 μl Microsep filter; 10-kDa cut off). The [14C]ATP and [14C]AMP were separated from the supernatant by HPLC using a 4.6-mm × 25-cm Beckman ultrasphere C18 reversed-phase analytical column and 25 mm KH2PO4, 2.5% triethylamine, and 5% methanol as eluant (1 ml/min flow rate). Peak fractions were quantitated by scintillation counting. Reaction solutions (100 μl) initially containing 0.1–20 μm enzyme, 5 mm pyruvate, 5 mm Pi, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NH4Cl, and 20 units/ml of inorganic pyrophosphatase (to drive the reaction to completion by catalyzing PPi hydrolysis) in 50 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C) were quenched at specified times with 300 μl of 0.6 m HCl. The resulting solutions were filtered and analyzed by HPLC as described above. The time courses ([14C]AMP concentration versus reaction time) for wild-type and Tem533 PPDK-catalyzed single turnover reactions ofE +[14C]ATP → E-PP·AMP andE + [14C]ATP + Pi →E-P + [14C]AMP + PPi were carried out as described previously (6McGuire M.

The time courses ([14C]AMP concentration versus reaction time) used for the determination of the kobsversus [Mg(II)] plot were measured with 60-μl reaction solutions initially containing 40 μm[14C]ATP, 40 μm Tem533 PPDK, and variable MgCl2 concentration (10–5000 μm) in 40 mm NH4Cl and 50 mmK+Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C). The reactions were terminated and analyzed for [14C]AMP and [14C]ATP as described previously (6McGuire M. Huang K. Kapadia G. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13463-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The kobs was calculated from the time course data using Equation 3, where Pt is the concentration of [14C]AMP at time t, and Peq is the concentration of [14C]AMP at equilibrium. logPt/Peq=kobs(t)Equation 3 The crystallization conditions used for the C. symbiosum K22A PPDK mutant were the same as those used for the wild-type enzyme (4Herzberg O.

Single crystals were obtained at 30 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. Protein drops were equilibrated against reservoir solutions containing 50–55% saturated ammonium sulfate and 100 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.0. The drops consisted of protein at ∼10 mg/ml, 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm mercaptoethanol diluted by an equal volume of reservoir solution. The crystals belong to the space group P2, and within the accuracy of the data the unit cell dimensions are the same as those of the wild-type protein crystals (Table IV). X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Siemens area detector mounted on a 3-circle goniostat, with monochromated CuKα x-ray supplied by a Rigaku Rotaflex RU200BH rotating anode generator. Data were processed with the XENGEN package (11Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal domain of PPDK has a fold similar to the folds of the ATP binding domains of the ATP-Grasp enzyme superfamily. The members of this superfamily bind, and activate, ATP for γ-P phosphoryl transfer to a variety of cosubstrates (15Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PPDK, which catalyzes pyrophosphoryl transfer by displacement at the ATP β-P, represents a point of chemical divergence within the family. Aside from PPDK, each member of the ATP-Grasp family is known to bind one or more divalent metal ions at the catalytic site, and all but synapsin (which binds a single Ca(II) ion) utilizes Mg(II) as the physiological cofactor. PPDK requires Mg(II) for catalysis (1Wood H.G. O'Brien W, E. Micheals G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 85-155PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previous studies of the Mg(II) dependence of PPDK catalyzed isotope exchange, there is evidence that suggests that Mg(II) is a required cofactor at both active sites (16Michaels G. Milner Y. Moskovitz B.R. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7656-7661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The object of this study was to measure Mg(II) activation at the N-terminal domain active site. For this purpose, the truncation mutant Tem533 (PPDK residues 1–533), in which the C-terminal domain has been deleted, was used in place of native PPDK. Since the Tem533 does not contain the PEP/pyruvate active site, Mg(II) binding at the ATP/Pi site of Tem533 may be studied without the interference from Mg(II) binding at the PEP/pyruvate site. The Tem533 PPDK mutant gene was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in E. coli cells to provide 4 mg of purified protein/g of cells. The efficiency of catalysis of the E + ATP → E-PP·AMP andE + ATP + Pi → E-P + AMP + PPi partial reactions was measured in the presence of saturating Mg(II) (5 mm). The rate data are plotted in Fig.2. The kobsvalues, determined by fitting the time course data to a single exponential equation (Equation 3) (TableI), indicate that Tem533 PPDK has retained 10% of the activity of the native enzyme. At the present, the reason behind the 10-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency is not known. We suspect, however, that substrate binding and product release from the N-terminal domain active site require that the central domain is docked at the C-terminal domain. Nonetheless, the Tem533 mutant was sufficiently active to carry out the Mg(II) activation studies as planned.Table IThe observed rate constants (kobs) derived from single turnover reactions catalyzed by wild-type (WT) and Tem533 PPDKReactionWTkobsTem533kobss−1E + [14C]ATP1-aThe initial reaction mixture contained 40 μm enzyme, 10 μm[14C]ATP, 2.5 mm CoCl2, 40 mmNH4Cl, and 50 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C).

The kobs values were obtained from fitting the rate data of Fig. 2B to Equation 3. Open table in a new tab The E + ATP + Pi → E-P + AMP + PPi partial reaction, and not the E + ATP →E-PP·AMP partial reaction, was chosen to measure Mg(II) activation. This is because the level of product formation in theE + ATP → E-PP·AMP partial reaction is small (5% (17Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) when Mg(II) is used as cofactor (note that the Co(II) used in the reaction reported in Fig. 2A serves to increase product formation to 25% owing to tighter ATP binding and greaterE-PP·AMP stability (17Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The E + ATP + Pi → E-P + AMP + PPi partial reaction, on the other hand, is driven to 65% completion (Fig.2B) by Pi, independent of the cofactor used. The higher the level of the product formation, the more accurate is the product determination. The rate (kobs) of theE + ATP + Pi → E-P + AMP + PPi partial reaction was measured using 40 μmenzyme to react with 40 μm [14C]ATP in the presence of 11 mm Pi. A similar data set was obtained using 1 mm Pi. The Mg(II) concentrations used in the reaction ranged from 0 to 5 mm. The plot ofkobs versus [Mg(II)], shown in Fig.3A, deviates from the hyperbolic curve predicted for single site Mg(II) binding. Several determinations of kobs were carried out for reactions containing between 0 and 100 μm [Mg(II)] in order to define an apparent “lag” in enzyme activation observed at the low concentration range (Fig. 3B). The presence of a lag in the kobsversus [Mg(II)] of plot (Fig. 3) may be explained by a two-site Mg(II) binding model. Specifically, one site on the enzyme binds Mg(II) with high affinity, whereas the second site binds Mg(II) with significantly lower affinity. 2A model in which ATP binds one Mg(II) and the Mg(ATP), in turn, binds to the enzyme is also consistent with these data. The second Mg(II) binds then to the apoenzyme and/or to the enzyme-Mg(ATP) complex. In addition, since the “break in the lag” occurs at a Mg(II) concentration of 80 μm and the enzyme is present at a concentration of 40 μm, it is possible that two high affinity sites and one low affinity site exist on the enzyme. The present data are, however, not sufficient to make a distinction between one and two high affinity sites. Future studies, focused on metal activation of PPDK, will examine cofactor stoichiometry more thoroughly than can be done in this work. The absence of product formation at Mg(II) concentrations below ∼80 μm, followed by a “hyperbolic” response between the rate of product formation and the Mg(II) concentration in the 100–5000 μm range, suggests that a high affinity site is being titrated at low Mg(II) concentration (i.e. on the order of the enzyme concentration = 40 μm), and once this first site is filled Mg(II) is available to bind to the second site. Only when both sites are occupied is the enzyme competent to catalyze the reaction. The amino acid residues whose polar side chains project into the ATP/Piactive site crevice include Gln-240, Arg-92, Lys-22, Thr-253, Asp-321, Glu-323, Gln-335, and Arg-337 (Fig. 4). There are also two loops (the 101–103 loop and the 278–281 loop) that contribute to the active site. The 101–103 loop (Gly-101 to Met-102 to Met-103), which is reminiscent of the classical phosphate binding loop observed in other nucleotide-dependent enzymes, is located to one side of the crevice entrance. The 278–281 loop (containing residues Glu-279 and Asp-280 whose side chains project into the active site) will be referred to as the “ω-loop.” This loop forms the roof of the active site crevice, but in the apoPPDK crystal structure the ω-loop is seen to protrude into the active site, where Glu-279 forms an ion pair with active site residue Arg-92. Substrate binding must displace the loop, thus allowing Glu-279 or Asp-280 to favorably interact with Arg-135 (which may function to hold the loop over the active site) instead of with Arg-92 (which appears to draw the loop into the active site). Amino acid replacements 3Ala substitution did not affect enzyme solubility. The E323L mutant had been prepared previously in the laboratory and was used here in place of the E323A mutant. The D321N and E323D mutants were used to examine the effects of a comparatively subtle change in side chain structure. For all but one of the positively charged amino acids (viz. Arg-135), substitutions with conserved charge were also made. were made at Gln-240, Arg-92, Lys-22, Thr-253, Asp-321, Glu-323, Gln-335, Arg-337, Glu-279, and Asp-280 in order to determine if these residues contribute to catalysis at the ATP/Pi active site. The mutant enzymes were purified to homogeneity and then evaluated for catalytic activity by measuring their kcat andKm values using steady-state kinetic techniques. Although the kcat value is determined by the rate at which catalysis occurs at the C-terminal domain active site (Scheme FS1, partial reaction 3) as well as by the rate at which catalysis occurs at the N-terminal domain active site (partial reactions 1 and 2), previous studies (17Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that these two rates are comparable in magnitude. Thus, a mutation that significantly slows down catalysis at the N-terminal domain active site will result in a significant reduction in thekcat value measured for the complete reaction. The mutants were first tested for catalysis of AMP + PPi + PEP → ATP + Pi + pyruvate reaction using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. Although applicable only to mutants having >0.1% of the wild-type activity, the assay allows easy determination of substrate kcat andKm values as well as theKi values of the inert ATP analog AMPPNP (Table II). Less active mutants (R92A, R92K, K22A, D321N, E323D, Q335A, and E279A/D280A) were analyzed using a fixed time, radioisotopic assa"
https://openalex.org/W2031861063,"The study of Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) has benefited significantly from mouse models with knockout mutations for the Atm (A-T mutation) locus. While these models have proven useful for in vivo studies, cell cultures from Atm null embryos have been reported to grow poorly and then senesce. In this study, we initiated primary cultures from adult ears and kidneys of Atm homozygous mice and found that these cultures immortalized readily without loss of sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other Atm related cell cycle defects. A mutational analysis for loss of expression of an autosomal locus showed that ionizing radiation had a mutagenic effect. Interestingly, some spontaneous mutants exhibited a mutational pattern that is characteristic of oxidative mutagenesis. This result is consistent with chronic oxidative stress in Atm null cells. In total, the results demonstrate that permanent cell lines can be established from the tissues of adult mice homozygous for Atm and that these cell lines will exhibit expected and novel consequences of this deficiency."

The specificity of these residues is different. Glu820 can only be replaced by Asp, indicating that the negative charge of this residue is essential for K+ activation (8Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P.

At position 343, only Gln can replace Glu, but this results in a reduction in K+affinity, suggesting that the Glu on this position is the preferable amino acid residue (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K.

Interestingly, several other mutants of Glu343, like E343D, could still be phosphorylated, but no K+-dependent stimulation of the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated intermediate was found (5Asano S. Furumoto R. Tega Y. Matsuda S. Takeguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we observed that some mutants of Glu820 (E820Q, E820A, E820N) (9Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) possessed a relatively high ATPase activity in the absence of K+. This K+-independent ATPase activity (also named constitutive ATPase activity) was caused by an enhanced spontaneous dephosphorylation rate of the phosphorylated intermediate (Fig. 1, step 4). We postulated that the altered cation-binding site mimics the stimulatory effect of the K+-filled binding pocket on the hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphate in the phosphorylated enzyme. The ATPase activity of these mutants was, like that of the wild type enzyme, very sensitive to inhibition by SCH 28080.2 In addition, the steady-state ATP-dependent phosphorylation level of the wild-type enzyme as well as of K+-sensitive mutants was decreased by SCH 28080 (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the steady-state phosphorylation level of the constitutively active mutants was only partly decreased by SCH 28080, and that of the mutant E820Q was even enhanced (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). The latter increase was also found in five double mutants of Glu795 and Glu820 that displayed K+-independent ATPase activity (11Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Wassink L. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This anomalous behavior of constitutively active mutants was explained by differences in the E2 ↔E1 equilibrium between the enzymes with K+-dependent and K+-independent ATPase activity (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). K+-dependent enzymes are assumed to be present in the E2 form. Upon preincubation of these enzymes with SCH 28080, a complex is formed (see Fig. 1, step 7), and ATP-dependent phosphorylation (steps 1 and 2) can no longer occur. Mutants with K+-independent ATPase activity are assumed to be mainly present in the E1 form. Preincubation with SCH 28080 does not result in anE2·SCH complex, and upon addition of ATP, phosphorylation occurs, finally resulting in formation of the phosphorylated intermediate E2-P (Fig. 1,steps 2 and 3). Next,E2-P forms a stable complex with SCH 28080 (step 5) and is accumulated, since its dephosphorylation rate (step 6) is slower than that of the phosphorylated intermediate formed in the absence of SCH 28080 (step 4) (10Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). The preference of mutants with constitutive ATPase activity for theE1 form was confirmed by recent studies with vanadate (11Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Wassink L. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Vanadate reacts with the E2 form of the enzyme (Fig. 1, step 8). We found that the ATPase activity of mutants with K+-independent ATPase activity was much less sensitive toward vanadate than that of enzymes with K+-dependent ATPase activity. The K+-independent mutants have thus a relatively high preference for the E1 form. The present study aims to investigate whether this preference of the K+-independent mutants for the E1conformation and the high spontaneous dephosphorylation rate are two coupled processes. This was performed by combining mutations of residue Glu343, which block the dephosphorylation step (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol.

The present study shows that the preference for theE1 conformation in the E820Q mutant also occurs when the dephosphorylation process is blocked, indicating that these two phenomena can be uncoupled. The cDNAs of the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits were cloned in the pFastbacdual vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) behind the polyhedrin and the p10 promotor, respectively (12Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwé G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis on Glu343 was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutagenic primer (Biolegio, Malden, The Netherlands) introduced the desired mutation (E343A, E343D, E343L, and E343Q) in the α-subunit together with a silent mutation, thereby creating or deleting a specific restriction site, useful for detection of the mutants. TheSgrAI/MluI fragment (870 bp) was subcloned in the pFastbacdual vector containing either the wild type cDNA or the previously constructed E820Q, E795Q, or E795Q/E820Q cDNAs (7Hermsen H.P.H.

Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After selection, the mutants were checked by sequence analysis. All DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard molecular biology techniques described by Sambrook et al.(13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pFastbacdual transfer vector containing the different (mutant) cDNAs was transformed to competent DH10bac Escherichia coli cells (Life Technologies) harboring the baculovirus genome (bacmid) and a transposition helper vector. Upon transposition between the Tn7 sites in the transfer vector and the bacmid, recombinant bacmids were selected and isolated (14Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, insect Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmids using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Breda, The Netherlands). After a 3-day incubation period, recombinant baculoviruses were isolated and used to infect Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Four days after infection, the amplified viruses were harvested. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in 100-ml spinner flask cultures as described by Klaassen et al. (12Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F.

For production of H+,K+-ATPase, 1.5·106cells·ml−1 were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1–3 in the presence of 1% (v/v) ethanol (15Klaassen C.H.W. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and 0.1% (w/v) pluronic F-68 (Sigma) in Xpress medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) as described before (9Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. Membranes were resuspended at 0 °C in 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.0) and sonicated twice for 30 s at 60 watts (Branson Power Company, Denbury, CT). After centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 ×g, the supernatant was collected and recentrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in the above mentioned buffer and stored at −20 °C. The protein concentrations were quantified with the modified Lowry method according to the method of Peterson (16Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples from the membrane fraction were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separated on SDS gels containing 10% acrylamide according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The α-subunit of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase was detected with the polyclonal antibody HKB (18Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SCH 28080-sensitive ATPase activity was determined using a radiochemical method (19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W.

For this purpose, 0.6–5 μg of Sf9 membranes were added to 100 μl of medium, which contained 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 20–100 mCi·mmol−1), 1.2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ouabain, 1 mm NaN3, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and various concentrations of KCl in the presence and absence of 0.1 mm SCH 28080. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 10% (w/v) charcoal in 6% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, and after 10 min at 0 °C the mixture was centrifuged for 10 s (10,000 × g). To 0.2 ml of the clear supernatant, containing the liberated inorganic phosphate (32Pi), 3 ml of OptiFluor (Canberra Packard, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added, and the mixture was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. In general, blanks were prepared by incubating in the absence of membranes. The H+,K+-ATPase activity is presented as the difference of the activity in the absence and presence of SCH 28080. ATP-dependent phosphorylation was determined as described before (8Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M.

After 30–60 min of preincubation, 10 μl of 0.6 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 50–200 Ci·mmol−1) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 s at 21 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in 0.1 m phosphoric acid, and the phosphorylated protein was collected by filtration over a 0.8-μm membrane filter (Schleicher and Schuell). After washing twice with 5 ml of stop-solution, the filters were analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. Data are corrected for the levels of phosphorylated protein obtained with mock-infected membranes. After ATP-dependent phosphorylation, the reaction mixture was diluted from 60 to 500 μl with nonradioactive ATP (final concentration 10 μm; in order to prevent rephosphorylation with radioactive ATP) in 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 6.0) and 0–100 mm KCl. The mixture was further incubated for 3 s at 21 °C. Thereafter, the reaction was stopped as described above, and the residual protein phosphorylation levels were determined. Cellfectin, competent DH10bac Escherichia coli cells, and all enzymes used for DNA cloning were purchased from Life Technologies. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci·mmol−1 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.SCH 28080 was kindly provided by Dr. C.D. Strader (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ). The antibodies HKB and 2G11 were gifts from Dr. M. Caplan (Yale) and Dr. J. Forte (Berkeley), respectively. All data are presented as mean values for 2–5 individual preparations with S.E. Differences were tested for significance by means of the Student's t test. IC50 and K0.5 values were determined by analyzing the plots using the Non-Linear Curve Fitting program (Hill equation function) of Origin 6.1 (Microcal, Northampton, MA). In this study, we produced a series of mutants of gastric H+,K+-ATPase in which Glu343, Glu795, and Glu820 were replaced, yielding single, double, and triple mutations in the putative K+-binding domain. For clarity, these mutants are indicated with their single letter code. The first letter indicates the amino acid at position 343, the second at position 795, and the third at position 820 (e.g. DQQ is mutant E343D/E795Q/E820Q). The α-subunit of all mutants expressed in the Sf9 membrane fractions could be detected by the HKB antibody (18Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2). The β-subunit was present both in a carbohydrate-free and a core-glycosylated form, similarly as previously reported (12Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwé G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although quantitative analysis of the blots is ambiguous, Fig. 2suggests that the level of expression of the mutants is rather variable. It is known, however, that part of the protein expressed using the baculovirus expression system is inactive (6Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. De Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29764-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Importantly, the maximal phosphorylation level (expressed per mg of protein) of the various mutants is rather constant. This suggests that in this system, relatively more active protein is produced when the expression level is low. It might be that at very high protein expression levels the amount of chaperones is not sufficient for correct protein folding. We therefore express below the ATPase activity and phosphorylation levels per mg of protein and not per unit of expressed H+,K+-ATPase. First, four single mutants of Glu343 were produced and characterized. These mutants were phosphorylated by ATP, to a similar steady-state level (AEE, 5.5 ± 0.6; DEE, 5.5 ± 1.0; LEE, 7.5 ± 2.0; QEE, 5.5 ± 1.3; values in pmol per mg of protein) as the wild type enzyme (EEE, 5.7 ± 0.5 pmol per mg of protein; Fig. 3A). ATP-dependent phosphorylation was completely prevented by preincubation with 0.1 mm SCH 28080. Moreover, the ATPase activities of these mutants measured in the absence of K+were comparable with the activities of membranes from mock-infected cells and were not sensitive to SCH 28080. This indicates that they did not possess K+-independent ATPase activity, as found with some Glu795 (7Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Glu820 (9Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) mutants (see also below). The AEE, DEE, and LEE mutants showed, in contrast to the QEE enzyme, no K+-activated ATPase activity (Fig.3B). The apparent K+ sensitivity of the latter mutant (K0.5 = 0.43 ± 0.04 mm) was about 5 times reduced, compared with that of the wild type enzyme (K0.5 = 0.08 ± 0.01 mm). The ATPase activity of both the wild type enzyme and the QEE mutant was inhibited by high K+ concentrations due to K+/ATP antagonism that is relatively large at the low (10 μm) ATP concentration used (19Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The maximal K+-stimulated ATPase activity of the QEE mutant (0.19 ± 0.04 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1) tended to be lower than that of the wild type enzyme (0.30 ± 0.04 μmol of Pi·mg−1 protein·h−1). The experiments depicted in Fig. 3C show that the dephosphorylation of the AEE, DEE, and LEE phosphointermediates was not stimulated by K+, which is in line with the lack of K+-stimulated ATPase activity. The QEE mutant was dephosphorylated by K+, but the apparent K+affinity (0.16 ± 0.02 mm) was 8 times lower than that of the wild type enzyme (0.02 ± 0.01 mm). These results confirm those of Asano et al. (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Asano S. Furumoto R. Tega Y. Matsuda S. Takeguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), who expressed these mutants in HEK293 cells. This indicates that expression of these mutants in HEK293 and Sf9 cells yields similar results. Next, we produced H+,K+-ATPase mutants of Glu343, Glu795, and Glu820 in different combinations. At position 343, either an Asp (no K+-stimulated activity) or a Gln (reduced K+affinity) was used, whereas at positions 795 and 820, Glu was replaced by a Gln. All 12 possible combinations were expressed as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2). In these 12 combinations, the wild type enzyme (EEE), the previously studied mutants EQE (7Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), EEQ (9Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and EQQ (11Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Wassink L. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the Glu343 single mutants QEE and DEE (Fig. 3) were included for comparison. All mutants were functionally active as indicated by ATP-dependent phosphorylation. After determining (i) the steady-state ATP-dependent phosphorylation level, (ii) the K+ dependence of the ATPase reaction, and (iii) the effect of K+ on the dephosphorylation process, the mutants and the wild type enzyme were divided in three groups: (i) K+-sensitive mutants (QEE, EQE, QQE) including the wild type enzyme (EEE), (ii) constitutively active mutants (EEQ, QEQ, EQQ, QQQ), and (iii) nondephosphorylating mutants (DEE, DQE, DEQ, DQQ). Fig.4A shows that the wild type enzyme (EEE) and the three mutants QEE, EQE, and QQE were phosphorylated by ATP. The phosphorylation levels varied somewhat but were not significantly different from the wild type enzyme (EEE, 5.7 ± 0.5; EQE, 3.8 ± 0.5; QEE, 5.5 ± 1.3; QQE, 8.4 ± 1.8; values in pmol/mg of protein). SCH 28080 (0.1 mm) completely prevented ATP-dependent phosphorylation of these preparations. The EQE mutant had a slightly higher K+ sensitivity (0.03 ± 0.01 mm) in the ATPase reaction than the wild type enzyme (0.08 ± 0.01 mm). The apparent K+ affinity of the QQE mutant (0.56 ± 0.08 mm) was, like that of the QEE mutant (0.43 ± 0.04 mm), reduced by approximately 1 log unit (Fig. 4B). The maximal activity of the QQE mutant (0.30 ± 0.11 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1) was similar to that of the wild type enzyme (0.30 ± 0.04 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1) and somewhat, although not significantly, higher than that of the QEE (0.19 ± 0.04 μmol of Pi·mg−1 protein·h−1) and EQE (0.19 ± 0.02 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1) mutants. The data from the dephosphorylation experiments were in line with those of the ATPase assays, showing, a slightly higher apparent K+ affinity for the EQE mutant (0.01 ± 0.01 mm) and a reduced apparent affinity for the QEE (0.16 ± 0.02 mm) and QQE (0.08 ± 0.02 mm) mutants, compared with the wild type enzyme (0.02 ± 0.01 mm) (Fig. 4C). If the values for the ATPase activities were divided by those of the maximal steady state phosphorylation levels, “turnover numbers” that were not significantly different (varying between 576 and 877 min−1) were obtained. These turnover numbers are an underestimation of the actual turnover numbers because of the low ATP concentration used in the ATPase assay. Thus, with a Gln at position 343 and/or position 795, the ATPase activity was K+-sensitive if the native Glu was present at position 820. In the case of a Gln at position 343, the K+ affinity was 1 log unit lower than with a Glu at this position. The phosphorylation levels of the four mutants with a Gln at position 820 and either a Glu or a Gln at positions 343 and 795 were lower than those of the K+-sensitive preparations (values in pmol/mg of protein; EEQ, 3.1 ± 0.3; EQQ, 1.3 ± 0.2; QEQ, 3.7 ± 0.5; QQQ, 1.6 ± 0.5; cf. Fig.5A with Fig. 4A). The EQQ and the QQQ mutants had especially low phosphorylated intermediate levels. Preincubation of the membranes with SCH 28080 did not prevent ATP-dependent phosphorylation of these mutants. Conversely, it enhanced the steady-state phosphorylation levels (values in pmol per mg of protein; EEQ, 6.8 ± 0.7; EQQ, 8.5 ± 1.4; QEQ, 5.4 ± 1.0; QQQ, 6.2 ± 1.0) as previously shown for the EEQ and EQQ mutants (10Swarts H.G.P.

De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Of note, the phosphorylation level measured in the presence of SCH 28080 was of the same order of magnitude as that of K+-sensitive mutants measured in the absence of SCH 28080, suggesting that they have similar intrinsic capacities. The constitutively active mutants showed an SCH 28080-sensitive ATPase activity in the absence of K+ (Fig.5B). This activity was not affected by K+concentrations up to 10 mm and decreased at higher concentrations. The highest constitutive ATPase activity (0.44 ± 0.09 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1) was obtained with the EQQ double mutant (11Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Wassink L. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6527-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Further neutralization of the putative K+ binding pocket by an additional introduction of a Gln at position 343 (QQQ) did not enhance the constitutive ATPase activity but lowered it to 0.19 ± 0.01 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1. Similarly, the constitutive ATPase activity of the QEQ mutant (0.08 ± 0.01 μmol of Pi·mg−1 protein·h−1) was less compared with that of the single mutant EEQ (0.26 ± 0.02 μmol of Pi·mg−1 protein·h−1). If the values for the ATPase activities were divided by those of the steady state phosphorylation levels (obtained in the presence of SCH 28080), the apparent turnover numbers decreased in the same rank order as shown in Fig. 5B, from 863 min−1 for the EQQ mutant to 247 min−1 for the QEQ mutant. These apparent turnover numbers also underestimate the actual turnover numbers because of the low ATP concentration used in the ATPase assay. Fig.5C demonstrates that in 3 s at 21 °C, the phosphorylated intermediates of the EEQ, EQQ, and QQQ mutants were hydrolyzed to 10% or less of the original level. The phosphorylated intermediate of the QEQ mutant was reduced to 30% of the original level in this time period. The residual phosphorylation levels were not affected by K+. Thus, constitutive ATPase activity was obtained with a Gln at position 820, independent of the presence of either a Gln or a Glu at posit"

Primary endosomes budded from the plasma membrane and oscillated near the cell periphery for 1–4 min. The addition of thyroid hormone triggered the processive, centripetal movement of the recycling vesicle in linear bursts at velocities of up to 200 nm/s.

Dyneins and kinesins provide bidirectional movement of organelles along individual microtubules, and members of the myosin superfamily use microfilaments for this function. Recent work done in melanocytes revealed that individual organelles can possess both microtubule- and microfilament-based motors and that the two cargo carrier systems cooperate in organelle trafficking (2Rogers S.L.

In melanocytes from the myosin 5a null mouse, dilute, pigment granules remain centrally distributed and fail to accumulate in dendritic arbors (4Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J.

The short distances traveled by cargo-laden myosin 5a in melanocytes limit the direct analysis of myosin 5a-mediated movement in living cells. In vitro, myosin 5a is a processive cargo-carrying motor and undergoes multiple catalytic cycles that allow the motor to move long distances along actin fiber tracks by taking large steps of ∼36 nm (15Rief M.

The globular tail of the motor appears to bind tightly to the surface of melanosomes (4Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143 (J.

However, the short distances traveled and the presence of cooperating microtubule-based cargo carriers have confounded the direct analysis of the processive movement and vesicle-docking reactions in living cells. Astrocytes provide a unique model for the study of myosin 5a-mediated vesicle trafficking, because the dynamic hormone-dependent regulation of the short-lived membrane-bound enzyme type II deiodinase (D2)1 is an actin-based endocytotic event (21Stachelek S.J.

Safran M. Dubord S. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16369-16374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In vitro, the C-terminal 22 residues of myosin 5a serve as the hormone-dependent vesicle-binding domain (21Stachelek S.J. Kowalik T.F. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31701-31707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This long range actin-based trafficking of recycling vesicles can be exploited to define the properties of myosin 5a-mediated vesicle movement in living cells without the participation of the microtubule cargo carriers. In this report we use rapid acquisition time lapse microscopy to follow the processive, centripetal movement of individual recycling vesicles in living cells and show that a specific hormone(s) triggers the docking of primary endosomes to the C terminus of the actin-bound motor. Once tethered, the cargo-laden myosin 5a shows processive, centripetal movement from the cell periphery to the endosomal sorting pool with a velocity of ∼100 nm/s. Actin depolymerization, myosin ATPase inhibitors, and the expression of motorless, dominant negative myosin 5a truncation mutants arrested the processive hormone-dependent movement of recycling vesicles. These findings provide the first evidence of the processive long range movement of cargo-laden myosin 5a along actin fibers in living cells and identify a specific thyroid hormone-dependent domain responsible for reversible vesicle docking. Thyroid hormones, Triton X-100, ATP, dibutyryl cAMP, hydrocortisone, colchicine, bovine serum albumin, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), and rabbit anti-actin IgG were obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, antibiotics, Hanks' solution, and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-myosin 5a was generated as detailed previously (21Stachelek S.J. Kowalik T.F.

Astrocytes were prepared from 1-day-old neonatal rats as described previously (45Leonard J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and grown in growth medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 90 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown to confluence in 75-cm2culture flasks in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C and used at passages 1–3. The D2p29GFP chimera was created as described previously (27Leonard D.M. Stachelek S.J. Safran M. Farwell A.P. Kowalik T.F. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25194-25201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The replication-deficient Ad5-p29GFP virons were purified from HEK293 cell lysates by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The myosin 5a dimerization mutant, Δmyo5acoiled-coil encoding the last IQ domain and the coiled-coil region (residues 892–1040, myosin 5a) was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using rat brain mRNA and site-specific 20-mer oligonucleotides (upstream 5′-CAGTGCTGCTTCCGGCGGAT-3′; downstream, 5′-GTTGAGGGTCTCCTTTTCCTA-3′). The ∼500-base pair fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of the prokaryotic expression vector, pThioHis B (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and the Δmyo5acoiled-coil cDNA was then subcloned into theNotI site of the multiple cloning site of the Sinbis viral expression vector, pSinHis A (Invitrogen). The plasmid, containing a promoter for in vitro transcription as well as the Δmyo5acoiled-coil cDNA, was linearized withPvuI, the mRNA was transcribed using InvitroScript CAP SP6 in vitro transcription kit (Invitrogen), and pseudovirions were produced according to manufacturer instructions in baby hamster kidney cells. Spent medium containing the pseudovirion packaged His6-tagged Δmyo5acoiled-coil mRNA was collected 2–3 days post infection. The C terminus of myosin 5a (nucleotides 2911–7087, a gift from Dr. Nancy Jenkins) was cloned into the BamHI-NotI site of the multicloning site of AdpRec (27Leonard D.M. Stachelek S.J. Safran M.

The Δmyo5a1830 (nucleotides 5534–5660) containing the C-terminal-most 22 amino acids was cloned into the EcoRV site of the multicloning site of AdpRec. For both truncation constructs, the shuttle vector was linearized by EcoRI and cotransfected with ClaI-XbaI linearized Ad-5-β-gal replication-deficient adenovirus DNA into HEK293 cells. The virus was propagated in HEK293 cells, and cell lysates containing ∼108 plaque-forming units/μl replication-deficient Ad5-Δmyo5atail or replication-deficient Ad5-Δmyo5a1830 were then used as a reagent for in vivo analysis of D2p29 vesicle trafficking. Rat astrocytes were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated (10 μg/ml) coverslips and infected with Ad5-D2p29GFP (multiplicity of infection = 5–6), and expression of the GFP fusion protein was visually confirmed 24 h later. The cells were then grown in serum-free medium for 24 h, and D2p29GFP translocation to the plasma membrane was done by an overnight incubation with 100 nm hydrocortisone and 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (45Leonard J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Twenty minutes prior to study the microtubules were disassembled with 10 μm colchicine. Coverslips were then placed on a heated stage (37 °C), the individual cells were isolated, and the treatment medium containing 10 nm thyroid hormone (T4, rT3, or T3) or 0.1% bovine serum albumin vehicle control was added. The movement of the D2p29GFPmolecule was followed by collecting image data sets composed of 40 images taken at 250-nm focal increments. Each data set was collected in 200 msec and repeated every 15 s for a total of 10 min. Computer reconstructions (46Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D. Isenberg G. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) created three-dimensional images that were assembled into time-lapse movies. Representative QuickTime movies may be viewed in the on-line version (http://www.jbc.org). All experiments were done a minimum of three times, and where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Real-time rapid-acquisition digital microscopy was used to visualize the hormone-dependent centripetal movement of the recycling vesicles in astrocytes expressing a catalytically active green fluorescent fusion protein of the 29-kDa subunit of D2 (D2p29GFP) (27Leonard D.M.

Prior end-point analysis revealed that the principal circulating hormone T4, but not the transcriptionally active metabolite T3, initiated the delivery of D2 vesicles from the cell periphery to the perinuclear space over 20 min (23Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Juge-Aubry C. Tranter M.P. Ekenbarger D.M. Leonard J.L. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D2p29GFP was delivered to the cell periphery prior to the vesicle trafficking study by cAMP stimulation, and the microtubules, which have no effect on recycling vesicle internalization, were disassembled with colchicine (23Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recycling vesicle movement was initiated by hormone(s), and the centripetal movement of the GFP reporter was monitored by collecting stacked image data sets at 250-nm focus increments through the cell every 15 s. Three-dimensional image reconstructions were assembled into time-lapse movies, and the photomicrographs in Fig.1 show representative “snapshots” of D2p29GFP-expressing cells at 0, 4, and 8 min after adding T4, T3, or no hormone. A two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional data set (th1.qt) may be viewed in the on-line version (http://www.jbc.org). At the beginning of the experiment discrete D2p29GFP signals were distributed around the cell periphery in all treatment groups. In hormone-free cells, the fluorescent reporter wobbled in the same position on the plasma membrane throughout the experimental period. In T4-treated cells, the fusion protein remained at the periphery of the cell for up to 4 min and then showed episodic centripetal movement toward the cell nucleus. Individual vesicles in transit showed frequent perpendicular shifts preceded by short pauses, and by 8 min >80% of the recycling vesicles were deposited in the perinuclear space. In contrast, T3-treated cells showed no directed movement, and the fluorescent reporter remained at the cell periphery as observed in hormone-free cells. Vector analysis was then used to determine the path, distance traveled, and the velocity of 30–45 individual recycling vesicles. Fig.2 shows the vector profiles for D2p29GFP vesicles in hormone-free and thyroid hormone-treated cells. In hormone-free cells or cells treated with T3, the D2p29GFP vesicles oscillated within 500 nm of the plasma membrane with average velocities (± S.E.) of 46 ± 8 nm/sec (n = 36, no hormone) and 40 ± 5 nm/sec (n = 30, T3-treated), respectively. In contrast, both T4- and rT3-treated cells showed centripetal but interrupted vesicle movement from the cell periphery to the perinuclear space. In both T4 and rT3 cells, individual vesicles showed 3–8 episodes of linear centripetal movement over the 10-min evaluation period, and the average of peak velocities (mean ± S.E.) during linear vesicle movement was 88 ± 16 nm/sec (n = 30) in the T4-treated cells and 105 ± 26 nm/sec (n = 32) in the rT3-treated cells. We next examined the effects of inhibitors of microfilament depolymerization and the myosin ATPase inhibitor, BDM, on recycling vesicle trafficking. Cyclic AMP-induced D2p29GFP-expressing astrocytes were pretreated for 20 min with 10 μm colchicine alone or in combination with either 10 μm dihydrocytochalasin B or 10 mm BDM, and vesicle movement was initiated by T4. As shown in Fig.3, the colchicine-treated control cells showed that T4 initiated vesicle trafficking from the cell periphery to the perinuclear region of the astrocyte like that observed above (see Fig. 2). Consistent with earlier biochemical studies (21Stachelek S.J. Kowalik T.F. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31701-31707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,23Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both 10 μm dihydrocytochalasin B and 10 mm BDM completely arrested T4-initiated vesicle movement (Fig. 3), and the vesicles remained within 500 nm of the cell periphery. Because our biochemical studies (21Stachelek S.J. Kowalik T.F. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31701-31707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that the C terminus of myosin 5a tethered the D2p29 vesicle to actin fibers in vitro, we examined the myosin 5a domain(s) responsible for the hormone-dependent docking of recycling vesicles in living cells. To deliver the recombinant myosin 5a tail mutants to astrocytes, we used replication-deficient adenoviral constructs containing the complete myosin 5a tail domain (Δmyo5atail), a fragment encoding for the last 22 residues of the myosin 5a (Δmyo5a1830), and a Sinbis pseudoviron containing the mRNA encoding the coiled-coil domain of myosin 5a (Δmyo5acoiled-coil). Control cells were infected with Ad5-β-gal to determine the influence, if any, of the adenoviral delivery system on astrocyte vesicle trafficking. Shown in Fig. 4 are representative vector tracings of individual D2p29GFP vesicles in T4-treated astrocytes expressing the individual myosin 5a truncation mutants and velocity diagrams for T4-initiated movement of individual vesicles. Representative video files for cells expressing the Δmyo5atail (T4_myo5atail.qt) and Δmyo5acoiled-coil (T4_myo5acc.qt) may be viewed in the on-line version (http://www.jbc.org). All the Ad5-Δmyo5a mutant and Simbis-infected cells remained viable for up to 5 days after infection (the longest time tested) and showed cAMP-induced increases in D2 activity identical to that observed in uninfected cells. As expected, control cells expressing Ad5-β-gal showed T4-initiated centripetal vesicle trafficking identical to uninfected astrocytes, indicating that adenoviral infection did not alter hormone-dependent vesicle trafficking (Fig. 4). Overexpression of the Δmyo5atail completely blocked the T4-initiated vesicle transport and decreased the maximal velocity of D2p29GFP-containing vesicles to 38 ± 8 nm/sec (n = 30), a value equal to that in the hormone-free cell (see Fig. 2). Similarly, cells expressing the last 22 residues of myosin 5a (Δmyo5a1830) showed no hormone-dependent directed vesicle movement, and the D2p29GFP vesicles oscillated within 500 nm of the plasma membrane with average velocities (± S.E.) of 41 ± 5 nm/sec (n = 30). These data confirm that the last 22 residues of myosin 5a are essential for vesicle trafficking in situand show that this domain serves as the hormone-dependent vesicle-docking domain in living cells. To determine whether myosin 5a-mediated vesicle trafficking in living cells required two functional motor domains, myosin 5a dimerization was disrupted with a Δmyo5acoiled-coil mutant (residues 892–1040), and the consequences on T4-initiated vesicle trafficking were examined. In cells expressing the Δmyo5acoiled-coil, D2p29 vesicle trafficking was divided into two roughly equal populations: one showed no directed movement (immobile), and the other showed directed long range centripetal movement identical to control T4-treated cells (mobile) (Fig. 4). Unlike our in vitro findings in which this ∼20-kDa Δmyo5a mutant had no effect on vesicle binding to the actin-bound myosin 5a motor (21Stachelek S.J. Kowalik T.F. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31701-31707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in living cells it decreased the number of migrating vesicles by ∼50%. Mobile vesicles had peak velocities (± S.E.) during linear movement of 90 ± 10 nm/sec (n = 16), which is equal to that of cargo-laden native myosin 5a dimers (see Fig. 2). Analysis of the individual vesicle paths in hormone-free cells, T4-treated cells, and the T4-treated cells expressing Δmyo5acoiled-coil is shown in Fig.5. In hormone-free cells, individual vesicles oscillated within 500 nm of the plasma membrane and did not migrate to the cell interior during the 10-min observation period. In T4-treated cells, individual vesicles showed 3–8 episodes of linear centripetal movement of up to 3 μm that lasted up to 30 s with velocities ranging from 70 to 200 nm/s. All vesicles examined also showed several abrupt lateral shifts and occasional retrograde movement that bracketed the long range vesicle movements. Closer examination of individual members of the two pools of D2p29 vesicles in Δmyo5acoiled-coil-expressing cells showed vesicles with no directed movement similar to that in hormone-free cells (immobile vesicles) and vesicles with directed long range episodic linear migration and cable shifts that are identical to those of D2p29 vesicles docked to the native myosin 5a dimers in T4-treated cells (mobile vesicles) (Fig. 5). Bothin vitro and in situ, T4 initiates the formation of a detergent-insoluble complex between vesicles containing D2p29 and actin fibers (25Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the dominant negative Δmyo5a constructs altered the affinity of native myosin 5a for the actin cytoskeleton or competed with native myosin 5a for docking to the D2p29 containing vesicles, we examined the association of both native myosin 5a and the Δmyo5a constructs with the Triton-insoluble actin cytoskeleton (25Farwell A.P.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), we also examined whether this membrane-bound protein and selected other vesicle proteins were also part of this hormone-initiated actin-bound complex. Shown in Fig.6 A are the results of the immunoblot analysis of the T4-initiated interactions between selected vesicle proteins, affinity-radiolabeled D2p29 (30Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and native myosin 5a with the Triton-insoluble actin cytoskeleton. In cell lysates, T4 treatment had little if any influence on any of the proteins evaluated, indicating that T4 did not alter the formation of primary endosomes but promoted the formation of a complex between vesicle-docking protein(s) on the primary endosome and myosin 5a, presumably in preparation for centripetal movement of the vesicle to the cell interior. Rab3, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and D2p29 were all present in the Triton-insoluble complex of T4-treated cells but lacking in this fraction from control hormone-free cells. In contrast, the full-length ∼190-kDa myosin 5a was always found in the Triton-insoluble fraction from both hormone-free and T4-treated astrocytes. Direct analysis of the distribution of the native myosin 5a and the truncation mutants of myosin 5a is shown in Fig. 6 B. Cells expressing Δmyo5atail, Δmyo5a1830, and Δmyo5acoiled-coil were treated with T4 for 20 min, and the Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were prepared as detailed previously (25Farwell A.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the native myosin 5a was localized exclusively to the Triton-insoluble fraction of astrocytes expressing the Δmyo5atail, whereas the Δmyo5atail lacking the actin binding head was exclusively found in the Triton-soluble fraction. Similarly, >90% of the native 190-kDa myosin 5a in Δmyo5a1830-expressing cells was found in the Triton-insoluble fraction, suggesting that these two dominant negative myosin 5a constructs derived from the vesicle binding tail of myosin 5a do not alter the binding of native myosin 5a to the actin cytoskeleton. In Δmyo5acoiled-coil-expressing cells, the native myosin 5a was found in both the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions (Fig. 6 B), with 25–30% of the full-length myosin 5a present in the Triton-soluble fraction and the remaining 70–75% associated with the Triton-insoluble actin cytoskeleton.

Here we demonstrate thatDrosophila RotundRacGAP is active in vitro on Drac1 and Dcdc42 but not Drho1. Similarly, in yeast, RotundRacGAP interacts specifically with Drac1 and Dcdc42, as well as with their activated V12 forms, showing a particularly strong interaction with Dcdc42V12. In the fly, lowering RotundRacGAP dosage specifically modifies eye defects induced by expressing Drac1 or Dcdc42 but not Drho1, confirming that Drac1 and Dcdc42 are indeed in vivotargets of RotundRacGAP. Furthermore, embryonic-directed expression of either RotundRacGAP, or dominant negative Drac1N17, transgenes induces similar defects in dorsal closure and inhibits Drac1-dependent cytoskeleton assembly at the leading edge. Expression of truncated forms of RotundRacGAP shows that the GAP domain of RotundRacGAP is essential for its function. Unexpectedly, transgenes encoding Drac1N17, Dcdc42N17, or RotundRacGAP do not affect the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent gene expression ofdecapentaplegic and puckered, indicating that another Drac1-independent signal redundantly activates this pathway. Finally, in a situation where Drac1 is constitutively activated, RotundRacGAP greatly reduces the ectopic expression ofdecapentaplegic, possibly by negatively regulating Dcdc42. RhoGTPases are negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Here we demonstrate thatDrosophila RotundRacGAP is active in vitro on Drac1 and Dcdc42 but not Drho1.

Like all GTPases of the Ras superfamily, RhoGTPases act as molecular switches to control cellular processes by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states (5Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 constitute a class of regulatory proteins that bind activated forms of RhoGTPases and stimulate GTP hydrolysis, thus down-regulating RhoGTPase-mediated signals (5Nobes C.

In Drosophila, the RhoGTPases are specifically required in many developmental events involving actin-mediated cell shape changes and the control of gene transcription. In particular, misexpression of RhoGTPases during eye development causes defects in ommatidial patterning (12Hariharan I.K. Hu K.Q. Asha H. Quintanilla A. Ezzell R.M. Settleman J.

During embryogenesis, Drac1, Dcdc42, and Drho1 specifically contribute to the elongation of the epidermis during dorsal closure (for review, see Refs. 19Noselli S.

Dorsal closure is a morphogenetic event of mid-embryogenesis in which the lateral epidermis on either side of the embryo stretches dorsally to cover the degenerative epidermis called amnioserosa and finally encloses the embryo in a continuous epidermis (22Ring J.M.

The JNK pathway consists of a set of sequentially activated kinases that transmits a cytoplasmic signal to the nucleus, which generates, in cells situated at the leading edge, both the accumulation of an acto-myosin cytoskeletal network at the dorsal membrane (23Young P.E.

Two major JNK-target genes required for dorsal closure arepuckered (puc), encoding a phosphatase that participates in a feedback loop negatively regulating JNK activity (22Ring J.M. Martinez Arias A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1168-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), function as upstream activators of the JNK cascade. The rotund (rn) locus from Drosophilaencodes a protein, which has been identified as a RacGAP based on 30–50% similarity in its C-terminal region with the GAP domain of several RhoGAP proteins, including the human n-Chimaerin (6Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 43Agnel M. Kerridge S. Vola C. Griffin-Shea R.

RotundRacGAP (RnRacGAP) presents 60% similarity with its closest human homologue Male Germ Cell RacGAP (MgcRacGAP) protein, which specifically enhances the GTPase activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 but is inactive on Rho (45Toure A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jegou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that RnRacGAP displays GAP activityin vitro toward Drac1 and Dcdc42, but not Drho1, and interacts with these same two RhoGTPases in a two-hybrid assay in yeast. The existence of a specifically strong interaction with the activated form Dcdc42V12 suggests an additional function for RnRacGAP in Dcdc42 signaling. We further demonstrate by genetic analysis that changes in RnRacGAP dosage interfere with eye development and embryonic dorsal closure in the fly, two processes controlled by the RhoGTPases Drac1 and Dcdc42. A 1296-base pair fragment, including the entire rnRacGAPcoding sequence, was generated by XmnI-NspV enzymatic digestion of the rnRacGAP(2) cDNA (46Guichard A. Bergeret E. Griffin-Shea R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and inserted into the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Recombinant baculovirus were produced according to the method proposed by Invitrogen Corp. (Kit Maxbac). For the time course analyses ofrnRacGAP RNA and protein production, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus purified by at least two rounds of plaque purification, and as control, wild type virus. At various intervals of infection (24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 h), cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 2000 ×g). Total RNA was isolated by the RNA+ method (Quantum) and analyzed by Northern blot analysis. For protein analysis, similarly prepared cells were directly resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). Protein extracts were then analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels containing 12% polyacrylamide, followed by Coomassie blue staining. Cytosols were prepared from cell extracts by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Cloned cDNAs in pGEX-2T vector encoding the recombinant GST-Dcdc42, GST-Drac1, and GST-Drho1 proteins (41Lu Y. Settleman J.

A. 1997; 94: 12963-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 strain. Proteins were expressed and purified by affinity on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using classical protocols. The GTPases were then cleaved from GST by 4-h incubation at 4 °C in the presence of 1 unit of thrombin (Sigma Chemical Co.) per 100 ml of culture. Thrombin action was blocked by 1 mm diisopropyl fluoro phosphate. The GTPases were loaded with 10 μm GTP (containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP in the presence of 10 mmEDTA as described previously (48Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). Aliquots of the assay medium were loaded onto a nitrocellulose filter under vacuum and washed with 5 ml of Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.5/MgCl2, 5 mm (washing buffer). Binding of GTP was followed for 5 min at 30 °C and found to be maximal at 2.5 min, ranging from 0.5 to 1 mol of GTP/mol of GTPase. After loading with GTP for 2.5 min, spontaneous and stimulated GTPase activities were initiated by adding MgCl2 to 20 mm. Aliquots of the assay medium were incubated either with the RnRacGAP-expressing Sf9 cytosol, a negative control cytosol, GST-human BCR-GAP domain, or GST-p50 Rho-GAP domain as positive controls, or with the washing buffer alone. All samples were run in parallel for a given GTPase. The amount of remaining GTP-bound GTPase was assessed by filtration under vacuum and liquid scintillation counting of the filters. The rnRacGAP cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-GCCTTAAGAATACTAATCACCGAGACCCTC-3′ from rnRacGAP cDNA and T7 primer, and subcloned into the pGAD3S2X vector (digestionEcoRI/NotI). Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (49Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Detection of LexA-fused protein by Western blot analysis was performed with anti-LexA antibodies (CLONTECH) using standard procedures. All flies were maintained on standard medium at 25 °C except where indicated. Full-length rnRacGAPcDNA (46Guichard A. Bergeret E. Griffin-Shea R. Mech.

Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). The rn mutant used in this study is the deficiency rn20 (43Agnel M. Kerridge S. Vola C. Griffin-Shea R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which deletes the entire rn locus. The rn locus itself includes at least two transcription units: rnRacGAPand a second transcript, originally reported to be 5.3 kb in size, for which the size and direction of transcription have been recently revised. 2E. Bergeret and R. Griffin-Shea, unpublished results. Embryonic distribution ofdpp was determined by in situ hybridization to whole-mount embryos adapted from a previous study (53Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Antisense probes labeled with digoxigenin-UTP were generated using the full-length dpp cDNA (gift from M. Affolter) cloned into the pBluescript vector. Anti-β-galactosidase staining was performed as described in (54Ingham P.W. Martinez-Arias A. Nature. 1986; 324: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to detect expression of β-galactosidase in the puc-lacZ enhancer trap linepucE69 (22Ring J.M. Martinez Arias A. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 251-259PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Fas staining was performed as described previously (55Patel N.H. Snow P.M. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1987; 48: 975-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). 7G10 anti-Fasciclin III monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD (National Institutes of Health) and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences (Iowa City, IA). Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) staining was performed with anti-PY antibodies diluted 1:500 (Transduction Laboratories) and Texas-red conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector laboratories). For F-actin staining, TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Fluorescent staining was viewed on a Leica TCS/SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope. To determine the extent and specificity of the potential GAP activity of RnRacGAP, its expression was optimized in a baculovirus insect-cell system. Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying rnRacGAP cDNA, and cell extracts were generated at the post-infection times indicated (Fig.1, A and B) to follow rnRacGAP expression and protein production.rnRacGAP RNA (Fig. 1 A) and protein (arrowhead; Fig. 1 B) accumulated over time with corresponding peaks at 60–72 h post-infection. Because cells showed signs of cell death at 72 h (data not shown), a 60-h post-infection time was chosen as optimal to test the functional GAP activity of RnRacGAP toward Drosophila RhoGTPases (41Lu Y. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1168-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,47Luo L. Lee T. Tsai L. Tang G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12963-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RnRacGAP cytosol stimulated the GTPase activity of Drac1 and Dcdc42 as efficiently as the GAP domain from human BCR (Bcr-GAP) (Fig.1 C). In contrast, it had virtually no effect on Drho1 whereas the GAP domain from human p50-RhoGAP was active (Fig.1 C). Control cytosol displayed no GAP activity on any of these three RhoGTPases (data not shown). Thus, RnRacGAP displays the same specific GAP activity toward Drac1 and Dcdc42 as its closest human homologue MgcRacGAP giving further support to the hypothesis that they are true functional homologues (45Toure A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jegou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test for direct interaction between RnRacGAP and Drac1, Dcdc42, and Drho1, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay (49Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Fusions of the Gal4 activation domain with RnRacGAP were expressed in yeast together with fusions of the LexA-DNA binding domain with either Drac1, Dcdc42, or Drho1, or with the corresponding mutated forms Drac1V12, Dcdc42V12, and Drho1V14, each of which is constitutively blocked in an active conformation (41Lu Y. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1168-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 47Luo L. Lee T. Tsai L. Tang G. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12963-12968Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of RnRacGAP with these target proteins was measured as the ability of transformed yeast to activate the transcription of thehistidine selector gene and the lacZ reporter gene, both under the control of the LexA-binding sequences. None of the constructs alone was able to activate the two genes allowing histidine prototrophy or lacZ expression (not shown). Coexpression of RnRacGAP with Drac1, Dcdc42, Drac1V12, or Dcdc42V12 allowed yeast to grow on the selective medium without histidine (Fig.2 A, −UWLH). However, only the coexpression of RnRacGAP with Dcdc42V12 allowed the activation of the reporter gene lacZ (Fig. 2 A, −UWL+X-Gal), although Drac1V12 and Dcdc42V12 proteins were expressed in yeast at a similar level (Fig. 2 B). There was no detectable interaction between RnRacGAP and either Drho1 or Drho1V14 (Fig. 2 A), although these two forms of Drho1 were expressed in cotransformed yeast (Fig. 2 B). The A35 mutation affects the RhoGTPase effector loop known to be essential for interaction with specific effectors, including RacGAP proteins (56Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As expected, the two mutant forms Drac1V12A35 and Dcdc42V12A35 were not capable of interacting with RnRacGAP and did not grow on selective medium without histidine (Fig. 2 A, −UWLH). Thus, this result validates the specificity of the interaction observed with Drac1V12 and Dcdc42V12, although RnRacGAP interacts more strongly with Dcdc42V12 than with Drac1V12. Flies homozygous for the rn20deficiency, which deletes the rnRacGAP transcript sequence, together with other genetic units (see “Experimental Procedures”), present small rough eyes suggesting a possible role for RnRacGAP in eye development (57Cavener D.R. Otteson D.C. Kaufman T.C. Genetics. 1986; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, defects in retinal organization displayed byrn20/rn20 flies were rescued by the expression of a transgene carrying genomicrnRacGAP-encoding sequence (58Bergeret E. Pignot-Paintrand I. Guichard A. Raymond K. Fauvarque M.-O. Cazemajor M. Griffin-Shea R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6280-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RnRacGAP dosage would affect RhoGTPase activities in the eye, we analyzed the effect of the deficiency rn20 on the phenotypes induced by expression of wild type Drac1, Dcdc42, or Drho1 under the control of the eye-specific promoter GMR in the transgenic flies GMRRac1, GMRCdc42, and GMRRho1+GMRRho3, respectively (12Hariharan I.K. Hu K.Q. Asha H. Quintanilla A. Ezzell R.M. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although lowering RnRacGAP dosage in vivo inrn20/+ hemizygous flies does not affect eye morphology (not shown) compared with wild type eyes (Fig.3, A and B), it strongly enhances the effects of expressing Drac1, consistent with RnRacGAP being a negative regulator of Drac1. Compared with GMRRac1/+ flies, which are moderately affected (Fig. 3, C andD), GMRRac1/rn20 flies (Fig. 3,E and F) present eyes that are dramatically reduced, with flat ommatidia and almost no hairs. In the case of Dcdc42, the data are more complex and may reveal a dual function of RnRacGAP on Dcdc42 activity. On the one hand, observation with the binocular microscope (not shown) and lower magnification scanning electron microscopy showed the eyes of GMRCdc42/rn20flies to be systematically less rough and larger (Fig. 3 J) when compared with those of GMRCdc42/TM3,Sb flies (Fig. 3 G). On the other hand, ommatidial packing in GMRCdc42/rn20 flies was more affected compared with that in GMRCdc42/TM3,Sb flies; in particular, ommatidia were much less closely associated with one another, resulting in contiguous gaps or channels between them (Fig. 3; compare H and Iwith K and L). In contrast to Drac1 and Dcdc42, no change in the phenotype induced by Drho1 was observed in anrn20/+ context (data not shown), consistent with the absence of any direct interaction in the 2-hybrid system and the absence in vitro of GAP activity of RnRacGAP toward Drho1. Drac1 and Dcdc42 signaling are required to complete embryonic dorsal closure (59Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,60Harden N. Ricos M. Ong Y.M. Chia W. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 273-284PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed the in vivo action of RnRacGAP on its putative molecular targets Drac1 and Dcdc42 by overexpressing RnRacGAP in embryos using the Gal4-UAS system (51Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dorsal closure as a phenotypic test to look at the specificity of RnRacGAP with respect to these two RhoGTPases. We constructed transgenic lines containing complete or truncated forms of the rnRacGAP cDNA (46Guichard A. Bergeret E. Griffin-Shea R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,50Hoemann C.D. Bergeret E. Guichard A. Griffin-Shea R. Gene. 1996; 168: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) under the control of UAS regulatory sequences and crossed them with the driver PtcGal4 to overexpress RnRacGAP in a Patched-like (Ptc) pattern during embryogenesis. Although control embryos expressing a UAS-lacZ transgene under the control of PtcGal4 showed normal morphology (Fig. 4 A) and completed embryogenesis, giving rise to normal larvae and adults, embryonic-directed expression of UASRnRacGAP caused 100% embryonic lethality in all the lines. A correlation between RnRacGAP expression levels and the cuticular phenotypes was observed. Indeed, cuticle examination of dead embryos from the lines in which rnRacGAP reached high levels (not shown) showed that only a residue of the two unfused lateral epidermis sheets remained and that the ventral epidermis was totally absent (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, in the line expressing lower amounts of rnRacGAP (not shown), progeny exhibited less severe defects (Fig. 4 C). In this case, the cuticular phenotype is clearly interpretable as an anterior open phenotype resulting from defective dorsal closure and absence of head involution. In addition, small ventral holes are frequently observed (not shown). Ventral holes were also found in Dcdc42 mutant embryos (16Genova J.L. Jong S. Camp J.T. Fehon R.G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 221: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggesting that RnRacGAP also interferes with Dcdc42 function in the maintenance of the integrity of the ventral epidermis. Defects in dorsal closure were also observed with the embryonic epidermal driver 69BGal4 (51Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown) and with the leading edge cell-specific drivers pnrGal4 (61Calleja M. Moreno E. Pelaz S. Morata G. Science. 1996; 274: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) (not shown) and LEGal4 (25Glise B. Noselli S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D). In the latter case, RnRacGAP leading edge-restricted expression induces only about 6% embryonic lethality. Dorsal closure defects induced by high levels of RnRacGAP are reminiscent of those induced by expressing the dominant negative forms of either Drac1 or Dcdc42 under the control of PtcGal4 (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively, and Refs. 59Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,60Harden N. Ricos M. Ong Y.M. Chia W. Lim L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 273-284PubMed Google Scholar). As for the RnRacGAP transgene, leading edge-restricted expression of Drac1N17 or Dcdc42N17 induces only partial lethality of about 5%, associated with dorsal closure defects (data not shown). Similarities in the observed phenotypes are consistent with RnRacGAP acting as a negative regulator of these two proteins. The RnRacGAP protein contains two major domains: a PKC-C1 domain in the N terminus, including a zinc finger, and a domain homologous with the GAP domain of RhoGAP proteins in the C terminus (44Agnel M. Roder L. Vola C. Griffin-Shea R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5111-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The N, and C, termini were separately cloned in the pUAS vector and used to generate transgenic lines named, respectively, UAS-Zn and UAS-GAP (see “Exp"
https://openalex.org/W2093350639,"Previously, we observed that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel openings are destabilized by replacing several acidic residues in the amino-terminal tail with alanines (Naren, A. P., Cormet-Boyaka, E., Fu, J., Villain, M., Blalock, J. E., Quick, M. W., and Kirk, K. L. (1999) Science 286, 544–548). Here we determined whether this effect is due to the loss of negative charge at these sites and whether the amino-terminal tail also modulates other aspects of channel gating. We introduced cysteines at two of these positions (E54C/D58C) and tested a series of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents for their effects on the gating properties of these cysteine mutants in intact Xenopusoocytes and excised membrane patches. Covalent modification of these sites with either neutral (MMTS) or charged (2-carboxyethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSCE) and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSET)) reagents markedly inhibited channel open probability primarily by reducing the rate of channel opening. The MTS reagents had negligible effects on the gating of the wild type channel or a corresponding double alanine mutant (E54A/D58A) under the same conditions. The inhibition of the opening rate of the E54C/D58C mutant channel by MMTS could be reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (200 μm) or by elevating the bath ATP concentration above that required to activate maximally the wild type channel (>1 mm). Interestingly, the three MTS reagents had qualitatively different effects on the duration of channel openings (i.e. channel closing rate), namely the duration of openings was negligibly changed by the neutral MMTS, decreased by the positively charged MTSET, and increased by the negatively charged MTSCE. Our results indicate that the CFTR amino tail modulates both the rates of channel opening and channel closing and that the negative charges at residues 54 and 58 are important for controlling the duration of channel openings. Previously, we observed that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel openings are destabilized by replacing several acidic residues in the amino-terminal tail with alanines (Naren, A.

Science. 1994; 266: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The CFTR channel possesses two transmembrane domains, each of which contains six transmembrane segments, two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and a large regulatory domain (R domain) with multiple phosphorylation sites (4Riordan J.R.

CFTR channel gating probably involves physical and functional interactions among the R domain and the NBDs (7Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.-J. Galley K. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Neville D.C. Rozanas C.R. Tulk B.M. Townsend R.R. Verkman A.S.

Biophys. 2000; 375: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although the precise roles of these domains in controlling channel opening and closing are still unclear. In addition, there have been reports that other regions of CFTR such as the cytoplasmic loops may also modulate CFTR channel function (11Seibert F.S. Lindsell P. Loo T.W. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27493-27499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Seibert F.S. Lindsell P. Loo T.W. Hanrahan J.W. Clarke D.M. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15139-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We observed previously (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar) that a cluster of negatively charged residues in a putative helical region of the amino-terminal tail (N-tail) participates in CFTR channel gating. Alanine substitutions at these positions (i.e. Asp-47, Glu-51, Glu-54, and Asp-58) resulted in accelerated deactivation kinetics in intact oocytes and shortened open channel bursts in excised membrane patches (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A disease-associated mutant that maps to one of these sites (D58N CFTR) exhibited similar alterations in macroscopic current kinetics and open channel burst duration (14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). These mutations had no apparent effect on the ATP dependence of channel gating or on bulk phosphorylation of the CFTR protein by PKA but did prevent the very long channel openings that can be induced by the poorly hydrolyzable nucleotide analog AMP-PNP (14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, these mutations in the N-tail destabilize channel openings (i.e. increase channel closing rate) apparently by affecting a gating transition that is downstream of channel activation by phosphorylation and ATP binding (14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). Although the results of our previous mutational analyses indicated that the N-tail regulates CFTR channel closing, those studies provided only limited insight into the specific role of this region in modulating CFTR gating. For example, most of our previous data were obtained for one kind of mutation (Glu/Asp to Ala), which limits our ability to make conclusions about the importance of the charge or bulk of the side groups of the relevant amino acids. In addition, the comparison between the gating properties of wild type and mutant channels is an unpaired comparison that could be confounded by effects of the mutations on the biosynthesis or general structure of the channel protein. Finally, the N-tail could play additional roles in CFTR channel gating that are not particularly sensitive to point mutations in this region. Although we failed to observe a dramatic effect of mutations in this region on channel opening rate, we did observe a modest increase in interburst duration (i.e. closed time) for D58N CFTR (14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar) as if this mutation also affected the ability of the channel to open. In addition, Chan et al. (15Chan K.W. Csanady L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have recently reported that CFTR channels that have been epitope-tagged (FLAG-tagged) at the extreme amino terminus exhibit fewer channel openings in excised membrane patches (i.e. reduced opening rate) relative to the untagged channel. These observations raise the possibility that the N-tail could participate in multiple aspects of CFTR gating (i.e. both channel opening and closing). To address these issues we substituted cysteines for two negatively charged amino acids in the N-tail (Glu-54 and Asp-58) and covalently modified these residues in intact Xenopus oocytes and excised membrane patches. The advantages of studying cysteine mutants is that one can acutely and reversibly modify these residues with thiol-specific reagents (i.e. do paired comparisons within the same oocyte or membrane patch). In addition, since cysteines can be modified with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives with different chemistries (16Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), such experiments have the potential to provide initial insights into the structural requirements for the involvement of the N-tail in channel gating. We were encouraged to attempt this approach because of reports that the CFTR channel is relatively insensitive to low concentrations of thiol-specific reagents (17Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Akabas M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Harrington M.A. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27536-27544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that modification of these cysteines with either uncharged or charged MTS reagents markedly and reversibly reduces channel opening rate in excised membrane patches. This inhibition of opening rate was observed at concentrations of MTS reagents that had no effect on the gating of the wild type channel or of a corresponding alanine mutant (E54A/D58A). Interestingly, uncharged and charged MTS reagents had different effects on open channel burst duration (i.e. channel closing rate); specifically, burst duration was increased by the negatively charged MTSCE, decreased by the positively charged MTSET, and virtually unaffected by the neutral MMTS. Our results indicate that the amino-terminal tail can modulate both the opening and closing of the CFTR channel and that the duration of channel openings is dependent on the negative charges at positions Glu-54 and Asp-58. The E54C and E54C/D58C CFTR mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis. A 1-kilobase pair fragment of wild type CFTR in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.) was amplified by PCR in the presence of an appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotide. The upstream primer contained an Asp-718 restriction site, and the downstream primer contained a Kpn21 site. After digestion the PCR product was ligated back into pCDNA3-wild type CFTR pre-digested with Asp-718 and Kpn21. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire 1-kilobase pair fragment. For oocyte injections wild type and mutant CFTR cRNAs were prepared using the T7 Megascript transcription kit from Ambion Inc. Female Xenopus laevis were purchased from Xenopus One (Ann Arbor, MI). Frogs were anesthetized in water containing 0.2% MS-222 (Tricaine, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester) for 30 min before surgery. Oocytes were removed from a 1-cm incision in the abdomen. After suturing the incision, the frog was allowed to recover in water. The frogs were humanely killed after the final collection. Clumps of oocytes were defolliculated in a 10-ml plastic tube of OR-2 solution (82 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing 2 mg/ml collagenase A. Defolliculated oocytes were transferred to 50% Leibovitz medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 15% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 18 °C before and after injection. Wild type and mutant CFTR cRNAs were injected into oocytes 2–5 days before voltage clamp studies or patch clamp recording. For patch clamp experiments more mutant CFTR cRNAs were injected (2–5versus 1 ng of cRNA for wild type CFTR) to provide sufficient channel activity for quantitative analysis of channel gating (see below). Two microelectrode voltage clamp experiments were performed to measure the macroscopic currents mediated by wild type CFTR and the cysteine mutants in intact oocytes. CFTR-mediated currents were activated in a low calcium ND-96 bath solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) by the addition of a mixture containing 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 10 μm forskolin, and 200 μm dibutyryl-cAMP. Oocytes were clamped at −50 mV throughout the experiments. All recordings were performed at 21–23 °C. For patch clamp experiments the oocytes were shrunken briefly in a bath solution containing 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with HCl). The vitelline membrane was then removed with fine tip forceps. All single channel recordings were performed at 21–23 °C in an inside-out excised configuration with a holding potential of −80 mV (pipette side ground). The pipette solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with HCl). PKA catalytic subunit and Mg-ATP were added to the bath right after the formation of an excised inside-out patch and were present throughout the experiment. The final concentrations of Mg-ATP and PKA catalytic subunit were 1 mm and 80 units/ml, respectively, unless otherwise noted. Bath solutions containing MMTS, MTSET, MTSCE, or DTT were prepared fresh in low calcium ND-96 solution (two electrode voltage clamp experiments) or in the bath solution used for patch clamping (see above) before each experiment. Patch clamp records were filtered at 100 Hz. Only records with stable activity for at least 10 min were analyzed. Single channel analysis was performed using pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments). Closings shorter than 20 ms were considered to be intraburst flickerings (due presumably to block by the HEPES in the bath (20Tabcharani J.A. Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21McCarty N.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1947-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and were ignored in our analysis. The kinetic differences between wild type CFTR and the cysteine mutants, and the effects of thiol modification on the cysteine mutants, were also obvious when longer cut-off times (50 or 80 ms) were used (data not shown). Since most patches contained multiple channels, mean open channel burst duration was calculated by the cycle time method described by Mathews et al. (22Mathews C.J. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 365-377Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and used by us previously (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). Channel open probability (P o) was calculated as described (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar, 22Mathews C.J. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 365-377Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Channel opening rate was calculated as the number of openings observed per s divided by the number of active channels detected in that patch. The calculation of burst duration using the cycle time method is independent of the number of channels in the patch (14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar, 22Mathews C.J. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 365-377Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely, the calculations of opening rate and P o are directly dependent on how many active channels are in a patch. Thus, absolute values of opening rates and P o can be overestimated for patches containing channels with low activity for which the numbers of channels may be underestimated. However, this potential source of error does not affect estimates of the relative changes of these parameters in paired experiments performed on individual excised patches. Data are presented as means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of oocytes or patches analyzed. Paired Student'st tests were performed to examine differences before and after treatment with a given reagent. Differences were considered to be statistically significant for p values lower than 0.05 (indicated by asterisks in figures). MTSET and MTSCE were purchased from Toronto Research Chemical Inc. PKA catalytic subunit was purchased from Promega, and forskolin was from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The functional properties of the cysteine mutants were first analyzed in intact oocytes to determine how the cysteine substitutions themselves affected CFTR activity. The cRNAs encoding wild type CFTR, a single cysteine mutant (E54C), or a double cysteine mutant (E54C/D58C) were injected into oocytes and assayed by two-electrode voltage clamp analysis. Both cysteine mutants exhibited lower cAMP-activated macroscopic currents than wild type CFTR when equivalent amounts of cRNA were injected (Fig.1 B), as we had observed previously (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar) for the alanine mutants at these positions. In addition, like the corresponding double alanine mutant (E54A/D58A) (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the double cysteine mutant deactivated faster than wild type CFTR following removal of the cAMP-activating mixture (Fig. 1 C). As will be shown below, E54C/D58C also exhibits reduced channelP o and briefer channel openings in excised membrane patches relative to the wild type channel. Thus, the cysteine mutations in the N-tail affect CFTR channel activity much like the corresponding alanine substitutions that we had characterized previously (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). We next tested the responses of the cysteine mutants to MMTS, which covalently attaches a thio-methyl group to cysteine through disulfide bonding (see Fig. 1 A for formula). MMTS is neutral, small, and lipid-soluble and, therefore, can cross to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane when applied extracellularly (23Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1849-C1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The currents mediated by the double cysteine mutant and, to a lesser extent, the single cysteine mutant were inhibited when MMTS (10 μm) was applied to the bath after currents had been first activated with the cAMP-containing mixture (Fig. 2,A and B). The representative current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 2 C indicates that the MMTS-induced inhibition of the currents mediated by E54C/D58C was due to lowered macroscopic conductance (i.e. reduced slope) rather than to a change in concentration driving force (i.e.altered reversal potential). We also tested the effects of MMTS on the wild type channel (WT CFTR) and the double alanine mutant (E54A/D58A) to determine if the inhibition was specifically due to modification of the engineered cysteines at residues 54 and 58. At this concentration MMTS had small effects (5–10% inhibition) on the macroscopic currents mediated by WT CFTR and E54A/D58A in intact oocytes (Fig. 2, A andB) and had no effects on the channel activities of these constructs in excised patches (see below). Greater inhibition of the currents mediated by E54C/D58C was observed at higher MMTS concentration (1–5 mm), but nonspecific effects on wild type CFTR became significant at these considerably higher doses (results not shown). Consequently, 10 μm MMTS was used for the patch clamp studies described below. We also tested two charged, hydrophilic MMTS analogs (MTSET and MTSCE; see Fig.1 A for formulae) for their effects on the currents mediated by the double cysteine mutant in intact oocytes (Fig. 2 D). These membrane-impermeant reagents had no effect when applied extracellularly at a 10-fold greater concentration (100 μm) than that used for our MMTS experiments, which is consistent with the presumed cytoplasmic orientation of the CFTR amino-terminal tail (4Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar). Since the activity of the double cysteine mutant was substantially affected by thiol modification in intact oocytes, we performed a series of patch clamp studies of the E54C/D58C channel in excised inside-out patches. The goals of these experiments were as follows: (i) to compare the gating properties of this N-tail mutant to those of wild type CFTR, and (ii) to test the effects of thiol modification of the engineered cysteines on CFTR channel gating in excised inside-out patches. The unmodified E54C/D58C mutant channel exhibited an ∼50% lowerP o than WT CFTR (Fig.3) under conditions that maximally activate the wild type channel (80 units/ml PKA; 1.0 mmMg-ATP). This reduction in P o was due in part to shorter open channel bursts (Fig. 3 D), as we had observed previously (13Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar) for the corresponding alanine mutants. No obvious effect of these mutations on channel opening rate was detected (Fig.3 D). We next tested the effects of the neutral MMTS on the gating properties of E54C/D58C in excised patches, since this compound inhibited the macroscopic currents mediated by the cysteine mutants in intact oocytes. When added to the cytoplasmic face of excised patches, MMTS had little effect on the channel open probability and gating kinetics (opening rate, burst duration) of either wild type CFTR or the double alanine mutant (E54A/D58A) (Fig. 3, A andB). However, this reagent strongly inhibited the open probability of the double cysteine mutant (Fig. 3, C andD). This effect on E54C/D58C channel activity in excised patches occurred within 1–5 min of adding MMTS to the patch (results not shown). Interestingly, the MMTS-induced reduction in theP o of the double cysteine mutant was due almost entirely to a marked inhibition of opening rate (Fig. 3 D). We could detect no significant effect of MMTS on open channel burst duration (i.e. the duration of channel openings). If the effect of MMTS on the gating of the E54C/D58C channel is due to the formation of a mixed disulfide at these positions, then this effect should be reversed by a reducing agent such as DTT. Fig.4 shows that the inhibitory effects of MMTS on the gating of E54C/D58C were completely reversed by the subsequent addition of 200 μm DTT. TheP o and channel opening rate of the double cysteine mutant completely recovered from MMTS inhibition within 1–5 min of adding DTT to the bath. At this low concentration DTT had negligible effects on the gating of the wild type channel (results not shown) or on the gating of E54C/D58C in the absence of MMTS (Fig. 4,A and B). The fact that DTT alone had no effect on the gating of E54C/D58C indicates that the lower channel activity of this mutant is unlikely due to formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between the two engineered cysteines in the N-tail. We also tested the effects of the two charged MTS reagents on the gating properties of the double cysteine mutant in excised patches,i.e. the positively charged MTSET and the negatively charged MTSCE. Although these charged reagents had no effect on the activity of the double cysteine mutant when applied extracellularly to intact oocytes (Fig. 2 D), each inhibited E54C/D58C channel activity when applied to the cytoplasmic face of an inside-out patch. Like MMTS, the positively charged MTSET inhibited P o and channel opening rate of the double cysteine mutant (Figs.5, B and C) but had no effect on the channel activity of wild type CFTR (Fig.5 A) or the double alanine mutant (data not shown). However, unlike the case for the neutral MMTS, MTSET also significantly inhibited the open channel burst duration of the double cysteine mutant (Fig. 5 C). Thus, modification of the E54C/D58C channel with the positively charged MTS reagent not only inhibited channel opening rate but also further shortened the channel openings in excised membrane patches. The negatively charged MTSCE had a qualitatively different effect on the gating properties of the double cysteine mutant. Although modification with MTSCE also inhibited channel opening rate (and consequently P o), this reagent induced the appearance of long open channel bursts (5–20 s; e.g. Fig.6 A) that were intermingled with the short bursts characteristic of the MMTS- or MTSET-modified channel. These longer bursts were never observed following modification with MMTS or MTSET and were only very rarely observed for the unmodified E54C/D58C mutant channel. In fact, the mean open channel burst duration for the double cysteine mutant increased to wild type levels following modification with the negatively charged MTSCE (Fig.6 B; where mean burst duration was calculated for multichannel patches using the cycle time method (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 14Fu J. Ji H.-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; (in press)Google Scholar and 22Mathews C.J. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 365-377Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Similar results were obtained when we generated histograms of open channel bursts for patches containing only one detectable channel each (Fig.7). Although the latter analysis is made more difficult by the fact that MTS-modified channels have low channel opening rates (and, hence, fewer openings to analyze), it is clear that modification with the positively charged MTSET and the negatively charged MTSCE caused shifts toward briefer and longer openings, respectively. Thus, the duration of CFTR channel openings can be increased by modification of the engineered cysteines in the N-tail with a negatively charged MTS reagent but not with a neutral or positively charged reagent. These results, taken together with our initial observation that open channel burst duration was reduced by replacing the original acidic residues at these positions (Glu-54 and Asp-58) with alanines (13Naren A.P.

Rme1p has three zinc finger segments, and two of them are atypical. To determine DNA binding domain of Rme1p, a series of Rme1p derivatives fused with maltose-binding protein were purified and characterized by gel mobility shift assay. We show that not only three zinc fingers, but also the neighboring C-terminal region is essential for DNA binding. Mutational analysis of this region revealed that basic residues Arg-287, Lys-290, and Arg-291 and the hydrophobic residues Phe-288, Leu-292, Ile-295, and Leu-296 are critical for DNA binding. In addition, double substitutions by proline at Asn-289 and Lys-293, each of which was not essential for DNA binding, abolished DNA binding. These results suggest that the C-terminal segment forms an amphipathic helical structure. Furthermore, it was shown that the mutations in the important basic residues abolish or impair Rme1p function in vivo for repression and inhibition of spore formation.

Adams M.D. Myers E.W. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10387) Google Scholar). Many zinc finger proteins recognize specific DNA sequences (1Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E.

Structural features and functional requirements for the binding of C2H2 zinc fingers to DNA have proven valuable for understanding biochemical and biological regulatory mechanisms. In addition, this information has had significant impact in protein engineering, permitting the design of novel DNA-binding proteins useful for diagnostics and gene therapy (3Choo Y. Isalan M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of zinc finger domains with DNA is not simple, and general rules for DNA recognition are continually refined and extended. Thus, there are still significant challenges in understanding zinc finger protein-DNA interaction and in developing design methods for zinc finger proteins with novel specificity. Our studies focus on the zinc finger protein Rme1p, which has a vital role in the life cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Mitchell A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 56-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kupiec M. Bryers B. Esposito R.E. Mitchell A.P. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 3.

It prevents haploid cells from initiating meiosis, a specialized division that would be nonproductive and potentially lethal. Rme1p has two characterized molecular roles. First, it represses IME1, which specifies an activator of a major class of meiosis-specific genes (13Covitz P.A. Herskowitz I. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Covitz P.A. Song W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Second, it stimulates expression of CLN2 (17Toone W.M. Johnson A.L. Banks G.R. Toyn J.H. Stuart D. Wittenberg C. Johnson L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5824-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which specifies a mitotic G1 cyclin. A very similar G1 cyclin (Cln3p) has been shown to exclude Ime1p from the nucleus (18Colomina N. Gari E. Gallego C. Herrero E. Aldea M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rme1p may inhibit meiosis through two convergent mechanisms. We have characterized the action of Rme1p at the IME1promoter, which is unusual among yeast promoters for its size, complexity, and repression mechanism (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A.

Rme1p binds to two sites upstream of IME1 at −2030 and −1950 in vivo and in vitro, and both sites are required for repression of IME1 (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), treatment of the purified Rme1p with EDTA abolishes its DNA binding activity (16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The nature of Rme1p-DNA recognition is of interest for two reasons. First, Rme1p has three zinc fingers (designated ZF1,1 ZF2, ZF3; see Fig. 1) and yet protects over 13 bp as determined by in vitro andin vivo footprinting (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Second, two of the Rme1p zinc fingers are atypical (13Covitz P.A. Herskowitz I. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as seen in Fig. 1B. ZF1 has a C2H1E1 structure rather than a C2H2 structure. ZF2 lacks the first hydrophobic residue, and the number of residues between the second cysteine and the second hydrophobic residue exceed the consensus (X6 instead of X3; see Fig. 1B). Also, the ZF2–ZF3 linker region contains 21 amino acids rather than the 5 residues found in the most common linker arrangement. To determine the molecular consequences of these novel features, we have initiated a study of the Rme1p structural requirements for DNA binding. We find that the C-terminal region adjacent to ZF3 is required for DNA binding. Mutational analysis supports a model in which this region forms an amphipathic α-helix, which may contact DNA directly. Full-length and truncated RME1 genes (RME1-(171–300),RME1-(171–284),RME1-(171–237),RME1-(201–300), andRME1-(201–284), the numbers in parentheses show the position numbers of the amino acid residues in Rme1p; also see Fig. 1) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pAM240 (13Covitz P.A. Herskowitz I. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a template, which carries RME1 on an ∼3-kilobase pair Sau3A1-BglII fragment in the pBR322 BamHI site. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were inserted between the XmnI andHindIII sites of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolab) to fuse with the malE gene that encodes maltose-binding protein (MBP). Site-directed mutagenesis in the C-terminal region was introduced by two-step polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid carrying theRME1-(171–300) gene in pMAL-c2. The sequences for RME1 and its mutants in all the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids constructed were introduced in the Escherichia coliTB1 strain, and MBP-Rme1p proteins were overexpressed in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.01 mmZnCl2 by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA600 = 0.5. The cell lysate was loaded onto an amylose-resin chromatography column (2.5 × 7 cm), and the column was washed with 175 ml (10 column volumes) of the column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). After washing the column, MBP-Rme1p was eluted by the column buffer containing 10 mm maltose according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of MBP-Rme1p was checked by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of purified MBP-Rme1p was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The 404-bp fragment ofIME1 upstream (−2140 to −1746) was subcloned into theEcoRI site of a pBR322 derivative plasmid (16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 404-bp RC fragment was isolated from low melting temperature agarose gel electrophoresis of the EcoRI digests of the plasmid, and it was radioactively labeled by treatment with Klenow fragment together with [α-32P]dATP. 0.16 pmol of 32P-labeled fragment was mixed with a different amount of proteins (0.16–41.0 pmol) in 30 μl of the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol) containing 2 μg poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 7.5 μg of bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 30 min on ice, each mixture was loaded and run on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 5 °C (16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography.

Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) from strain AMP1122 as follows. AhisG-URA3-hisG fragment was inserted into theBglII site of MBP-Rme1p expression plasmids. Then, the wild type RME1 gene for 171–300 amino acid residues or mutants (K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A or K290A) in the plasmids were cleaved at theEcoRI site (codons for 199 and 200 amino acid residues in Rme1p) and integrated into the genomic locus ofPGAL1-RME1 in AMP1122 strain. After selection of Ura+ transformants, the hisG-URA3-hisG was popped out by selection on a plate of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FoA) medium (22Rose M. Winston F. Hieter P.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sporulation was measured by counting the number of asci/400 cells after 72 h in sporulation medium (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase and sporulation assay results are the average of three independent cultures of each strain. Rme1p consists of 300 amino acid residues, and three regions similar to C2H2zinc fingers lie at positions 178–199 (ZF1), 206–234 (ZF2), and 256–281 (ZF3) (13Covitz P.A. Herskowitz I. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1. For analysis of DNA binding by Rme1p, we purified a series of Rme1p derivatives (Fig. 1A) as fusions to E. coli MBP. DNA binding affinity was characterized through gel mobility shift assays using a 404-bp IME1 upstream fragment (−2146 to −1743) that contains two Rme1p binding sites. With full-length MBP-Rme1p (Fig. 2A), we observed one complex at low [protein]/[DNA] ratios (lanes 5–7). A second complex forms at higher [protein]/[DNA] ratios (lanes 8–10), which we have shown to depend upon presence of two Rme1p binding sites in the template (16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N-terminal region of Rme1p is required for DNA binding, we examined the N-terminal deletion derivative MBP-Rme1p171–300 (Fig. 1A). As seen in Fig.2B, this fusion protein binds the DNA fragment with affinity similar to MBP-Rme1p, forming a second complex at nearly the same [protein]/[DNA] ratio as that of full-length MBP-Rme1p. Competition assays indicate that MBP-Rme1p171–300 binds to each site in the IME1 upstream region with similar affinities (data not shown) as determined previously for MBP-Rme1p (16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the truncated MBP-Rme1p171–300 retains the full binding specificity of intact Rme1p. Further truncation to yield MBP-Rme1p201–300, which lacks ZF1, abolished DNA binding. Similarly, MBP-Rme1p171–237, which lacks ZF3, did not bind to DNA (summarized in Fig. 1A). This result is in keeping with the finding that point mutations at cysteine residues in any of the Rme1p zinc fingers abolish DNA binding (13Covitz P.A. Herskowitz I. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We conclude that DNA binding by Rme1p does not require the N-terminal region (residues 1–170) and does require the zinc finger region. Consistent with a property of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins (29Pedone P.V. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Felsenfeld G. Omichinski J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), incubation of the protein with 10 mm EDTA inhibits the DNA binding activity of Rme1p171–300 (data not shown) as does the full-length Rme1p (16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether the three zinc fingers are sufficient for DNA binding, MBP-Rme1p171–284 was constructed and characterized. This protein lacks both the Rme1p N-terminal region, and a short C-terminal region. MBP-Rme1p171–284 did not form detectable protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2C), indicating that the C-terminal region (residues 285–300; called the C-TR) is essential for DNA binding. These results indicate that the zinc fingers are not sufficient for DNA binding ability. Thus, the DNA binding domain of Rme1p consists of three zinc fingers and the C-TR. The C-TR contains several basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). Provided that the region folds into α-helix, the basic residues appear to form a ridge on one side of the helix, whereas the hydrophobic residues appear on the other side as diagrammed in Fig.3. We performed mutational analysis of the basic and hydrophobic residues in the C-TR to define the amino acid residues that are required for DNA binding. The DNA binding affinity of a series of MBP-Rme1p171–300 C-TR mutant proteins was determined as described above.

Neutral substitutions for four basic residues (K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A) abolished detectable DNA binding (Fig. 4, lane 2). Individual K290A and R291A substitutions severely reduced binding affinity (lanes 4 and 5, respectively), whereas a K293A/K294S double substitution had no effect (lane 6). An R287A substitution also caused significantly less binding affinity (lane 3). A K300A substitution had no effect (lane 7). Therefore, basic residues Arg-287, Lys-290, and Arg-291 are critical for DNA binding, whereas Lys-293, Lys-294, and Lys-300 are not. The three critical residues (Arg-287, Lys-290, and Arg-291) are spatial neighbors in the helical C-TR projection (Fig. 3). Next, we tested the requirements for hydrophobic C-TR residues. Mutant proteins with either F288A/L292S or I295A/L296S double substitutions did not bind to DNA (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and 9). We did not construct individual substitutions for each residue. Nonetheless, our results support the hypothesis that the hydrophobic surface predicted by the helical C-TR projection (Fig. 3) is required for DNA binding. If the C-TR segment extending from Arg-287 to Leu-296 forms an α-helical structure, then helix-breaking proline substitutions in this region should abolish DNA binding. We observed that the side chains of Asn-289 and Lys-293 were not critical for DNA binding, because a N289A/K293A double substitution mutant protein bound to DNA with affinity similar to wild type (Fig. 4, lane 10). However, substitutions of proline for these residues abolished DNA binding (lane 11). These results support the hypothesis that formation of an α-helix by this C-TR segment is required for DNA binding. Our studies described above establish that the C-TR is required for DNA bindingin vitro by recombinant MBP-Rme1p. To test the function of the C-TR in vivo, we examined the biological activity of mutant RME1 derivatives expressed in S. cerevisiae. The C-TR mutations were introduced into thePGAL1-RME1 locus by recombination in strain AMP1122 (Fig. 5A; also see “Experimental Procedures”). We then used immunoblot analysis to verify that each Rme1p derivative was expressed, making use of the N-terminal S53 epitope (13Covitz P.A. Herskowitz I. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoded byPGAL1-RME1 (Fig. 5B). S53 tagged-Rme1p was identified by its presence in a PGAL1-RME1strain (lane 1, AMP1122) and not in anrme1Δ strain (lane 2, AMP119). The wild-type Rme1p introduced by recombination from themalE-RME1 plasmid (lane 3, strain MHS11) was expressed at lower levels than in thePGAL1-RME1 reference (lane 1), most likely because of the lack of a defined transcriptional terminator in 3′ vector sequences (see Fig. 5A). The mutant Rme1p derivatives, carrying either the K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A substitutions (Fig. 5B, lane 4, strain MHS13) or the K290A substitution (Fig. 5B, lane 5, strain MHS15), accumulated to levels as great as wild-type Rme1p (Fig.5B, lane 3). A cross-reacting protein (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 5B) was observed at comparable levels in all samples, thus verifying that similar amounts of extract protein were present in each sample. Therefore, these Rme1p C-TR substitutions do not cause diminished Rme1p accumulation. We used two assays for Rme1p activity to assess mutant protein function. First, we examined repression of a hybridRC-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Shimizu M. Li W. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This reporter carries an IME1 upstream segment (−2146 to −1740, called a repression cassette (RC)) adjacent to a CYC1-lacZ reporter gene. In control measurements, we found that wild-type Rme1p caused 14-fold repression (Fig.6A, strain AMP1122) compared with nonfunctional Rme1–213p (strain AMP1124), in agreement with previous studies (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimizu M. Li W. Covitz P.A. Hara M. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Shimizu M. Li W. Shindo H. Mitchell A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reporter was expressed at low levels in strain MHS11, thus indicating that Rme1p derived from themalE-RME1 plasmid is capable of significant repression. Repression was not as great as in strain AMP1122, presumably because of the lower expression of Rme1p in strain MHS11 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, as seen in Fig. 6A, the reporter was expressed at high levels in strains MHS13 and MHS15. These results indicate that the C-TR substitutions block repression by Rme1p as expected for substitutions that impair DNA binding. We observed reproducibly that strain MSH15 (K290A substitution) was capable of weak repression compared with strain MHS13 (K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A substitutions), suggesting that the K290A substitution permits some DNA binding activity in vivo. As a second assay, we examined the effect of C-TR mutations on sporulation. Diploids homozygous for the respectivePGAL1-RME1 alleles were constructed from strains AMP1122, AMP1124, MHS11, MHS13, and MHS15, and sporulation was quantitated as shown in Fig. 6B. Control diploids derived from AMP1122 sporulated weakly (0.6%); control diploids derived from AMP1124 sporulated efficiently (91.2%). The diploid derived from strain MHS11 sporulated weakly (0.4%), thus verifying that Rme1p derived from the malE-RME1 plasmid is capable of significant repression. The diploid derived from strain MHS13 sporulated efficiently (91.3%), thus verifying that the K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A substitutions abolish Rme1p function. Unexpectedly, the diploid derived from strain MHS15 sporulated at a low level (4.0%), which is substantially less than observed with the AMP1124 and MHS13 diploids. Yet, the level of sporulation in the MHS15 diploid is substantially greater than the MHS11 diploid, which supports the idea that the K290A substitution causes a repression defect. Therefore, the K290A substitution impairs but does not abolish DNA binding ability in vivo. Herein, we have identified the DNA binding domain of Rme1p as residues 171–300, which consists of three zinc fingers and a C-terminal region of 16 amino acids (C-TR). Point mutations in the C-TR revealed that several basic amino acid residues (Arg-287, Lys-290, and Arg-291) and hydrophobic residues (Phe-288, Leu-292, Ile-295, and Ile-296) play an essential role in DNA binding in vitro. Mapping of the critical C-TR residues on an α-helical wheel projection suggests that the C-TR forms an amphipathic α-helix. In support of this structure, we found that a double proline substitution in the C-TR abolished DNA binding. Thus, we suggest that the basic surface of C-TR may contact DNA, whereas the hydrophobic surface may stabilize the structure of the DNA binding domain. We also found that the C-TR is essential for transcriptional repression and inhibition of spore formation by Rme1p. This finding supports the importance of the C-TR for DNA binding in vivo. This analysis also pointed to an unexpected difference between the two C-TR substitutions tested; the K290A substitution caused a milder defect than the K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A multi-site substitution. The difference was negligible in transcriptional repression assays but was striking in sporulation assays. These results can be explained with the assumption that RC-CYC1-lacZ repression is a less sensitive functional assay than sporulation. This assumption seems reasonable because: (i) RC-CYC1-lacZ is a multi-copy reporter gene, whereas sporulation reflects mainly repression of the single-copyIME1 gene (14Covitz P.A. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and (ii) we have observed thatRC-CYC1-lacZ repression depends upon overexpression of Rme1p, whereas sporulation inhibition occurs at the natural level of Rme1p expression. 2P. A. Covitz and A. P. Mitchell, unpublished results. This assumption leads to the conclusion that the K290A substitution permits weak but significant DNA binding, which is greater than permitted by the K290A/R291S/K293A/K294A multi-site substitution. It has been reported that two to four tandem zinc fingers are sufficient for specific DNA binding, but additional secondary structure elements are often used to augment DNA recognition by one or two zinc fingers (23Schmiedeskamp M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14003-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Bowers P.M. Schaufler L.E. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 1997; 4: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For example, the yeast transcription factor Adr1p DNA binding domain contains two zinc fingers and an additional N-terminal accessory region (23Schmiedeskamp M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14003-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that forms a compact domain of three antiparallel strands (24Bowers P.M. Schaufler L.E. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown recently that DNA-induced α-helix capping in a conserved linker sequence, TGEKP, is a determinant of binding affinity (25Laity J.H. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the ββα structure of the zinc finger motif is a central unit, but the flanking regions also contribute to high affinity binding. Our present study illustrates that the Rme1p C-TR acts as a novel accessory domain for zinc fingers. We performed an homology search for the amino acid sequence of ZF3 and C-TR by BLASTP and found several zinc finger proteins with C-terminal segments related to the Rme1p C-TR (TableI). The amount of homology among these segments is not particularly strong, but it is worthwhile to note that the zinc finger proteins found by the BLASTP search attach a C-terminal segment rich in basic amino acids. Also, while Tramtrack, Swi5p, and the GAGA factor are not close homologs of Rme1p, we note that flanking basic residues contribute to DNA binding by the one or two fingers of these proteins (26Dutnall R.N.

Therefore, it seems reasonable that the C-terminal segments listed in Table I may also contribute to high affinity DNA binding by zinc fingers.Table ISequence alignments of C-terminal regions of zinc finger proteins with Rme1p C-TR homologyAmino acid sequences1-aSequence alignments start at the last histidine residue in the C2H2 zinc finger motif.

The C2H2 zinc finger has a conserved ββα structure, and amino acids at positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 of the α-helix play important roles for DNA recognition; e.g.Arg, Gln, and Asp at position −1 often recognize guanine, adenine, and cytosine, respectively, and Arg at position 6 recognizes guanine (31Choo Y.

Thus, half of the Rme1p site is occupied by two zinc fingers, and we suggest that the other half (3′-TTTTCG-5′) is a C-TR contact region. Thus, the unique feature for Rme1p binding, the extended footprint, can be explained by the contact with C-TR. This finding gives a new insight into the diversity of DNA recognition by zinc fingers, and the C-terminal accessory domain may be a useful part of the building blocks for the design of high affinity zinc finger proteins for protein engineering.
