https://openalex.org/W1964369854,"The solid electrolytes MAg4I5, where M may be potassium, rubidium, or ammonium, have an ionic conductivity of 0.2 (ohm cm)-1 at 20°C. Although pure CsAg4I5 does not form, partial substitution of cesium into the M position was obtained. The high-conducting phases of KAg4I5 and RbAg4I5 may be quenched to low temperatures, where they transform to resistive phases at -136° and -155°C, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1975387064,"The crystal structure of the solid electrolyte RbAg4I5 has been determined from single-crystal x-ray diffraction counter data. There are four RbAg4I5 in a cubic unit cell with a = 11.24 Å. The structure refinement, by least squares, is based on space group P413 (O7). The arrangement of the iodide ions is similar to that of the manganese atoms in β-manganese, and provides 56 iodide tetrahedra per unit cell, which share faces in such manner as to provide diffusion paths for the silver ions. The occurrence of the two low-temperature phases of RbAg4I5 has been established by x-ray diffraction and optical examination."

It allows the stations to be as far apart as the earth can accommodate. This then makes the radio band from 10- to 60-centimeters wavelength the best frequency range for high-precision angular measurements, since the variability of the atmosphere is less disturbing there than in the optical band."

https://openalex.org/W2042997109,"A radio interferometer could yield an error on the order of 10(-9) second at the semidiurnal frequency. With errors of this magnitude, yearly changes in the rate at which the earth's rotation is slowing down could be determined. The proposed interferometer could also yield significant improvements in the determination of the Love number k and its variation with frequency, and in the changes in angular momentum of the atmosphere for periods greater than 1 week."
https://openalex.org/W2056307282,"The alkali-rich zeolites mordenite and clinoptilolite have been discovered in tuffaceous rocks of the Green River Formation, Wyoming. This occurrence strongly supports the alteration of glass to alkali-rich zeolite to analcime as the paragenetic sequence of alteration of tuffaceous rocks deposited in ancient Lake Gosiute."
https://openalex.org/W2017930289,It is apparent that penicillin exerts an antibacterial action against Gram negative as well as Gram positive organisms. This property of penicillin becomes more apparent in high potency preparations. It is possible that a form of penicillin showing greater activity against Gram negative organisms may exist. Studies on the nature of such a substance and on the in vivo action of penicillin against Gram negative organisms are in progress.

On 16 July, however, the Times departed from this pattern to question the advisability of proceeding at this time with the construction of the Weston accelerator. Leading off with an editorial on last week's riots in Newark, New Jersey, titled, ""The Gravest Responsibility . . .,"" the Times followed with an editorial on the 200-Bev accelerator, titled "". . . Vs. Scientific Luxury."""
