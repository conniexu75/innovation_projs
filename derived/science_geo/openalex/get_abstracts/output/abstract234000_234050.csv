https://openalex.org/W2055294370,"IT has been suggested1,2, on the basis of kinetic measurements, that the fluorophosphonates inhibit esterases by virtue of a highly specific affinity for the active centres of this group of enzymes. Preliminary experiments with di-isopropyl fluorophosphonate containing phosphorus-32 have given results which are in accordance with this view."

https://openalex.org/W2058271388,"ACCORDING to Szent-Györgyi1, muscular contraction involves the following reaction : at certain salt concentrations, actomyosin, formed from myosin and polymerized actin, loses water and contracts by the action of adenosinetriphosphate. Actin may be present in two forms : in a globular and a fibrous form. In the presence of salts, globular actin is transformed into the fibrous form, that is, polymerization takes place. Only at this stage is actin able to form with myosin the highly viscous actomyosin. Straub et al.2 showed that adrenaline increases, chinine and vera-trine diminish, the speed of polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W4250049119,"THE name 'actinomycin' was given by Waksman and Woodruff1 to a bright red crystalline antibiotic which they isolated from Actinomyces antibioticus. A preliminary examination of its chemical nature was made by Waksman and Tishler2, who reported that it decomposed at 250°, had [χ]25D = – 320° ± 5°, and gave analytical values approximating to a formula C41H O11N8; molecular weight determinations gave values varying from 768 to 1,000. Actinomycin appeared to contain a quinonoid system, since it underwent reversible reduction with hydrosulphite and it could be both acetylated and reductively acetylated. More recently, red antibiotic substances have been isolated from other Actinomycetes, and all have been considered to be identical with actinomycin3. It would also seem that the yellow xanthomycins4 are related chemically to actinomycin."
https://openalex.org/W2088589662,"THERE is little doubt that the macular and foveal region of the human retina is lacking in blood vessels detectable by histological means1. By subjective observation of the red corpuscles in blue light, Weale2 has recently confirmed Gescher's estimate of 1° 30"" for the visual angle within which the vessels of the central artery of the retina are absent. We have been unable to find any evidence that capillaries enter the foveal region from the choroidal vessels, and so it seems that in the absence of an oxygen supply directly from the blood, this region would tend to exhibit a relative anoxia. Hence, if the oxygen tension in the blood is reduced, a disturbance of central rather than peripheral vision is to be expected. In fact, experiment shows precisely the opposite effect, namely, a sparing of the central area and loss of function at the periphery under conditions of lack of oxygen3,4."
https://openalex.org/W2167677004,"BACTERIA possess their own enzymes and can synthesize to a greater or less degree all the substances which are necessary for their growth ; in consequence, pathogenic forms have a metabolism which is distinct from that of their host, while nearly all bacteria can be grown in vitro in the absence of living cells. Viruses are often considered to represent a degenerative simplification of this condition in which the enzymic equipment, although tacitly assumed to be present, is defective to such an extent that a dependence upon host metabolism has developed which deprives the virus of the capacity for independent growth. While this may perhaps be the case in the hickettsiæ, which fall outside the scope of this article, a consideration of the available literature leaves one with the impression that there is little, if any, definite evidence that the true viruses have any enzyme activity at all, while their multiplication may well be more closely related to the mechanisms of heredity than to the growth of bacteria, being secured by some form of control over the metabolism of the host which recalls the control of the activities of the cytoplasm by genes and organisers."

https://openalex.org/W2049710372,"A Disease of seedling lime trees in the Cape Coast district, Gold Coast Colony, is threatening to destroy the industry. Research has revealed the cause of the malady to be a virus existing in at least two strains. In the first of these, symptoms include a one-sided death of the tree coupled with veinal fleckings on the young leaves and severe pitting of the trunks and branches. In the other, conspicuous dwarfing together with the usual veinal symptoms and subsequent death occur. Most sweet citrus and rough lemon appear to be symptomless carriers of the virus."

https://openalex.org/W1966461340,"It is a well-known fact that some lamellar crystals, such as montmorillonite, graphite and hæmoglobin1, swell reversibly upon the addition of water, the latter entering in small defined layers between the crystal planes. It is the purpose of this note to direct attention to some remarkable examples of such behaviour on a much more striking scale. These occur in liquid crystalline solutions of some detergents (anisotropic aqueous phases). In these, all the added water appears to enter the expanded lamellar lattice."

https://openalex.org/W2073733129,"ON September 2, at the recent British Association meeting in Newcastle, a discussion was held by Section B (Chemistry) on ""The Nitrogen Cycle in Nature"". Prof. G. R. Clemo, in introducing the discussion, gave a general survey of the great importfance of the nitrogen cycle in Nature, which ensures that, unlike other natural resources generally, our vast reserves of atmospheric nitrogen are never likely to become exhausted. Among the many groups of naturally occurring nitrogenous substances, he made special mention of chloromycetin, the first organic nitro compound to be discovered in Nature and containing the fundamental C6C3 unit characteristic of many plant products."
https://openalex.org/W2139092858,"The staining of nucleoli of liver and nervous tissue cells fixed in acetone and 80 per cent alcohol by Gomori's acid phosphatase technique has been reported1,2,3; a negative reaction was noted by another investigator4. In a study of the phosphatase reactions of smears of human bone marrow cells fixed in formol vapour5, it was reported that nucleoli did not stain after the acid phosphatase method, being surrounded by a chromatin ring strongly reminiscent of the ""nucleolus associated chromatin"" of Swedish workers6. This problem has been further investigated with animal material."
https://openalex.org/W2013385952,"SEIBERT and her colleagues1, and other workers, found that the polysaccharide content of serum rises above the normal in certain pathological conditions, including tuberculosis and carcinoma, and it was suggested1 that this increase is associated with tissue destruction. In view of the possibility that the carbohydrate was derived from nucleic acid, Seibert et al.2 applied to serum the tryptophane – perchloric acid reaction of Cohen3, when they found a significant increase in the reaction in cases of tuberculosis and several types of carcinoma. The nature of the reacting substance is unknown; but Seibert et al. have produced evidence suggesting that it is derived from proteins. Presumably an increased reaction may also be regarded as being associated with tissue destruction."

They suggested that Δ9-etiocholenol-3(α)-one-17 was a derivative of 11-hydroxy-etiocholanol-3(α)-one-17 (I) and was formed from the latter compound by dehydration during the acid hydrolysis of the urine. Later, they were able to identify (I) in urinary extracts by infrared spectroscopy2."

Morton in Nature of April 2, p. 530, prompts us to publish our results for the provitamin in clams. In order to obtain experimental evidence for the hypothesis that the provitamin D is essentially of endogenous origin, we investigated several years ago the sterols of the viscera and of the eviscerated body of clams. At the time when the clams were collected (late summer) their intestinal tract was filled with a dark green paste, indicating that the food consisted predominantly of chlorophyll-bearing micro-organisms such as algae. The sterols isolated from the viscera contained 21·4 per cent provitamin D (determined spectroscopically and calculated as ergosterol). On the other hand, the sterols from the eviscerated body contained only 7·8 per cent provitamin D. Based on the weight of the fresh material, the viscera contained 0·0418 per cent provitamin D and the eviscerated body 0·0163 per cent. The total provitamin D content of the clams was found to be 0·019 per cent, and 24 per cent of the total provitamin D was in the viscera."

This yellow base gives colourless salts with acids, and further work has now confirmed the structures suggested by the above workers for the base and its salts."

It had been placed in 50/50 magnesium chloride (7 per cent) and sea water to relax it; and the escape of the air-bubble took place some twenty minutes later. Twenty minutes after return to sea water, the air-cavity was 60 per cent full of air again."

https://openalex.org/W4239465908,"THERE was a large and attentive audience, including participants from the Continent of Europe, at each session of the recent symposium upon ""Amino-Acids and Protein Hydrolysates ""organised by the Food Group of the Society of Chemical Industry. The symposium consisted of six papy-reading sessions held in the William Beyeridge Hall at the Senate House, University of London, and an exhibition of relevant equipment and techniques presented in the Physical Chemical Laboratory, Imperial College of Science and Technology, South Kensington. The symposium opened on the evening of September 28 with an introductory address by Prof. E. C. Dodds. Prof. H. D. Kay was in the chair. Prof. Dodds had been asked to introduce the subject of the symposium by providing, within the space of a little more than one hour, a reasonably elementary review of the chemistry and biochemistry of the amino-acids, and he fulfilled this task admirably. He reviewed the history, discovery, chemistry and the properties of amino-acids, and followed on to a discussion on methods of synthesis. He rounded off this section of his address by discussing the modern thiazolone method of synthesis in which, starting with hydrocyanic acid, formaldehyde and ammonium chloride, a series of operations easily conducted at room temperature leads to high yields."
https://openalex.org/W4247306378,"SINCE September 1947, the use of Western European languages in periodicals has ceased in the U.S.S.R. Prior to that time the lists of contents in many periodicals were translated into English, French and German, while some of the periodicals, such as the Journal of Physics, were published entirely in Western European languages. In attempts to make known the contents of Russian periodicals, many organisations have been translating contents lists for their own internal use. Recently, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research started a scheme for collecting these lists and publishing them at monthly intervals under the title of ""Translated Contents Lists of Russian Periodicals"". The first issue appeared in June 1949. The original typescripts are used to make rota-print plates photographically, and it may be partly due to this that the booklet appears to be more up to date than two similar publications appearing in the United States. About a hundred Russian scientific and technical periodicals are available for export to Great Britain, and the publication of the Department covers sortie seventy of these in all fields, including agriculture and medicine. Copies of the ""Translated Contents Lists of Russian Periodicals""are circulated free of charge to all co-operating organisations and, so far as the supply will permit, to other research organisations. If the demand becomes much greater, it may be necessary to charge for copies. A list of the periodicals not at present covered by the scheme is available, and anyone interested in helping to make this publication complete is invited to write to the Secretary, D.S.I.R. (Intelligence 1), Dorland House, 14-16 Regent Street, London, S.W.1."
https://openalex.org/W4247600440,"THOSE men of science who are familiar with the study of ""The Professions"" which Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders and Mr. P. A. Wilson gave in 1933 will welcome the survey of ""The English Middle Classes ""which Mr. R. Lewis and Mr. A. Maude have recently made*. While this new book does not diminish the need for a new edition of the earlier work, some of the changes in the professions which have occurred during the last sixteen years are reviewed and some of the new problems which have emerged are discussed, though in a wider context. Moreover, passages in the book are quite as pertinent to discussions on the recent report of the Royal Commission on Population or on the place of voluntary organisations in Britain to-day which the publication'of Lord Beveridge's ""Voluntary Action""and its supplementary volume have provoked. There are shrewd observations on education, on the Civil Service and on issues raised by the nationalization of industry, and no scientific worker who is concerned with the defence of freedom, whether in the universities or in its wider context in public and social life, can fail to read much of this book with deep interest and appreciation."
