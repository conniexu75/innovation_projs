https://openalex.org/W2149037769,"Claudins are the critical transmembrane proteins in tight junctions. Claudin-5, for instance, prevents paracellular permeation of small molecules. However, the molecular interaction mechanism is unknown. Hence, the claudin-claudin interaction and tight junction strand formation were investigated using systematic single mutations. Claudin-5 mutants transfected into tight junction-free cells demonstrated that the extracellular loop 2 is involved in strand formation via trans-interaction, but not via polymerization, along the plasma membrane of one cell. Three phenotypes were obtained: the tight junction type (wild-type-like trans- and cis-interaction; the disjunction type (blocked trans-interaction); the intracellular type (disturbed folding). Combining site-directed mutagenesis, live-cell imaging-, electron microscopy-, and molecular modeling data led to an antiparallel homodimer homology model of the loop. These data for the first time explain how two claudins hold onto each other and constrict the paracellular space. The intermolecular interface includes aromatic (F147, Y148, Y158) and hydrophilic (Q156, E159) residues. The aromatic residues form a strong binding core between two loops from opposing cells. Since nearly all these residues are conserved in most claudins, our findings are of general relevance for all classical claudins. On the basis of the data we have established a novel molecular concept for tight junction formation."

Sixty percent of the structural genes coding for these enzymes in the sporophyte were also found to be expressed by the gametophyte. All the genes tested were found to be expressed after meiosis, apparently transcribed and translated in the haploid gametophytes."
https://openalex.org/W2083732385,"The exostosin (EXT) family of genes encodes glycosyltransferases involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Five human members of this family have been cloned to date: EXT1, EXT2, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3. EXT1 and EXT2 are believed to form a Golgi-located hetero-oligomeric complex that catalyzes the chain elongation step in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, whereas the EXTL proteins exhibit overlapping glycosyl-transferase activities in vitro, so that it is not apparent what reactions they catalyze in vivo. We used gene-silencing strategies to investigate the roles of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 in heparan sulfate chain elongation. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against the human EXT1, EXT2, or EXTL3 mRNAs were introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Compared with cells transfected with control siRNA, those transfected with EXT1 or EXT2 siRNA synthesized shorter heparan sulfate chains, and those transfected with EXTL3 siRNA synthesized longer chains. We also generated human cell lines overexpressing the EXT proteins. Overexpression of EXT1 resulted in increased HS chain length, which was even more pronounced in cells coexpressing EXT2, whereas overexpression of EXT2 alone had no detectable effect on heparan sulfate chain elongation. Mutations in either EXT1 or EXT2 are associated with hereditary multiple exostoses, a human disorder characterized by the formation of cartilage-capped bony outgrowths at the epiphyseal growth plates. To further investigate the role of EXT2, we generated human cell lines overexpressing mutant EXT2. One of the mutations, EXT2-Y419X, resulted in a truncated protein. Interestingly, the capacity of wild type EXT2 to enhance HS chain length together with EXT1 was not shared by the EXT2-Y419X mutant.

Heparan sulfates (HSs) 4The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; EXT, exostosin; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HME, Hereditary Multiple Exostoses; NDST, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TI, transferase I; TII, transferase II; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. are sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) distributed on the cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrices of most tissues. HS chains are synthesized covalently linked to various proteins in a proteoglycan structure. HS proteoglycans have been implicated as regulators in a diverse number of biological events related to intracellular signaling, cell-cell interactions, and tissue morphogenesis (1Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Most of these activities depend on the binding of the negatively charged HS chains to a variety of molecules including members of the fibroblast growth factor family, serine protease inhibitors, and extracellular matrix proteins (2Lindahl U.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of HS is a complex process (reviewed in Refs. 2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 3Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

Chain elongation is initiated by the formation of a tetrasaccharide linkage region composed of glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-xylose (GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-), where Xyl is attached to a serine residue in the core protein (5Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). After the addition of a single GlcNAc residue by GlcNAc transferase I (GlcNAc-TI), elongation proceeds by the action of glycosyltransferases (GlcNAc-TII and GlcA-TII), which add β1,4-GlcA and α1,4-GlcNAc units in alternating sequence to the nonreducing end of the growing polymer (6Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The polymerization reactions are carried out by the exostosin proteins EXT1 and EXT2 (7McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 8Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K.

Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Concomitantly with chain elongation modification of the chain occurs, initiated by N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine units, carried out by the bifunctional enzyme N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST). These reactions occur in a more or less blockwise fashion and create stretches of N-sulfated regions and nonmodified N-acetylated domains, interspersed with short mixed regions (N-sulfated/N-acetylated domains) (10Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Twada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The N-deacetylation/N-sulfation reaction has been regarded as a key regulatory step because all subsequent modifications, epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid and various sulfation reactions, only occur in the vicinity of N-sulfate groups. However, NDST1-/-/NDST2-/- embryonic stem cells that completely lack N-sulfation are still able to produce 6-O-sulfated HS (12Holmborn K. Ledin J. Smeds E. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42355-42358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Subsequent modifications include C-5 epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid, 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acid, and 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylated and N-sulfated GlcN residues. In addition, a small number of N-sulfated d-glucosamine residues become O-sulfated at C-3, and a few GlcA units become O-sulfated at C-2. Five members of the EXT family of glycosyltransferases are known in humans: EXT1, EXT2, EXTL1 (for EXT-like 1), EXTL2, and EXTL3. Members of the EXT gene family encode glycosyltransferases that are suggested to be involved in HS biosynthesis, and most of the members seem to possess more than one in vitro glycosyl transferase activity (5Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 9Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). EXT1 and EXT2 appear to have dual enzyme activities, GlcA-TII and GlcNAc-TII, although those of EXT2 are weak and have been questioned. Even though EXT1 alone is able to polymerize the HS backbone structure in vitro, all evidence suggests that both EXT1 and EXT2 are necessary for chain elongation (13Busse M. Kusche-Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41333-41337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tanaka J. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41618-41623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All three EXTLs catalyze GlcNAc transferase reactions. EXTL1 adds GlcNAc to the nonreducing end of the growing polysaccharide (GlcNAc-TII activity); EXTL3 adds GlcNAc to the GAG protein linkage region (GlcNAc-TI activity) and to the growing chain (GlcNAc-TII activity), thus harboring enzyme activities involved in both the initiation and elongation of HS chains (15Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); and EXTL2, the shortest member of the EXT family, exhibits GlcNAc-TI activity (16Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The biological roles of EXTL1 and EXTL2 in HS biosynthesis have not yet been demonstrated, and in contrast to the other members of the EXT family, orthologs of the mammalian EXTL1 and EXTL2 are absent in Drosophila, suggesting that they are not essential for HS biosynthesis. Hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder, is one of the most common benign skeletal conditions affecting 1:100 000, with a risk for malignant transformation. The clinical signs are shorter stature and skeletal deformities caused by cartilage capped bony outgrowths at the epiphyseal end of the long bones (17Solomon L. J. Bone Jt. Surg. 1963; 45B: 292-304Crossref Google Scholar). The mechanism by which exostosis develops is poorly understood, but mutations in either EXT1 or EXT2 and the resulting reduction or absence of HS in the exostosis cartilage cap has been implicated in disturbed signaling response in exostosis chondrocytes (18Hecht J.T. Hall C.R. Snuggs M. Hayes E. Haynes R. Cole W.G. Bone. 2002; 31: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Hecht J.T. Hayes E. Haynes R. Cole W.G. Long R.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Carson D.D. Differentiation. 2005; 73: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A number of mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 have been reported in HME patients, and the majority of cases involve mutations in EXT1 (60-70% of the patients) (9Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Francannet C. Cohen-Tanugi A. Le Merrer M. Munnich A. Bonaventure J. Legeai-Mallet L. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mutations are randomly distributed over the entire EXT1 gene, whereas EXT2 mutations appear to be concentrated toward the N-terminal part of the protein. Most mutations result in premature termination of translation and loss of function. Less common are missense mutations affecting single amino acids. The amino acid substitutions are believed to alter the functional properties of the EXT proteins. However, although it is generally believed that the mutations result in abnormal HS synthesis, this is not always the case. Some of the reported EXT1 mutant proteins retain their ability to synthesize HS (21Cheung P.K. McCormick C. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Tufaro F. Duncan G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, we evaluated the contribution of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 to HS chain elongation by up-regulation of their expression by overexpression and down-regulation of their expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNA). We also analyzed the effect on HS synthesis of EXT2 with two different mutations found in HME patients. Gene Silencing with siRNA—Predesigned siRNAs for human EXT1 (5′-GGAUCAUCCCAGGACAGGA-3′;5′-GGAUUCCAGCGUGCACAUU-3′ and 5′-GGCUUAUUUUUCUUCAGUU-3′), EXT2 (5′-GGUGUAUAUCUAUGCUCUG-3′, 5′-CGUGUUUUGAUGUCUAUCG-3′, and 5′-GGAGACAGCACAAGCGAUG), EXTL3 (5′-GGCAGGCAAGCGGAUUUUU-3′;5′-GGCAAGCGGAUUUUUGGUC-3′ and 5′-GGUCUCUUCCUUACCCUUU-3′), and complement C1r (control siRNA, 5′-GGCUGCUUCUAUGAUUAUG-3′) were purchased from Ambion. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the siRNAs (50 nm of each) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 24 h the transfection was repeated, and the cells were cultured at 37 °C for another 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum with 200 μCi/ml Na 352SO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 50 μCi/ml [6-3H]glucosamine HCl (Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled GAGs were isolated after trypsin treatment as described below. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells transiently transfected with siEXT1, siEXT2, siEXTL3, or control siRNA using RNeasy Mini prep kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using random primers (iScript cDNA synthesis kit; Bio-Rad). Quantification of mRNA expression was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit (Roche Applied Science) and Light-Cycler instrument (Roche Applied Science). The primers were selected using PrimerBank (pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) (22Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The primers used were: EXT1 forward, 5′-GCTCTTGTCTCGCCCTTTTGT-3′ and reverse 5′-TGGTGCAAGCCATTCCTACC-3′; EXT2 forward, 5′-AAGCACCAGGTCTTCGATTACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAAGTACGCTTCCCAGAACCA-3′; and EXTL3 forward, 5′-CGCTCATCGCCCACTATTACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGTTCAGCTCTTGGCGCTT-3′. cDNAs were normalized against transcript levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward primer, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′). Each primer/cDNA set was performed in duplicate with cDNAs from three different transfections. Data analysis was performed using the ΔΔCT method (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Plasmids and Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—A cDNA corresponding to the full-length mouse EXT1 or EXT2 open reading frame was amplified from a mouse brain Quick-clone cDNA library (Clontech) using the following primers for EXT1: sense primer, 5′-CTCTTGACCCAGGCAGGAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGCTTCCTCAAAGTCGTTCA-3′; and for EXT2: sense primer, 5′-GAGGACGAGGACACCTGTTT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGGAGGTGCGGCAAGC-3′. The amplified product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced. The EXT1 and EXT2 cDNAs were inserted, either separately or together, into the pBudCE4.1 expression vector (Invitrogen), adopted for double insertions. Mutant bases were introduced into EXT2 cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EXT2-D227N point mutation was constructed using forward primer 5′-CTTACCGGCAGGGCTACAATGTCAGCATTCCTG-3′ and complementary reverse primer 5′-CAGGAATGCTGACATTGTAGCCCTGCCGGTAAG-3′. The EXT2-Y419X deletion mutant was generated using forward primer 5′-ATCAATGACAGGATCTAACCATATGCAGCCATCTCC-3′ and complementary reverse primer 5′-GGAGATGGCTGCATATGGTTAGATCCTGTCATTGAT-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined and in bold). The wild type and mutated inserts were excised with EcoRI and subcloned into the corresponding site of the pcDNA-3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids with inserts containing the coding region in 5′ to 3′ direction were selected by sequencing. A truncated, soluble form of human EXTL3, lacking the first 51 amino acids, was amplified using a human placenta cDNA (Clontech) with the primers 5′-ATATGCGGCCGCAACCACTCTGGATGAG (forward) and 5′-GGGCTCTAGAGATGAACTTGAAGCACTTGGT (reverse), and the PCR products were cloned in-frame with the preprotrypsin leader sequence and the N-terminal 3-FLAG tag p3XFLAGCMV9 expression vector (Sigma). The truncated forms of EXT1 and EXT2 were as described (13Busse M. Kusche-Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41333-41337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant expression constructs were stably or transiently transfected into HEK cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable clones expressing the EXT1, EXT2, and EXT1/EXT2 expression constructs and control clones transfected with vector alone (pcDNA-3 or pBudCE4.1) were selected as described (24Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 463-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selected cellular clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) complemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin G-streptomycin, 1% Fungizone (2.5 IU/ml), and Geneticin (G418 sulfate) (pcDNA-3) or zeosin (pBudCE4.1) at concentrations of 400 and 200 μg/ml, respectively. Metabolic Labeling, Isolation, and Analysis of HS Chains from Cell Culture—Subconfluent transfected cell cultures were incubated with 200 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate or 50 μCi/ml [6-3H]glucosamine HCl for the time periods indicated in the text. After incubation at 37 °C the medium was removed and frozen for future use, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C, and the cell suspensions were centrifuged. The supernatants were collected and treated with 0.5 m NaOH at 4 °C overnight to release the O-linked saccharides from the protein core. The samples were applied to 300-μl DEAE-Sephacel columns, equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100. The columns were washed with 10 bed volumes of 1) the equilibration buffer; 2) 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100; 3) 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl; or 4) H2O. The GAGs were finally eluted with 2 m NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. Galactosaminoglycans were digested with chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm sodium acetate and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the reaction mixtures were separated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 0.5 m NH4HCO3. HS was digested with heparitinase I and II (Seikagagu) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm sodium acetate and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. To isolate cellular HS, the cells were solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 10 μg of pepstatin/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant containing the radiolabeled proteoglycans was recovered and isolated by DEAE anion exchange chromatography. After desalting on PD-10 columns (Sephadex G-25) (Amersham Biosciences), GAG chains were released from the peptide cores and isolated using PD-10 gel filtration columns eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. The samples were digested with chondroitinase ABC and analyzed as described above. For analysis of medium-derived HS chains, NaOH to a final concentration of 0.5 m was added to the medium. After 24 h at 4 °C the medium was neutralized and diluted to a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl. Sulfated GAG chains were isolated on 500-μl DEAE-Sephacel columns essentially as described above. Compositional Analysis of Labeled HS—Labeled HS chains were depolymerized with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by reduction with NaBH4 (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The labeled deamination products were fractionated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-15 (1 × 180 cm) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions corresponding to oligo- and disaccharides were collected and desalted by lyophilization. Labeled disaccharides were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC using a Whatman Partisil 10-SAX column eluted with aqueous KH2PO4 of stepwise increasing concentration at a rate of 1 ml/min (26Smeds E. Habuchi H. Do A.T. Hjertson E. Grundberg H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 371-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferase Assays—GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities were measured essentially as described (13Busse M. Kusche-Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41333-41337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GlcNAc-T activities of crude cell extracts were determined by incubating 60-90 μg of lysate protein with 0.125 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and 50 μg of [GlcA-GlcNAc]n oligosaccharide (the reducing terminal sugar is modified to an 2,5-anhydromannitol unit). After 1 h at 37 °C, the mixtures were applied to columns (28 × 0.5 cm) of Sephadex G-25 in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Effluent fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting. GlcA-T activities were assayed in similar fashion, except that UDP-[14C]GlcA was used as a sugar donor, and GlcNAc-[GlcA-GlcNAc]n oligosaccharides were used as acceptors. Immunofluorescence—For immunocytochemical analysis, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids on coverslips as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min in room temperature, and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The cells were then incubated with the polyclonal primary antibodies, goat anti EXT2-N15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the Golgi marker mouse-anti GM130 (BD Biosciences, provided by Dr. Jaakko Saraste, University of Bergen) at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:200, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. They were then rinsed three times in PBS and further incubated for 2 h with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG, respectively. Finally, they were mounted in VectaShield with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). The images were visualized under a Zeiss Axioscope microscope equipped with optics for observing fluorescence and captured using a digital AxioCam MRm camera. siRNA-mediated Silencing of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3—To investigate the role of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 in HS chain elongation, we transiently transfected HEK 293 cells with siRNA targeting EXT1 (siEXT1), EXT2 (siEXT2), EXTL3 (siEXTL3), and complement C1r (control siRNA). As determined by real time PCR, the respective EXT mRNA expression levels were reduced to ≤10% of that of the control siRNA-treated cells. The cells transfected with either siEXT1 or siEXT2 exhibited decreased GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities relative to the control siRNA-transfected cells. By contrast, treatment of cells with EXTL3 siRNA exhibited slightly increased transferase activities (Fig. 1). We were interested to determine whether there was a possible coregulation of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 at the mRNA level. Therefore, we also examined whether silencing of EXT1, EXT2, or EXTL3 would affect the transcript levels of the other EXTs examined. Analysis by real time PCR revealed no detectable effect of silencing of one EXT on the mRNA levels of the other EXTs (data not shown). Effect of siRNA-mediated Silencing of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 on HS Chain Length—To investigate the effect of siRNA on HS synthesis, HEK 293 cells transiently silenced with siEXT1, siEXT2, siEXTL3, or the control siRNA were metabolically labeled for 24 h with [35S]sulfate or [3H]glucosamine. Proteoglycans were isolated from the cell surface/matrix and from the culture medium, and the GAGs were released from the core proteins. The cells transfected with EXTL3 siRNA displayed an increased chain length, and those transfected with EXT1 and EXT2 siRNA produced HS chains that were shorter than those synthesized by the control cells (Fig. 2). siEXT1 and siEXT2 cells labeled with [3H]glucosamine exhibited a ∼50% lower HS/chondroitin sulfate ratio relative to the control transfected cells, whereas the ratio in siEXTL3 cells was largely unaffected. Interestingly, the effect of reduced EXT1 or EXT2 mRNA levels on HS chain elongation is analogous to our previous findings regarding HS produced by mouse embryonic fibroblasts carrying a hypomorphic mutation in EXT1 so that they still contained small amounts of normal EXT1 transcript (27Yamada S.

The mutant cells produce about 18% HS compared with wild type cells, and the mutations mainly affect HS chain length, although some reduction in the number of chains may also have occurred (27Yamada S.

Effect of siRNA-mediated Silencing of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 on HS Domain Organization—For structural analysis we selected 3H samples with more than 90% reduction in their mRNA levels (as determined by real time PCR) and with a marked effect on HS chain length. The various samples were treated with chondroitinase ABC to degrade any galactosaminoglycans present in the samples. Chondroitinase ABC-resistant labeled polysaccharides were isolated, and the N-substitution patterns of HS from siRNA-treated cells were analyzed by treatment of [3H]glucosamine-labeled polysaccharides with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 that results in cleavage of the chains at the sites of N-sulfated glucosamine units. Under these conditions, N-acetylated units remain intact. Contiguous N-sulfated sequences will be degraded to disaccharides, whereas alternating N-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine residues will give rise to tetrasaccharides. Spaced sequences with solitary N-sulfate groups will yield oligosaccharides of at least hexasaccharide size. The gel chromatography profiles of the products revealed very similar disposition of the sulfated regions with a range of differently sized saccharide fragments (Fig. 3). However, it was noted that the silencing of EXT1 and EXT2 resulted in more pronounced peaks of ∼26-mers and larger oligosaccharides than HS from control cells. Detailed information regarding the distribution of O-sulfate groups was obtained by analysis of the disaccharides generated by low pH HNO2/NaBH4 treatment of 3H-labeled HS fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resultant disaccharides were separated by anion exchange HPLC into different O-sulfated species. There was a small increase 6-O-sulfated disaccharides in siEXT2 and siEXTL3 HS compared with the control (Table 1).TABLE 1Disaccharide composition within the N-sulfated domains of [3H]GlcN-labeled HS from siControl, siEXT1, siEXT2, and siEXTL3 transfected cells [3H]GlcN-labeled HS were degraded to disaccharides (deamination at pH 1.5 followed by reduction of products with NaBH4) that were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”).Deamination productsCell typesiControlsiEXT1siEXT2siEXTL3% of total disaccharidesGlcA/IdoA-aManRaaManR, the 2,5-anhydromannitol deamination products of N-sulfated d-glucosamine residues; IdoA, iduronic acid1011810GlcA(2S)-aManR1111GlcA-aManR(6S)10111813IdoA-aManR(6S)4476IdoA(2S)-aManR57564747IdoA(2S)-aManR(6S)18161923a aManR, the 2,5-anhydromannitol deamination products of N-sulfated d-glucosamine residues; IdoA, iduronic acid Open table in a new tab Effect of Overexpression of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 on HS Chain Length—We next investigated the effect of overexpression of EXT1 and EXT2 on HS chain length. HEK 293 cells were stably transfected with the vector alone (mock), EXT1, EXT2, or coexpressed EXT1 and EXT2 (EXT1/EXT2). The specific GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities of the EXT1 overexpressing cells expressed on a cellular protein basis were increased compared with the activities obtained for mock transfected cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar to previous observations (8Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M.

Mock transfected, EXT1, EXT2, and EXT1/EXT2 overexpressing cells were metabolically [35S]sulfate-labeled for 60 min, and cell-associated 35S-labeled HS proteoglycans were isolated by gel chromatography on Superose 6, and the HS chains were released from the core protein by alkali treatment (28Sandbäck Pikas, D., Eriksson, I., and Kjellén, L.

We used a microfiberoptic epifluorescence photobleaching method to determine the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in macromolecule diffusion deep in tumor tissue. In subcutaneous B16 tumors in living mice, translational diffusion of 10 kDa FITC-dextran was slowed 2- to 3-fold (compared with its diffusion in water) within a depth of 0.2 mm from the tumor surface, but >10-fold beyond a depth of 1 mm. Diffusion of larger macromolecules, FITC-albumin and 500 kDa FITC-dextran, was slowed by up to 40-fold at 0.5 mm and 300-fold at 2 mm. Intratumoral collagenase (to digest collagen) or cathepsin C (to digest decorin) each increased diffusion of 10 kDa FITC-dextran by approximately 2-fold. However, these treatments dramatically increased diffusion (>10-fold) of larger macromolecules, such as 500 kDa dextran, in deep tumor (2 mm depth). Intratumoral hyaluronidase, in contrast, slowed diffusion throughout the tumor. In vitro measurements in defined gel-like mixtures of collagen, hyaluronan, and decorin closely recapitulated results in tumors in vivo. Mathematical modeling quantified the roles of extracellular space volume fraction and dimensions, and indicated a substantial effect of cell density on diffusion in deep tumor. Our data define the determinants of diffusion in deep tumor and suggest collagen and decorin digestion to greatly facilitate macromolecule delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1968279100,Major features of the daily surface pressure oscillations observed by the Viking landers during the two great dust storms on Mars in 1977 can be explained in terms of the classical atmospheric tidal theory developed for the earth's atmosphere. The most dramatic exception is the virtual disappearance of only the diurnal tide at Viking Lander 1 just before the second storm. This disappearance is attributed to destructive interference between the usually westward-traveling tide and an eastward-traveling diurnal Kelvin mode generated by orographically induced differential heating. The continuing Viking Lander 1 pressure measurements can be used with the model to monitor future great dust storms.

https://openalex.org/W2006007524,"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitously expressed family of thiol peroxidases that reduce hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and hydroperoxides using a highly conserved cysteine. There is substantial evidence that oxidative stress elicited by amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is a causative factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we show that Aβ-resistant PC12 cell lines exhibit increased expression of multiple Prx isoforms with reduced cysteine oxidation. Aβ-resistant PC12 cells also display higher levels of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, two enzymes critical for maintaining Prx activity. PC12 cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons transfected with wild type Prx1 exhibit increased Aβ resistance, whereas mutant Prx1, lacking a catalytic cysteine, confers no protection. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes sulfinylated and sulfonylated Prxs, it is demonstrated that primary rat cortical nerve cells exposed to Aβ display a time-dependent increase in cysteine oxidation of the catalytic site of Prxs that can be blocked by the addition of the thiol-antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In support of previous findings, expression of Prx1 is higher in post-mortem human AD cortex tissues than in age-matched controls. In addition, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Prx2 exists in a more oxidized state in AD brains than in control brains. These findings suggest that increased Prx expression and resistance to sulfhydryl oxidation in Aβ-resistant nerve cells is a compensatory response to the oxidative stress initiated by chronic pro-oxidant Aβ exposure.

(1Butterfield D.A. Griffin S. Munch G. Pasinetti G.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). AD, the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by extracellular neuritic plaques containing the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide1–42 and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed mainly of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Several studies have shown that Aβ exposure increases levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation (carbonylation) in cultured neurons (2Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 3Aksenov M.Y. Aksenova M.V. Markesbery W.R. Butterfield D.A. J. Mol.

Increased oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, and proteins is also found in AD brains (1Butterfield D.A. Griffin S. Munch G. Pasinetti G.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the exogenous addition of antioxidants or catalase protects cultured nerve cells from Aβ toxicity (2Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 5Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Klier F.G. Schubert D. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that free radicals play a critical role in Aβ cytotoxicity. Therefore, cellular mechanisms that either prevent or remove reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reverse damage to cellular components after ROS exposure may play a key role in blocking Aβ toxicity. Although widespread nerve cell death occurs in the brains of AD patients, some neurons are spared, indicating that certain populations of cells survive the same conditions that kill neighboring cells. Early studies had shown that low concentrations of Aβ can actually rescue neurons from stressful conditions (6Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Aβ resistance is only poorly understood. Previously, a series of Aβ-resistant clones was derived from the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 by growth for 4 months in the presence of high concentrations Aβ and subsequent cloning (2Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 5Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Klier F.G. Schubert D. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ-resistant nerve cell clones not only survive exposure to toxic concentrations of Aβ but are also less sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and t-butyl-H2O2, in part due to increased expression and activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and catalase (2Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 5Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Klier F.G. Schubert D. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that Aβ-resistant nerve cells also have an enhanced flux of glucose through both the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (7Soucek T. Cumming R. Dargusch R. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As a result of enhanced glycolysis and PPP activity, Aβ-resistant cells produce higher levels of reducing equivalents such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH is essential for maintaining glutathione and thioredoxin (Trx) in a reduced state through reactions catalyzed by glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), respectively (8Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Both the glutathione and TrxR systems are essential for maintaining intracellular protein sulfhydryls in a reduced state. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a widely expressed group of peroxidases that reduce H2O2, peroxynitrite, and a range of organic hydroperoxides using reducing equivalents provided by the Trx/TrxR system (9Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that Prxs can also mediate signal transduction processes elicited by various growth factors and cytokines (10Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Yang K.S. Woo H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Prxs, which exist as homodimers (with the exception of Prx6), use redox-active cysteines to reduce peroxides and are divided into two classes, the 1-Cys and 2-Cys Prxs, based upon the number of conserved cysteines involved in catalysis (9Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Typical 2-Cys Prxs, the largest class of Prxs, undergo a catalytic cycle in which the N-terminal cysteine (generally near residue 50) is oxidized by H2O2 to a cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) that then reacts with the C-terminal cysteine (near residue 170) of another subunit to produce an intermolecular disulfide. This disulfide is then reduced by the Trx/TrxR system, completing the catalytic cycle. Formation of the disulfide bond is a slow process, and the sulfenic intermediate is occasionally hyperoxidized to a sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) or even a sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H), resulting in inactivation of Prx peroxidase activity (11Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to a Cys-SO2H in Prxs 1–4 is reversed by a reaction catalyzed by sulfiredoxin (12Woo H.A. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Park K.J. Park S.J. Yang J.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). No mechanism of sulfinic acid reduction in Prx5 and Prx6 isoforms has yet been identified. Moreover, over-oxidation of all Prx isoforms to a Cys-SO3H state is irreversible. Of the six known mammalian Prx isoforms, Prx1–4 belong to the typical 2-Cys class, and Prx5 is an atypical 2-Cys that forms an intramolecular disulfide as part of its catalytic cycle (9Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Prx6 belongs to the 1-Cys class which possesses only one catalytic cysteine. Oxidized Prx6 (Cys-SOH) is either directly reduced by ascorbate (13Monteiro G. Horta B.B. Pimenta D.C. Augusto O. Netto L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4886-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or via a reaction catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase π (14Ralat L.A. Manevich Y. Fisher A.B. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Prx1, Prx2, and Prx6 are found mainly in the cytosol, Prx3 is found in mitochondria, and Prx4 is a secreted protein (9Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Prx5 is localized to the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (15Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Initial studies examining Prx1 and Prx2 expression in human brain revealed that Prx1 was expressed primarily in astrocytes, whereas Prx2 was expressed exclusively in neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and spinal cord. A more recent immunohistochemical study in mouse brain revealed cytoplasmic expression of Prx2–5 in neurons throughout multiple regions of the brain (16Jin M.H. Lee Y.H. Kim J.M. Sun H.N. Moon E.Y. Shong M.H. Kim S.U. Lee S.H. Lee T.H. Yu D.Y. Lee D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 381: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prx1 and Prx6 expression was detected in microglia and astrocytes. respectively. These findings suggest that the varied distribution of Prx isoforms in the brain may serve distinct roles that may reflect the different functions and biochemical activities of their host cells. Several studies have shown that Prx expression is elevated in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (17Krapfenbauer K. Engidawork E. Cairns N. Fountoulakis M. Lubec G. Brain Res. 2003; 967: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Basso M. Giraudo S. Corpillo D. Bergamasco B. Lopiano L. Fasano M.

Acta Neuropathol. (Berl). 2005; 110: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if increased Prx expression in these diseases occurs as a general response to nerve cell death or is a protective mechanism elicited by disease-specific stimuli. Here we show that nerve cells selected for Aβ-resistance exhibit increased expression of specific Prx isoforms that are less susceptible to oxidative inactivation. Transfection of Prx1 in either PC12 cells or primary hippocampal neurons confers increases resistance to Aβ. Exposure of rat cortical primary neurons to Aβ causes a time-dependent increase in Prx oxidation that is countered by a thiol-specific antioxidant. In addition, cortical tissue from post-mortem AD patients exhibits increased expression of Prx1, whereas Prx2 exists in a more oxidized (acidic) form in AD brains. These findings suggest that increased Prx expression and the ability to maintain Prxs in a reduced state is part of a specific neuroprotective mechanism that occurs in response to Aβ accumulation. Understanding these mechanisms of Aβ resistance may be important for designing therapies to increase both the antioxidant and reductive capacity of nerve cells in AD patients. Culture Conditions and Experimental Treatment—The PC12 clonal cell line, their Aβ-resistant derivatives, and their culture conditions have been previously described (2Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 5Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Klier F.G. Schubert D. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat primary cortical and hippocampal cultures were prepared and cultured under standard conditions (21Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). For Aβ treatment, a stock solution (0.5 mm) of the Aβ1–42 peptide (Bachem) was freshly prepared in distilled water and allowed to form fibrils for 4 h at room temperature before the addition to cell culture media. Primary cultures were treated with 10 μm Aβ1–42 peptide for various time periods as indicated. In some cases primary cultures were co-treated with 1 mm N-acetylcysteine (Sigma). Expression constructs containing FLAG-tagged versions of both wild type and cysteine mutant (C52S) Prx cDNAs were generously supplied by Dr. Hyunjung Ha (Chungbuk National University, Cheonju Korea). PC12 cells and primary cultures were seeded in 35-mm dishes at 5 × 105 and 2 × 106 cells/dish, respectively, and co-transfected with either pcDNA or FLAG-tagged Prx expression constructs along with an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at a 3:1 molar ratio for a total of 4 μg of DNA per dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free media. Plasmid DNA was mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) added to PC12 cell cultures, and 6 h later the transfection media was replaced with regular media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary hippocampal neurons were transfected based on a protocol optimized for transfecting this cell type (22Ohki E.C. Tilkins M.L. Ciccarone V.C. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 112: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, plasmid DNA was mixed with 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM media (500 μl total volume) and allowed to form a complex for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-Lipofectamine complex was then added to the primary hippocampal culture, and after 6 h the transfection media was replaced with Neurobasal media with B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm l-glutamine. Transfection efficiencies were ∼70 and 20% for PC12 and primary hippocampal neurons, respectively. One day after transfection, 20 μm Aβ1–42 peptide was added to the experimental dishes, and cell viability was determined at 24-h intervals. Twenty random fields of cells transfected with the Prx constructs (∼500 cells total) were scored for green fluorescence at 400× magnification using a Leica DMIRB microscope equipped with a mercury lamp and appropriate filters. Cell viability was assessed by comparing the average number of green positive cells after Aβ treatment versus no treatment. Cell viability data were based on the average of three separate experiments. Immunoblotting—After exposure to various oxidative stimuli, ∼1 × 106 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in ice-cold PBS with 40 mm iodoacetamide for 5 min to prevent thiol-disulfide exchange and inhibit post-lysis oxidation of free cysteines. These cells were harvested in 0.1 ml of digitonin extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.015% (w/v) digitonin, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mm iodoacetamide) followed by rocking on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 2500 × g, extracts were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). After the addition of an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 4% β-mercaptoethanol) protein extracts (20 μg) were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE precast gels (Bio-Rad) electroblotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked with 1% milk, 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Blots were hybridized with antibodies against Prx-specific isoforms, Trx-1 (Lab-Frontier, Seoul, Korea), thioredoxin reductase 1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), FLAG, or actin (Sigma) overnight and, after washing, were further hybridized with appropriate horseradish peroxidate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Detection was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric Analysis—Western blots were scanned using a GS-800 calibrated densitometer equipped with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Gel bands were scanned three times and normalized to actin. In studies using cell lines, the densitometric values from three separate experiments were averaged. For protein expression studies using human post-mortem brain samples, densitometric values were normalized to actin, and then the total values for both the control and AD sample sets were averaged. Brain Tissue—Autopsied brain samples were obtained from Dr. Carol Miller at the Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Los Angeles, CA. All tissue samples were removed from the same area of the mid-frontal cortex and immediately quick-frozen. AD cases and controls were matched pairwise for age, sex, and in most cases post-mortem time. All AD patients had a clinical history of dementia, and histological analysis of mid-frontal cortex samples revealed plaque density scores in the low to frequent range according to The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease criterion (1 = sparse, 1–5; 3 = moderate, 6–20; 5 = frequent, 21–30 or above).

Tissue protein extracts (20 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Because the type and amount of proteins vary dramatically with the growth state of cultured cells (23Garrels J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7961-7977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), care was taken to grow and plate cells under identical conditions where comparisons of protein content were to be made. Exponentially dividing cultures were dissociated and replated at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture plate. The next day 10 μm Aβ1–42 was added, and 24 h later the cells were harvested for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 0.5 ml of 8 m urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 40 mm Tris, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3–10 ampholytes (Bio-Rad), and 50 mm dithiothreitol were added to the plate, and the cells were scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. DNase1/RNase (100/50 μg/ml) was added to the lysate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g, the protein amount was determined, and 300 μg of supernatant was loaded onto pH 4–7 isoelectric focusing strips (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed to 60,000 V-h on a Bio-Rad Protean isoelectric focusing machine. The strip was then applied to the top of an 18-cm Bio-Rad precast 12% acrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 25 milliamps per gel until the dye front was at the bottom of the gel. Gels were fixed in 50% methanol overnight and silver stained according to the method of Shevchenko et al. (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7814) Google Scholar). Gel spots from two-dimensional gels were excised, in-gel-digested with trypsin (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7814) Google Scholar), and analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Briefly, samples were loaded onto a fused silica capillary column (PicoFrit Column, New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed with reversed phase material (Zorbax C-18, 5-μm particle size, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The mobile phase consisted of aqueous 0.1% formic acid (A buffer) and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile/water (B buffer). Elution was achieved by a gradient of 5 to 70% B buffer in 65 min at a flow rate of 150 nl/min. The eluant was electrosprayed into a Bruker Esquire 3000 Plus quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Spectra were measured for the three most intense species in each time window. For each mass, MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded. After two sets of spectra, the parent mass was excluded for 1 min. The complete data set for each gel spot was searched using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK) against a recent release of the non-redundant NCBI data base. Only results that gave significant Mascot scores were reported. Statistical Analysis—Changes in protein expression levels or cell viability were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc testing using GraphPad InStat software. A p value <0.05 was considered significantly significant. Aβ-Resistant PC12 Cells Display Increased Prx Levels—Previous studies have shown that Aβ-resistant clonal populations of PC12 nerve cells are resistant to multiple forms of oxidative stress (2Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 5Sagara Y. Dargusch R. Klier F.G. Schubert D. Behl C. J.

Although part of this resistance is attributable to an up-regulation of antioxidant and glycolytic enzymes, the full repertoire of differentially expressed proteins in Aβ-resistant cells has not been examined. We, therefore, compared protein profiles between an Aβ-resistant clone (PC12r7) and its parental cell line (PC12) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis to identify other proteins that may contribute to Aβ resistance. The range of proteins that displayed the most dramatic differences in abundance and pI focused between pH 5.3 and 6.5 with a molecular mass between 15 and 50 kDa. Among this subset of proteins ∼26 spots were identified that varied between the sensitive and resistant cells (Fig. 1). In agreement with earlier work (7Soucek T. Cumming R. Dargusch R. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a number of glycolytic enzymes (Table 2) were up-regulated in the PC12r7 clone. Essentially identical results were obtained with another resistant clone, PC12r1. When PC12 cells were transiently exposed to 10 μm Aβ1–42, the same group of enzymes was up-regulated including triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, α-enolase, and aldolase A (Table 2). In addition, several antioxidant proteins were also elevated in the resistant and Aβ-treated cells including biliverdin reductase and Prx6.TABLE 2MS identification of proteins in PC12 control, PC12r7, and PC12 cells treated with AβSpot no.PC12PC12r7AβProtein nameAccession no.Molecular massMascot scorePeptideskDa1↓+-Heat shock protein 2720466522,8791313↓+-Ribosomal protein S121392899214,2591052↓+-NDPK25592614517,2726622↓+-Histone H2B47767613,8511785↓+-Ub-conj. enzyme E2N1675881017,1136413↓+↓Histone 13006139113,9842119↓+↓Phosphoglycerate mutase type b824881928,8281684↓+↓Ribosomal protein S205609027113,3641334↓+↓Ub-conj. enzyme E2N1675881017,11310824++↓Ub-conj. enzyme E2N1675881017,1131114++↓Ribosomal protein S196266137115,782662++↓Histone H2B47767613,8516425-+-Ran/TC4-binding protein73924123,568952-+-Ribosomal protein S196266137115,782923-+-Histone 13006139113,984602-+-Ribosomal protein S121392899214,259582-+-Ub-conj. enzyme E2N1675881017,1135126+↓↓Cu,Zn SOD20701215,7002737+↓↓Ub-conj. enzyme E2N1675881017,11310347+↓+Stmn13832824217,27834588-++Ca2+-regulated heat-stable protein2275814215,8968959-+-Transgelin 26155702822,3792064-+-αB-Crystallin5758019,945190510↓++Peroxiredoxin 61675834824,803392911++↓Peroxiredoxin 61675834824,8032806++↓Peroxiredoxin 31196813228,3031062++↓Heat shock protein 2720466522,879169412+↓↓Peroxiredoxin 31196813228,3032832+↓↓Lysophospholipase 2724215624,77866113+-↓Heat shock protein 2720466522,8793158+-↓Ubiquitin thiolesterase9293424,754228614+↓+Heat shock protein 2720466522,87949614+↓+Peroxiredoxin 61675834824,80385215+↑+Bilverdin reductase1387928622,1833086+↑+Peroxiredoxin 61675834824,8031135+↑+Transketolase1201825267,64483216+-+Stmn13832824217,2781974+-+Lysophospholipase 2724215624,77854217-+-Triosephosphate isomerase 11262107426,904332918+↓+Triosephosphate isomerase 11262107426,9041795+↓+Peroxiredoxin 61675834824,803110419-+-α-Enolase5092683347,0984911120+-↓Proteasome 28 subunit a6109821428,6172385+-↓Heat shock protein 2720466522,879122321+--Heat shock protein 2720466522,8793387+--Ubiquitin thiolesterase9293424,754166522+↑↓Aldolase A697848739,327294523+-+Heat shock protein 2720466522,87933124+↓+Aldolase A697848739,32755613+↓+α-Enolase5092683347,098106425+↓↓Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase5618835,813148626+-↓Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase5618835,813602+-↓Acat25403534141,10847127+--Heat shock protein 2720466522,879742 Open table in a new tab Curiously, Prx6 was identified in five different locations in the gels (Fig. 1).

Because multiple proteins can reside in the same spot and mask the relative protein abundance of Prx isoforms on silver-stained two-dimensional gels, we examined expression levels of all six Prx isoforms in lysates from both parental and Aβ-resistant PC12 cell lines by immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies. Although the same amount of protein per lane was loaded, all Prx levels were also standardized against an actin loading control. As expected, PC12-resistant clones displayed elevated"

The normal biological function of β-amyloid is also unknown. We used phage display, co-precipitation, and mass spectrometry to examine the protein-protein interactions of β-amyloid in normal rabbit brain in order to identify the biochemical receptors for β-amyloid. β-Amyloid was found to bind primarily to proteins involved in low density lipoprotein and cholesterol transport and metabolism, including sortilin, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment 2 (ERGIC2), ERGIC-53, steroid 5α-reductase, and apolipoprotein B. β-Amyloid also bound to the C-reactive protein precursor, a protein involved in inflammation, and to 14-3-3, a protein that regulates glycogen synthase kinase-3β, the kinase involved in tau phosphorylation. Of eight synthetic peptides identified as targets of β-amyloid, three were found to be effective blockers of the toxic effect of β-amyloid on cultured neuronal cells. These peptides bound to the hydrophobic region (residues 17–21) or to the nearby protein kinase C pseudo-phosphorylation site (residues 26–30) of β-amyloid, suggesting that these may be the most critical regions for β-amyloid effector action and for aggregation. Peptides or other small molecules that bind to this region may protect against β-amyloid toxic effect by competitively blocking its ability to bind β-amyloid effector proteins such as sortilin and 14-3-3. β-Amyloid peptide produces apoptosis in neurons at micromolar concentrations, but the mechanism by which β-amyloid exerts its toxic effect is unknown.

Transgenic animals expressing human Aβ exhibit many of the pathologies of Alzheimer disease (AD), including cognitive deficits (17Higgins G.A. Kim H. Behav.

APP is transported from the ER and Golgi to the cell surface membrane (19Caporaso G.L. Kim K. Gandy S.E. Matteoli M. Mundigl O. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3122-3128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it may be cleaved by α-secretase. Protein kinase C-activated α-secretases also reside in the trans-Golgi network (20Skovronsky D.M.

Uncleaved APP is then internalized into endocytic compartments, where it is cleaved by β- and γ-secretase to produce Aβ (21Steinhilb M.L. Kim R.S. Gaut J.R. J.

Biol. 1994; 161: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and cell adhesion (48Small D.H. Kim H.L. Williamson T.G. Reed G. Key B. Mok S.S. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Nurcombe V. J. Alzheimers Dis. 1999; 1: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, both APP and Aβ may play an important role in normal synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth. The Aβ peptide is not only produced in AD but has also been found in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of normal patients (49Seubert P. Kim C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The production and secretion of Aβ is regulated by neuronal activity (50Kamenetz F. Kim T. Hsieh H. Seabrook G. Borchelt D. Iwatsubo T. Sisodia S. Malinow R. Neuron. 2003; 37: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Kamenetz et al. (50Kamenetz F. Kim T. Hsieh H. Seabrook G. Borchelt D. Iwatsubo T. Sisodia S. Malinow R. Neuron. 2003; 37: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) found that APP reversibly depresses synaptic transmission by a mechanism mediated by activation of APP cleavage by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. This suggests that Aβ is normally produced by neurons and has one or more functions in normal cells. To identify the biochemical pathways in which Aβ participates, we performed phage display screenings and co-precipitation experiments to identify the binding partners of Aβ in normal rabbit brain. We also examined the ability of peptides based on these binding partners to block the toxic effects of Aβ.Aβ was found to interact with apolipoprotein B and the C-reactive protein precursor, the transporter proteins sortilin, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 2 (ERGIC2), and ERGIC-53, and the regulatory proteins 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3γ. Peptides based on these binding regions were effective blockers of Aβ toxicity. Materials—5′-Nucleotidase was purchased from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphodiesterases 3A and 3B were obtained from EMD Biosciences (San Diego CA). Antibodies against 14-3-3β, -δ, -γ, and -η were obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-ERGIC2 was obtained from Aviva Systems Biology (San Diego, CA). Kidins antibody was obtained from Orbigen (San Diego, CA). Sortilin antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Other antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All β-amyloid and β-amyloid derivatives were purchased from Anaspec (San Jose, CA). UltraLink protein A and protein G-agarose, sequencing grade trypsin, and Pro-Ject protein transduction reagent were purchased from Pierce. Caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-amidomethylcoumarin) was purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Rabbit and mouse brains were obtained from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR). Culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—Rat hippocampal H19-7/IGF-IR cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated plates and grown at 35 °C in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum for several days until ≈50% coverage was obtained. The cells were then induced to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype by replacing the medium with 5 ml of N2 medium containing 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor at 39 °C and grown in T-75 flasks at 37 °C. β-Amyloid Oligomerization—Human Aβ (Anaspec 20276, 1 mg) was dissolved in 3 ml of deionized water by the addition of a minimum volume of 1% ammonium hydroxide and was incubated for 3 days at 37°. The solution was then reduced in volume to 0.886 ml by lyophilization and incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C. The oligomerized Aβ was then stored at–80 °C. Characterization of Oligomerized Aβ—A 10-μl sample of Aβ was injected onto a Macrosphere GPC100 7-μm size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter) and eluted with 20 mm ammonium carbonate. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. The oligomerized Aβ used in each experiment was tested to ensure that a similar degree of oligomerization had occurred. Synthetic Peptides—Aβ-binding peptides were synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ). All peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 1 mm, except for peptide #3 (VSVGMLWC), which was dissolved at 0.1 mm. Peptides were then sterilized by filtration before use. One vial of Pro-Ject protein transduction reagent (Pierce) was then dissolved in 250 μl of CHCl3. Four μl of Pro-Ject solution were transferred to 1.5-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and evaporated with nitrogen. Peptide was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to 9.1 μg/ml, and 0.22 μg of peptide was added. The vial was incubated for 5 min, then vortexed, and the volume was brought to 0.5 ml with serum-free DMEM. Cells were grown in 12-well plates containing 1 ml of N2 culture medium. When the cells reached 75–80% confluence, they were washed with serum-free DMEM, and peptide/ProJect mixture dissolved in 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM was added. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. After 18 h, oligomerized Aβ was added. Cells were monitored daily. Under these conditions some cell death is visible within 48–72 h. The number of visibly apoptotic cells continued to increase for several more days. Therefore, we stopped the experiment after 7 days (6 days after adding Aβ). The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. A 100-μl aliquot of phosphate-buffered saline was added, and the cells were removed by gentle scraping. The cells were homogenized by sonication and stored at–80 °C. β-Galactosidase—We tested for senescence using the hydrolysis by β-galactosidase at pH 6 of X-gal, a commonly used β-galactosidase substrate. Under these conditions, β-galactosidase is easily detectable in senescent cells but undetectable in quiescent, immortal, or tumor cells (51Dimri G.P. Kim X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5153) Google Scholar). To measure β-galactosidase, cell homogenate (20 μl) was incubated in 100 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.1 mg/ml X-gal. After 24 h at 37 °C, the samples were diluted to 1 ml, and absorbance at 610 nm was measured. pBad—Bad (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter) is a member of the Bcl-2 family and regulates the survival signal (52Ruvolo P.P. Kim X. May W.S. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 515-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Bad dimerizes with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which neutralizes their anti-apoptotic activity. Activation of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase pathway ultimately leads to activation of Akt, which phosphorylates Bad on serine 136. Activation of mitogen-activate kinase pathways results in phosphorylation of Bad on serine 112. Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered from its proapoptotic role by binding with 14-3-3 protein (53Masters S.C. Kim R.R. Truong A. Yang H. Fujii K. Zhang H. Fu H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, a decrease in Bad phosphorylation indicates apoptosis (54Datta S.R. Kim H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Image quantitation and molecular weight estimation were done on 16-bit images using the Unix-based image analysis program imal. The background value for each band was calculated by fuzzy k-means clustering analysis of the appropriate region of the image (61Kaufman L. Kim P.J.

Caspase-3 Assay—Members of the caspase family of cysteine aspartyl proteases are related to the Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3 death protein. Caspases-8, -9, and -10 are activated by receptor clustering and are known as “initiator caspases” (65Riedl S.J. Kim Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Caspases-3, -6, and -8 are activated by changes in mitochondrial permeability that are associated with apoptosis and are known as “effector caspases.” Effector caspase-3 proteolyzes a number of substrates, including DNA fragmentation factor/inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (DFF45/ICAD), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, gelsolin, and nuclear lamins (66Boatright K.M. Kim G.S. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; 70: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of DFF45/ICAD liberates the DNase subunit of DFF to cause chromatin degradation (67Wolf B.B. Kim M. Echeverri F. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30651-30656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase has been used by many researchers as a marker for apoptosis. We measured caspase-3 activity fluorometrically using the commercially available substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-NH2-methylcoumarin, which contains the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage site (68Fernandes-Alnemri T. Kim A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L. Tomaselli K.J. Wang L. Yu Z. Croce C.M. Salveson G. et al.Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6045-6052PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of this peptide yields a species that fluoresces at 440–460 nm. To measure caspase-3, samples (20 μl) were incubated with 20 μl of caspase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5mm EDTA, 0.2% CHAPS, and 15% sucrose) containing 0.3% dithiothreitol and 0.54 μg of Ac-DEVD-amidomethylcoumarin peptide in 1.5-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. The samples were incubated in a total volume of 40 μl for 1 h at 37°Cand diluted to 1 ml, and fluorescence was measured (ex = 354 nm, em = 442 nm) in a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer. Phosphodiesterase Assay—Phosphodiesterase was measured by the method of Alvarez and Daniels (69Alvarez R. Kim D.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Fines were removed from acidic alumina (Brockmann grade 1) by resuspending several times in water. Bio-Rad Poly-Prep columns were packed with a slurry containing 1.3 g of alumina to a height of 3 cm. Columns were precycled with 0.1 m ammonium acetate to remove any cAMP, then equilibrated with water. In a 0.5-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube, a volume equivalent to 0.15 μl of rat brain homogenate was diluted to 100 μl with water and 10 μl of buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 2 mm MgSO4), and 0.5 μlof[3H]cAMP were added. After 10 of min incubation at 30 °C, the samples were boiled and cooled, and 0.1 μl of 5′-nucleotidase was added (Biomol, 500 kilounits/ml). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and applied to the column. The adenosine was eluted with 4 ml of 5 mm HCl, mixed with scintillation fluid, and counted in a scintillation counter. 2′, 3′-Cyclic Nucleotide 3′-Phosphodiesterase (CNPase) Assay— CNPase was measured using the coupled enzyme method of Weissbarth et al. (70Weissbarth S. Kim H.S. Raes I. Brannan T.S. Lapin E.P. Lehrer G.M. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Samples (20 μl) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 4 mm cyclic NADP, 2 mm d-glucose 6-phosphate, 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.025% Triton X-100 in 0.2 m MES buffer, pH 6.0, in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml of 50 mm NaCO3, pH 10.5, and the fluorescence of the resulting NADPH was measured (ex = 360, em = 460 nm). Western Blots—Protein was measured using the Bradford dye binding technique (71Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202012) Google Scholar). Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel. Identical amounts of protein were applied to each gel. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, nitrocellulose blotting, and antibody staining using commercial antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (72Nelson T.J. Kim P.S. Alkon D. Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Co-precipitation—One rabbit brain was homogenized by sonication in 3 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaF and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was then re-centrifuged to produce the cytosolic fraction, and the original pellet was sonicated in the original volume of 10% N-lauroyl sarcosine or 10% CHAPS and centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g. The detergent extracts and cytosol were divided into 4-ml aliquots and incubated in 17 × 100-mm polypropylene tubes (Falcon 2059) with 10 μgof biotin-LC-β-amyloid-(1–42) (Anaspec) for 1 h at room temperature. Avidin-agarose (50 μl) was added, and the incubation was continued on an orbital shaker (800 rpm) for an additional 60 min. The mixture was cooled on ice, transferred to a Bio-Rad Poly-Prep column, and rapidly washed with 2 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl plus 100 mm NaCl using pressure. The co-precipitated proteins were eluted with 2 ml of 4 m NaCl and 2 ml of 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2. The eluted fractions were concentrated and desalted in Centricon-3 ultrafiltration units, then mixed with SDS sample buffer for Western blotting. The non-eluted proteins were eluted from the agarose beads by boiling with SDS sample buffer. Samples were applied to a 4–20% SDS-poly-acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Co-precipitation Using Protein A-Agarose—Rabbit brain or N-lauroyl sarcosine extracts (3 ml) were incubated with 1 μgof Aβ-(1–42) for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-Aβ antibody (Calbiochem 171604, 9.09 μg) was added. After 45 min of shaking, 30 μl of protein A-agarose was added, and the samples were incubated with shaking for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then transferred to disposable plastic columns and rapidly washed with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The agarose beads were transferred to a centrifuge tube, proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were identified by electrophoresis and Western blotting"

https://openalex.org/W1968224058,"Profiles of man-made radionuclides in sediment cores from the James River estuary confirm the rapid burial of the pesticide Kepone. The greatest deposition of Kepone has occurred in zones characterized by very high sedimentation rates, 10 to 20 centimeters per year. Since sediment is the major Kepone reservoir, rapid burial probably reduces the exposure of organisms to further contamination. Disturbance caused by hurricanes or dredging, however, could return highly contaminated sediment to the surface although this sediment would be diluted with less contaminated particles."

During a 5-month period 17 float trajectories were obtained in the eastern (45 degrees to 65 degrees W) Gulf Stream and subtropical gyre interior at depths of 700 and 2000 meters. These mid-depth trajectories suggest a time-varying Gulf Stream with instances of both a narrow, swift, westward recirculation south of the stream and a northeastward penetration into the Newfoundland Basin. A hundredfold increase of eddy kinetic energy was observed at 2000 meters from the gyre interior (south of 30 degrees N) to the Gulf Stream."
https://openalex.org/W1978247685,"Proper assembly of the 26 S proteasome is required to efficiently degrade polyubiquitinated proteins. Many proteasome subunits contain the proteasome-COP9-initiation factor (PCI) domain, thus raising the possibility that the PCI domain may play a role in mediating proteasome assembly. We have previously characterized the PCI protein Yin6, a fission yeast ortholog of the mammalian Int6 that has been implicated in breast oncogenesis, and demonstrated that it binds and regulates the assembly of the proteasome. In this study, we isolated another PCI proteasome subunit, Rpn7, as a high copy suppressor that rescued the proteasome defects in yin6 null cells. To better define the function of the PCI domain, we aligned protein sequences to identify a conserved leucine residue that is present in nearly all known PCI domains. Replacing it with aspartate in yeast Rpn7, Yin6, and Rpn5 inactivated these proteins, and mutant human Int6 mislocalized in HeLa cells. Rpn7 and Rpn5 bind Rpn9 with high affinity, but their mutant versions do not. Our data suggest that this leucine may interact with several hydrophobic amino acid residues to influence the spatial arrangement either within the N-terminal tandem α-helical repeats or between these repeats and the more C-terminal winged helix subdomain. Disruption of such an arrangement in the PCI domain may substantially inactivate many PCI proteins and block their binding to other proteins. Proper assembly of the 26 S proteasome is required to efficiently degrade polyubiquitinated proteins.

Disruption of such an arrangement in the PCI domain may substantially inactivate many PCI proteins and block their binding to other proteins. The 26 S proteasome contains a 20 S catalytic core, which has a cylindrical shape and on its own is capable of degrading small peptides (1Voges D. Kim P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). However, eukaryotic proteins that are designated for degradation are frequently marked by polyubiquitination, which apparently increases the bulk of the protein to make it difficult to enter the small catalytic chamber. To degrade polyubiquitinated proteins, the 19 S regulatory particle is needed, and these 19 S particles cap the two ends of the 20 S catalytic core to produce the 26 S proteasome. In order to understand how the 26 S proteasome efficiently and selectively degrades proteins, it is critical to ascertain how a 26 S proteasome is properly assembled. A 19 S regulatory particle can be further divided into a lid and a base subcomplex, each of which contains approximately eight subunits. Intriguingly, more than half of the lid subunits contain a proteasome-COP9-initiation factor (PCI) 4The abbreviations used are: PCI, proteasome-COP9-initiation factor; WH, winged helix; eIF3, eukaryotic initiation factor-3; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; HAM, HEAT analogous motif; HEAT, Huntington elongation factor 3, a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A; YEAU, yeast extract medium; MM, minimal medium; RFP, red fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; ts, temperature-sensitive. domain, thus named because it is frequently found in these three protein complexes, which, besides the proteasome, include the COP9/signalosome and eIF3 translation initiation complex (2Aravind L. Kim C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Hofmann K. Kim P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 204-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The common presence of PCI domains in these protein complexes supports a model in which the PCI domain can play a role in assembling subunits within or even between these complexes (4Chang E.C. Kim C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PCI domains remain structurally poorly defined. So far, the only relevant crystal structure of the PCI domain is that of human eIF3k (5Wei Z. Kim P. Zhou Z. Cheng Z. Wan M. Gong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34983-34990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), since this protein is a more distant member in the PCI family (6Scheel H. Kim K. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the structural study of Wei et al. (5Wei Z. Kim P. Zhou Z. Cheng Z. Wan M. Gong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34983-34990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the authors have concluded that the PCI domain in eIF3k actually contains two subdomains, and this two-subdomain architecture is probably also true for more typical PCI domains. The eIF3k PCI N-terminal subdomain was termed HEAT analogous motif (HAM) because it resembles the HEAT helical repeats found in numerous proteins whose main roles appear to be binding and assembling other proteins. In a previous bioinformatic analysis of PCI architecture (6Scheel H. Kim K. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we predicted that the N-terminal subdomain of typical PCI domains most likely resembles the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), which consists of pairs of α-helices that are oriented in an antiparallel manner. Compared with the HEAT repeats, the functionally similar TPR has a slightly different arrangement of helices. The C-terminal subdomain in the eIF3k PCI was determined to be a winged helix (5Wei Z. Kim P. Zhou Z. Cheng Z. Wan M. Gong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34983-34990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is also likely to be conserved in the other PCI domains. Together with the TPR/HEAT repeat subdomain, these two subdomains create two large surfaces, one of which is concave and one of which is convex, resulting in an earlike shape. The presence of these two large surfaces may allow a PCI protein to provide ample binding areas for many proteins. However, no detailed structure-function analyses have yet been performed to investigate whether the presence of these two subdomains is physiologically relevant. Our laboratory has characterized a PCI protein called Yin6 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yin6 is the S. pombe ortholog of the mammalian Int6 protein that has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis (8Marchetti A. Kim F.

AfCS-Nature Molecule Pages. 2005; 10.1038/mp.a003493.01Google Scholar), although its molecular functions are poorly defined. Int6 is also known as eIF3e, because it was found to co-purify with the eIF3 complex (11Asano K. Kim W.C. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23477-23480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that Yin6 is not essential for global translation initiation (12Bandyopadhyay A. Kim V. Matsumoto T. Chang E.C. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2360-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, we have found that a major evolutionarily conserved function of Yin6 is to regulate the 26 S proteasome by preferentially binding and controlling the localization and/or assembly of a PCI proteasome lid subunit, Rpn5 (13Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30669-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In wild type S. pombe cells, the proteasome is concentrated in the inner layer of the nuclear membrane. By contrast, in yin6 null (yin6Δ) cells as well as rpn5Δ cells, the proteasome appears more diffuse, as measured by microscopy, and lacks many subunits, as revealed by affinity pull-down. To better define the role of Yin6, in this study we carried out a high copy suppressor screen seeking S. pombe genes that when overexpressed rescued the cold-dependent growth defect of yin6Δ cells. In support of the model in which Yin6 regulates the proteasome, we report herein the isolation of another PCI proteasome subunit, Rpn7, from the screen. Since together with Yin6 and Rpn5, we now have three well characterized PCI proteins, we performed a structure-function analysis to identify amino acid resides in the PCI domain that may be important for the function of many PCI proteins. We have thus identified a Leu residue that is critical for the functions of these three proteins. Bioinformatics analysis showed that this Leu appears to reside in a region that is in close proximity to both the TPR-like and the WH subdomains. The hydrophobic interactions provided by the identified Leu may influence how each of these two subdomains folds, how they are arranged relative to one another, or both. Collectively, these data suggest that maintaining proper conformation of these two subdomains is indeed important for the function of many PCI proteins. Strains and Growth Conditions—The parental wild-type S. pombe strain used in this paper is SP870 (h90, ade6-M210, leu1-32, ura4-D18). The yin6Δ, rpn5Δ, and pus1/rpn10-PA strains were as described (13Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30669-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in either yeast extract medium (YEAU) or synthetic minimal medium (MM) with appropriate supplements. To test for canavanine sensitivities, stock solutions of canavanine sulfate (50 mg/ml in water) were prepared and added to media after autoclaving. We carried out all the experiments with cells pregrown to early logarithmic phase (2-5 × 106 cells/ml). For growth experiments on plates, cells were serially diluted 1:5. HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin, and the CO2 was maintained at 5%. For transfection, HeLa cells were grown to 40-50% confluence in 24-well glass bottom culture plates (MatTek), 100 ng of plasmid DNA was used, and the transfection reagent was Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). High Copy Suppressor Screen—The YIN6K strain (yin6::kanR) (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was transformed with a cDNA library whose cDNA clones are carried by the pREP3 vector that contains a thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (15Norbury C. Kim S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were incubated at 20 °C for 6 weeks, and plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies that emerged. These cDNA clones were retested with a fresh batch of YIN6K cells, and those that failed to rescue the growth defects were discarded. The final cDNA clones were sequenced using two primers: 5′-CAATCTCATTCTCACTTTCTGAC-3′ and 5′-TTGAATGGGCTTCCATAGTTTG-3′. The former anneals in the nmt1 promoter, whereas the latter anneals to the nmt1 terminator. The obtained sequences were submitted to the BLAST server of the S. pombe sequencing project at the Sanger Institute (16Wood V. Kim R. Rajandream M.A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S. Basham D. Bowman S. Brooks K. Brown D. Brown S. Chillingworth T. Churcher C. Collins M. Connor R. Cronin A. Davis P. Feltwell T. Fraser A. Gentles S. Goble A. Hamlin N. Harris D.

Taylor R.G. Tivey A. Walsh S. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). In addition to yin6, which was isolated six times, two identical rpn7 clones (SPBC582.07c) were isolated. These two clones do not have the coding sequence for the first 8 amino acids. The 12th amino acid in the Rpn7 protein is a methionine; therefore, we assumed that protein expression from these two plasmids starts from this second methionine. All of the Rpn7 vectors described in this study contain the full-length rpn7 gene, however. This screen has also isolated other genes, but they will be described elsewhere. Plasmid Constructions—The construction of pREP1YIN6, pGADYIN6, pLBDMOE1, pGADRPN9, and pLBDRPN5 was as described (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Yen H.C.

A BamHI rpn7 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR from the cosmid SPBC582 (16Wood V. Kim R. Rajandream M.A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S. Basham D. Bowman S.

Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), pREP1, pREP41, and pREP41GFP to create pLBDRPN7, pREP1RPN7, pREP41RPN7, and pREPGFPRPN7. All PCR products in this study have been verified by sequencing to make sure that there is no mutation altering the coding sequence. In a separate project, we 5X. Fu and E. Chang, unpublished results. have constructed an expression vector that was derived from pNR210gck (18Sivakumar S. Kim M. Patel P.K. Benoit K. Rhind N. Methods. 2004; 33: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and uses the cdc42 promoter to express fusion proteins that are N-terminally tagged by a monomeric form of RFP called mCherry (19Shu X. Kim N.C. Yarbrough C.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9639-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We named it mcRFP in this study. To tag Rpn7 with mcRFP, the rpn7 cDNA was modified by PCR to contain SalI and SphI sites for cloning, and the resulting vector is named pMCRPN7. All site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). pAL1YIN6g contains the genomic version of the wild type yin6 gene in a high copy Leu+ vector, pAL1 (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of wild type yin6 in this vector was replaced with the mutated ones, and the final vector expressing Yin6L332D was named pYIN6LD. The wild type human int6 in pHAHINT6 (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the wild type yin6 in pHAYIN6 (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were similarly mutated to create pHAHINT6LD and pHAYIN6LD. Wild type or mutant human int6 were subcloned into the YFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) to create pYFPHINT6 and pYFPHINT6LD. The mutant rpn5 and rpn7 gene products were also subcloned into pVJL11, pREP41, and pREP41GFP to create pLBDRPN5LD, pLBDRPN7LD, and pREPGFPRPN7LD. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate rpn9 in pGADRPN9 to create pGADRPN9FD, pGADRPN9MD, and pGADRPN9FDMD. Strain Constructions—rpn7Δ/+ heterozygous diploid cells were created by homologous recombination of an rpn7::ura4 fragment amplified from the KS-ura4 plasmid as described (20Bähler J. Kim J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. 3rd Steever Wach A.B. A. Philippsen P. Pringle J. R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), and this was also the method that we first chose to tag Rpn7 with GFP at the C terminus by the pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 plasmid. This approach of tagging does not deliberately create an amino acid spacer between Rpn7 and GFP, and the resulting strain displayed a temperature-sensitive growth defect. We thus named this strain RPN7TS. To properly perform gene tagging using PCR and homologous recombination, we used a different plasmid, pYM27, as described by another group (21Janke C. Kim M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E. Knop M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). This approach creates a poly(AG) spacer between the gene of interest and GFP. Proper tagging was confirmed by Western blots (supplemental Fig. S1). The resulting strain was named RPN7GFP. The same method was used to tag Rpn7 with GFP in yin6Δ, rpn5Δ, and pus1/rpn10-PA cells to create strain Y6AR7GFP, R5AR7GFP, and R10PAR7GFP. We used a similar method to tag Rpn11 and α4 with GFP, and the resulting strains were named RPN11GFP and A4GFP, respectively, and Rpn5, Rpn7, and Rpn9 were tagged in SP870 by HA6, GFP, and Myc9 to create strain R5HAR7GFPR9MYC. The pYIN6LD vector was linearized and allowed to integrate to the chromosome of yin6Δ cells (strain YIN6K) (7Yen H.S. Kim E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14370-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to create strain YIN6LD, such that the only copy of yin6 in this strain is the mutant version. In parallel, the same mutant yin6 was integrated into a wild type strain to make sure that it did not induce a yin6Δ-like phenotype (data not shown). Other yin6 mutant genes were examined similarly. S. pombe contains two copies of rpn5 genes, rpn5a and rpn5b, that encode an identical protein (14Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30669-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The expression of these two loci is tightly regulated, such that when one of them is deleted, the expression of the second locus will increase to maintain the same level of total Rpn5 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to similarly mutate the rpn5 coding sequence in pBSRPN5-HAKanR (14Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30669-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to create pBSR5LD-HAKanR. This plasmid was digested by XhoI and SmaI to release a fragment containing rpn5, and this fragment was used to transform a rpn5bΔ strain (RPN5bA) (14Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30669-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After homologous recombination, its rpn5a locus was replaced by rpn5L316L-HAKanR. We named the resulting strain RPN5LD. Fluorescence Microscopy—The general procedures for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of S. pombe cells were as described (22Alfa C. Kim P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Samples were examined via an UPlanFI ×100/1.30 oil objective on an Olympus BX61 microscope, and the images were captured by a Q-Imaging Retiga camera. Deconvolution of images (Nearest Neighbor) was performed using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) on a stack of eight images taken at 0.5-μm intervals. For the protein colocalization study, images in each focal plane were examined to confirm colocalization. Openlab software (Improvision) was used to quantify the GFP intensity. To visualize YFP-tagged Int6 in HeLa cells, 48 h after transfection, YFP signals were captured using the Olympus IX70 microscope via a ×60/1.4 oil objective. To visualize the nuclei of live cells, Hoechst 33342 was added 10 min prior to image acquisition. YFP intensity was quantified by Slidebook software. Images were deconvolved (constrained iterative) using Slidebook on a stack of 12 images collected at 0.5-μm intervals. 26 S Proteasome Pull-down—Approximately 30 OD units (∼3 × 108) of cells were lysed in ice-cold 26 S-binding buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, pH 7.0-7.4). Total crude lysates were centrifuged twice at 20,800 × g for 20 min. Supernatants with the same amount of protein were incubated with either 50 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Invitrogen) or Protein A-Sepharose control (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After eight washes in the 26 S-binding buffer, beads were incubated with the tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) twice for 1 h at 30 °C to release the 26 S proteasome. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. Antibodies against Mts4/Rpn1, Pus1/Rpn10, and Mts3/Rpn12 were as described (13Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Antibodies against proteasome 20 S core α subunits (MCP231; 1:1000), GFP (1:1000), HA (1:1000), and Myc (1:1000) were from BIOMOL, Fitzgerald, Covance, and Abcam, respectively. The anti-Cdc8 antibody was a gift from M. Balasubramanian (University of Singapore) (23Balasubramanian M.K. Kim D.M. Hemmingsen S.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The existing antibody against the α core does not recognize the α4 subunit, so we generated a polyclonal rabbit antibody using CIVKEIQDEKEAEAARKKGR as a peptide antigen. The confirmation of this antibody (1:2000) is shown in supplemental Fig. S2. To quantify protein levels, fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and the signals were measured by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences). Proteasome Subunit Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells (strain R5HAR7GFPR9MYC) were grown to 5 × 106 cells/ml in YEAU at 30 °C. Lysates were prepared in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.9) plus 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) and cleared by centrifuging twice at 20,800 × g for 15 min. Supernatants containing 5 mg of total proteins were mixed with the antibody (12CA5 or 9E10) at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) were then added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. To perform salt extraction (24Leggett D.S. Kim M.H. Finley D. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. Ubiquitin-Proteasome Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 57-70Google Scholar), protein A beads containing immunoprecipitated sample were mixed with the same lysis buffer containing 0, 0.5, or 1 m NaCl and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting, and protein levels were quantified by the Odyssey system (see “26 S Proteasome Pull-down”). Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—The cell lysate was prepared following the same procedure as that in the proteasome pull-down experiment. Glycerol gradient centrifugation was performed as described (25Stone M. Kim R. Seeger M. Bech-Otschir D. Wallace M. Gordon C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that 300-μl fractions were collected. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described (17Chang E.C. Kim M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H. Wigler H.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reporter strain was L40, which carries the reporter gene cassettes lexA-HIS3 and lexA-lacZ. The β-galactosidase activity was assayed by a color filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal) as substrate, whereas the HIS3 expression was assayed by plating cells in medium lacking histidine. To quantify β-galactosidase activity, a colorimetric assay using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside as substrate was performed as described (17Chang E.C. Kim M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H. Wigler H.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Detection of Polyubiquitinated Proteins—To detect ubiquitinated proteins, cells were broken by glass beads in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Total crude extracts containing equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an ubiquitin antibody (1:100; Sigma). Isolation of Rpn7 as a High Copy Suppressor That Rescues yin6Δ Phenotypes—The cDNA encoding a putative proteasome subunit in the lid of the 19 S cap particle was isolated twice in a genetic screen in which we sought S. pombe cDNAs that when overexpressed rescued the cold-dependent growth defects of yin6Δ cells (Fig. 1A). We named it Rpn7 based on its sequence homology to other Rpn7 proteins. Canavanine is an arginine analog; cells defective in the proteasome, such as yin6Δ cells, are hypersensitive to this drug. We found that overexpressing Rpn7 also rescued canavanine hypersensitivity of yin6Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Proteasome subunits in normal cells concentrate in the nuclear membrane, but in yin6Δ cells they are more diffused throughout the cell (Fig. 1C) (13Yen H.C. Kim C. Chang E.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We overexpressed rpn7 in yin6Δ cells and measured the ratio of the catalytic α4 subunit in the cytoplasm versus that in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 1C, in rpn7-overexpressed cells, substantially more α4 subunit could now be found in the nucleus, suggesting that rpn7 overexpression can directly rescue proteasome mislocalization/disassembly in yin6Δ cells. Rpn7 Is Essential for Proteasome Functioning—To determine whether rpn7 encodes an essential proteasome subunit, we deleted and replaced it with the ura4 selectable marker via homologous recombination in a diploid cell, and the deletion (rpn7::ura4) was confirmed by PCR. Tetrad analysis of its meiotic products showed that only two of the four spores in a given tetrad formed colonies (Fig. 2A), and they were all auxotrophic for uracil (Ura-) (data not shown), indicating that a single essential gene had been replaced by ura4. Finally, we transformed the heterozygous rpn7Δ/+ diploid cells with a plasmid expressing the rpn7 cDNA. By random spore analysis, we were able to easily identify cells that were uracil-prototrophic (Ura+) (data not shown), indicating that the expression of rpn7 cDNA rescued the lethality of rpn7Δ cells, as expected. These data collectively indicate that rpn7 is a gene essential for viability. During the course of an unsuccessful gene-tagging experiment, we found that Rpn7 that was C-terminally tagged with GFP without a proper amino acid spacer induced growth defects that were temperature-sensitive (ts), and this ts phenotype could be rescued by overexpressing rpn7 (data not shown). These data indicate that the ts growth defect is caused by loss of Rpn7 function. We thus used this strain, called RPN7TS, to more efficiently analyze Rpn7 functions and its relationship to the proteasome, and the rpn7 allele in this strain is called rpn7ts. In Fig. 2B, we show that at even semipermissive temperature, abnormal mitotic RPN7TS cells accumulated. In particular, cells that had apparently undergone abnormal chromosome segregation were frequently observed, which is consistent with the fact that sister-chromatid separation during anaphase is a key event regulated by the proteasome. To determine whether such a phenotype can be similarly detected in rpn7Δ cells, we sporulated diploid cells heterozygous for rpn7::ura4 in medium lacking uracil, so that only rpn7Δ (rpn7::ura4) cells could grow. We found that all germinated cells divided just a few times and displayed the same mitotic abnormalities as seen in RPN7TS cells (data not shown). We conclude that the rpn7ts allele recapitulates the deficiencies in rpn7Δ cells. Cells defective in the proteasome are expected to show hypersensitivity to canavanine and to accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins, and indeed, both phenotypes were readily detected in RPN7TS cells (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively).

As demonstrated in our earlier cell-based tests (8Savinov A.Y. Kim D.V. Golubkov V.S. Wong F.S. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), MT1-MMP cleavage releases the extracellular domain of CD44 from T cell surfaces and inactivates the CD44 cell receptor function. Similarly, the cleavage of CD44 by MT1-MMP plays a significant role in the regulation of tumor cell migration (15Kajita M. Kim Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J.

By means of this regulatory proteolysis, which our earlier data suggest (8Savinov A.Y. Kim D.V. Golubkov V.S. Wong F.S. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), MT1-MMP appears to control the severity of the diabetic disease and mediates the transition of T cell adhesion on endothelium to transendothelial migration that results in T cell homing into the pancreatic islets. The inhibition of MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 leads to an extended instead of a temporal adhesion of cytotoxic autoimmune T cells on the vascular endothelium. In a similar fashion, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2; a potent inhibitor of MT1-MMP) but not tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1; a poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP) decreased T-cell transmigration and preserved insulin production in a type 1 diabetes organ culture model (17Woods C.C. Kim K. Tessler C. Lebsack T.W. Grainger L. Nielsen A. Bleich D. DeLuca D. J. Autoimmun. 2006; 27: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The long term immobilization on the endothelium impedes the transmigration and homing efficiency of the diabetogenic CD8+ T cells. These combined events delayed the onset of the transferred diabetes in NOD mice (8Savinov A.Y. Kim D.V. Golubkov V.S. Wong F.S. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27755-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Consistent with our data, a recent publication suggests that MT1-MMP plays an important role in regulating monocyte transendothelial migration (18Sithu S.D. Kim W.R. Olson P. Krubasik D. Baker A.H.

Therapies of IDDM will require the repair of immunological tolerance breakdown, restoration of insulin-producing β cell mass, or both (19Bresson D. Kim M. Autoimmun.

Science. 2006; 311: 1775-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and a clinically relevant increase in insulin production in acutely diabetic NOD mice. Here, using acutely diabetic NOD mice and performing subsequent extensive morphometric analyses and the measurement of both the C-peptide blood levels and the proinsulin mRNA in the islets, we experimentally confirm that this hypothesis is correct. Animals—Mice of NOD/LtJ (NOD), C57Bl/6J, and NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J (NOD-scid) strains were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in the pathogen-free animal facility of the Burnham Institute for Medical Research. All animal treatment protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Burnham Institute Animal Care Committee. NOD female mice developed diabetes in ∼5 months following birth. The onset of spontaneous diabetes was identified by assessing urine glucose levels with Diastix strips (Bayer, Tarrytown, NY) and verified by blood glucose measurement using an Ascensia Elite 1 one-touch blood glucose monitor (Bayer). Mice with blood glucose levels >450 mg/dl for three consecutive measurements were considered diabetic. Adoptive Transfer—Adoptive transfer of diabetes was performed by intravenous injection of freshly isolated splenocytes from diabetic NOD animals into irradiated (725 Roentgens, 24 h in advance) syngeneic NOD recipients (1.5 × 107 cells/animal) (26Savinov A.Y. Kim F.S. Chervonsky A.V. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6637-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both males and females 6–10 weeks of age were used. Because neither sex nor age affected the incidence and the time of diabetes onset, the results were pooled. The recipients of adoptive transfer were monitored daily by blood glucose measurements for 30 days for diabetes development. Animals with blood glucose levels >450 mg/dl for three consecutive measurements were considered diabetic. Multidose STZ Treatment—To induce diabetes, streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.5) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 5 consecutive days into 8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (27Flodstrom M. Kim B. Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels were monitored every second day. Animals were considered diabetic when their blood glucose levels were >450 mg/dl in three consecutive measurements. Mice in the control group received an equal volume of sodium citrate buffer alone. AG3340 Treatment—Porcine insulin (Sigma; ≥27 USP units/mg; 15–20 units/kg; one injection every 2–3 days) was injected subcutaneously into female NOD mice that had already developed acute spontaneous diabetes and also into C57BL/6 animals with STZ-induced diabetes. Insulin injections lasted for 20 days to ensure total destruction of any residual degranulated β cells (28Sherry N.A. Kim J.A. Glandt M. Kitamura T. Brillantes A.M. Herold K.C. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The spontaneously diabetic NOD- and STZ-treated C57BL/6 control animals (four and five mice/group, respectively) then continued to receive insulin alone. Experimental groups of spontaneously diabetic NOD- and STZ-treated C57BL/6 (six mice/group each) received insulin subcutaneously jointly with AG3340 intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg; one injection every 2–3 days) for 30 days, and then insulin injections were stopped in all groups, whereas experimental groups continued to receive AG3340 intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg; one injection in every 2–3 days) for the following 30 days. Every other day, animals were subjected to measurements of blood glucose. Animals with blood glucose levels >450 mg/dl for three consecutive measurements were considered diabetic and were then sacrificed. Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test—Mice were fasted for 16 h. Glucose (2.0 g/kg, 20% solution in 0.9% NaCl) was administered intraperitoneally. Blood glucose was analyzed at 0, 10, 20, and 60 min after injection using a blood glucose monitor (Bayer). Immunohistochemistry, Morphometry, and Pancreatic Regenerative Capability Analyses—Pancreata were weighed, fixed by immersion in 10% formaldehyde, and paraffin-embedded. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with guinea pig anti-insulin polyclonal serum (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to glucagon (DacoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) followed by species-specific secondary horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. The Vector VIP kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to visualize horseradish peroxidase-stained tissue. Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin, mounted, and analyzed. Morphometry and a pancreatic regenerative capability analyses were performed using serial 5-μm-thick longitudinal paraffin sections of pancreata separated by a 50-μm interval and immunostained for insulin. The microscopic images of pancreatic sections were taken using the Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA) connected through a video camera to a computer. Images were analyzed using the Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). The β cell representation was measured using our assumption that all insulin-positive areas were represented by β cells. Morphometric analysis was performed using a grid system. At least 300 fields/mouse were examined. Relative β cell, non-β cell, and total exocrine tissue areas were calculated. The β cell mass was then calculated by multiplying the relative β cell representation by the corrected pancreatic weight. For the analysis of the pancreatic regenerative capability, we used 5-μm-thick longitudinal paraffin sections of pancreata separated by a 50-μm interval. The sections were immunostained for insulin. The size of the individual functional islets, defined as the insulin-positive area of the sections, was measured using an Olympus BX51 microscope with a ×200 magnification connected through a video camera to a computer. The data were analyzed by Metamorph software and expressed in pixels (29Pelegri C. Kim J.G. Durant S. Throsby M. Alves V. Coulaud J. Esling A. Pleau J.M. Drexhage H.A. Homo-Delarche F. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 311-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to our observations, 85–90% of the functional islets in adult NOD-scid mice exceeded 80 μm (2000 pixels) in size. Infiltration-free, insulin-positive, and ≤2000 pixel in size islets were considered to be either regenerating or newly formed. These miniature islets were counted in the sections of the entire pancreas and recorded. 4–6 mice/group were analyzed by an observer under double-blinding conditions. The data were expressed as mean value + S.E. Measurement of Serum Insulin and C-peptide Levels—Mice were fasted for 16 h. Glucose (2.0 g/kg body weight, 20% solution in 0.9% NaCl) or an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl was administered intraperitoneally. The blood was withdrawn from the orbital sinus 30 min after injection. The serum insulin and the C-peptide levels were measured in triplicate using the insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chemistry, Downers Grove, IL) and the C-peptide radioimmune assay kit (Linco), respectively. The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Q-RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from fresh pancreatic tissue using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed using 3 μg of RNA. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was conducted in duplicate using 25 ng of cDNA and 0.4 μm primers in a 30-μl final volume of 1xSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Forward and reverse primers (5′-GCTCTCTACCTGGTGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTAGAGGGAGCAGATG-3′, respectively) were specifically designed to amplify both murine Ins1 and Ins2 genes. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. The melt curve was analyzed, and the absence of primer dimers was verified. Relative expression levels were calculated using the following equation: 2Ct β-actin - Ct insulin, where Ct is the cycle threshold. β-Actin RNA was used as an intrinsic control. Statistical Analysis—The Fisher’s least significant difference test and one-way analysis of variance were used to determine statistical significance. A difference was considered statistically significant if the p value was <0.05. Inhibition of T Cell MT1-MMP in Spontaneously Diabetic NOD Mice—To generate proof-of-principle data that the inhibition of T cell MT1-MMP and the subsequent reduction of autoimmune T cell transmigration and homing would lead to regeneration of insulin-producing β cells, NOD female mice were first allowed to develop spontaneous IDDM. To compare the effects of an AG3340 treatment on spontaneous and STZ-induced diabetes (27Flodstrom M. Kim B. Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we also used multiple injections of STZ (40 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneally for 5 days) to cause diabetes in 8-week-old C57BL/six mice. Diseased mice then received insulin alone (15 units/kg subcutaneously) for 20 days to ensure the complete destruction of residual degranulated β cells (28Sherry N.A. Kim J.A. Glandt M. Kitamura T. Brillantes A.M. Herold K.C. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For the next 30 days, the control mice continued to receive insulin, whereas the experimental groups received insulin jointly with AG3340 (5 mg/kg). Because of the considerations described below, we specifically selected this hydroxamate inhibitor for our studies. AG3340/Prinomastat (3(S)-2,2-dimethyl-4[(4-pyridin-4-yloxy)-benzensulfonyl]-thimorpholine-3-carboxylic acid hydroxamate) was used earlier in phase III trials in cancer patients and is a highly potent hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs and especially of MT1-MMP (Ki = 40 pm) (30Shalinsky D.R. Kim J. Zou H. McDermott C.D. Forsyth P. Edwards D. Margosiak S. Bender S. Truitt G. Wood A. Varki N.M. Appelt K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 236-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Zucker S. Kim J. Chen W.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The Ki values of AG3340 against MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13 are higher, and hence, AG3340 is less efficient (∼100, 300, and 200 pm, respectively). Other individual MMPs are significantly less sensitive to AG3340 inhibition (e.g. the Ki values for MMP-1 and MMP-7 are 10 and 55 nm, respectively) (30Shalinsky D.R. Kim J. Zou H. McDermott C.D.

Our previous extensive studies involving AG3340, a recently designed thiirane MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor SB-3CT ((4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl) butane-1,2-dithiol) (34Ikejiri M. Kim M.M. Bonfil R.D. Toth M.

Res. 2005; 67: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), demonstrated that in a transfer diabetes model in NOD mice, only AG3340, the potent antagonist of MT1-MMP, delivered clinically relevant effects (14Savinov A.Y. Kim A.Y. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although both EGCG and SB-3CT are poor inhibitors of MT1-MMP, they are capable of targeting MMPs distinct from MT1-MMP. Because of the wide-ranging specificity of the MMP inhibitors, a simultaneous assessment of AG3340, SB-3CT, and EGCG permitted us to conclude that only T cell MT1-MMP plays a significant role in IDDM, whereas the combined effect of all other MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, both of which are efficiently inhibited by SB-3CT, is far less important. Overall, our earlier comprehensive studies led us to conclude that because of the primary role of MT1-MMP in shedding of T cell CD44 and the subsequent effects of CD44 shedding in T cell transendothelial migration, only MT1-MMP antagonists such as AG3340, as opposed to other broad range inhibitors of MMPs, are efficient in delaying IDDM transfer to NOD mice (8Savinov A.Y.

Insulin injections were then suspended in both the control and the experimental group mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Those mice that received insulin alone became hyperglycemic in a matter of days following the cessation of insulin injections and were then sacrificed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Simultaneously, the spontaneously diabetic NOD mice that received insulin jointly with the inhibitor continued to be normoglycemic/mildly hyperglycemic (≥450 mg/dl) for several weeks as long as the inhibitor injections were continued but without the injections of external insulin (Fig. 1A). These results support and extend our preliminary observations, which we reported earlier (9Savinov A.Y. Kim D.V. Strongin A.Y. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mice with STZ-induced diabetes did not improve their hyperglycemia following AG3340 treatment. It is well established that STZ uses Glut-2 as the receptor for entering into the target cell that eventually kills (39Guz Y. Kim I. Teitelman G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4956-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 40Kohnert K.D. Kim F. Hahn H.J. Cossel L. Acta Diabetol. 1997; 34: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Rood P.P. Kim R. Balamurugan A.N. Fan Y. Cooper D.K. Trucco M. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2006; 23: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). STZ does not provoke an autoimmune process; rather, it directly poisons the Glut-2 receptor-positive β cells. Because T cell activity is not part of the picture, it is understandable why AG3340 does not bring any benefit to STZ-treated animals (Fig. 1B). Glucose Tolerance, C-peptide, and Insulin mRNA—A routine glucose tolerance test further confirmed that spontaneously diabetic NOD mice that received AG3340 and healthy NOD-scid animals were capable of clearing injected glucose (intraperitoneally, 2 g/kg of body weight) from the blood at a similar rate (Fig. 1C). NOD-scid mice share an NOD genetic background but lack T and B cells and thus are broadly used as diabetes- and insulitis-free controls for NOD mice. To confirm that insulin was produced by the body, we determined the C-peptide levels in the blood of healthy NOD-scid mice and diseased NOD mice that received the inhibitor. There was an ∼50% reduction in the C-peptide level in both fasting and glucose-stimulated (2 g/kg) mice, which received the inhibitor, relative to the healthy NOD-scid mice. Control diabetic NOD animals that received insulin alone did not have detectable C-peptide in the blood. In mice with STZ-induced diabetes, the levels of C-peptide were insignificant independently of the AG3340 treatment (Fig. 2A). During the 34-day period following the cessation of insulin injections, the C-peptide concentrations in fasting mice were in the range of 60–100 pm in the serum of diabetic NOD mice that received AG3340, whereas concentrations in the range of 180–220 and 25–30 pm were measured in healthy NOD-scid mice and in C57BL/six mice with STZ-induced diabetes, respectively (Fig. 2B). The C-peptide concentrations in the serum correlated with the combined level of the Ins1 and Ins2 gene mRNA in the pancreas. According to the Q-RT-PCR analysis, the proinsulin mRNA level in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice that received the inhibitor was 30–40% of that detected in healthy NOD-scid mice. The proinsulin mRNA level was close to zero in mice with STZ-induced diabetes. Regeneration of β Cells in Acutely Diabetic NOD Mice—To examine the functionality of the surviving and either the regenerating or the newly formed islets, the murine pancreata were excised, sectioned, and stained with antibodies to insulin and glucagon. Consistent with our earlier data (9Savinov A.Y. Kim D.V. Strongin A.Y. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), AG3340 caused an increase in the number of intact islets and the islets with limited peri-islet insulitis in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. In addition, AG3340 caused a recovery of insulin-producing β cells in the pancreatic parenchyma. Intriguingly, the small-sized, presumably rescued, regenerating, or newly formed, islet-like structures were predominantly observed in those spontaneously diabetic NOD animals that received the inhibitor. Similar structures were infrequent either in diabetic NOD mice that received insulin alone or in mice with STZ-induced diabetes regardless of the inhibitor treatment. These islet-like structures were free from mononuclear infiltration and produced insulin and glucagon, thus providing evidence of the functional recovery of the hormone-secreting cells. In STZ-treated mice, the insulin staining was insignificant, suggesting a complete or near complete destruction of β cells (Fig. 3A). Because insulin synthesis is a surrogate measure of β cell mass, we directly determined the β cell mass in mice (28Sherry N.A. Kim J.A. Glandt M. Kitamura T. Brillantes A.M. Herold K.C. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 42Leroux L. Kim P. Lamotte L. Duvillie B. Cordonnier N. Jackerott M. Jami J. Bucchini D. Joshi R.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S150-S153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β cell mass was calculated from pancreatic sections made throughout the whole organ and stained for insulin. We used a morphometric analysis with a grid system to analyze at least 300 fields/animal. The significant increase in the pancreatic insulin mRNA content in AG3340-treated diabetic NOD mice was accompanied by a 9-fold increase in β cell mass (0.386 ± 0.037 mg in insulin + AG3340 mice versus 0.048 ± 0.02 mg in the insulin alone NOD control; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3, B and C). In diabetic NOD mice that received the inhibitor, β cell mass was equal to 40% of the mass of healthy NOD-scid mice. To further support our data, an observer under double-blinding conditions counted the newly formed, infiltration-free, insulin-positive islets having the size of ≤2000 pixels (∼80 μm diameter) (29Pelegri C. Kim J.G. Durant S. Throsby M. Alves V. Coulaud J. Esling A. Pleau J.M. Drexhage H.A. Homo-Delarche F. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 311-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the 5-μm longitudinal paraffin sections prepared at 50-μm intervals throughout the whole organ (4–5 mice/group) (Fig. 3D). We selected a 2000-pixel threshold because according to our observations, the average size of the functional mature islets in the adult, diabetes-free NOD-scid mice significantly exceeded 2000 pixels. There were, on average, 35 small-sized islets per animal in diabetic NOD mice that received AG3340. In turn, only a few small-sized islets were detected both in healthy NOD-scid mice and in diabetic NOD mice that received insulin alone. These data suggest that the regenerating processes were enhanced in diabetic mice because of the presence of AG3340. In general agreement with our data, TIMP-1 has been shown to inhibit cytokine-induced apoptosis in multiple β cell lines (43Han X. Kim Y. Scott S. Bleich D.

The Assessment of Immunosuppression—To determine whether AG3340 specifically represses the T cell transmigration processes as opposed to causing immunosuppression, we used an adoptive transfer of diabetes model. For this purpose, NOD mice with spontaneously developed diabetes were treated with insulin and AG3340 or insulin alone. In 25 days, the total splenocyte population was isolated from the spleens of experimental and control animals. The isolated splenocytes (1.5 × 107) were injected intravenously into young irradiated (725 Roentgens, 24 h in advance) syngeneic NOD recipients (six mice/group) (26Savinov A.Y. Kim F.S. Chervonsky A.V. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6637-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The onset of spontaneous diabetes was monitored daily by assessing urine glucose levels and verified by blood glucose measurements. Mice with blood glucose levels >450 mg/dl for three consecutive days were considered diabetic. There was no difference in the onset of diabetes among the groups, suggesting that no specific immunosuppressive effects were induced by AG3340 treatment (Fig. 4). In conclusion, we are now confident that inhibition of T cell transmigration by the MT1-MMP antagonists including AG3340 provides a level of protection against diabetes by controlling islet-destructive autoimmunity and stimulating the functional recovery of the insulin-producing β cells. Our data provide a rationale for conducting similar tests of the inhibitors of MT1-MMP in IDDM in humans."

In the 2.5 years preparation, the conference has generated scores of meetings and a vast pile of reports and documents on each of the energy sources under discussion. The plan of action is expected to call for international programs of research and development, training and information on new and renewable energy resources. It will also launch a major effort to alleviate fuelwood shortages in the Third World."
