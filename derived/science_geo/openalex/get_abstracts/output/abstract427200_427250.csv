https://openalex.org/W2045435533,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W1975240837,"Functionalization of unactivated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) single bonds is an efficient strategy for rapid generation of complex molecules from simpler ones. However, it is difficult to achieve selectivity when multiple inequivalent C-H bonds are present in the target molecule. The usual approach is to use σ-chelating directing groups, which lead to ortho-selectivity through the formation of a conformationally rigid six- or seven-membered cyclic pre-transition state. Despite the broad utility of this approach, proximity-driven reactivity prevents the activation of remote C-H bonds. Here we report a class of easily removable nitrile-containing templates that direct the activation of distal meta-C-H bonds (more than ten bonds away) of a tethered arene. We attribute this new mode of C-H activation to a weak 'end-on' interaction between the linear nitrile group and the metal centre. The 'end-on' coordination geometry relieves the strain of the cyclophane-like pre-transition state of the meta-C-H activation event. In addition, this template overrides the intrinsic electronic and steric biases as well as ortho-directing effects with two broadly useful classes of arene substrates (toluene derivatives and hydrocinnamic acids)."

The factors that make an element mobile are unknown but are generally considered rare in mammals. Lee et al. (p. 967 , published online 28 June) analyzed five cancer types occurring among several individuals and found that three types of epithelial tumors exhibited high rates of element movement relative to brain and blood cancers. Furthermore, these somatically acquired, tumor-specific elements targeted genes in colorectal cancer that, when disrupted, impact gene expression and thus may be a factor in the progression of the cancers."

Despite years of intensive research on the virus, Jagger et al. (p. 199 , published online 28 June; see the Perspective by Yewdell and Ince ) have found that the influenza A virus has been hiding a gene in its small negative-sense RNA genome. An overlapping open reading frame was found contained in the PA viral RNA polymerase gene, which is accessed by ribosomal frameshifting to produce a fusion protein containing the N-terminal messenger RNA (mRNA) endonuclease domain of PA and an alternative C-terminal X domain. The resulting polypeptide, PA-X, selectively degrades host mRNAs and, in a mouse model of infection, modulated cellular immune responses, thus limiting viral pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2154222068,"Organisms employ a fascinating array of strategies to silence invasive nucleic acids such as transposons and viruses. Although evidence exists for several pathways that detect foreign sequences, including pathways that sense copy number, unpaired DNA, or aberrant RNA (e.g., dsRNA), in many cases, the mechanisms used to distinguish “self” from “nonself” nucleic acids remain mysterious. Here, we describe an RNA-induced epigenetic silencing pathway that permanently silences single-copy transgenes. We show that the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 and its genomically encoded piRNA cofactors initiate permanent silencing, and maintenance depends on chromatin factors and the WAGO Argonaute pathway. Our findings support a model in which PRG-1 scans for foreign sequences and two other Argonaute pathways serve as epigenetic memories of “self” and “nonself” RNAs. These findings suggest how organisms can utilize RNAi-related mechanisms to detect foreign sequences not by any molecular signature, but by comparing the foreign sequence to a memory of previous gene expression.

Epigenetic silencing triggered by piRNA-mediated recognition of nonself RNA piRNAs scan using imperfect base pairing to initiate gene silencing Maintenance of silencing requires chromatin factors and RdRP-generated small RNAs Activating and silencing signals may compete in self versus nonself discrimination All organisms balance the need to maintain genetic variation against the danger of accumulating potentially deleterious genes or pathogenic sequences (Antonovics et al., 2011Antonovics J. Boots M. Abbate J. Baker C. McFrederick Q. Panjeti V. Biology and evolution of sexual transmission.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2011; 1230: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The experimental introduction of DNA (transgenes) into the germline provides an opportunity to probe an organism's response to foreign DNA (Rülicke and Hübscher, 2000Rülicke T. Hübscher U. Germ line transformation of mammals by pronuclear microinjection.Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 589-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has revealed that organisms use a variety of mechanisms to silence transgenes in the germline (Birchler et al., 2003Birchler J.

Interestingly, some mutants that disrupt transgene silencing also desilence endogenous genes, including self-replicating elements called transposons (Ketting et al., 1999Ketting R.F. Haverkamp T.H. van Luenen H.G. Plasterk R.H.

Thus, the mechanisms involved in transgene silencing protect the genome from invasive DNA elements. In many organisms, transgene silencing has been linked to factors that are also required for the RNAi pathway (Bosher and Labouesse, 2000Bosher J.M. Labouesse M. RNA interference: genetic wand and genetic watchdog.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E31-E36Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). RNAi was first identified as a sequence-specific response triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11739) Google Scholar). During RNAi, dsRNA is processed by the RNase III-related protein, Dicer, into ∼21 nucleotide (nt) short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Bernstein et al., 2001Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M.

Teng G. Tuschl T. Human Argonaute2 mediates RNA cleavage targeted by miRNAs and siRNAs.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). AGOs are RNase H-related proteins that use the base-pairing potential of small RNA cofactors to guide sequence-specific binding to target sequences (Song et al., 2004Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Crystal structure of Argonaute and its implications for RISC slicer activity.Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In some cases, AGOs directly cleave their targets; in other cases, AGOs recruit cofactors that direct mRNA destruction or other modes of regulation. Despite a clear overlap between the mechanisms that mediate RNAi and the silencing of transposons and transgenes, several findings point to distinct triggering mechanisms. For example, the AGO protein RDE-1 is essential for the dsRNA response in C. elegans but is not required for transposon or transgene silencing (Tabara et al., 1999Tabara H. Sarkissian M. Kelly W.G. Fleenor J. Grishok A. Timmons L. Fire A. Mello C.C. The rde-1 gene, RNA interference, and transposon silencing in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 99: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). RDE-1 engages siRNAs produced by Dicer and mediates the initial search for target RNAs in the cell (Parrish and Fire, 2001Parrish S. Fire A.

RDE-1 is thought to recruit a cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which then utilizes the target mRNA as a template for the production of secondary siRNAs, termed 22G-RNAs (Gu et al., 2009Gu W.

The 22G-RNAs are loaded onto members of an expanded, partially redundant, group of worm-specific AGOs (WAGOs). WAGOs that localize to the cytoplasm are thought to mediate mRNA turnover, whereas WAGOs that localize to the nucleus mediate transcriptional silencing (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D. Vasale J. Batista P.J. Claycomb J.M. Moresco J.J. Youngman E.M. Keys J.

Many components of the RNAi pathway that function downstream of RDE-1 are required for transposon and transgene silencing, including the RdRP system (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D.

Vastenhouw N.L. Plasterk R.H. RNA interference, transposon silencing, and cosuppression in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line: similarities and differences.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2004; 69: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fact that RDE-1 is not required for transposon and transgene silencing suggests that features unique to transposons and transgenes underlie the initial recruitment of RdRP to these targets and that dsRNA is unlikely to be the trigger. In the germline, RdRPs not only produce 22G-RNAs that interact with WAGOs, but also produce 22G-RNAs that interact with a distinct AGO, CSR-1, required for fertility and chromosome segregation (Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S.

Analysis of the C. elegans Argonaute family reveals that distinct Argonautes act sequentially during RNAi.Cell. 2006; 127: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, some factors, including RDE-3 and MUT-7, are only required for WAGO 22G-RNA accumulation (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D. Vasale J. Batista P.J. Claycomb J.M. Moresco J.J. Youngman E.M. Keys J. Stoltz M.J. et al.Distinct argonaute-mediated 22G-RNA pathways direct genome surveillance in the C. elegans germline.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), indicating that the CSR-1 and WAGO 22G pathways also involve distinct mechanisms. Indeed, the WAGO and CSR-1 22G pathways together target virtually all germline-expressed mRNAs; however, their targets are largely nonoverlapping (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D. Vasale J. Batista P.J. Claycomb J.M. Moresco J.J. Youngman E.M. Keys J. Stoltz M.J. et al.Distinct argonaute-mediated 22G-RNA pathways direct genome surveillance in the C. elegans germline.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike the WAGO pathway, the CSR-1 22G pathway does not appear to silence its targets (Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S.

Instead, the CSR-1 pathway may help to define and maintain euchromatic regions along the holocentric chromosomes in order to support the proper assembly of kinetochores. In most animals, the Piwi family AGOs are required for fertility and transposon silencing (Cox et al., 1998Cox D.N. Chao A. Baker J. Chang L. Qiao D. Lin H.

In C. elegans, however, the Piwi-related gene product PRG-1 has only been linked to the silencing of one transposon family, Tc3 (Batista et al., 2008Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M. Chiang R.

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) (21U-RNAs in C. elegans) are genomically encoded and appear to be expressed as Pol II transcripts whose single-stranded products are processed and loaded onto Piwi (Aravin and Hannon, 2008Aravin A.A.

The majority of these piRNAs map uniquely to the genome and lack obvious targets. As such, their function remains entirely unknown. Here, we use a homologous gene-targeting method called “Mos1-mediated single-copy insertion” (MosSCI; Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2008Frøkjaer-Jensen C. Davis M.W. Hopkins C.E. Newman B.J. Thummel J.M. Olesen S.P. Grunnet M. Jorgensen E.M. Single-copy insertion of transgenes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) to show that strains bearing identical single-copy transgenes inserted at the same chromosomal site can exhibit opposite and remarkably stable epigenetic fates, either expressed or silenced. Transgenes consisting of an endogenous germline-expressed gene fused to a relatively long foreign sequence (e.g., gfp) were prone to silencing. By contrast, otherwise identical transgenes fused to a short foreign sequence (e.g., flag) were always expressed. Our genetic and molecular analyses reveal that silencing is dependent on nuclear and cytoplasmic WAGOs and is correlated with the accumulation of 22G-RNAs targeting the foreign portion of the transgene. Importantly, PRG-1 is required to initiate, but not to maintain, silencing. We propose that PRG-1 and its 21U-RNA cofactors scan for foreign RNA sequences and initiate WAGO-maintained gene silencing, and endogenous mRNAs are protected from silencing, perhaps by the CSR-1/22G-RNA pathway. Single-copy insertions can overcome barriers to transgene expression in the germline (Rieckher et al., 2009Rieckher M. Kourtis N. Pasparaki A. Tavernarakis N. Transgenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 561: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, the single-copy insertion of transgenes at a defined chromosomal locus via the recently developed MosSCI approach reproducibly achieves germline expression (Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2008Frøkjaer-Jensen C. Davis M.W. Hopkins C.E. Newman B.J. Thummel J.M. Olesen S.P. Grunnet M. Jorgensen E.M. Single-copy insertion of transgenes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). However, while using MosSCI, we were surprised to find that not all single-copy transgenes were expressed in the germline (Figures 1A–1C ). The failure to express was only common for transgene fusions to lengthy foreign sequences, gfp (Figure 1A); transgenes with the flag epitope sequences were nearly always fully expressed (Figure 1A). Furthermore, we observed that transgenes in which gfp was inserted at the 5′ (rather than 3′) end of the construct were much less likely to be expressed (Figure 1A). PCR and sequence analyses indicated that nonexpressed transgenes are structurally identical to expressed transgenes, suggesting that the former are actively silenced. We next crossed a silent line to an expressing line to see which phenotype dominates. Strikingly, we found that 100% of the F1 cross-progeny (n = 12) and F2 self-progeny (n = 24) failed to express gfp in the germline (Figure 1D). Identical results were obtained even when the silent and active alleles were inserted on separate chromosomes (Figure 1E), suggesting that chromosomal pairing is not required for transfer of the silent state. Although transgenes with 3′ gfp insertions were less prone to silencing during transgene formation, they were fully silenced when crossed to a silent line (Figure 3J and data not shown). We found that either parent could contribute the dominant silencing signal. However, when the silent allele was male derived, it took more than one generation to completely silence the active allele. For example, silencing was observed in 67% (n = 15) of F1 progeny when the silent allele was paternally derived, whereas 100% (n = 12) of F1 progeny were silenced when maternally derived. Nevertheless, regardless of the parent of origin, in the F3 and subsequent generations, 100% of the descendants were GFP negative (n > 100). The silent phenotype was fully penetrant, with no evidence of expression or reversion even after the formerly active allele was resegregated as a homozygote (Figure 1E). These results clearly indicate that the failure to express these single-copy transgenes represents an active silencing process that involves a dominant trans-acting silencing signal. We first observed this dominant silencing activity in crosses with gfp::csr-1, which raised a concern because CSR-1 is an Argonaute that is potentially involved in silencing mechanisms. However, identical results were obtained in crosses with cdk-1 transgenes (data not shown), indicating that there is nothing unusual about the csr-1 transgenic lines. We refer to this phenomenon as RNA-induced epigenetic silencing (RNAe) because the silent state is stable indefinitely (without evidence of reversion), and (as shown below) maintenance of silencing involves a small RNA silencing signal that is epigenetically programmed (not genomically encoded). We identify transgenes exhibiting this type of silencing by including the term “(RNAe)” after the transgene name (e.g., neSi11 gfp::cdk-1(RNAe)). For clarity, active versions of the same alleles are referred to using (+), e.g., neSi11 gfp::cdk-1(+). High-copy transgenes in C. elegans can induce cosuppression of endogenous homologous genes (Dernburg et al., 2000Dernburg A.F. Zalevsky J. Colaiácovo M.P. Villeneuve A.M. Transgene-mediated cosuppression in the C. elegans germ line.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1578-1583PubMed Google Scholar, Ketting and Plasterk, 2000Ketting R.F. Plasterk R.H. A genetic link between co-suppression and RNA interference in C. elegans.Nature. 2000; 404: 296-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several of the transgenes we analyzed are fusion constructs with essential genes (e.g., gfp::cdk-1) and should result in obvious visible phenotypes if the corresponding endogenous locus was cosuppressed. However, no phenotypic evidence of cosuppression was observed in the silent lines analyzed (data not shown), suggesting that, despite the dominant nature of the silencing signal, silencing does not spread to the endogenous locus. To ask whether there is a partial suppression of the endogenous locus, we performed western blot analysis to determine the relative expression of the transgene and endogenous protein products in both active and silent lines. Consistent with the lack of phenotypic evidence for cosuppression, we observed identical levels of endogenous protein expression in both the active and silent transgenic lines (Figure 2A ). To ask whether silencing is regulated transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally, we isolated total RNA from otherwise identical silent and active gfp::csr-1 strains and measured the abundance of pre-mRNAs and mRNAs by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). We found that both the pre-mRNA and mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the silent line compared to the active line (Figures 2B and 2D). Moreover, although a reduction at the pre-mRNA level appeared to account for the majority of silencing, a further reduction was evident at the mRNA level, suggesting that silencing is achieved at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (Figures 2B and 2D). Previous work has shown that the methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me), a histone modification associated with silent chromatin, is enriched on high-copy number transgenes in the germline (Bessler et al., 2010Bessler J.B. Andersen E.C. Villeneuve A.M.

Furthermore, germline silencing of high-copy transgenes is dependent on a number of chromatin-associated factors, including the Polycomb group complex (MES-2/-3/-6), a Trithorax-related protein (MES-4), and the heterochromatin proteins (HPL-1 and -2) (Couteau et al., 2002Couteau F.

Consistent with these previous findings, we found that transgene sequences from a silent MosSCI allele, but not an active MosSCI allele, were enriched in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using antibodies specific for H3K9me3 (Figures 2C and 2D). The lysates used were from whole worms; therefore, only a portion of the chromatin present in the total lysate corresponds to germline chromatin, perhaps accounting for the relatively weak 2-fold enrichment observed. Finally, we found that mes-3, mes-4, and hpl-2 mutants all desilenced the gfp::csr-1 and gfp::cdk-1 transgenes (Table 1).

It is one of the brightest known and most nearby planets with an orbital period of just a few days. Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital inclination have been announced and refuted, and have subsequently remained elusive until now. Here we report on the detection of carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal day-side spectrum of tau Bootis b. At a spectral resolution of R~100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of i=44.5+-1.5 degrees and a true planet mass of 5.95+-0.28 MJup. This result extends atmospheric characterisation to non-transiting planets. The strong absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing towards higher altitudes. This is a stark contrast to the temperature inversion invoked for other highly irradiated planets, and supports models in which the absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed by the ultraviolet emission from the active host star."
https://openalex.org/W1999029823,"Viral infection activates several transcription factors including NF-κB and IRF3, which collaborate to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and innate antiviral response. MITA (also called STING) is a critical adaptor protein that links virus-sensing receptors to IRF3 activation upon infection by both RNA and DNA pathogens. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) ubiquitinated MITA and dramatically enhanced MITA-mediated induction of IFN-β. Overexpression of TRIM32 potentiated virus-triggered IFNB1 expression and cellular antiviral response. Consistently, knockdown of TRIM32 had opposite effects. TRIM32 interacted with MITA, and was located at the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. TRIM32 targeted MITA for K63-linked ubiquitination at K20/150/224/236 through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which promoted the interaction of MITA with TBK1. These findings suggest that TRIM32 is an important regulatory protein for innate immunity against both RNA and DNA viruses by targeting MITA for K63-linked ubiquitination and downstream activation."

A chemical link between both conditions of altered metabolism is the highly reactive compound methylglyoxal (MG), which accumulates in all cells, in particular neurons, and leaks into plasma as an index of the severity of the disorder. The electrophilic structure of this cytotoxic ketoaldehyde suggests TRPA1, a receptor channel deeply involved in inflammatory and neuropathic pain, as a molecular target. We demonstrate that extracellularly applied MG accesses specific intracellular binding sites of TRPA1, activating inward currents and calcium influx in transfected cells and sensory neurons, slowing conduction velocity in unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers, and stimulating release of proinflammatory neuropeptides from and action potential firing in cutaneous nociceptors. Using a model peptide of the N terminus of human TRPA1, we demonstrate the formation of disulfide bonds based on MG-induced modification of cysteines as a novel mechanism. In conclusion, MG is proposed to be a candidate metabolite that causes neuropathic pain in metabolic disorders and thus is a promising target for medicinal chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2044370075,"O-linked-N-acetyl-glucosamine glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) of the serine and threonine residues of cellular proteins is a dynamic process and affects phosphorylation. Prolonged O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to diabetes-related complications, including mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are dynamically remodeling organelles, that constantly fuse (fusion) and divide (fission). An imbalance of this process affects mitochondrial function. In this study, we found that dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) is O-GlcNAcylated in cardiomyocytes at threonine 585 and 586. O-GlcNAcylation was significantly enhanced by the chemical inhibition of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Increased O-GlcNAcylation decreases the phosphorylation of DRP1 at serine 637, which is known to regulate DRP1 function. In fact, increased O-GlcNAcylation augments the level of the GTP-bound active form of DRP1 and induces translocation of DRP1 from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. Mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential also accompany the increased O-GlcNAcylation. In conclusion, this report shows, for the first time, that O-GlcNAcylation modulates DRP1 functionality in cardiac muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058326304,"The processes by which cells sense and respond to ambient oxygen concentration are fundamental to cell survival and function, and they commonly target gene regulatory events. To date, however, little is known about the link between the microRNA pathway and hypoxia signaling. Here, we show in vitro and in vivo that chronic hypoxia impairs Dicer (DICER1) expression and activity, resulting in global consequences on microRNA biogenesis. We show that von Hippel-Lindau-dependent down-regulation of Dicer is key to the expression and function of hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) subunits. Specifically, we show that EPAS1/HIF-2α is regulated by the Dicer-dependent microRNA miR-185, which is down-regulated by hypoxia. Full expression of hypoxia-responsive/HIF target genes in chronic hypoxia (e.g. VEGFA, FLT1/VEGFR1, KDR/VEGFR2, BNIP3L, and SLC2A1/GLUT1), the function of which is to regulate various adaptive responses to compromised oxygen availability, is also dependent on hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of Dicer function and changes in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Therefore, functional deficiency of Dicer in chronic hypoxia is relevant to both HIF-α isoforms and hypoxia-responsive/HIF target genes, especially in the vascular endothelium. These findings have relevance to emerging therapies given that we show that the efficacy of RNA interference under chronic hypoxia, but not normal oxygen availability, is Dicer-dependent. Collectively, these findings show that the down-regulation of Dicer under chronic hypoxia is an adaptive mechanism that serves to maintain the cellular hypoxic response through HIF-α- and microRNA-dependent mechanisms, thereby providing an essential mechanistic insight into the oxygen-dependent microRNA regulatory pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1987228440,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replicates within the ribonucleoprotein complex, assembled on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranous structures closely juxtaposed to the lipid droplets that facilitate the post-replicative events of virion assembly and maturation. It is widely believed that the assembled virions piggy-back onto the very low density lipoprotein particles for secretion. Lipid phosphoinositides are important modulators of intracellular trafficking. Golgi-localized phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) recruits proteins involved in Golgi trafficking to the Golgi membrane and promotes anterograde transport of secretory proteins. Here, we sought to investigate the role of Golgi-localized PI4P in the HCV secretion process. Depletion of the Golgi-specific PI4P pool by Golgi-targeted PI4P phosphatase hSac1 K2A led to significant reduction in HCV secretion without any effect on replication. We then examined the functional role of a newly identified PI4P binding protein GOLPH3 in the viral secretion process. GOLPH3 is shown to maintain a tensile force on the Golgi, required for vesicle budding via its interaction with an unconventional myosin, MYO18A. Silencing GOLPH3 led to a dramatic reduction in HCV virion secretion, as did the silencing of MYO18A. The reduction in virion secretion was accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of intracellular virions, suggesting a stall in virion egress. HCV-infected cells displayed a fragmented and dispersed Golgi pattern, implicating involvement in virion morphogenesis. These studies establish the role of PI4P and its interacting protein GOLPH3 in HCV secretion and strengthen the significance of the Golgi secretory pathway in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2034982440,"We have reported that hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) promotes the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we report that HBXIP works in the event through up-regulating S100A4. We observed that HBXIP expression was positively correlated to that of S100A4 in 87 clinical breast cancer tissue samples. Then, we identified that HBXIP was able to up-regulate S100A4 expression in breast cancer cells. Notably, we observed the HBXIP nuclear localization, implying that HBXIP may be associated with the promoter of S100A4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that HBXIP was able to bind to the nucleotides +200~+239 region of S100A4 promoter, containing two putative recognition motif of transcription factor STAT4 and GRβ. It suggests that HBXIP is able to activate S100A4 promoter via interacting with STAT4 in breast cancer cells, leading to the up-regulation of S100A4. In addition, we identified another pathway of S100A4 up-regulation mediated by HBXIP. We found that HBXIP activated the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling by inducing DNA methylation of PTEN, which subsequently boosted S100A4 expression. In function, we demonstrated that HBXIP enhanced the growth or migration of breast cancer cells through S100A4 in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, we conclude that HBXIP up-regulates S100A4 through activating S100A4 promoter involving STAT4 and inducing PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling to promote growth and migration of breast cancer cells. Our finding provides new insight into the mechanism of HBXIP in promotion of the development of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2041865938,"Small GTPase Rab functions as a molecular switch that drives membrane trafficking through specific interaction with its effector molecule. Thus, identification of its specific effector domain is crucial to revealing the molecular mechanism that underlies Rab-mediated membrane trafficking. Because of the large numbers of Rab isoforms in higher eukaryotes, however, the effector domains of most of the vertebrate- or mammalian-specific Rabs have yet to be determined. In this study we screened for effector molecules of Rab36, a previously uncharacterized Rab isoform that is largely conserved in vertebrates, and we succeeded in identifying nine Rab36-binding proteins, including RILP (Rab interacting lysosomal protein) family members. Sequence comparison revealed that five of nine Rab36-binding proteins, i.e. RILP, RILP-L1, RILP-L2, and JIP3/4, contain a conserved coiled-coil domain. We identified the coiled-coil domain as a RILP homology domain (RHD) and characterized it as a common Rab36-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the RHD of RILP revealed the different contributions by amino acids in the RHD to binding activity toward Rab7 and Rab36. Expression of RILP in melanocytes, but not expression of its Rab36 binding-deficient mutants, induced perinuclear aggregation of melanosomes, and this effect was clearly attenuated by knockdown of endogenous Rab36 protein. Moreover, knockdown of Rab36 in Rab27A-deficient melanocytes, which normally exhibit perinuclear melanosome aggregation because of increased retrograde melanosome transport activity, caused dispersion of melanosomes from the perinucleus to the cell periphery, but knockdown of Rab7 did not. Our findings indicated that Rab36 mediates retrograde melanosome transport in melanocytes through interaction with RILP."
https://openalex.org/W1977182098,"Recent studies suggested that in old mice, beta cells lose their regenerative potential and cannot respond to mitogenic triggers. These studies examined beta cell replication in aged mice under basal conditions and in response to specific stimuli including treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog exenatide, streptozotocin injection, partial pancreatectomy, and high fat diet. However, it remains possible that the ability to mount a compensatory response of beta cells is retained in old age, but depends on the specific stimulus. Here, we asked whether partial ablation of beta cells in transgenic mice, using doxycycline-inducible expression of diphtheria toxin, triggers a significant compensatory proliferative response in 1-2-year-old animals. Consistent with previous reports, the basal rate of beta cell replication declines dramatically with age, averaging 0.1% in 2-year-old mice. Transient expression of diphtheria toxin in beta cells of old mice resulted in impaired glucose homeostasis and disruption of islet architecture (ratio of beta to alpha cells). Strikingly, the replication rate of surviving beta cells increased 3-fold over basal rate, similarly to the -fold increase in replication rate of beta cells in young transgenic mice. Islet architecture and glucose tolerance slowly normalized, indicating functional significance of compensatory beta cell replication in this setting. Finally, administration of a small molecule glucokinase activator to old mice doubled the frequency of beta cell replication, further showing that old beta cells can respond to the mitogenic trigger of enhanced glycolysis. We conclude that the potential for functionally significant compensatory proliferation of beta cells is retained in old mice, despite a decline in basal replication rate."
https://openalex.org/W2030623529,"Many enzymes have buried active sites. The properties of the tunnels connecting the active site with bulk solvent affect ligand binding and unbinding and also the catalytic properties. Here, we investigate ligand passage in the haloalkane dehalogenase enzyme LinB and the effect of replacing leucine by a bulky tryptophan at a tunnel-lining position. Transient kinetic experiments show that the mutation significantly slows down the rate of product release. Moreover, the mechanism of bromide ion release is changed from a one-step process in the wild type enzyme to a two-step process in the mutant. The rate constant of bromide ion release corresponds to the overall steady-state turnover rate constant, suggesting that product release became the rate-limiting step of catalysis in the mutant. We explain the experimental findings by investigating the molecular details of the process computationally. Analysis of trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations with a tunnel detection software reveals differences in the tunnels available for ligand egress. Corresponding differences are seen in simulations of product egress using a specialized enhanced sampling technique. The differences in the free energy barriers for egress of a bromide ion obtained using potential of mean force calculations are in good agreement with the differences in rates obtained from the transient kinetic experiments. Interactions of the bromide ion with the introduced tryptophan are shown to affect the free energy barrier for its passage. The study demonstrates how the mechanism of an enzymatic catalytic cycle and reaction kinetics can be engineered by modification of protein tunnels."
https://openalex.org/W1978023710,"Despite the passage of ∼30 years since the complete primary sequence of the intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin was reported, the structure remains unknown for both an individual protomer and the assembled filament. In this report, we present data describing the structure of vimentin linker 1 (L1) and rod 1B. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra collected from samples bearing site-directed spin labels demonstrate that L1 is not a flexible segment between coiled-coils (CCs) but instead forms a rigid, tightly packed structure. An x-ray crystal structure of a construct containing L1 and rod 1B shows that it forms a tetramer comprising two equivalent parallel CC dimers that interact with one another in the form of a symmetrical anti-parallel dimer. Remarkably, the parallel CC dimers are themselves asymmetrical, which enables them to tetramerize rather than undergoing higher order oligomerization. This functionally vital asymmetry in the CC structure, encoded in the primary sequence of rod 1B, provides a striking example of evolutionary exploitation of the structural plasticity of proteins. EPR and crystallographic data consistently suggest that a very short region within L1 represents a minor local distortion in what is likely to be a continuous CC from the end of rod 1A through the entirety of rod 1B. The concordance of this structural model with previously published cross-linking and spectral data supports the conclusion that the crystallographic oligomer represents a native biological structure."

Despite the importance of this phase, little is known about the metabolic state(s) that sustains it. Here, we investigate metabolically active but non-growing Bacillus subtilis during nitrogen starvation. In the absence of biomass formation as the major NADPH sink, the intracellular flux distribution in these resting B. subtilis reveals a large apparent catabolic NADPH overproduction of 5.0 ± 0.6 mmol g(-1)h(-1) that was partly caused by high pentose phosphate pathway fluxes. Combining transcriptome analysis, stationary (13)C-flux analysis in metabolic deletion mutants, (2)H-labeling experiments, and kinetic flux profiling, we demonstrate that about half of the catabolic excess NADPH is oxidized by two transhydrogenation cycles, i.e. isoenzyme pairs of dehydrogenases with different cofactor specificities that operate in reverse directions. These transhydrogenation cycles were constituted by the combined activities of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases GapA/GapB and the malic enzymes MalS/YtsJ. At least an additional 6% of the overproduced NADPH is reoxidized by continuous cycling between ana- and catabolism of glutamate. Furthermore, in vitro enzyme data show that a not yet identified transhydrogenase could potentially reoxidize ∼20% of the overproduced NADPH. Overall, we demonstrate the interplay between several metabolic mechanisms that concertedly enable network-wide NADPH homeostasis under conditions of high catabolic NADPH production in the absence of cell growth in B. subtilis."

The peptide hormone relaxin is important for the renal and systemic hemodynamic adaptations to pregnancy, and has been shown to increase arterial compliance and outward hypertrophic remodeling. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that relaxin acts on its receptor, RXFP1, to mediate uterine artery compliance in late pregnancy and increase uterine blood flow velocity in rats. RXFP1 was predominantly localized to the tunica media vascular smooth muscle cells in the uterine artery, although receptors were also detected in endothelial cells. Highest expression of Rxfp1 in the uterine artery occurred in estrus and early pregnancy. Isolated uterine arteries from late pregnant rats treated with a monoclonal antibody against circulating relaxin (MCA1) had significantly increased vessel wall stiffness compared with controls, with no reduction in wall thickness. Chronic infusion of relaxin (4 μg/h, osmotic minipump) for 5 d in nonpregnant rats significantly increased uterine artery blood flow velocity. Overall, these data demonstrate a functional role for relaxin in mediating uterine artery compliance in pregnant rats, which may be necessary to maintain adequate uterine blood flow to the uterus and placenta."

Despite their abundance, wide distribution and contribution to the bioenergy budget of the marine photic zone, an understanding of PR function and physiological significance in situ has been hampered as the vast majority of PRs studied to date are from unculturable bacteria or culturable species that lack the tools for genetic manipulation. In this study, we describe the presence and function of a horizontally acquired PR and retinal biosynthesis gene cluster in the culturable and genetically tractable bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio campbellii. Pigmentation analysis, absorption spectroscopy and photoinduction assays using a heterologous over-expression system established the V. campbellii PR as a functional green light absorbing proton pump. In situ analyses comparing PR expression and function in wild type (WT) V. campbellii with an isogenic ΔpR deletion mutant revealed a marked absence of PR membrane localization, pigmentation and light-induced proton pumping in the ΔpR mutant. Comparative photoinduction assays demonstrated the distinct upregulation of pR expression in the presence of light and PR-mediated photophosphorylation in WT cells that resulted in the enhancement of cellular survival during respiratory stress. In addition, we demonstrate that the master regulator of adaptive stress response and stationary phase, RpoS1, positively regulates pR expression and PR holoprotein pigmentation. Taken together, the results demonstrate facultative phototrophy in a classical marine organoheterotrophic Vibrio species and provide a salient example of how this organism has exploited lateral gene transfer to further its adaptation to the photic zone."

HypF catalyzes S-carbamoylation of the C-terminal cysteine of HypE via three steps using carbamoylphosphate and ATP, producing two unstable intermediates: carbamate and carbamoyladenylate. Although the crystal structures of intact HypE homodimers and partial HypF have been reported, it remains unclear how the consecutive reactions occur without the loss of unstable intermediates during the proposed reaction scheme. Here we report the crystal structures of full-length HypF both alone and in complex with HypE at resolutions of 2.0 and 2.6 Å, respectively. Three catalytic sites of the structures of the HypF nucleotide- and phosphate-bound forms have been identified, with each site connected via channels inside the protein. This finding suggests that the first two consecutive reactions occur without the release of carbamate or carbamoyladenylate from the enzyme. The structure of HypF in complex with HypE revealed that HypF can associate with HypE without disturbing its homodimeric interaction and that the binding manner allows the C-terminal Cys-351 of HypE to access the S-carbamoylation active site in HypF, suggesting that the third step can also proceed without the release of carbamoyladenylate. A comparison of the structure of HypF with the recently reported structures of O-carbamoyltransferase revealed different reaction mechanisms for carbamoyladenylate synthesis and a similar reaction mechanism for carbamoyltransfer to produce the carbamoyl-HypE molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2037319865,"Protein disaggregation in Escherichia coli is carried out by ClpB, an AAA(+) (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) molecular chaperone, together with the DnaK chaperone system. Conformational changes in ClpB driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis promote substrate binding, unfolding, and translocation. Conserved pore tyrosines in both nucleotide-binding domain-1 (NBD-1) and -2 (NBD-2), which reside in flexible loops extending into the central pore of the ClpB hexamer, bind substrates. When the NBD-1 pore loop tyrosine is substituted with alanine (Y251A), ClpB can collaborate with the DnaK system in disaggregation, although activity is reduced. The N-domain has also been implicated in substrate binding, and like the NBD-1 pore loop tyrosine, it is not essential for disaggregation activity. To further probe the function and interplay of the ClpB N-domain and the NBD-1 pore loop, we made a double mutant with an N-domain deletion and a Y251A substitution. This ClpB double mutant is inactive in substrate disaggregation with the DnaK system, although each single mutant alone can function with DnaK. Our data suggest that this loss in activity is primarily due to a decrease in substrate engagement by ClpB prior to substrate unfolding and translocation and indicate an overlapping function for the N-domain and NBD-1 pore tyrosine. Furthermore, the functional overlap seen in the presence of the DnaK system is not observed in the absence of DnaK. For innate ClpB unfolding activity, the NBD-1 pore tyrosine is required, and the presence of the N-domain is insufficient to overcome the defect of the ClpB Y251A mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2020710014,"Plant myosin XI functions as a motor that generates cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells. Although cytoplasmic streaming is known to be regulated by intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, the molecular mechanism underlying this control is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism of regulation of myosin XI by Ca(2+) at the molecular level. Actin filaments were easily detached from myosin XI in an in vitro motility assay at high Ca(2+) concentration (pCa 4) concomitant with the detachment of calmodulin light chains from the neck domains. Electron microscopic observations showed that myosin XI at pCa 4 shortened the neck domain by 30%. Single-molecule analysis revealed that the step size of myosin XI at pCa 4 was shortened to 27 nm under low load and to 22 nm under high load compared with 35 nm independent of the load for intact myosin XI. These results indicate that modulation of the mechanical properties of the neck domain is a key factor for achieving the Ca(2+)-induced regulation of cytoplasmic streaming."
https://openalex.org/W2145897826,"Renal fibrosis (RF) is thought to be a direct consequence of dedifferentiation of resident epithelial cells via an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Increased glomerular flow is a critical initiator of fibrogenesis. Yet, the responses of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) to fluid flow remain uncharacterized. Here, we investigate the effects of pathological shear stresses on the development of fibrosis in PTECs. Our data reveal that type I collagen accumulation in shear-activated PTECs is accompanied by a ∼40-60% decrease in cell motility, thus excluding EMT as a relevant pathological process. In contrast, static incubation of PTECs with TGFβ1 increases cell motility by ∼50%, and induces stable expression of key mesenchymal markers, including Snail1, N-cadherin, and vimentin. Ectopic expression of TGFβ1 in shear-activated PTECs fails to induce EMT-associated changes but abrogates collagen accumulation via SMAD2-dependent mechanisms. Shear-mediated inhibition of EMT occurs via cyclic oscillations in both ERK2 activity and downstream expression of EMT genes. A constitutive ERK2 mutant induces stable expression of Snail1, N-cadherin, and vimentin, and increases cell motility in shear-activated PTECs by 250% without concomitant collagen deposition. Collectively, our data reveal that RF not only occurs without EMT but also that these two responses represent mutually exclusive cell fates."
https://openalex.org/W2148081875,"Chiral β-amino acids occur as constituents of various natural and synthetic compounds with potentially useful bioactivities. The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent S-selective transaminase from Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK (MesAT) is a fold type I aminotransferase that can be used for the preparation of enantiopure β-Phe and derivatives thereof. Using x-ray crystallography, we solved structures of MesAT in complex with (S)-β-Phe, (R)-3-amino-5-methylhexanoic acid, 2-oxoglutarate, and the inhibitor 2-aminooxyacetic acid, which allowed us to unveil the molecular basis of the amino acid specificity and enantioselectivity of this enzyme. The binding pocket of the side chain of a β-amino acid is located on the 3'-oxygen side of the PLP cofactor. The same binding pocket is utilized by MesAT to bind the α-carboxylate group of an α-amino acid. A β-amino acid thus binds in a reverse orientation in the active site of MesAT compared with an α-amino acid. Such a binding mode has not been reported before for any PLP-dependent aminotransferase and shows that the active site of MesAT has specifically evolved to accommodate both β- and α-amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W1983419147,"Trafficking of NMDA receptors to the surface of neurons and to synapses is critical for proper brain function and activity-dependent plasticity. Recent evidence suggests that surface trafficking of other ionotropic glutamate receptors requires ligand binding for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we show that glutamate binding to GluN2 is required for trafficking of NMDA receptors to the cell surface. We expressed a panel of GluN2B ligand binding mutants in heterologous cells with GluN1 or in rat cultured neurons and found that surface expression correlates with glutamate efficacy. Such a correlation was found even in the presence of dominant negative dynamin to inhibit endocytosis and surface expression correlated with Golgi localization, indicating differences in forward trafficking. Co-expression of wild type GluN2B did not enhance surface expression of the mutants, suggesting that glutamate must bind to both GluN2 subunits in a tetramer and that surface expression is limited by the least avid of the two glutamate binding sites. Surface trafficking of a constitutively closed cleft GluN2B was indistinguishable from that of wild type, suggesting that glutamate concentrations are typically not limiting for forward trafficking. YFP-GluN2B expressed in hippocampal neurons from GluN2B(-/-) mice rescued synaptic accumulation at similar levels to wild type. Under these conditions, surface synaptic accumulation of YFP-GluN2B mutants also correlated with apparent glutamate affinity. Altogether, these results indicate that glutamate controls forward trafficking of NMDA receptors to the cell surface and to synapses and raise the intriguing idea that NMDA receptors may be functional at intracellular sites."
https://openalex.org/W2012415856,"In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in proteasome inhibitors as a novel class of anticancer drugs. We report that fenbendazole (FZ) (methyl N-(6-phenylsulfanyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate) exhibits a potent growth-inhibitory activity against cancer cell lines but not normal cells. We show here, using fluorogenic substrates, that FZ treatment leads to the inhibition of proteasomal activity in the cells. Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-methylcoumarinamide (MCA), benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-7-amido-4-MCA, and t-butoxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amido-4-MCA fluorescent derivatives were used to assess chymotrypsin-like, post-glutamyl peptidyl-hydrolyzing, and trypsin-like protease activities, respectively. Non-small cell lung cancer cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding pd1EGFP and treated with FZ showed an accumulation of the green fluorescent protein in the cells due to an increase in its half-life. A number of apoptosis regulatory proteins that are normally degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway like cyclins, p53, and IκBα were found to be accumulated in FZ-treated cells. In addition, FZ induced distinct ER stress-associated genes like GRP78, GADD153, ATF3, IRE1α, and NOXA in these cells. Thus, treatment of human NSCLC cells with fenbendazole induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, reactive oxygen species production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release that eventually led to cancer cell death. This is the first report to demonstrate the inhibition of proteasome function and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress/reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines by fenbendazole, which may represent a new class of anticancer agents showing selective toxicity against cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078679682,"Membrane-embedded β-barrel proteins are found in the outer membranes (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. In eukaryotic cells, precursors of these proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and have to be sorted to their corresponding organelle. Currently, the signal that ensures their specific targeting to either mitochondria or chloroplasts is ill-defined. To address this issue, we studied targeting of the chloroplast β-barrel proteins Oep37 and Oep24. We found that both proteins can be integrated in vitro into isolated plant mitochondria. Furthermore, upon their expression in yeast cells Oep37 and Oep24 were exclusively located in the mitochondrial OM. Oep37 partially complemented the growth phenotype of yeast cells lacking Porin, the general metabolite transporter of this membrane. Similarly to mitochondrial β-barrel proteins, Oep37 and Oep24 expressed in yeast cells were assembled into the mitochondrial OM in a pathway dependent on the TOM and TOB complexes. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the central mitochondrial components that mediate the import of yeast β-barrel proteins can deal with precursors of chloroplast β-barrel proteins. This implies that the mitochondrial import machinery does not recognize signals that are unique to mitochondrial β-barrel proteins. Our results further suggest that dedicated targeting factors had to evolve in plant cells to prevent mis-sorting of chloroplast β-barrel proteins to mitochondria."

By analogy to elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), SelB is expected to control the delivery and release of Sec-tRNA(Sec) to the ribosome by the structural switch between GTP- and GDP-bound conformations. However, crystal structures of SelB suggested a similar domain arrangement in the apo form and GDP- and GTP-bound forms of the factor, raising the question of how SelB can fulfill its delivery function. Here, we studied the thermodynamics of guanine nucleotide binding to SelB by isothermal titration calorimetry in the temperature range between 10 and 25 °C using GTP, GDP, and two nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, guanosine 5'-O-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) and guanosine 5'-(β,γ-imido)-triphosphate (GDPNP). The binding of SelB to either guanine nucleotide is characterized by a large heat capacity change (-621, -467, -235, and -275 cal × mol(-1) × K(-1), with GTP, GTPγS, GDPNP, and GDP, respectively), associated with compensatory changes in binding entropy and enthalpy. Changes in heat capacity indicate a large decrease of the solvent-accessible surface area in SelB, amounting to 43 or 32 amino acids buried upon binding of GTP or GTPγS, respectively, and 15-19 amino acids upon binding GDP or GDPNP. The similarity of the GTP and GDP forms in the crystal structures can be attributed to the use of GDPNP, which appears to induce a structure of SelB that is more similar to the GDP than to the GTP-bound form."

A combination of biochemical and structural approaches enabled us to demonstrate that CpG methylation decreases I-CreI DNA binding affinity and inhibits its endonuclease activity in vitro. This inhibition depends on the position of the methylated cytosine within the DNA target and was almost total when it is located inside the central tetrabase. Crystal structures of I-CreI bound to methylated cognate target DNA suggested a molecular basis for such inhibition, although the precise mechanism still has to be specified. Finally, we demonstrated that the efficacy of engineered meganucleases can be diminished by CpG methylation of the targeted endogenous site, and we proposed a rational design of the meganuclease DNA binding domain to alleviate such an effect.

There are three tyrosine residues (32, 91, and 96) clustered in the dimer interface, interacting differently in the two light chain proteins due to their two different dimer conformations. These tyrosines may be ionized at pH 10, causing repulsion and inhibiting fibril formation. Here, we characterize single and double Tyr-to-Phe mutations in AL-09 and AL-103. All AL-09 Tyr-to-Phe mutants form fibrils at pH 10, whereas none of the AL-103 mutants form fibrils at pH 10.

We expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the yeast Spf1 P5A-ATPase containing the GFP fused at the N-terminal end. The GFP-Spf1 protein was localized in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Purified preparations of GFP-Spf1 hydrolyzed ATP at a rate of ~0.3-1 μmol of P(i)/mg/min and formed a phosphoenzyme in a simple reaction medium containing no added metal ions except Mg(2+). No significant differences were found between the ATPase activity of GFP-Spf1 and recombinant Spf1. Omission of protease inhibitors from the purification buffers resulted in a high level of endogenous proteolysis at the C-terminal portion of the GFP-Spf1 molecule that abolished phosphoenzyme formation. The Mg(2+) dependence of the GFP-Spf1 ATPase was similar to that of other P-ATPases where Mg(2+) acts as a cofactor. The addition of Mn(2+) to the reaction medium decreased the ATPase activity. The enzyme manifested optimal activity at a near neutral pH. When chased by the addition of cold ATP, 90% of the phosphoenzyme remained stable after 5 s. In contrast, the phosphoenzyme rapidly decayed to less than 20% when chased for 3 s by the addition of ADP. The greater effect of ADP accelerating the disappearance of EP suggests that GFP-Spf1 accumulated the E1~P phosphoenzyme.

Although mitochondria are also known to participate in the catabolism of fatty acids via β-oxidation, differences exist between the peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation. Only peroxisomes, but not mitochondrion, can shorten very long chain fatty acids. Here, we describe the crystal structure of a ternary complex of peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductases (pDCR) with hexadienoyl CoA and NADP, as a prototype for comparison with the mitochondrial 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase (mDCR) to shed light on the differences between the enzymes from the two organelles at the molecular level. Unexpectedly, the structure of pDCR refined to 1.84 Å resolution reveals the absence of the tyrosine-serine pair seen in the active site of mDCR, which together with a lysine and an asparagine have been deemed a hallmark of the SDR family of enzymes. Instead, aspartate hydrogen-bonded to the Cα hydroxyl via a water molecule seems to perturb the water molecule for protonation of the substrate. Our studies provide the first structural evidence for participation of water in the DCR-catalyzed reactions. Biochemical studies and structural analysis suggest that pDCRs can catalyze the shortening of six-carbon-long substrates in vitro. However, the K(m) values of pDCR for short chain acyl CoAs are at least 6-fold higher than those for substrates with 10 or more aliphatic carbons. Unlike mDCR, hinge movements permit pDCR to process very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids."

The β1-4-galactosyltransferase-I (β4Gal-T1) enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of the N-acetyllactosamine moiety. To understand its oligosaccharide acceptor specificity, we have previously investigated the binding of tri- and pentasaccharides of N-glycan with a GlcNAc at their nonreducing end and found that the extended sugar moiety in these acceptor substrates binds to the crevice present at the acceptor substrate binding site of the β4Gal-T1 molecule. Here we report seven crystal structures of β4Gal-T1 in complex with an oligosaccharide acceptor with a nonreducing end GlcNAc that has a β1-6-glycosidic link and that are analogous to either N-glycan or i/I-antigen. In the crystal structure of the complex of β4Gal-T1 with I-antigen analog pentasaccharide, the β1-6-branched GlcNAc moiety is bound to the sugar acceptor binding site of the β4Gal-T1 molecule in a way similar to the crystal structures described previously; however, the extended linear tetrasaccharide moiety does not interact with the previously found extended sugar binding site on the β4Gal-T1 molecule. Instead, it interacts with the different hydrophobic surface of the protein molecule formed by the residues Tyr-276, Trp-310, and Phe-356.

ProP attains the same activity at the same osmolality when the medium outside cells or proteoliposomes is supplemented with diverse, membrane-impermeant solutes. The osmosensory mechanism of ProP has been probed by varying the solvent within membrane vesicles and proteoliposomes. ProP activation was not ion specific, did not require K(+), and could be elicited by large, uncharged solutes polyethylene glycols (PEGS). We hypothesized that ProP is an ionic strength sensor and lumenal macromolecules activate ProP by altering ion activities. The attainable range of lumenal ionic strength was expanded by lowering the phosphate concentration within proteoliposomes. ProP activity at high osmolality, but not the osmolality, yielding half-maximal activity (Π(1/2)/RT), decreased with the lumenal phosphate concentration. This was attributed to acidification of the proteoliposome lumen due to H(+)-proline symport. The ionic strength yielding half-maximal ProP activity was more anion-dependent than Π(1/2)/RT for proteoliposomes loaded with citrate, sulfate, phosphate, chloride, or iodide. The anion effects followed the Hofmeister series. Lumenal bovine serum albumin (BSA) lowered the lumenal ionic strength at which ProP became active. Osmolality measurements documented the non-idealities of solutions including potassium phosphate and other solutes. The impacts of PEGS and BSA on ion activities did not account for their impacts on ProP activity. The effects of the tested solutes on ProP appear to be non-coulombic in nature. They may arise from effects of preferential interactions and macromolecular crowding on the membrane or on ProP."

This loss of function is due to a biochemical defect, not to destabilization or mistargeting of the mutant GFR protein. Mass spectrometry and HPLC analysis showed that nac1 mutants lack not only core α1,3-linked, but also core α1,6-linked fucose residues on their N-glycans. Thus, the nac1 Gfr mutation produces a previously unrecognized general defect in N-glycan core fucosylation. Transgenic expression of a wild-type Gfr gene restored the HRP epitope in neural tissues, directly demonstrating that the Gfr mutation is solely responsible for the neural HRP epitope deficiency in the nac1 mutant. These results validate the Drosophila nac1 mutant as a model for the human congenital disorder of glycosylation, CDG-IIc (also known as LAD-II), which is also the result of a GFR deficiency. Studying genetic disorders in model organisms can provide insights into heritable human diseases.

Inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate is implicated in crucial processes such as mRNA export, DNA editing, and phosphorus storage in plants. We previously solved the first structure of an IP5 2-K, which shed light on aspects of substrate recognition. However, failure of IP5 2-K to crystallize in the absence of inositide prompted us to study putative conformational changes upon substrate binding. We have made mutations to residues on a region of the protein that produces a clasp over the active site. A W129A mutant allowed us to capture IP5 2-K in its different conformations by crystallography. Thus, the IP5 2-K apo-form structure displays an open conformation, whereas the nucleotide-bound form shows a half-closed conformation, in contrast to the inositide-bound form obtained previously in a closed conformation. Both nucleotide and inositide binding produce large conformational changes that can be understood as two rigid domain movements, although local changes were also observed. Changes in intrinsic fluorescence upon nucleotide and inositide binding are in agreement with the crystallographic findings. Our work suggests that the clasp might be involved in enzyme kinetics, with the N-terminal lobe being essential for inositide binding and subsequent conformational changes. We also show how IP5 2-K discriminates between inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate enantiomers and that substrate preference can be manipulated by Arg130 mutation. Altogether, these results provide a framework for rational design of specific inhibitors with potential applications as biological tools for in vivo studies, which could assist in the identification of novel roles for IP5 2-K in mammals.

https://openalex.org/W2045837454,"Chlorella virus DNA ligase (ChVLig) is an instructive model for mechanistic studies of the ATP-dependent DNA ligase family. ChVLig seals 3′-OH and 5′-PO4 termini via three chemical steps: 1) ligase attacks the ATP α phosphorus to release PPi and form a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate; 2) AMP is transferred to the nick 5′-phosphate to form DNA-adenylate; 3) the 3′-OH of the nick attacks DNA-adenylate to join the polynucleotides and release AMP. Each chemical step requires Mg2+. Kinetic analysis of nick sealing by ChVLig-AMP revealed that the rate constant for phosphodiester synthesis (kstep3 = 25 s−1) exceeds that for DNA adenylylation (kstep2 = 2.4 s−1) and that Mg2+ binds with similar affinity during step 2 (Kd = 0.77 mm) and step 3 (Kd = 0.87 mm). The rates of DNA adenylylation and phosphodiester synthesis respond differently to pH, such that step 3 becomes rate-limiting at pH ≤ 6.5. The pH profiles suggest involvement of one and two protonation-sensitive functional groups in catalysis of steps 2 and 3, respectively. We suggest that the 5′-phosphate of the nick is the relevant protonation-sensitive moiety and that a dianionic 5′-phosphate is necessary for productive step 2 catalysis. Motif VI, located at the C terminus of the OB-fold domain of ChVLig, is a conserved feature of ATP-dependent DNA ligases and GTP-dependent mRNA capping enzymes.

The N-terminal NTase domain (amino acids 1–189), which performs the chemical steps of ligation, binds the major groove flanking the nick and the minor groove on the 3′-OH side of the nick (see Fig. 1A). The NTase active site is composed of a cage of β strands and interstrand loops that include six peptide motifs (I, Ia, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that define the covalent nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (DNA ligases, RNA ligases, and mRNA capping enzymes) (9.Shuman S.

The C-terminal OB domain of ChVLig, composed of a five-strand antiparallel β barrel and an α helix, engages the DNA minor groove on the face of the duplex behind the nick (see Fig. 1A). The OB domain also makes functionally important contacts to amino acids in the NTase domain surrounding the ligase active site, e.g. the salt bridge from Arg-285 in the OB domain to Asp-29 in motif I of the NTase domain (see Fig. 1B) (13.Samai P.

The latch module, consisting of a β hairpin loop (amino acids 203–231) that emanates from the OB domain, occupies the DNA major groove flanking the nick. Residues at the tip of the latch contact the NTase domain to close the ligase clamp. An extensive structure-guided mutational analysis of ChVLig has illuminated the contributions of the amino acid side chains that (i) directly promote catalysis of one or more of the chemical steps in the ligation pathway; (ii) comprise the extended ligase DNA footprint and make atomic contacts with the 3′-OH and 5′-phosphate strands or the continuous template strand; (iii) elicit conformational distortion of the DNA in the vicinity of the nick; and (iv) form or stabilize the ligase clamp. Such studies have employed in vivo and in vitro readouts of the composite ChVLig nick sealing activity, plus biochemical assays of isolated steps in the ligase pathway (3.Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L.

The observed step 2 and step 3 rate constants (kstep2 and kstep3) for wild-type ChVLig were 2.4 s−1 and 24 s−1, respectively (14.Sriskanda V. Shuman S.

Thus, the attack of the nick 3′-OH on AppDNA is an order of magnitude faster than the formation of AppDNA. Similar single-turnover kinetic studies have been performed for human DNA ligase I (HuLig1) (15.Taylor M.R. Conrad J.A. Wahl D. O'Brien P.J.

It would appear that diverse ATP-dependent DNA ligases have similar kinetic properties with respect to steps 2 and 3. Kinetic analysis of nick sealing by a large collection of ChVLig mutants revealed the quantitative contributions of individual functional groups to step 2 and step 3 catalysis and, in some instances, a selective negative impact of mutations on step 3 versus step 2 or vice versa (11.Sriskanda V.

The aims of the present study were two-fold. First, we sought to determine the effects of varying the divalent cation concentration and the pH on the rates of steps 2 and 3 and thereby gain insights to the catalytic mechanism. At least one magnesium ion is needed for each of the three steps of the composite ligation reaction. A two-metal model for step 1 ligase-adenylylation has been proposed, wherein one Mg2+ is coordinated by the β and γ phosphates of the ATP substrate and another “catalytic” Mg2+ engages the ATP α phosphate to stabilize the transition state of the step 1 reaction (17.Cherepanov A.V. de Vries S. Kinetic mechanism of the Mg2+-dependent nucleotidyl transfer catalyzed by T4 DNA and RNA ligases.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1695-1704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T4 RNA ligase 1 bound to AMPPNP and two metal ions is consistent with this idea (18.El Omari K. Ren J. Bird L.E. Bona M.K. Klarmann G. LeGrice S.F. Stammers D.K. Molecular architecture and ligand recognition determinants for T4 RNA ligase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1573-1579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whereas the noncatalytic Mg2+ is likely to exit with the PPi leaving group after step 1 is completed, it is reasonable to think that the single catalytic metal ion remains bound to ligase and the AMP phosphate during catalysis of steps 2 and 3. The available evidence is that the catalytic metal ion is coordinated at every step by the invariant essential carboxylate side chain of motif IV (161EGVMI in ChVLig) and, at least during steps 2 and 3, by the motif I aspartate (27KxDG in ChVLig) (5.Odell M.

The motif IV glutamate, the motif I aspartate, and the AMP phosphate together coordinate a zinc ion in the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis LigD-AMP (19.Akey D. Martins A. Aniukwu J. Glickman M.S. Shuman S. Berger J.M. Crystal structure and nonhomologous end-joining function of the ligase component of mycobacterium DNA ligase D.J. Biol.

In the crystal structure of ChVLig-AMP bound to nicked DNA, a water molecule (colored magenta in Fig. 1B) occupies the putative catalytic Mg2+ site, wherein it is coordinated by motif IV Glu-161, motif I Asp-29, the AMP phosphate, and the nick 3′-OH (8.Nair P.A.

Biol. 2007; 14: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mg2+ in this position would be well poised to stabilize the transition state of the AMP phosphate during step 2 DNA adenylylation and to activate the 3′-OH nucleophile during step 3 phosphodiester synthesis. We were especially interested in the effects of Mg2+ concentration in light of the report that limiting Mg2+ changes the rate-limiting step for nick sealing by HuLig1 in such a way as to potentially compromise genome stability (15.Taylor M.R.

Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of the effects of pH on the rates of the chemical steps that places this phenomenon on firmer mechanistic grounds. Second, we interrogated the role of nucleotidyltransferase motif VI (located at the C terminus of the OB domain of ChVLig) during the three-step ligation pathway. Motif VI (typically RxDK) is a shared feature of the OB domains of ATP-dependent DNA ligases and GTP-dependent mRNA capping enzymes (Fig. 2A). Motif VI arginine and lysine side chains contact the β and γ phosphates of the GTP substrate in the crystal structure of Chlorella virus capping enzyme (Fig. 2B), and this interaction orients the PPi leaving group apical to the attacking motif I lysine during the step 1 enzyme nucleotidylation reaction (23.Håkansson K.

X-ray crystallography reveals a large conformational change during guanyl transfer by mRNA capping enzymes.Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Alanine mutations of the motif VI arginines, lysine, and aspartate residues eliminate capping enzyme activity in vivo (24.Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Phylogeny of mRNA capping enzymes.Proc.

Mutational analysis of the guanylyltransferase component of mammalian mRNA capping enzyme.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and capping enzyme-GMP adduct formation in vitro (25.Sawaya R. Shuman S. Mutational analysis of the guanylyltransferase component of mammalian mRNA capping enzyme.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although it is thought that motif VI plays an analogous role in step 1 of the DNA ligase pathway (14.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Mutational analysis of Chlorella virus DNA ligase: Catalytic roles of domain I and motif VI.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), no structure of a productive Lig·ATP complex is available for DNA ligases to affirm this idea. In the ChVLig-AMP and ChV-AMP-DNA crystal structures, the C-terminal residues of the motif VI peptide (which follows the last β strand of the OB domain; Fig. 2) are disordered (6.Odell M.

Yet, we do know that the OB domain of ChVLig-AMP undergoes a large rigid-body rotation during DNA binding and clamp closure that places the C terminus (and motif VI) well away from the DNA (6.Odell M.

Here, we tested a series of motif VI mutations for their impact on nick sealing by ChVLig under transient state and steady state conditions and on ligase adenylylation. Wild-type and mutant ChVLig proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography (4.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Chlorella virus DNA ligase: Nick recognition and mutational analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of the ChVLig preparations were determined as described previously (12.Samai P. Shuman S.

The detailed methods and purity data are provided in supplemental Fig. S1. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 pmol of 32P-labeled singly nicked 36-bp duplex DNA substrate (Fig. 3; prepared as described (28.Shuman S. Vaccinia virus DNA ligase: Specificity, fidelity, and inhibition.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)), and wild-type or mutant ChVLig as specified were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C. Single-turnover nick ligation mixtures lacked exogenous ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ChVLig and quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 90% formamide, 40 mm EDTA. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 45 mm Tris borate, 1.25 mm EDTA. The extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Ligation was plotted as a function of input ChVLig, with each datum being the average of three separate enzyme titration experiments. The specific activities of the wild-type and mutant ligases in ATP-dependent nick sealing were determined from the slopes of the titration curves in the linear range of enzyme dependence. The activities of the mutant ligases were normalized to the specific activity of wild-type ChVLig protein (defined as 100%) that was purified in parallel with that mutant and assayed in parallel using the same preparation of radiolabeled DNA substrate. The concentrations of preformed Lig-AMP in the enzyme preparations were determined from the slopes of the titrations curves obtained in the absence of added ATP. A Kintek RQF3 rapid chemical quench apparatus was used to assay the reaction of nicked DNA with a 10-fold molar excess of preformed Lig-AMP at 22 °C in the absence of added ATP, with reaction times in the range of 0.1 to 5 s. Where applicable, longer reaction times were assayed manually. The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 nm wild-type Lig-AMP, and 50 nm 32P-5′-nick-labeled DNA substrate. The rapid kinetic measurements were initiated by mixing two solutions (20 μl each) of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, containing 100 nm nicked DNA substrate and 1 μm ChVLig-AMP, respectively. The reactions were quenched by rapid mixing with 110 μl of 90% formamide, 50 mm"
