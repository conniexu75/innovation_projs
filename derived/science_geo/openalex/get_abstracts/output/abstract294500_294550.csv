https://openalex.org/W2004394451,"Several categories of biological microstructures 1.9+/- billion years old are here described, illustrated, and referred to a group of early thallophytes that includes the thread bacteria and the blue-green algae. These microstructures were almost surely autotrophic and in the line of evolution toward green-plant photosynthesis, if not themselves oxygen producers. Geochemical evidence has been interpreted by some to imply that the contemporaneous atmosphere was essentially anoxygenic (reducing), and by others to indicate an atmosphere rich in oxygen. These conflicting interpretations may be reconciled by a hypothesis, based on demonstrable fossil organisms, that calls for local centers of biologic oxygen generation."
https://openalex.org/W1978932938,"Normal paraffins in the C(16) to C(32) range and the saturated isoprenoid hydrocarbons, pristane and phytane, have been found in chert from the Gunflint iron formation (1.9 x 10(9) years old) of the north shore of Lake Superior. The distribution of n-alkanes shows two maxima, one at about C(18) to C(19) and the other at about C(22) with a minimum occurring at C(20) to C(21). No predominance of odd- to even-carbon-number alkanes is observed within the C(16) to C(32) range. The results agree with micropaleontological observations made on the Gunflint chert and provide a chemical characterization of Precambrian life existing about two eons ago."

https://openalex.org/W1984666765,"The discoveries of a series of hominid remains in the Olduvai Gorge, Tanganyika, has focused attention upon the age of the deposits of Bed 1, in which both Zinjanthropus and Homo habilis were found. Because the age of 1.75 million years, as determined by the radioactive decay of potassium and argon, has been questioned several times, a fission-track age was measured for the pumice from Bed 1. The result is 2.03 +/- 0.28 million years, in good agreement with the result obtained by the potassium-argon decay method."

https://openalex.org/W1973785039,A quantitative measure of the Lewis acidity of common organic solvents is given by the equilibrium constant for complex formation between the solvent and a Ï€-donor such as an aromatic hydrocarbon. Lewis acidities are reported for 12 solvents from new distribution and vapor-pressure measurements.
https://openalex.org/W1970105061,Evaporation retardants interspersed in a solid or semisolid matrix of water-soluble material allow discrete particles of retardant to be released at a controlled rate as the matrix dissolves. This system permits the continuous application of evaporation retardants to a water surface without the use of mechanical devices.

The bodies are plausibly organic because of constancy of form, manner of fossilization, and similarities to Michigan forms associated with extractable organic compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1971528662,"The plus factors of the federal personnel system for scientists may be summarized briefly as follows. 1) We have a modern, progressive personnel system which compares very favorably in most respects with that of a good private laboratory. 2) Although our pay scale may still be a little below that of private employment, great progress has been made in the past 3 years, and we are now catching up rather than falling further behind. 3) We do about as well as private employment with respect to benefits such as group life insurance, health insurance, and retirement, although some companies pay a larger share of the costs. 4) We have a generous and flexible leave system. 5) We are especially strong on promotion programs, incentive awards, and career development opportunities on the basis of merit and demonstrated competence."
