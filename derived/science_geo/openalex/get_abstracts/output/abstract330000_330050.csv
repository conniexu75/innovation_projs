https://openalex.org/W2087213018,"Clinoenstatite undergoes a metastable displacive inversion at 995 degrees C. The new phase can be indexed (from x-ray powder pattern) on a triclinic cell with dimensions a = 10.00 A; b = 8.934 A; c = 5.170 A; alpha = 88.27 degrees ; beta = 70.03 degrees ; gamma = 91.09 degrees . The new phase persists from 995 degrees to 1010 degrees C at the composition MgSiO(3). For a solid solution (15 percent by weight) of diopside in clinoenstatite, the new phase persists from 995 degrees to at least 1400 degrees C and does not invert in periods of several hours to protoenstatite, the phase previously thought to be the stable form in this region."

https://openalex.org/W1989484685,"The new spectroscopy is in its infancy, and many fascinating aspects are yet to be studied. The properties of thin films may be studied by means of the excitation they induce in a given kind of beam. The production of ions with but a single electron offers a means of carefully mapping the nuclear charge distribution without the complications introduced by the normal complement of electrons. The study of high-purity, multiply ionized particles should make for better temperature determinations in hot plasmas. Possibly the data on lifetimes and modes of decay of excited energy levels may assist in the quantitative assignment of element abundances in the stars. One can even attempt to use the glowing beams as sources for absorption spectroscopy. The method seems to permit study of every stage of excitation for every stage of ionization for every element in the periodic table. Practical problems may interfere with so complete a study, but a major extension of our knowledge of atomic structure seems to be at hand."

Calculations based on estimates of recent influx of dust to the earth, quiet solar-wind intensity, argon abundance in the solar wind, and assumed Poynting-Robertson lifetimes of small particles in space agree within a factor of 5 with the present amounts of argon-36 and argon-38 in the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2091686086,"A transverse electrical potential develops in many plant organs after they are reoriented from a vertical to a horizontal position. This phenomenon has been the basis for both a geoelectric hypothesis of geotropic curvature and its subsequent refutation. In both arguments a causal relation between the potential and curvature has been assumed. Curvature occurs in the absence of potential, as well as vice versa; it is concluded that both the hypothesis and its refutation are incorrect."
