https://openalex.org/W2172060930,"Loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene (PARK2) and PINK1 gene (PARK6) are associated with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. PINK1 deficiency was recently linked to mitochondrial pathology in human cells and Drosophila melanogaster, which can be rescued by parkin, suggesting that both genes play a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Here we demonstrate that an acute down-regulation of parkin in human SH-SY5Y cells severely affects mitochondrial morphology and function, a phenotype comparable with that induced by PINK1 deficiency. Alterations in both mitochondrial morphology and ATP production caused by either parkin or PINK1 loss of function could be rescued by the mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn2 and OPA1 or by a dominant negative mutant of the fission protein Drp1. Both parkin and PINK1 were able to suppress mitochondrial fragmentation induced by Drp1. Moreover, in Drp1-deficient cells the parkin/PINK1 knockdown phenotype did not occur, indicating that mitochondrial alterations observed in parkin- or PINK1-deficient cells are associated with an increase in mitochondrial fission. Notably, mitochondrial fragmentation is an early phenomenon upon PINK1/parkin silencing that also occurs in primary mouse neurons and Drosophila S2 cells. We propose that the discrepant findings in adult flies can be explained by the time of phenotype analysis and suggest that in mammals different strategies may have evolved to cope with dysfunctional mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2078178166,"Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) causing a pseudotuberculous lung disease to which patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are particularly susceptible. We report here its complete genome sequence. The genome of M. abscessus (CIP 104536T) consists of a 5,067,172-bp circular chromosome including 4920 predicted coding sequences (CDS), an 81-kb full-length prophage and 5 IS elements, and a 23-kb mercury resistance plasmid almost identical to pMM23 from Mycobacterium marinum. The chromosome encodes many virulence proteins and virulence protein families absent or present in only small numbers in the model RGM species Mycobacterium smegmatis. Many of these proteins are encoded by genes belonging to a “mycobacterial” gene pool (e.g. PE and PPE proteins, MCE and YrbE proteins, lipoprotein LpqH precursors). However, many others (e.g. phospholipase C, MgtC, MsrA, ABC Fe(3+) transporter) appear to have been horizontally acquired from distantly related environmental bacteria with a high G+C content, mostly actinobacteria (e.g. Rhodococcus sp., Streptomyces sp.) and pseudomonads. We also identified several metabolic regions acquired from actinobacteria and pseudomonads (relating to phenazine biosynthesis, homogentisate catabolism, phenylacetic acid degradation, DNA degradation) not present in the M. smegmatis genome. Many of the “non mycobacterial” factors detected in M. abscessus are also present in two of the pathogens most frequently isolated from CF patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. This study elucidates the genetic basis of the unique pathogenicity of M. abscessus among RGM, and raises the question of similar mechanisms of pathogenicity shared by unrelated organisms in CF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2145652787,"The nucleation of microtubules requires protein complexes containing γ-tubulin, which are present in the cytoplasm and associate with the centrosome and with the mitotic spindle. We have previously shown that these interactions require the γ-tubulin targeting factor GCP-WD/NEDD1, which has an essential role in spindle formation. The recruitment of additional γ-tubulin to the centrosomes occurs during centrosome maturation at the G2/M transition and is regulated by the mitotic kinase Plk1. However, the molecular details of this important pathway are unknown and a Plk1 substrate that controls γ-tubulin recruitment has not been identified. Here we show that Plk1 associates with GCP-WD in mitosis and Plk1 activity contributes to phosphorylation of GCP-WD. Plk1 depletion or inhibition prevents accumulation of GCP-WD at mitotic centrosomes, but GCP-WD mutants that are defective in Plk1-binding and -phosphorylation still accumulate at mitotic centrosomes and recruit γ-tubulin. Moreover, Plk1 also controls the recruitment of other PCM proteins implicated in centrosomal γ-tubulin attachment (Cep192/hSPD2, pericentrin, Cep215/Cdk5Rap2). Our results support a model in which Plk1-dependent recruitment of γ-tubulin to mitotic centrosomes is regulated upstream of GCP-WD, involves multiple PCM proteins and therefore potentially multiple Plk1 substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2089877898,"Although behavioral risk factors are strongly associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) risk, the role of genetics in acquiring this disease is poorly understood.To test the hypothesis that polymorphisms in Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway genes are associated with susceptibility to UTIs, we conducted a population-based case-control study of women ages 18-49 years. We examined DNA variants in 9 TLR pathway genes in 431 recurrent cystitis (rUTI) cases, 400 pyelonephritis cases, and 430 controls with no history of UTIs. In the Caucasian subgroup of 987 women, polymorphism TLR4_A896G was associated with protection from rUTI, but not pyelonephritis, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.54 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.31 to 0.96. Polymorphism TLR5_C1174T, which encodes a variant that abrogates flagellin-induced signaling, was associated with an increased risk of rUTI (OR(95%CI): 1.81 (1.00-3.08)), but not pyelonephritis. Polymorphism TLR1_G1805T was associated with protection from pyelonephritis (OR(95%CI): 0.53 (0.29-0.96)).These results provide the first evidence of associations of TLR5 and TLR1 variants with altered risks of acquiring rUTI and pyelonephritis, respectively. Although these data suggest that TLR polymorphisms are associated with adult susceptibility to UTIs, the statistical significance was modest and will require further study including validation with independent cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2022291383,"The ATP-activated P2X7 receptor channel is involved in immune function and inflammatory pain and represents an important drug target. Here we describe a new P2X7 splice variant (P2X7(k)), containing an alternative intracellular N terminus and first transmembrane domain encoded by a novel exon 1 in the rodent P2rx7 gene. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of the rat isoform expressed in HEK293 cells revealed an 8-fold higher sensitivity to the agonist Bz-ATP and much slower deactivation kinetics when compared with the P2X7(a) receptor. Permeability measurements in Xenopus oocytes show a high permeability for N-methyl-d-glucamine immediately upon activation, suggesting that the P2X7(k) channel is constitutively dilated upon opening. The rates of agonist-induced dye uptake and membrane blebbing in HEK cells were also increased. PCR analyses and biochemical analysis by SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGE indicate that the P2X7(k) variant escapes gene deletion in one of the available P2X7−/− mice strains and is strongly expressed in the spleen. Taken together, we describe a novel P2X7 isoform with distinct functional properties that contributes to the diversity of P2X7 receptor signaling. Its presence in one of the P2X7−/− strains has important implications for our understanding of the role of this receptor in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2080941879,"Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential in the control of tolerance. Evidence implicates Tregs in human autoimmune conditions. Here we investigated their role in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods/Principal Findings Patients were subdivided as having limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc, n = 20) or diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc, n = 48). Further subdivision was made between early dcSSc (n = 24) and late dcSSc (n = 24) based upon the duration of disease. 26 controls were studied for comparison. CD3+ cells were isolated using FACS and subsequently studied for the expression of CD4, CD8, CD25, FoxP3, CD127, CD62L, GITR, CD69 using flow cytometry. T cell suppression assays were performed using sorted CD4CD25highCD127- and CD4CD25lowCD127high and CD3+ cells. Suppressive function was correlated with CD69 surface expression and TGFβ secretion/expression. The frequency of CD4+CD25+ and CD25highFoxP3highCD127neg T cells was highly increased in all SSc subgroups. Although the expression of CD25 and GITR was comparable between groups, expression of CD62L and CD69 was dramatically lower in SSc patients, which correlated with a diminished suppressive function. Co-incubation of Tregs from healthy donors with plasma from SSc patients fully abrogated suppressive activity. Activation of Tregs from healthy donors or SSc patients with PHA significantly up regulated CD69 expression that could be inhibited by SSc plasma. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that soluble factors in SSc plasma inhibit Treg function specifically that is associated with altered Treg CD69 and TGFβ expression. These data suggest that a defective Treg function may underlie the immune dysfunction in systemic sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2111577577,"Background The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (RAPA) promotes the expansion of CD4+ CD25highFoxp3+ regulatory T cells via mechanisms that remain unknown. Here, we studied expansion, IL-2R-γ chain signaling, survival pathways and resistance to apoptosis in human Treg responding to RAPA. Methodology/Principal Findings CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25neg T cells were isolated from PBMC of normal controls (n = 21) using AutoMACS. These T cell subsets were cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and 1000 IU/mL IL-2 for 3 to 6 weeks. RAPA (1–100 nM) was added to half of the cultures. After harvest, the cell phenotype, signaling via the PI3K/mTOR and STAT pathways, expression of survival proteins and Annexin V binding were determined and compared to values obtained with freshly-separated CD4+CD25high and CD4+CD25neg T cells. Suppressor function was tested in co-cultures with autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+CD25neg or CD8+CD25neg T-cell responders. The frequency and suppressor activity of Treg were increased after culture of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the presence of 1–100 nM RAPA (p<0.001). RAPA-expanded Treg were largely CD4+CD25highFoxp3+ cells and were resistant to apoptosis, while CD4+CD25neg T cells were sensitive. Only Treg upregulated anti-apoptotic and down-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins. Treg expressed higher levels of the PTEN protein than CD4+CD25neg cells. Activated Treg±RAPA preferentially phosphorylated STAT5 and STAT3 and did not utilize the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Conclusions/Significance RAPA favors Treg expansion and survival by differentially regulating signaling, proliferation and sensitivity to apoptosis of human effector T cells and Treg after TCR/IL-2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2010813562,"Hypoxia induces expression of the urokinase receptor (uPAR) and activates uPAR-dependent cell signaling in cancer cells. This process promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). uPAR overexpression in cancer cells also promotes EMT. In this study, we tested whether uPAR may be targeted to reverse cancer cell EMT. When MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cells were cultured in 1% O(2), uPAR expression increased, as anticipated. Cell-cell junctions were disrupted, vimentin expression increased, and E-cadherin was lost from cell surfaces, indicating EMT. Transferring these cells back to 21% O(2) decreased uPAR expression and reversed the signs of EMT. In uPAR-overexpressing MDA-MB 468 cells, EMT was reversed by silencing expression of endogenously produced urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which is necessary for uPAR-dependent cell signaling, or by targeting uPAR-activated cell signaling factors, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src family kinases, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells express high levels of uPA and uPAR and demonstrate mesenchymal cell morphology under normoxic culture conditions (21% O(2)). Silencing uPA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased expression of vimentin and Snail, and induced changes in morphology characteristic of epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that uPAR-initiated cell signaling may be targeted to reverse EMT in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2028654716,"Background The systemic injection of neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) provides remarkable amelioration of the clinico-pathological features of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This is dependent on the capacity of transplanted NPCs to engage concurrent mechanisms of action within specific microenvironments in vivo. Among a wide range of therapeutic actions alternative to cell replacement, neuroprotective and immune modulatory capacities of transplanted NPCs have been described. However, lacking is a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which NPCs exert their therapeutic plasticity. This study was designed to identify the first candidate that exemplifies and sustains the immune modulatory capacity of transplanted NPCs. Methodology/Principal Findings To achieve the exclusive targeting of the peripheral immune system, SJL mice with PLP-induced EAE were injected subcutaneously with NPCs and the treatment commenced prior to disease onset. NPC-injected EAE mice showed significant clinical improvement, as compared to controls. Exogenous NPCs lacking the expression of major neural antigens were reliably (and for long-term) found at the level of draining lymph nodes, while establishing sophisticated anatomical interactions with lymph node cells. Importantly, injected NPCs were never found in organs other than lymph nodes, including the brain and the spinal cord. Draining lymph nodes from transplanted mice showed focal up-regulation of major developmental stem cell regulators, such as BMP-4, Noggin and Sonic hedgehog. In lymph nodes, injected NPCs hampered the activation of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and steadily restrained the expansion of antigen-specific encephalitogenic T cells. Both ex vivo and in vitro experiments identified a novel highly NPC-specific–BMP-4-dependent–mechanism hindering the DC maturation. Conclusion/Significance The study described herein, identifies the first member of the TGF β/BMP family of stem cell regulators as a novel tolerogenic factor released by NPCs. Full exploitation of this pathway as an efficient tool for vaccination therapy in autoimmune inflammatory conditions is underway."
https://openalex.org/W2018517476,"The side chain of vitamin D3 is hydroxylated in a sequential manner by cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1) to form 20-hydroxycholecalciferol, which can induce growth arrest and differentiation of both primary and immortalized epidermal keratinocytes. Since nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, we examined the capability of 20-hydroxycholecalciferol to modulate the activity of NF-κB, using 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) as a positive control. 20-hydroxycholecalciferol inhibits the activation of NFκB DNA binding activity as well as NF-κB-driven reporter gene activity in keratinocytes. Also, 20-hydroxycholecalciferol induced significant increases in the mRNA and protein levels of the NF-κB inhibitor protein, IκBα, in a time dependent manner, while no changes in total NF-κB-p65 mRNA or protein levels were observed. Another measure of NF-κB activity, p65 translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was also inhibited in extracts of 20-hydroxycholecalciferol treated keratinocytes. Increased IκBα was concomitantly observed in cytosolic extracts of 20-hydroxycholecalciferol treated keratinocytes, as determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining. In keratinocytes lacking vitamin D receptor (VDR), 20-hydroxycholecalciferol did not affect IκBα mRNA levels, indicating that it requires VDR for its action on NF-κB activity. Comparison of the effects of calcitrol, hormonally active form of vitamin D3, with 20-hydrocholecalciferol show that both agents have a similar potency in inhibiting NF-κB. Since NF-κB is a major transcription factor for the induction of inflammatory mediators, our findings indicate that 20-hydroxycholecalciferol may be an effective therapeutic agent for inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases."

S. suis is often misdiagnosed, due to lack of awareness and improper testing. Here we report the first fifty cases diagnosed with S. suis infection in northern Viet Nam.In 2007, diagnostics for S. suis were set up at a national hospital in Hanoi. That year there were 43 S. suis positive cerebrospinal fluid samples, of which S. suis could be cultured in 32 cases and 11 cases were only positive by PCR. Seven patients were blood culture positive for S. suis but CSF culture and PCR negative; making a total of 50 patients with laboratory confirmed S. suis infection in 2007. The number of S. suis cases peaked during the warmer months.S. suis was commonly diagnosed as a cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in northern Viet Nam. In countries where there is intense and widespread exposure of humans to pigs, S. suis can be an important human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2075739226,"When cells are subjected to nutritional stress, uncharged tRNAs accumulate and activate Gcn2p phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) and the general amino acid control pathway. The Gcn2p regulatory domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetases is proposed to bind to uncharged tRNA, directly contributing to activation of Gcn2p. Here we apply a microarray technology to analyze genome-wide changes in tRNA charging in yeast upon activation of Gcn2p in response to amino acid starvation and high salinity, a stress not directly linked to nutritional deficiency. This microarray technology is applicable for all eukaryotic cells. Strains were starved for histidine, leucine, or tryptophan and shown to rapidly induce Gcn2p phosphorylation of eIF2. The relative charging level of all tRNAs was measured before and after starvation, and Gcn2p activation and the intracellular levels of the starved amino acid correlate with the observed decrease in tRNA charging. Interestingly, in some cases, tRNAs not charged with the starved amino acid became deacylated more rapidly than tRNAs charged with the starved amino acid. This increase in uncharged tRNA levels occurred although the intracellular levels for these non-starved amino acids remained unchanged. Additionally, treatment of a wild-type strain with high salinity stress showed transient changes in the charging of several different tRNAs. These results suggest that Gcn2p can be activated by many different tRNA species in the cell. These results also depict a complex cellular relationship between tRNA charging, amino acid availability, and non-nutrient stress. These relationships are best revealed by simultaneous monitoring of the charging level of all tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2000222878,"Different classes of small RNAs (sRNAs) refine the expression of numerous genes in higher eukaryotes by directing protein partners to complementary nucleic acids, where they mediate gene silencing. Plants encode a unique class of sRNAs, called trans-acting small interfering RNAs (tasiRNAs), which post-transcriptionally regulate protein-coding transcripts, as do microRNAs (miRNAs), and both sRNA classes control development through their targets. TasiRNA biogenesis requires multiple components of the siRNA pathway and also miRNAs. But while 21mer siRNAs originating from transgenes can mediate silencing across several cell layers, miRNA action seems spatially restricted to the producing or closely surrounding cells.We have previously described the isolation of a genetrap reporter line for TAS3a, the major locus producing AUXIN RESPONS FACTOR (ARF)-regulating tasiRNAs in the Arabidopsis shoot. Its activity is limited to the adaxial (upper) side of leaf primordia, thus spatially isolated from ARF-activities, which are located in the abaxial (lower) side. We show here by in situ hybridization and reporter fusions that the silencing activities of ARF-regulating tasiRNAs are indeed manifested non-cell autonomously to spatially control ARF activities.Endogenous tasiRNAs are thus mediators of a mobile developmental signal and might provide effective gene silencing at a distance beyond the reach of most miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2167793054,"Background The insulin receptor is localized in caveolae and is dependent on caveolae or cholesterol for signaling in adipocytes. When stimulated with insulin, the receptor is internalized. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined primary rat adipocytes by subcellular fractionation to examine if the insulin receptor was internalized in a caveolae-mediated process. Insulin induced a rapid, t1/2<3 min, endocytosis of the insulin receptor in parallel with receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation. Concomitantly, caveolin-1 was phosphorylated at tyrosine(14) and endocytosed. Vanadate increased the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 without affecting insulin receptor phosphorylation or endocytosis. Immunocapture of endosomal vesicles with antibodies against the insulin receptor co-captured caveolin-1 and immunocapture with antibodies against tyrosine(14)-phosphorylated caveolin-1 co-captured the insulin receptor, demonstrating that the insulin receptor was endocytosed together with tyrosine(14)-phosphorylated caveolin-1. By immunogold electron microscopy the insulin receptor and caveolin-1 were colocalized in endosome vesicles that resembled caveosomes. Clathrin was not endocytosed with the insulin receptor and the inhibitor of clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine, did not inhibit internalization of the insulin receptor, while transferrin receptor internalization was inhibited. Conclusion It is concluded that in response to insulin stimulation the autophosphorylated insulin receptor in primary adipocytes is rapidly endocytosed in a caveolae-mediated process, involving tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1."
https://openalex.org/W1972968981,"Background The species Yersinia pestis is commonly divided into three classical biovars, Antiqua, Medievalis, and Orientalis, belonging to subspecies pestis pathogenic for human and the (atypical) non-human pathogenic biovar Microtus (alias Pestoides) including several non-pestis subspecies. Recent progress in molecular typing methods enables large-scale investigations in the population structure of this species. It is now possible to test hypotheses about its evolution which were proposed decades ago. For instance the three classical biovars of different geographical distributions were suggested to originate from Central Asia. Most investigations so far have focused on the typical pestis subspecies representatives found outside of China, whereas the understanding of the emergence of this human pathogen requires the investigation of strains belonging to subspecies pestis from China and to the Microtus biovar. Methodology/Principal Findings Multi-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) with 25 loci was performed on a collection of Y. pestis isolates originating from the majority of the known foci worldwide and including typical rhamnose-negative subspecies pestis as well as rhamnose-positive subspecies pestis and biovar Microtus. More than 500 isolates from China, the Former Soviet Union (FSU), Mongolia and a number of other foci around the world were characterized and resolved into 350 different genotypes. The data revealed very close relationships existing between some isolates from widely separated foci as well as very high diversity which can conversely be observed between nearby foci. Conclusions/Significance The results obtained are in full agreement with the view that the Y. pestis subsp. pestis pathogenic for humans emerged in the Central Asia region between China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia, only three clones of which spread out of Central Asia. The relationships among the strains in China, Central Asia and the rest of the world based on the MLVA25 assay provide an unprecedented view on the expansion and microevolution of Y. pestis."
https://openalex.org/W2062188669,"MicroRNAs are noncoding, endogenous small RNAs that regulate target genes by cleavage of the targeted mRNA or translational repression. We investigated the microRNAome using 2-color microarrays in a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (subline 4175) and a noninvasive breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. We found 13 microRNAs that were up-regulated, and nine were down-regulated significantly in 4175 cells (p < 0.05, -fold change >2) compared with MCF10A cells. Interestingly, miR-27b and its putative target gene, ST14 (suppressor of tumorigenicity 14), had inverse expression pattern in breast cancer cells. The 3'-untranslated region of ST14 contains a regulatory element for miR-27b, and our luciferase experiments indicate that antisense miR-27b enhances ST14 expression in cancer cells. Furthermore, antagomir of miR-27b suppressed cell invasion in 4175 cells, whereas pre-miR-27b stimulated invasion in moderately invasive ZR75 breast cancer cells. In addition, ST14 reduces cell proliferation as well as cell migration and invasion. Analysis of human breast tumors revealed that miR-27b expression increases during cancer progression, paralleling a decrease in ST14 expression. Furthermore, our data indicate that ST14 inhibits cells from entering into S phase by up-regulating p27, which results in down-regulation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, suggesting ST14 reduces cell growth through its effects on cell cycle-related proteins. Introduction of miR-27b into ST14-expressing cells did not suppress the effect on cell growth. These findings suggest that ST14 plays an important role in several biological processes, and some effects are not completely dependent on miR-27b regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2048096689,"Exocytosis of the acrosome (the acrosome reaction) relies on cAMP production, assembly of a proteinaceous fusion machinery, calcium influx from the extracellular medium, and mobilization from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores. Addition of cAMP to human sperm suspensions bypasses some of these requirements and elicits exocytosis in a protein kinase A- and extracellular calcium-independent manner. The relevant cAMP target is Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap. We show here that a soluble adenylyl cyclase synthesizes the cAMP required for the acrosome reaction. Epac stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rap1, upstream of a phospholipase C. The Epac-selective cAMP analogue 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP induces a phospholipase C-dependent calcium mobilization in human sperm suspensions.

The AR is a regulated exocytosis where the membrane of the acrosome, the single dense core secretory granule in sperm, fuses to the plasma membrane surrounding the anterior portion of the head. This process releases hydrolytic enzymes stored in the granule. These enzymes, together with the physical thrust derived from strong flagellar beating, enable sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida (1Florman H.M. Ducibella Elsevier-T. Neill J.D.

Moreover, calcium relies on endogenous cAMP to accomplish acrosomal release, and it does so through a PKA-insensitive pathway involving Epac. The stimulation of endogenous Epac by the selective cAMP analogue 8-(p-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP) is sufficient to trigger the AR even in the absence of extracellular calcium. Furthermore, when Epac is sequestered with specific antibodies, cAMP, calcium (8Branham M.T. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8656-8666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and recombinant Rab3A (this study) are unable to elicit exocytosis. Epac1 and Epac2 are multidomain proteins that consist of an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic region (9Bos J.L. Trends Biochem.

Like all small G proteins, Raps cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound conformation. The GDP-GTP cycle is regulated by GEFs that induce the release of the bound GDP to be replaced by the more abundant GTP and by GTPase-activating proteins that coax the intrinsic GTPase activity to rapidly hydrolyze bound GTP, returning the G proteins to the inactive GDP-bound state (18Quilliam L.A.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Most small G proteins are linked to biological membranes via lipid modifications at their C terminus; for instance, Rap2A is farnesylated, and Rap1A/B, Rap2B, and Rabs are geranylgeranylated (20Leung K.F.

Extracellular stimuli often result in the activation of cellular adenylate cyclases and an increase in cAMP levels. By serving as a cAMP-binding protein with intrinsic GEF activity, Epac couples cAMP production to a variety of Rap-mediated processes such as the control of cell adhesion and cell-cell junction formation, water resorption, cell differentiation, inflammatory processes, etc. (9Bos J.L.

Of particular interest to us is the observation that Epac stimulates phospholipase Cϵ (PLCϵ) through the activation of Rap1 and -2, resulting in IP3-mediated release of calcium from internal stores (23Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 24Oestreich E.A. Wang H. Malik S.

PLCϵ is an unusual enzyme with two catalytic activities as follows: the typical phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolyzing PLC activity plus a Rap-GEF activity. Thus, PLCϵ acts both downstream and upstream of Ras-like GTPases, perhaps to guarantee sustained Rap signaling (25Bunney T.D. Katan M. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). During membrane fusion, Rab proteins direct the recognition and physical attachments of the compartments that are going to fuse (26Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This association, or tethering, represents one of the earliest known events in membrane fusion and is accomplished through the recruitment of tethering factors. Rab3A localizes to vesicles and secretory granules and is one of the isoforms directly implicated in regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones (28Lang T. Jahn R. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2008; 184: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Rab3A interacts in a GTP-dependent manner with at least two effector proteins, rabphilin and Rim (29Regazzi R. Regazzi R.

Epac is a multifunctional protein in which cAMP exerts its effects not only by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rap but also by allosterically regulating other molecules (10Holz G.G. Kang G. Harbeck M. Roe M.W. Chepurny O.G. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In exocytosis for instance, a number of Rap-independent, Epac-linked signaling pathways have been described. They include the interaction of Epac2 with Rim2 (39Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat.

Iwanaga T. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50497-50502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Epac2 also stimulates exocytosis by interacting with SUR1 (41Eliasson L. Ma X. Renström E. Barg S. Berggren P.O. Galvanovskis J. Gromada J. Jing X. Lundquist I. Salehi A. Sewing S. Rorsman P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Finally, Epac2 controls ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels that are involved in calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from internal stores in insulin-secreting cells (42Kang G. Joseph J.W. Chepurny O.G. Monaco M. Wheeler M.B. Bos J.L. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Holz G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8279-8285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this study, we piece together the analysis of two phenomena as follows: calcium mobilization and protein-protein interactions preceding exocytosis. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first integrated molecular model that includes both the assembly of the fusion and intravesicular calcium release protein machineries during regulated exocytosis. By enquiring further into the signaling pathways operating during sperm exocytosis, we have found more players than previously suspected, and we discovered that the key components of these cascades are not arranged in a linear sequence. Epac sits at a central point of the signaling cascade after which the exocytotic pathway splits into two limbs as follows: one that assembles the fusion machinery into place, and another that elicits the release of calcium from the acrosome; both need to act in concert to achieve exocytosis. Our results identify Rab3A for the first time as a downstream target for Epac and place this small GTPase as an early component of the “fusion machinery” branch of the pathway. They also show that Epac stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rap1 and that this protein, as well as a PLC, drives intracellular calcium mobilization. Finally, our data reveal that a soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) (43Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 44Kamenetsky M. Middelhaufe S. Bank E.M. Levin L.R. Buck J. Steegborn C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) synthesizes the cAMP that activates Epac. Again, we believe that this is the first report linking sAC to an exocytotic event.

Epac1 (amino acids 149–881) and Epac2 (amino acids 280–993) were expressed as GST fusion proteins from the pGEX-4T2 vector in the Escherichia coli strain CK600K as described previously (47Kraemer A.

GST-Ral-GDS-RBD, GST-RIM, GST-PTP1B D181A, GST-Rap1A, and GST-GDI were transformed into E. coli BL21, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thio-galactoside (0.2 mm for the first two proteins and 0.1 mm for the rest) for 16 h at 22 °C. All GST-fused recombinant proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose following standard procedures, except GST-Ral-GDS-RBD and GST-RIM, where bacterial lysates were frozen until use. His6-NSF Y83E was expressed and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described for wild type NSF (49Zarelli V.E. Ruete M.C. Roggero C.M. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N. J. Biol.

Rab3A proteins were prenylated for all but the in vitro activation experiments and loaded with the appropriate guanosine nucleotides. Recombinant protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay in 96-well microplates. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard, and the results were quantified on a 3550 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad). Experiments were performed as described (50van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 51Rehmann H. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 407: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using Rab3A in addition to Rap1. Purified Rab3A or Rap1 (200 nm, GST removed with thrombin) loaded with the fluorescent GDP analogue mGDP was incubated in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled GDP plus 150 nm purified Epac1 or Epac2. Cyclic AMP (100–500 μm) was added as indicated. The nucleotide exchange was measured in real time as decay in fluorescence using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian, Varian B.V., Middelburg, The Netherlands). The decay is caused by the release of protein-bound mGDP, which shows higher fluorescence intensity in the hydrophobic environment of the protein than in the buffer solution. The decay in the fluorescence signal is equal to the rate of nucleotide dissociation, and nucleotide exchange should be accelerated in the presence of an active GEF. All data analysis, fitting, and plotting were done with the Grafit 3.0 program (Erithacus software). Human semen samples were obtained from normal healthy donors. Semen was allowed to liquify for 30–60 min at 37 °C. We used a swim-up protocol to isolate highly motile sperm. Sperm concentrations were adjusted to 5–10 × 106/ml before incubating for at least 2 h under capacitating conditions (HTF, 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air). For experiments involving intact sperm, we added increasing concentrations of KH7 and 10 μm A23187 or 5 μm progesterone sequentially and incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C after each addition. For experiments involving permeabilized cells, washed spermatozoa were resuspended in cold PBS containing 2.1 units/ml SLO for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. We added inhibitors and stimulants sequentially as indicated in the figure legends and incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C after each addition. Where indicated, we preloaded SLO-permeabilized sperm with NP-EGTA-AM before incubating with inhibitors and/or calcium, carrying out all procedures in the dark. Photolysis was induced after the last incubation by exposing twice (1 min each time) to an UV transilluminator and mixing after each exposure. Intact and permeabilized sperm were spotted on Teflon-printed slides, air-dried, and fixed/permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 1 min. Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with FITC-coupled Pisum sativum (FITC-PSA) (52Mendoza C. Carreras A. Moos J. Tesarik J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1992; 95: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At least 200 cells were scored using an upright Nikon microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Basal (no stimulation) and positive (0.5 mm CaCl2 corresponding to 10 μm free calcium estimated by MAXCHELATOR, a series of program(s) for determining the free metal concentration in the presence of chelators) controls were included in all experiments. Acrosomal exocytosis indexes were calculated by subtracting the number of spontaneously reacted spermatozoa from all values and expressing the results as a percentage of the AR observed in the positive control. Data were evaluated using one way analysis of variance. The Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons. Differences were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. Capacitated sperm (10–50 × 106 cells) were washed twice and suspended in PBS. Sperm were treated with 100 μm 2-APB (an IP3-sensitive calcium channel blocker) to prevent cytosol/membrane loss due to exocytosis before adding the AR inducers. Alternatively, sperm were permeabilized with SLO and treated with 2-APB and 20 μg/ml anti-Rap1 antibodies (GenScript) or 1 μg of His6-Rab3A before challenging with 50 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP or 0.5 mm CaCl2. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were lysed in GST pulldown buffer (200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (P2714, Sigma), and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) by sonication on ice (two times for 15 s). We let proteins diffuse into the lysis buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. These whole cell detergent extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min and used immediately. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed twice with GST pulldown buffer and incubated with bacterial lysates containing GST-Ral-GDS-RBD or GST-RIM for 1 h at 4 °C under constant rocking. Beads were washed twice with PBS and once with GST pulldown buffer and used immediately. Twenty μl of glutathione-Sepharose containing 10 μg of the appropriate fusion protein was added to sperm lysates in a total volume of 0.6 ml and incubated by rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. The resin was recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C (5 min at 10,000 rpm) and washed three times with ice-cold GST pulldown buffer. The resin-bound fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and cellular GTP-Rap1 and GTP-Rab3A levels were analyzed by immunoblotting as described later. Partition experiments were conducted following standard procedures (53Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Pryde J.G. Phillips J.H. Biochem.

A yeast two-hybrid search for MAVS-interacting proteins yielded the Polo-box domain (PBD) of the mitotic Polo-like kinase PLK1. We showed that PBD associates with two different domains of MAVS in both dependent and independent phosphorylation events. The phosphodependent association requires the phosphopeptide binding ability of PBD. It takes place downstream of the proline-rich domain of MAVS, within an STP motif, characteristic of the binding of PLK1 to its targets, where the central Thr234 residue is phosphorylated. Its phosphoindependent association takes place at the C terminus of MAVS. PLK1 strongly inhibits the ability of MAVS to activate the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways and to induce IFN. Reciprocally, depletion of PLK1 can increase IFN induction in response to RIG-I/SeV or RIG-I/poly(I)-poly(C) treatments. This inhibition is dependent on the phosphoindependent association of PBD at the C terminus of MAVS where it disrupts the association of MAVS with its downstream partner TRAF3. IFN induction was strongly inhibited in cells arrested in G2/M by nocodazole, which provokes increased expression of endogenous PLK1. Interestingly, depletion of PLK1 from these nocodazole-treated cells could restore, at least partially, IFN induction. Altogether, these data demonstrate a new function for PLK1 as a regulator of IFN induction and provide the basis for the development of inhibitors preventing the PLK1/MAVS association to sustain innate immunity.

IFN induction was strongly inhibited in cells arrested in G2/M by nocodazole, which provokes increased expression of endogenous PLK1. Interestingly, depletion of PLK1 from these nocodazole-treated cells could restore, at least partially, IFN induction. Altogether, these data demonstrate a new function for PLK1 as a regulator of IFN induction and provide the basis for the development of inhibitors preventing the PLK1/MAVS association to sustain innate immunity. The cellular innate immune response is triggered by a variety of microbial pathogens as an essential mechanism to limit the initial spread of these infections and involves the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNα/β) 6The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonMAVSmitochondrial antiviral signalingCARDcaspase activation and recruitment domainRIPreceptor-interacting proteinTRAFtumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factorTBK1TANK-binding kinase 1NF-κBnuclear factor-κBIκBα(inhibitor of κB) αIKKIκB (inhibitor of κB) kinaseIRF3interferon regulatory factor-3IL-8interleukin-8ISG56interferon-stimulated gene 56dsRNAdouble-stranded RNAsiRNAsilencing RNARSVRous Sarcoma VirusCMVcytomegalovirusGal4galactosidase transcription factorCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidFLfull-lengthWTwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferase.

In contrast, the mechanisms involved in the association of MAVS with the downstream signaling pathways are more complex, because they require activation of several kinases such as IKKα, IKKβ, IKKϵ, and TBK1.

Recruitment of FADD, RIP1, and TRAF3 to MAVS has been recently shown to occur in complex with TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) (20Michallet M.C. Meylan E.

In turn, TANK interacts with NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator), which bridges the nuclear factor-κB and the IRF3 signaling pathways (21Zhao T. Yang L. Sun Q. Arguello M. Ballard D.W. Hiscott J. Lin R.

The two kinases TBK1 and IKKϵ present strong homologies (14Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J.

Yet they differ in several aspects, among which is the privileged association of IKKϵ with MAVS at the mitochondria upon viral infection (18Lin R. Lacoste J. Nakhaei P. Sun Q. Yang L. Paz S.

A systematic search for MAVS- and IKKϵ-interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen revealed that both MAVS and IKKϵ were interacting with the Polo-box domain (PBD) of the polo-like kinase PLK1. Here, we report the MAVS/PLK1 association. The IKKϵ/PLK1 association will be addressed in a separate study. PLK1 belongs to the family of mitotic serine/threonine Polo-like kinases that play critical roles in centrosome maturation, progression through mitosis, and the onset of cytokinesis (26Gumireddy K. Reddy M.V. Cosenza S.C. Boominathan R. Baker S.J. Papathi N. Jiang J. Holland J. Reddy E.P. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). PLK1 overexpression is known to occur in tumors, and it is considered as a negative prognostic marker of progression to cancer (27Reagan-Shaw S. Ahmad N. Faseb. J. 2005; 19: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PLK1 usually associates with its cognate partners in a phosphodependent manner through a phosphopeptide binding motif present in its Polo-box domain (28Cheng K.Y. Lowe E.D. Sinclair J. Nigg E.A. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5757-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the Polo-box domain of PLK1 associates with two different domains of MAVS. While one of these associations requires a phosphorylation event and the phosphopeptide binding motif of PLK1, the second one is phosphorylation-independent. Importantly, this non phosphospecific mode of interaction between PLK1 and MAVS was able to strongly disrupt the association of MAVS with its downstream partner TRAF3 and to interfere with the IFN induction pathway. PLK1 thus represents a new negative regulator of the IFN induction pathway. Control (scrambled) siRNA and siRNA to PLK1 (nucleotides 1416–1438 (31Spänkuch-Schmitt B. Wolf G. Solbach C. Loibl S.

(Lafayette, CO). Normal mouse IgG, anti-c-Myc (9E10), and anti-PLK1 (F-8) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-MAVS polyclonal antibody was from ALEXIS. Anti-actin and anti-FLAG mAbs (M2) were from Sigma. Anti-V5 mAb was from Invitrogen and anti-HSP60 mAbs from BD. Aphidicolin, nocodazole, and poly(I)-poly(C) were from Sigma. Anti-IKKϵ was provided by John Hiscott. Open-reading frames corresponding to MAVS (nucleotides 1–1539) were fused in-frame using the following primers : MAVS-forward (5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTACAAAAAAGTTGGCATGCCGTTTGCTGAAGACAAGA), MAVS-reverse (5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTACAAGAAAGTTGGTTATGAGGGCCTGTGGCATGG), with the coding sequence of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 using in vitro recombination (Gateway System, Invitrogen) as previously described (32Walhout A.J. Sordella R. Lu X. Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Thierry-Mieg N. Vidal M. Science. 2000; 287: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Then, the Gal4-DB-MAVS construct was transfected in AH109 yeast cells (Clontech) according to the manufacturer舗s procedure. The fusion protein did not induce transactivation. In parallel, a commercial human spleen cDNA library cloned in the Gal4-AD pPC86 two-hybrid vector (Invitrogen) was transfected in the Y187 yeast cells (Clontech). A mating strategy was used for two-hybrid screening of the human spleen cDNA library (33Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Positive colonies were selected from ∼50 million diploids on synthetic medium missing histidine and supplemented with 10 mm 3-amino-triazole (Sigma-Aldrich). The positive colonies were submitted to three rounds of screening to avoid contamination by irrelevant DNA (34Vidalain P.O. Boxem M. Ge H. Li S. Vidal M. Methods. 2004; 32: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Positive clones were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR products obtained from yeast colonies. The cDNA from these clones was then recovered and inserted into pDONR vector (Invitrogen) to allow subsequent cloning in Gateway compatible acceptor plasmids, engineered by Y. Jacob. The plasmid encoding FLAG-IKKϵ was described previously (14Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J.

The pV5-IKKϵ was generated by restriction digestion from pFLAG-IKKϵ(WT) and subsequent subcloning in a pcDNA3.1(+)-V5 vector engineered in the laboratory. The pcDNA3.1(+) vector was from Invitrogen. The pcDNA3.0-c-Myc-MAVS (pMyc-MAVS) full-length (FL), 1–157 (N), and 156–540 (C) were described in Ref. 18Lin R. Lacoste J. Nakhaei P. Sun Q. Yang L. Paz S. Wilkinson P. Julkunen I. Vitour D.

The following PCR primers were used for the amplification of MAVS-(1–360) wild type and mutant: forward primer, 5′-ggggacaactttgtacaaaaaagttggcatgCCGTTTGCTGAAGACAAGA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ggggacaactttgtacaagaaagttggttaTGGCACCATGCCAGCACG-3′. The sequence of the PLK1 cDNA fragment recovered from the yeast positive colonies corresponded to its polo-box domain (PLK1-(323–603) for interaction with MAVS). The full-length Myc-PLK1 plasmid was obtained from Roy Golsteyn (36Golsteyn R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pMyc-PLK1 T210D and T210V mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Full-length PLK1, cloned in pDON207R (Invitrogen), was inserted in-frame 3′ of a triple FLAG epitope sequence into a translation optimized pCINeo vector (Promega) using the Gateway cloning procedure (Invitrogen) to generate pFLAG-PLK1. The PLK1-PBD fragment recovered from the yeast screen and subcloned in pDON207R was inserted in the triple FLAG pCINeo vector or pEGFP-C1-modified vector using the Gateway cloning procedure. They are referred to as pFLAG-PLK1-PBD and pEGFP-PLK1-PBD. The full-length sequence of MAVS was amplified from the pMyc-MAVS plasmid and cloned into the triple FLAG vector to generate pFLAG-MAVS. The pFLAG-PLK1 construct containing the mutation K82M was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The PLK1-PBD constructs with the mutations H538A, L540M ± W414F, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on the pFLAG-PLK1-PBD plasmid. The PLK1-PBD sequence and the full-length cDNA of MAVS were subcloned into the pM and pVP16 vectors (Clontech), respectively. The IFN-β firefly luciferase (IFN-β-pGL2) and β-galactosidase (pRSV-βGal) reporter plasmids were described previously (35Breiman A. Grandvaux N. Lin R. Ottone C. Akira S. Yoneyama M. Fujita T.

Jacob. pGal4/Luc was engineered from basic pGL3 vector (Promega). The FLAG-TRAF3 plasmid was generated by cloning human TRAF3 by reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and insertion into the pcDNA3 FLAG vector (a gift from R. Lin).

HEK 293T, Hela, and MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Huh7 cells were cultured as described previously (35Breiman A. Grandvaux N. Lin R. Ottone C. Akira S. Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Hiscott J. Meurs E.F. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3969-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). HEK 293T were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. Infection with Sendaï virus (a gift from D. Garcin and D. Kolakofsky (37Strahle L. Garcin D. Kolakofsky D.

For IFN-β luciferase reporter assays, 1.4 × 105 cells were transfected with 100 ng of IFN-β-pGL2 and 50 ng of pRSV-β Gal using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Indicated amounts of the PLK1 constructs were co-transfected with MAVS constructs or empty vector. siRNAs targeting PLK1 (final concentration 50 nm) were transfected 24 h before transfection of different amounts of MAVS. Cells were incubated for 24–48 h and were mock-treated or infected with Sendai virus. The reporter assays were performed as described in Ref. 35Breiman A. Grandvaux N. Lin R. Ottone C. Akira S. Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Hiscott J. Meurs E.F. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3969-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar. Data are shown as the mean activity of luciferase activity (normalized to β-galactosidase activity) of triplicates ± S.E. For Gal4 luciferase reporter assays, 1.4 × 105 cells were transfected with 100 ng of Gal4-luc and 20 ng of pCMV-Renilla using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 400 ng of pM-PLK1-PBD, containing the DNA binding domain of Gal4 fused in-frame with the Polo-box domain of PLK1, 400 ng of pVP16-MAVS, containing the full-length sequence of MAVS fused in-frame with the transactivator VP16, were transfected individually or co-transfected. The reporter assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Data are shown as the mean normalized luciferase activity of triplicates ± S.E. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% CHAPS) or buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) containing cocktails of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). During λ-phosphatase treatment (5 units/mg protein extract; 30 min at 30 °C), phosphatase inhibitors were omitted. The protein content was analyzed by immunoblot as described (35Breiman A.

Lysates were incubated at 4 °C overnight with the appropriate antibodies and then in the presence of A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min. The beads were washed three times, and the precipitated proteins were extracted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C. Lysate and immunoprecipitated material were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad), and probed with antibodies directed against fused tags followed by appropriate secondary reagents. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). HEK 293T cells, plated at 3 × 106 cells/100 mm plate, were washed once in phosphate-free Dulbecco舗s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) and incubated for 10 h in this medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, previously dialyzed against phosphate-buffer-saline, 800 μCi to 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (8500–9120 Ci (314–337TBq)/mmol PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 20 μm MG132 (Sigma). After lysis in buffer A, protein extracts were submitted to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transfered to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the presence of proteins in the complex was revealed by appropriate antibodies, while the phosphorylated proteins were revealed after exposure of the membrane to an intensifying screen followed by scanning on a PhosphorImager. Total cellular RNA was extracted by acid-guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform using RNAble (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer. The sequence of the primers used for the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of GAPDH, IFN-β, and ISG56 were described in Ref. 38Vilasco M. Larrea E. Vitour D. Dabo S. Breiman A.

The sequences of the IL8 primers used for RT-PCR are: IL8-forward, 5′-AAGGGCCAAGAGAATATCCGAA-3′and IL8-reverse, 5′-ACTAGGGTTGCCAGATTTAACA-3′. The RT reactions were performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo dT primers and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative PCR was performed on a light cycler apparatus using SYBR Green, with 2 μl of the cDNA in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of Light Cycler FastStart Plus DNA master SYBR Green kit (Roche Applied Science) and 0.1 μm of each primer. Standard curves were established using 10-fold serial dilutions of plasmids containing amplicons (GAPDH, IFN-β, and ISG56) or purified PCR product (IL8). The measured amounts of each mRNA were normalized to the amounts of GAPDH mRNA. The amounts of RNA were expressed as number of copies/μg total. A high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen (32Walhout A.J. Sordella R. Lu X. Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Thierry-Mieg N. Vidal M.

We used a MAVS construct deprived of its transmembrane domain (MAVS-(1–513)) to favor nuclear localization and efficient interaction with the prey library. Out of 5 × 107 transformants obtained with a human spleen cDNA library, 27 positive colonies were identified when MAVS was used as a bait. The mitotic serine/threonine Polo-like kinase PLK1 (39Barr F.A. Silljé H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) was found as a major partner for MAVS along with two members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor family, TRAF2 and TRAF6. These data were thus in agreement with those obtained from a previous yeast two-hybrid screen using MAVS as bait (12Xu L.G. Wang Y.Y. Han K.J. Li L.Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). The sequence of the recovered PLK1 cDNA fragment (PLK1 amino acids 323–603) corresponds to its PBD. The interaction between MAVS and the PLK1-PBD was confirmed in human cells using a mammalian two-hybrid assay in which the PLK1-PBD sequence was fused in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, while the MAVS sequence was fused to the transactivator VP16. Co-transfection of both constructs provoked an 8-fold transactivation of a Gal4-driven luciferase gene, thus showing the relevance of the interactions revealed by the yeast two-hybrid screen (Fig. 1A). Transient transfection and coprecipitation assays next showed that MAVS could interact with PLK1-PBD, as well as full-length PLK1 (Fig. 1B). Expression of PLK1 is known to be linked to the cell cycle (39Barr F.A. Silljé H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether MAVS and PLK1 could associate at the endogenous level, we first established the kinetics of PLK1 and MAVS expression as a function of the cell cycle, in three different cell types: HEK 293T, Huh-7 (Fig. 1C), and Hela cells (supplemental Fig. S1), after growth arrest at G1/S interphase by aphidicolin treatment (26Gumireddy K. Reddy M.V. Cosenza S.C. Boominathan R. Baker S.J. Papathi N. Jiang J. Holland J. Reddy E.P. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) or double thymidine block. These data confirmed the dependence of PLK1 expression upon the cell cycle with higher expression 8–12 h after block release, corresponding to the G2/M phase of the cycle. The expression of MAVS does not vary much during the cell cycle and a concomitant high expression of both proteins can be observed at the peak of PLK1 expression (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). We then demonstrated that MAVS and PLK1 can interact at the endogenous level by using extracts from HEK 293T cells arrested at G2/M by nocodazole treatment as described (40Lowery D.M. Clauser K.R.

We also used the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (41Dickson R.B. Bates S.E. McManaway M.E. Lippman M.E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar), because PLK1 expression was reported to be constitutively elevated in tumor cells (42Strebhardt K. Ullrich A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, however, the MCF7 behaved as the 293T cells with regards to endogenous levels of PL"
https://openalex.org/W2087673933,"Here, we describe the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a vertebrate model system to study liver regeneration with the added benefit of its powerful genetics and screening possibilities to uncover the molecular pathways underlying liver regeneration. We developed a partial hepatectomy (PH) protocol in zebrafish and investigated in detail the cellular and morphological changes during the process of liver regeneration. We show that the type of regenerative response is dependent on the size of the injury sustained by the zebrafish liver. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that the mechanisms of liver regeneration in zebrafish after PH are strikingly similar to those of rodents and humans, with 100% recovery of the liver mass after 6-7 d postsurgery. This occurs via compensatory growth mediated by proliferation of hepatocytes throughout the entire liver remnant. By analyzing transgenic fish expressing dominant-negative forms of either bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1, we demonstrate that the BMP and FGF signaling pathways are crucial regulators of the early events during liver regeneration after PH. Our study demonstrates that the mechanisms of liver regeneration in zebrafish are highly similar to the processes ongoing during mammalian liver regeneration and make the adult zebrafish a suitable model system to study the mechanisms of liver regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2077722171,"Transient exposure of β-cells to oxidative stress interrupts the transduction of signals normally coupling glucose metabolism to insulin secretion. We investigated putative persistence of effects induced by one transient oxidative stress (200 μm H2O2, 10 min) on insulin secreting cells following recovery periods of days and weeks. Three days after oxidative stress INS-1E cells and rat islets exhibited persistent dysfunction. In particular, the secretory response to 15 mm glucose was reduced by 40% in INS-1E cells stressed 3 days before compared with naïve cells. Compared with non-stressed INS-1E cells, we observed reduced oxygen consumption (−43%) and impaired glucose-induced ATP generation (−46%). These parameters correlated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species formation (+60%) accompanied with down-regulation of subunits of the respiratory chain and decreased expression of genes responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM, −24%; PGC-1α, −67%). Three weeks after single oxidative stress, both mitochondrial respiration and secretory responses were recovered. Moreover, such recovered INS-1E cells exhibited partial resistance to a second transient oxidative stress and up-regulation of UCP2 (+78%) compared with naïve cells. In conclusion, one acute oxidative stress induces β-cell dysfunction lasting over days, explained by persistent damages in mitochondrial components.

In conclusion, one acute oxidative stress induces β-cell dysfunction lasting over days, explained by persistent damages in mitochondrial components. Pancreatic β-cells are poised to sense blood glucose to regulate insulin exocytosis and thereby glucose homeostasis. The conversion from metabolic signals to secretory responses is mediated through mitochondrial metabolism (1.Maechler P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1803-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Failure of the insulin secreting β-cells, a common characteristic of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, derives from various origins, among them mitochondrial impairment secondary to oxidative stress is a proposed mechanism (2.Green K. Brand M.D. Murphy M.P. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S110-S118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is characterized by a persistent imbalance between excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutaseCATcatalaseGPxglutathione peroxidasemtDNAmitochondrial DNABSAbovine serum albuminFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonePBSphosphate-buffered salineTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineΔΨmmitochondrial membrane potential.3The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutaseCATcatalaseGPxglutathione peroxidasemtDNAmitochondrial DNABSAbovine serum albuminFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonePBSphosphate-buffered salineTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineΔΨmmitochondrial membrane potential. and limited antioxidant defenses. Examples of ROS include superoxide (O2−̇), hydroxyl radical (OH⋅), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Superoxide can be converted to less reactive H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and then to oxygen and water by catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxin, which constitute antioxidant defenses. Increased oxidative stress and free radical damages have been proposed to participate in the diabetic state (3.Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). In type 1 diabetes, ROS are implicated in β-cell dysfunction caused by autoimmune reactions and inflammatory cytokines (4.Rabinovitch A. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In the context of type 2 diabetes, excessive ROS could promote deficient insulin synthesis (5.Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 599-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 6.Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and apoptotic pathways in β-cells (5.Evans J.L. Goldfine I.D. Maddux B.A. Grodsky G.M. Endocr.

Of note, ROS fluctuations may also contribute to physiological control of cell functions (8.Rhee S.G. Science. 2006; 312: 1882-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar), including the control of insulin secretion (9.Pi J. Bai Y. Zhang Q. Wong V. Floering L.M. Daniel K. Reece J.M. Deeney J.T. Andersen M.E. Corkey B.E. Collins S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It should also be stressed that metabolism of physiological nutrient increases ROS without causing deleterious effects on cell function. However, uncontrolled increase of oxidants, or reduction of their detoxification, leads to free radical-mediated chain reactions ultimately triggering pathogenic events. Pancreatic β-cells are relatively weak in expressing free radical-quenching enzymes SOD, CAT, and GPx (10.Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Welsh N. Margulis B. Borg L.A. Wiklund H.J. Saldeen J. Flodström M. Mello M.A. Andersson A. Pipeleers D.G. Hellerström C. Mol.

Mitochondria are not only the main source of cellular oxidants, they are also the primary target of ROS (13.Turrens J.F. J.

Mitochondria are essential for pancreatic β-cell function, and damages to these organelles are well known to markedly alter glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (15.Maechler P. de Andrade P.B. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2006; 34: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial genome constitutes one of the targets, encoding for 13 polypeptides essential for the integrity of electron transport chain (16.Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar). Damages to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) induce mutations that in turn may favor ROS generation, although the contribution of mtDNA mutations to ROS generation remains unclear. We previously reported that patient-derived mitochondrial A3243G mutation, causing mitochondrial inherited diabetes, is responsible for defective mitochondrial metabolism associated with elevated ROS levels and reduced antioxidant enzyme expression (17.de Andrade P.B. Rubi B. Frigerio F. van den Ouweland J.M. Maassen J.A. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mtDNA mutator mice exhibit accelerated aging without changes in superoxide levels in embryonic fibroblasts (18.Trifunovic A. Hansson A. Wredenberg A. Rovio A.T. Dufour E. Khvorostov I. Spelbrink J.N. Wibom R. Jacobs H.T. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17993-17998Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), showing that ROS generation can be dissociated from mtDNA mutations. In humans, mitochondrial defects typically appear with aging (19.Bua E. Johnson J. Herbst A. Delong B. McKenzie D. Salamat S. Aiken J.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 79: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), accompanied by sustained ROS generation and progressive oxidant-induced damages (20.Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). In support of this “mitochondrial theory of aging” (21.Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar), accumulating evidence shows that in older individuals mitochondria are altered, both morphologically and functionally (22.Cottrell D.A. Turnbull D.M. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2000; 3: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These age-related mitochondrial changes are foreseen to play a role in the late onset diabetes. In a rat model of intrauterine growth retardation, a vicious cycle between accumulation of mtDNA mutations and elevation of ROS production has been associated to β-cell abnormalities and the onset of type 2 diabetes in adulthood (23.Simmons R.A. Suponitsky-Kroyter I. Selak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28785-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similarly, mitochondrion-derived ROS impair β-cell function in the Zucker diabetic fatty rat (24.Bindokas V.P. Kuznetsov A. Sreenan S. Polonsky K.S. Roe M.W. Philipson L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9796-9801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations point to ROS action as a triggering event inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately resulting in the loss of the secretory response in β-cells (14.Li N. Frigerio F. Maechler P. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2008; 36: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In vitro, oxidative stress applied to β-cells rapidly interrupts the transduction of signals normally coupling glucose metabolism to insulin secretion (12.Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 25.Krippeit-Drews P. Kramer C. Welker S. Lang F. Ammon H.P. Drews G. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Specifically, we reported that INS-1E β-cells and rat islets subjected to a 10-min H2O2 exposure exhibit impaired secretory response associated with mitochondrial dysfunction appearing already during the first minutes of oxidative stress (12.Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the context of the mitochondrial theory of aging (21.Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar, 26.Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), it is important to know whether transient exposure to H2O2 could possibly induce persistent modifications of mitochondrial function. Cells surviving an oxidative stress might carry defects leading to progressive loss of β-cell function. In the present study, we asked the simple but unanswered question if a short transient oxidative stress could induce durable alterations of the mitochondria and thereby chronically impair β-cell function. INS-1E β-cells and rat islets were transiently exposed to H2O2 for 10 min and analyzed after days and weeks of standard tissue culture. INS-1E cells were used as a well differentiated clone derived from rat insulinoma INS-1 cells and cultured as detailed previously (26.Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion from Wistar rats weighting 200–250 g, hand-picked and cultured free-floating in RPMI 1640 medium before experiments (27.Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). INS-1E cells were seeded in Falcon (OmniLab, Mettmenstetten, Switzerland) multiwell plates and Petri dishes treated with polyornithine (Sigma-Aldrich). After 2 days of culture, cells were exposed to 200 μm H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 min later 100 units/ml CAT (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to neutralize H2O2. The 200 μm concentration of H2O2 was selected according to: (i) the dose-response performed previously showing direct effects above 100 μm (12.Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); (ii) the dose-response performed on INS-1E cells analyzed 3 days after the 10-min oxidative stress (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Following the H2O2 and CAT treatment, cells were further cultured in normal complete media and, where indicated, passaged once a week until analysis. Control cells were cultured for the same period of time as stressed cells. Regarding primary cells, rat pancreatic islets were isolated, exposed to oxidative stress as described above, and cultured before hand-picking for analyses. Insulin secretion assay was performed as detailed previously (26.Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were preincubated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH, in mM: 135 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (KRBH/BSA). Next, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRBH/BSA containing basal 2.5 mm or stimulatory 15 mm glucose concentrations. Non-nutrient-stimulated secretion was induced by 30 mm KCl (at 2.5 mm glucose). Cultured rat islets were hand-picked for either static insulin secretion or perifusion experiments. For perifusion protocols, cultured islets were placed by 10 in chambers of 250-μl volume (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), and then perifused at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (27.Carobbio S. Ishihara H. Fernandez-Pascual S. Bartley C. Martin-Del-Rio R. Maechler P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with KRBH/BSA medium containing sequentially basal 2.8 mm glucose followed by stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose. Insulin was collected, and insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St. Charles, MO). The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured as described (26.Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) in INS-1E cells loaded with Rhodamine-123 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and monitored in a plate-reader fluorometer (Fluostar Optima, BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany). At indicated time points, glucose was raised to 15 mm, and then 1 μm of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Cellular ATP levels were monitored in cells expressing the ATP-sensitive bioluminescent probe luciferase after transduction with the viral construct AdCAG-Luc the day before measurements (28.Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29.Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm luciferin, cells were stimulated with 15 mm glucose and 2 mm NaN3 was added at the end as a mitochondrial poison. Luminescence was monitored in a plate-reader luminometer (26.Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Total cellular ATP concentrations were determined according to manufacturer's instructions (ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II, Roche Applied Science) following cell incubation for 10 min with KRBH at 2.5 mm and 15 mm glucose. Oxygen consumption measurements were performed either on live cell suspension or isolated mitochondria. At indicated times cells were trypsinized and left to recover (60 min, 37 °C) before stimulation with 15 mm glucose. For isolated mitochondria, INS-1E cells were washed with PBS, scraped, collected in mitochondria isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris/HCl, and 2 mm EGTA at pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% BSA, and pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 1000 rpm). Pellets were then resuspended with mitochondria isolation buffer and homogenized in a 3-ml Teflon glass potter with 500 rpm rotation rate for 20 up-and-down strokes, followed by centrifugation for 8 min at 1500 × g to pull down nuclei. Supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the resulting pellets were collected with respiration buffer (200 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KH2PO4 at pH 7.0). After protein determination, 100 μg of mitochondria were used for measurements of oxygen consumption using a Clark-type electrode (Rank Brothers Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Succinate (5 mm) and 150 μm ADP-induced oxygen consumptions were performed on intact mitochondria directly after isolation. Oxygen consumption induced by NADH (5 mm) was measured in permeabilized mitochondria following snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing four times. This procedure weakened mitochondrial membrane shortly before experiments and thereby permitted uncoupled respiration measurements. Complex I activity was measured as the rate of NADH-driven electron flux through complex I using a variation of the Amplex Red assay (Molecular Probes), which detects mitochondrial H2O2 by monitoring peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of Amplex Red to resorufin (30.Keeney P.M. Xie J. Capaldi R.A. Bennett Jr., J.P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5256-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated and resuspended with respiration buffer as described above for oxygen consumption. Mitochondria were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed four times for permeabilization. Mitochondrial samples at a final protein concentration of 400 μg/ml were supplemented with SOD1 (40 units/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), horseradish peroxidase (0.1 unit/ml, Molecular Probes), and Amplex Red (50 μm, Molecular Probes). The reaction mixture in Krebs-Ringer Phosphate (KRPG, 145 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm Na2HPO4, 4.86 mm KCl, 0.54 mm CaCl2, 1.22 mm MgSO4, and 5.5 mm glucose at pH 7.35) with or without 5 mm NADH or 5 mm succinate was incubated at 37 °C with readings every min at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. Rates of NADH-driven electron flux through complex I were calculated over the linear increasing period, and the end plateau values of each reaction were treated as NADH- or succinate-induced mitochondrial ROS generation. For negative controls of basal activity, CAT (200 units/ml) was added at the beginning of the trace. Mitochondrial isolation was performed as described above. Here, 10 mm triethanolamine and 0.1 mg/ml digitonin were added in mitochondria isolation buffer to weaken cell membrane. Resulting pellets were collected and resuspended with mitochondria buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA at pH 7.8) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. For primary cells, 3 days after the 10-min oxidant exposure cell lysates were obtained and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Protein samples (10 μg/lane) were subjected to 10–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel before transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membrane was then blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% (w/v) gelatin protein (Top Block, Juro, Switzerland) in mitochondria PBS (1.4 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl at pH 7.3), incubated in mitochondria PBS containing 0.6% Top block with 0.05% Tween 20 and premixed mouse monoclonal antibodies against five subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (MS604 1:250; MitoSciences, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:2000, Amersham Biosciences), and immunoreactivity was visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). Total RNA from INS-1E cells and rat islets was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 2 μg of RNA, reverse transcriptase (Super Script II, Invitrogen), and 1 μg of random primers (Promega, Madison, WI) (32.Boengler K. Gres P. Dodoni G.

Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applera), and PCR products were quantified fluorometrically using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems). Values were normalized to the reference mRNA ribosomal protein subunit 29 (RPS29). Mitochondria were revealed by MitoTracker Orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining on fixed cells. Briefly, after the mentioned recovery period following transient oxidative stress, cells on polyornithine-coated glass coverslips were washed with PBS twice and incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker at 37 °C for 25 min. After another wash, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed extensively before mounting on glass slides. Cells were viewed using a confocal laser scanning 410 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. One-way analysis of variance and two-tailed unpaired t test were used for statistical analysis. Results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Basal apoptotic rate in control INS-1E cells was ∼2%, in agreement with previous observations (31.Brun T. Duhamel D.L. Hu He K.H. Wollheim C.B. Gauthier B.R. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4261-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Single 10-min oxidative stress induced 20–25% TUNEL-positive cells 8-h post-stress, an apoptotic rate maintained throughout a 5-day period post-stress (Fig. 1A). INS-1E cells exhibited typical proliferation rate with 30% BrdUrd labeling (31.Brun T. Duhamel D.L. Hu He K.H. Wollheim C.B. Gauthier B.R. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4261-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), while oxidative stress transiently decreased cell proliferation 24 h post-injury (Fig. 1B). Five days later, stressed cells exhibited higher proliferation rate compared with naïve cells, the latter proliferating at a slower pace along with increasing cell to cell contacts favored by confluency (Fig. 1B). Representative pictures are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Insulin secretion from control INS-1E cells (Fig. 1C) evoked by 15 mm glucose was stimulated 4.8-fold versus control basal release (p < 0.005). Compared with controls, cells subjected to oxidative stress 3 days before experiments had a 110% increase in basal insulin release (p < 0.05) but did not respond to 15 mm glucose, corresponding to a 40% inhibition of the secretory response versus glucose-stimulated control cells (p < 0.05). Exocytosis evoked by 30 mm KCl, used to raise cytosolic Ca2+ independently of mitochondrial activation, was not different between the two groups. However, insulin release under basal conditions was elevated in stressed cells to levels comparable to KCl-induced responses of controls, therefore showing no further stimulation. Because it is known that, immediately after stress, H2O2 exposure raises Ca2+ to ∼400 nm (12.Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we checked KCl responses in cells 3 days post-stress. Supplemental Fig. S4 shows efficient KCl-induced Ca2+ rise in stressed cells, suggesting impairment in the exocytotic machinery downstream of Ca2+ elevation. Five days post-stress, we observed similar inhibition of the glucose response (2.1-fold versus 5.4-fold in stressed versus control conditions, respectively) associated with elevated basal insulin release (+127% versus control, p < 0.005; Fig. 1D). These data show that the single 10-min oxidative stress induced secretory defects lasting over days. To determine whether mitochondrial morphology was conserved after transient oxidant exposure, INS-1E mitochondrial shape was visualized (Fig. 1, E and F). Control cells exhibited normal filament-like mitochondria (Fig. 1, E and F, top), whereas exposure to 200 μm H2O2 3 days before observation resulted in discontinuous mitochondrial network, eventually presenting globular patterns (Fig. 1E, bottom). Mitochondrial morphology was restored 5 days after transient oxidative stress (Fig. 1F, bottom). Mitochondrial membrane was hyperpolarized when glucose was raised from 2.5 mm to 15 mm and depolarized by the subsequent addition of 1 μm of the protonophore FCCP (Fig. 2A). In INS-1E cells stressed 3 days before by 200 μm H2O2, glucose-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization was inhibited by 55%, and total ΔΨm revealed by FCCP was reduced by 42% compared with non-stressed controls (Fig. 2A). Exposure to 500 μm H2O2 resulted in near complete abrogation of glucose-induced hyperpolarization measured 3 days post-stress (supplemental Fig. S1). Elevation of glucose from 2.5 mm to 15 mm in control cells resulted in a sustained elevation of cytosolic ATP levels (Fig. 2B), which were disrupted by adding the mitochondrial poison NaN3. Stressed cells exhibited a 59% inhibition in glucose-induced ATP generation. Measured as absolute levels, total cellular ATP concentrations in control INS-1E cells stimulated with 15 mm glucose were increased by 31% (p < 0.01) compared with basal levels (Fig. 2C). Stressed cells exhibited lower basal (−42%, p < 0.002) and stimulated (−46%, p < 0.0002) ATP levels versus control cells. Efficient electron transfer from NADH to complex I ensures activation of mitochondrial electron transport chain resulting in hyperpolarization of ΔΨm and ATP generation. Electron transport chain complex I activity was measured using permeabilized isolated mitochondria as the rate of NADH-induced electron flux. INS-1E cells subjected to oxidative stress 3 days before analysis exhibited reduced mitochondrial complex I activity (−14%, p < 0.001, n = 7) compared with naïve cells (data not shown). Measured in cell suspension, glucose-induced O2 consumption rate was reduced in stressed cells compared with normal respiration in naïve cells (Fig. 2D). Measured in isolated mitochondria, basal respiratory rates were similar between control mitochondria and mitochondria isolated from cells transiently stressed with 200 μm H2O2 3 days before measurements. Complex I was activated by the addition of its substrate NADH (5 mm) to permeabilized mitochondria and resulted in a 5.1-fold (p < 0.01) increase in O2 consumption in control mitochondria (Fig. 2E), which was totally abolished by the application of complex I inhibitor rotenone (data not shown). Compared with controls, mitochondria isolated from stressed cells showed a 43% (p < 0.05) reduction of the respiratory rate. Next, succinate was used as complex II substrate. In control mitochondria, state 4 respiration induced by 5 mm succinate and state 3 induced by further addition of 150 μm ADP resulted in 14.3- and 31.2-fold (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) elevations of O2 consumption, respectively (Fig. 2F). Transient exposure to oxidative stress 3 days prior to respiration measurements caused a decrease in both state 4 (−36%, p < 0.01) and state 3 (−59%, p < 0.005) respiration compared with corresponding controls. Concentrations of H2O2 lower than 200 μm (50 and 100 μm"
https://openalex.org/W2149193142,"The cytokine IL-6 has been considered to exert neuromodulating influences on the brain, with promoting influences on sleep. Sleep enhances the consolidation of memories, and, in particular, late nocturnal sleep also represents a period of enhanced IL-6 signaling, due to a distinctly enhanced availability of soluble IL-6 receptors during this period, enabling trans-signaling of IL-6 to neurons. Thus, a contribution of IL-6 to sleep-dependent memory consolidation is hypothesized. To test this hypothesis, we compared effects of intranasally administered IL-6 (vs. placebo) on sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative (neutral and emotional texts, 2-dimensional object location) and procedural (finger sequence tapping) memories in 17 healthy young men. IL-6 distinctly improved the sleep-related consolidation of emotional text material (P<0.03), which benefits mostly from sleep in the second night-half, in which rapid eye movement sleep (REM) dominates the non-REM-REM sleep cycle. During this second night-half, the amount of electroencephalogram slow-wave activity (0.5-4 Hz) distinctly increased after IL-6 (P<0.01). Other types of memory were not affected. The ability of IL-6 to enhance sleep-associated emotional memory consolidation highlights an example of a functional interaction between the central nervous and immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2148933301,"Determining the ways in which personality traits interact with contextual determinants to shape social behavior remains an important area of empirical investigation. The specific personality trait of neuroticism has been related to characteristic negative emotionality and associated with heightened attention to negative, emotionally arousing environmental signals. However, the mechanisms by which this personality trait may shape social behavior remain largely unspecified.We employed eye tracking to investigate the relationship between characteristics of visual scanpaths in response to emotional facial expressions and individual differences in personality. We discovered that the amount of time spent looking at the eyes of fearful faces was positively related to neuroticism.This finding is discussed in relation to previous behavioral research relating personality to selective attention for trait-congruent emotional information, neuroimaging studies relating differences in personality to amygdala reactivity to socially relevant stimuli, and genetic studies suggesting linkages between the serotonin transporter gene and neuroticism. We conclude that personality may be related to interpersonal interaction by shaping aspects of social cognition as basic as eye contact. In this way, eye gaze represents a possible behavioral link in a complex relationship between genes, brain function, and personality."

Whereas PHD1 and PHD3 proteolysis has been shown to be regulated by Siah2 ubiquitin E3 ligase-mediated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal destruction, protein regulation of the main oxygen sensor responsible for hypoxia-inducible factor α regulation, PHD2, remained unknown. We recently reported that the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 38 specifically interacts with PHD2 and determines PHD2 protein stability in a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-independent manner. Using peptide array binding assays, fluorescence spectroscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, we defined a minimal linear glutamate-rich PHD2 binding domain in the N-terminal part of FKBP38 and showed that this domain forms a high affinity complex with PHD2. Vice versa, PHD2 interacted with a non-linear N-terminal motif containing the MYND (myeloid, Nervy, and DEAF-1)-type Zn2+ finger domain with FKBP38. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that PHD2 subcellular localization overlapped with FKBP38 in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. An additional fraction of PHD2 was found in the cytoplasm. In cellulo PHD2/FKBP38 association, as well as regulation of PHD2 protein abundance by FKBP38, is dependent on membrane- anchored FKBP38 localization mediated by the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Mechanistically our data indicate that PHD2 protein stability is regulated by a ubiquitin-independent proteasomal pathway involving FKBP38 as adaptor protein that mediates proteasomal interaction.

Under normoxic conditions, two highly conserved prolyl residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIFα subunits are hydroxylated by members of the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) family (also called egg laying-defective nine homolog (EGLN) or HIF prolyl hydroxylase) (3Bruick R.K.

In addition, factor inhibiting HIF hydroxylates under normoxic conditions an asparaginyl residue in the C-terminal transcriptional transactivation domain of HIFα subunits, preventing the association with the CH1 domain of the p300 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) co-activators (9Mahon P.C.

PHDs and factor inhibiting HIF belong to the 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenase superfamily and act as cellular oxygen sensors by correlating the availability of oxygen with the regulation of HIF protein stability as well as transcriptional activity. Reduced tissue oxygenation leads to a concomitant decline in PHD and factor inhibiting HIF activity, resulting in the accumulation of HIFα subunits that translocate to the nucleus, heterodimerize with the constitutively expressed aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator/HIFβ subunit, and function as active transcription factors (11Schofield C.J.

Higher metazoans have three PHD genes; whereas PHD2 mRNA levels are ubiquitously expressed, PHD1 mRNA is present at high levels in testes, and PHD3 mRNA is most abundant in the heart (13Lieb M.E.

P4H is membrane-anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); hence it is more closely related to the collagen prolyl hydroxylases but it can also hydroxylate HIFα subunits in vitro (15Koivunen P. Tiainen P. Hyvärinen J. Williams K.E. Sormunen R. Klaus S.J. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30544-30552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Using short interfering RNAs, PHD2 was shown to be the main regulator of normoxic HIFα protein regulation (16Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouvès A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Genetic models have supported these findings; whereas Phd1−/− and Phd3−/− mice were apparently normal, Phd2−/− mice died between embryonic days 12.5 and 14.5 because of placental and heart defects (17Takeda K. Ho V.C. Takeda H. Duan L.J. Nagy A. Fong G.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 8336-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). PHD2 was shown to be the main regulator of vascular growth (18Takeda K.

Transcript levels of PHD2 and PHD3, but not PHD1, are themselves regulated by HIF, and induction under hypoxic conditions leads to attenuated HIFα levels (21Metzen E. Stiehl D.P. Doege K.

Initially it has been suggested that this feedback regulation would provide protection from reoxygenation (23Marxsen J.H. Stengel P. Doege K. Heikkinen P. Jokilehto T. Wagner T. Jelkmann W.

We recently suggested that induced PHD levels compensate for the lack of oxygen also under hypoxic conditions and thereby define an adapted HIF threshold (25Stiehl D.P. Wirthner R. Köditz J.

In addition, not only increased PHD levels but also overactivation of the catalytic activity of the PHD isoforms by chronic hypoxia has been proposed (26Ginouvès A. Ilc K. Macías N. Pouysségur J. Berra E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4745-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of HIF hydroxylases can also be modulated by interfering with the different cofactors. Krebs cycle intermediates like fumarate and succinate inhibit PHDs, and genetic defects in fumarate hydratase or succinate dehydrogenases predispose to tumor formation involving accumulation of HIFα (27Isaacs J.S.

Genet. 2005; 14: 2231-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In addition, also cellular availability of iron and ascorbate influences the catalytic activity of HIF hydroxylases. Iron and ascorbate supplementation suppressed HIF-1α accumulation in cancer cells, and decreased ascorbate levels resulted in HIF-1α stabilization (30Knowles H.J. Raval R.R. Harris A.L.

Finally also reactive oxygen species as well as nitric oxide have been shown to interfere with HIFα stabilization by modulating PHD activity (32Mansfield K.D. Guzy R.D. Pan Y. Young R.M. Cash T.P.

Apart from regulation of PHD mRNA levels and hydroxylase activity, differences in PHD protein abundance are directly linked to hydroxylation activity because HIF hydroxylation is a non-reversible process. Strikingly whereas PHD1 and PHD3 protein stability has been reported to be regulated by polyubiquitylation through the ubiquitin ligase Siah2, probably involving additional protein interfaces, the proteolytic regulation of the main oxygen sensor PHD2 remained unknown (35Nakayama K.

Wirthner R. Nytko K.J. Edlich F. Katschinski D.M. Stiehl D.P. Wenger R.H. Camenisch G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3758-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although this effect was independent of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of FKBP38, the precise molecular mechanism remained unknown. Here we biochemically characterized the PHD2/FKBP38 interaction in more detail by defining the minimal FKBP38 fragment required for PHD2 binding and provide evidence that in cellulo interaction as well as functional regulation of PHD2 protein abundance depends on the membrane-associated localization of FKBP38. These findings imply that PHD2 is not diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm but localizes to defined intracellular structures that determine PHD2 protein stability and hydroxylase function. If not indicated otherwise, cloning was carried out using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Cloning of PCR fragments into entry vectors and recombination to destination vectors were described previously (45Barth S. Nesper J. Hasgall P.A. Wirthner R. Nytko K.J. Edlich F. Katschinski D.M. Stiehl D.P. Wenger R.H. Camenisch G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3758-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas (Labforce, Nunnigen, Switzerland) or New England Biolabs (Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland). pENTR4-PHD2 from residues 1 to 162 (pENTR4-PHD21–162), pENTR4-PHD21–31, pENTR4-PHD21–58, and pENTR4-PHD21–114 were obtained by amplifying the corresponding PHD2 cDNAs from the plasmid pENTR/D-PHD2 by PCR and cloning into XhoI/NcoI-digested pENTR4. pENTR/D-PHD221–426 and pENTR/D-PHD263–426 were obtained by digesting with MscI/ScaI or MscI/KasI followed by Klenow fill-in and religation. pENTR4-FKBP381–389 was generated by inserting a stop codon in pENTR4-FKBP381–412 by site-directed mutagenesis. The inserts of all entry vectors were verified by DNA sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). The mammalian Matchmaker vectors pM and pVP16 (Clontech, Takara Bio Europe) were converted to destination vectors by ligation of the Gateway vector conversion cassette reading frame B (Invitrogen) into the EcoRI sites of pM and pVP16. The mammalian one-hybrid plasmid pM-HIF-1α370–429-VP16-AD and GST-HIF-1α530–826 were generated as described previously (45Barth S. Nesper J. Hasgall P.A. Wirthner R. Nytko K.J. Edlich F.

V5-tagged expression vectors were generated by recombination of entry vectors with pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST. Fluorescent expression vectors pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) were converted to destination vectors by ligation of the Gateway vector conversion cassette reading frame B (Invitrogen) into the SmaI sites of pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 to generate pECFP-C1-DEST and pEYFP-C1-DEST, respectively. Chemicals were purchased from the following companies: cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma), E64 (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Alexis Biochemicals), MG132 (Sigma), N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met (Calbiochem, Merck Chemicals, VWR International, Switzerland), and Pepstatin A (Alexis Biochemicals). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Peptides were produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis with the robot Syro II (MultiSynTech, Witten, Germany) using 0.15 mmol of preloaded Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-Wang resin (Novabiochem, Läufelfingen, Switzerland). The synthesis was performed by Fmoc strategy and standard protocol as described previously (38Edlich F. Maestre-Martínez M. Jarczowski F. Weiwad M. Moutty M.C. Maleseviæ M. Jahreis G. Fischer G. Lücke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36496-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The purity of the peptides was evaluated by analytical HPLC, and the correct molecular masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Using the standard SPOT synthesis protocol (47Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar), the peptides were synthesized stepwise by an Abimed Asp 222 synthesizer on a cellulose membrane derivatized with two β-Ala residues as linker. Before immunoblot screening, the dry peptide array membranes were rinsed for 10 min in methanol and three times for 20 min in TBS buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mm NaCl, 6.4 mm KCl). PHD2 variant solutions (100 nm) in TBS buffer were allowed to react with peptide array membranes for 4 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. The membrane was subsequently washed three times with TBS buffer, and bound protein was blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed using polyclonal rabbit anti-PHD2 antibodies (Novus Biologicals, Lubio Science, Lucerne, Switzerland). Streptavin-agarose (Sigma) was saturated with biotin-EEEEEEEEEEDDLSELPPLE-NH2 peptide and washed three times with incubation buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). PHD2 variants (1 μm) were incubated either in the presence or absence of Ac-EEEEEEEEEEDDLSELPPLE-NH2 peptide (20 μm) and FKBP38 (10 μm) with the affinity matrix for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently the samples were washed three times with incubation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Binding of PHD2 was analyzed using polyclonal rabbit anti-PHD2 antibodies (Novus Biologicals). For incubation with endogenous rat proteins, rat liver was decomposed in 50 mm Hepes buffer (4% Chaps, 1% dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to the affinity matrix analogously to the PHD2 proteins. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences FluoroMax2 fluorescence spectrometer using a 1 × 1-cm cuvette with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and excitation and emission slit widths of 5 and 3 nm, respectively. To compensate for inner filter effects, the samples for fluorescence measurements were diluted to an optical density at 280 nm of 0.15. Protein samples were applied in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The binding constant (KD) was calculated from the fluorescence intensity by using the equation P0⋅α=C0⋅αn(1−α)−KDn(Eq. 1) where P0 is total protein concentration, α is (Fmax − F)/(Fmax − F0), Fmax is fluorescence intensity at saturation, F0 is initial fluorescence intensity, n is the number of independent binding sites, C0 is total PHD2 concentration at each addition, and KD is the dissociation constant. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-AI (Invitrogen) by induction with 0.02% arabinose for 4 h and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Purification of GST-PHD2 from Sf9 insect cells was described previously (48Wirthner R. Balamurugan K. Stiehl D.P. Barth S. Spielmann P. Oehme F. Flamme I. Katschinski D.M. Wenger R.H. Camenisch G. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 435: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). S4 and S2 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS from pGEX-6P-PSMC1 and pGEX-6P-PSMD2, respectively. IVTT reactions were carried out as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland) using recombined destination vectors in the presence of [35S]Met (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). Purified GST-tagged proteins (10 μg) were diluted in bead binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. For pulldown experiments, 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte IVTT reactions or 10 μg of purified recombinant proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with bound GST fusion proteins in co-IP buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), washed four times with co-IP buffer, boiled in sample buffer (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried, and radioactively labeled proteins were detected by phosphorimaging (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). HeLa cervical carcinoma, HEK293 embryonic kidney carcinoma, MCF-7 breast cancer, mouse ts20, and H38-5 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) as described previously (46Camenisch G.

Generation of stable RNAi-mediated down-regulation of FKBP38 was reported previously (45Barth S. Nesper J. Hasgall P.A. Wirthner R. Nytko K.J. Edlich F. Katschinski D.M. Stiehl D.P. Wenger R.H. Camenisch G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 3758-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with pSilencer2.1-U6 hygro (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) containing either a control or FKBP38 targeting sequence, and single clones were selected by limited dilution. FKBP38 expression was analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Strong FKBP38 down-regulation was observed in stable clones 3D6 and 2G8. Transient transfections were performed with the polyethylenimine (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) method as reported before (25Stiehl D.P. Wirthner R. Köditz J. Spielmann P. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H. J.

Total cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce, Perbio Science). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (49Martin F. Linden T. Katschinski D.M. Oehme F. Flamme I.

Assays were performed as described by the manufacturer (Proteasome-GloTM assay system, Promega). Briefly HeLa cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm ATP, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was further lysed in the same lysis buffer as described above except that Triton X-100 was 0.5% and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was saved as the membrane fraction. Lysates (5 μg in 10 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) were incubated at room temperature with 10 μl of Suc-LLVY-GloTM (chymotrypsin-like), Z-LRR-GloTM (trypsin-like), or Z-nLPnLD-GloTM (where nL is norleucine) (caspase-like) reagent for 30 min before hydrolysis of the peptide was measured (Berthold Technologies, Regensdorf, Switzerland). Cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm KCl) on ice for 20 min and afterward Dounce homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and non-lysed cells. To separate the membrane from the cytosolic fraction, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer, overlaid on a 10–30% iodixanol gradient, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 18 h to separate the membrane fractions. 1-ml fractions were obtained by puncture of the centrifugation tubes and analyzed by immunoblotting.

https://openalex.org/W1984519429,"Infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric carcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA, which is delivered into gastric epithelial cells, specifically binds to and aberrantly activates SHP-2 oncoprotein. CagA also interacts with and inhibits partitioning-defective 1 (PAR1)/MARK kinase, which phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins to destabilize microtubules and thereby causes epithelial polarity defects. In light of the notion that microtubules are not only required for polarity regulation but also essential for the formation of mitotic spindles, we hypothesized that CagA-mediated PAR1 inhibition also influences mitosis. Here, we investigated the effect of CagA on the progression of mitosis. In the presence of CagA, cells displayed a delay in the transition from prophase to metaphase. Furthermore, a fraction of the CagA-expressing cells showed spindle misorientation at the onset of anaphase, followed by chromosomal segregation with abnormal division axis. The effect of CagA on mitosis was abolished by elevated PAR1 expression. Conversely, inhibition of PAR1 kinase elicited mitotic delay similar to that induced by CagA. Thus, CagA-mediated inhibition of PAR1, which perturbs microtubule stability and thereby causes microtubule-based spindle dysfunction, is involved in the prophase/metaphase delay and subsequent spindle misorientation. Consequently, chronic exposure of cells to CagA induces chromosomal instability. Our findings reveal a bifunctional role of CagA as an oncoprotein: CagA elicits uncontrolled cell proliferation by aberrantly activating SHP-2 and at the same time induces chromosomal instability by perturbing the microtubule-based mitotic spindle. The dual function of CagA may cooperatively contribute to the progression of multistep gastric carcinogenesis.

Recent studies have revealed that gain-of-function mutations of SHP-2 are associated with a variety of human malignancies, indicating that SHP-2 is a bona fide human oncoprotein. Furthermore, transgenic expression of CagA in mice induces gastrointestinal and hematological malignancies in a manner that is dependent on CagA tyrosine phosphorylation (22Ohnishi N. Yuasa H.

A polarized epithelial monolayer is characterized by the presence of well developed cell-cell interaction apparatuses such as tight junctions and adherens junctions. The tight junctions act as a paracellular barrier in polarized epithelial cells and play an essential role in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity by delimiting the apical and basolateral membrane domains. CagA disrupts the tight junctions and causes loss of epithelial apical-basal polarity (23Amieva M.R. Vogelmann R. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Nelson W.J. Falkow S.

PAR1 acts as a master regulator for the regulation of cell polarity in various cell systems. During epithelial polarization, PAR1 specifically localizes to the basolateral membrane, whereas atypical PKC complexed with PAR3 and PAR6 (aPKC complex) specifically localizes to the apical membrane as well as the tight junctions (29Suzuki A. Hirata M. Kamimura K. Maniwa R. Yamanaka T. Mizuno K. Kishikawa M. Hirose H. Amano Y. Izumi N. Miwa Y. Ohno S. Curr.

This asymmetric distribution of the two kinases, PAR1 and aPKC complex, ensures formation and maintenance of epithelial apical-basal polarity. Notably, mammalian PAR1 kinases were originally identified as microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs), which phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as Tau, MAP2, and MAP4 on their tubulin-binding repeats. The PAR1/MARK-dependent phosphorylation causes MAPs to detach from and thereby destabilize microtubules (32Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 33Ebneth A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Importantly, microtubules form a mitotic spindle, which plays an indispensable role in chromosomal alignment and separation during mitosis, raising the possibility that PAR1 regulates mitosis through controlling stability of the mitotic spindle. Indeed, during mitosis, MAPs undergo a severalfold higher level of phosphorylation (34Vandré D.D. Centonze V.E. Peloquin J. Tombes R.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 577-588PubMed Google Scholar, 35Preuss U. Doring F. Illenberger S. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and microtubule dynamics increase ∼20-fold (36Saxton W.M. Stemple D.L. Leslie R.J. Salmon E.D. Zavortink M. Mclntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This in turn raises the intriguing possibility that CagA influences chromosomal stability by subverting MAP phosphorylation through systemic inhibition of PAR1. In this study, the effects of CagA on microtubule-dependent cellular events, especially dynamics of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, were examined. The results of this work provide evidence that CagA perturbs mitotic spindle checkpoint and thereby causes chromosomal instability. Given the role of chromosomal instability in cell transformation, the newly identified CagA activity may play a crucial role in the development of gastric carcinoma.

MKN28 human gastric epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. WT-A10 cell line was an MKN28-derived stable transfectant clone, in which CagA was inducibly expressed by using the tetracycline-regulatable tet-off system (37Murata-Kamiya N. Kurashima Y.

For establishment of stable cell lines that constitutively express a fusion protein of green fluorescence protein (GFP) and human histone H2B, WT-A10 cells were transfected with H2B-GFP expression vector and cultured with 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Funakoshi) (38Izumi M.

Drug-resistant colonies were examined under fluorescence microscopy, and GFP-positive cells were isolated and then single cell cloned by limiting dilution method. The H2B-GFP expression vector was kindly provided by T. Kanda (Aichi Cancer Center, Japan). A recombinant adenovirus that expresses wild-type (WT) PAR1b, dominant-negative PAR1b (PAR1b MC) (25Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Brij-35, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on chamber slide in the presence or absence of 0.2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox). After 12-h incubation, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then treated overnight with primary antibody and were visualized with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Images were captured by using a confocal microscope system (Olympus). Cells were cultured on collagen-coated 35-mm culture dishes in the presence or absence of Dox. After 12-h incubation, culture medium was replaced by phenol-red free RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) and 10% fetal bovine serum. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was performed on the stage maintained at 37 °C and images were acquired every 3 min with a charge-coupled device camera (Princeton) controlled by Molecular Devices MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.) using a 20× objective (Olympus). Cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% cold ethanol at −20 °C overnight. After centrifugation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma). Cells were stained at room temperature with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and subjected to flow cytometric analysis by using FACScan and Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). It was previously reported that a fusion protein of GFP and human histone H2B (H2B-GFP) is incorporated into nucleosome core particles without perturbing cell cycle progression (39Kanda T. Sullivan K.F. Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we employed H2B-GFP to visualize mitotic chromosomal segregation in living cells by time-lapse analysis. To do so, an expression vector for H2B-GFP was transfected into MKN28-derived WT-A10 cells, in which CagA was inducibly expressed by depleting the tetracycline-analog doxycycline (Dox) from the culture supernatant (37Murata-Kamiya N. Kurashima Y. Teishikata Y. Yamahashi Y. Saito Y. Higashi H. Aburatani H. Akiyama T. Peek Jr., R.M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4617-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). After drug selection and limiting dilution, several transfectant clones with a high level of GFP expression and strict regulation of CagA induction by Dox were chosen for further analysis. One of the established clones, A10/H2B-GFP, was arbitrarily chosen and subsequently used in this work (Fig. 1). A10/H2B-GFP cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes with or without Dox, and the progression of mitosis in the presence or absence of CagA was monitored using a time-lapse fluorescence microscope. In the absence of CagA, cells initiated prophase and reached the anaphase without overt abnormality (Fig. 2 and supplemental video 1). In the presence of CagA, however, cells exhibited delayed chromosomal segregation. To quantitatively evaluate the effect of CagA on the progression of mitosis from prophase to anaphase, the time required from the onset of chromosome condensation to the onset of chromosomal separation was measured (Fig. 3). In the absence of CagA, cells required ∼30–40 min for the prophase-to-anaphase transition. In contrast, in the presence of CagA, cells took ∼60–80 min on average from prophase to the onset of anaphase. In fact, some of the CagA-expressing cells required >100 min for the transition. To quantitatively evaluate cells entering prophase or metaphase, cells were stained with an antibody specific to phosphorylated Serine 10 of histone H3 (H3-pSer10), which serves as a prophase/metaphase marker, and the number of H3-pSer10-positive cells was counted. As expected, the number of H3-pSer10-positive cells in the presence of CagA was two times larger than that in the absence of CagA (Fig. 4A). To exclude the possibility that the increase in prophase/metaphase cells was due to accelerated cell cycle progression by CagA, cells with CagA induction and those without CagA induction were treated with nocodazole to arrest them in prophase/metaphase. Following nocodazole treatment, there was no difference in the numbers of cells undergoing mitosis in the presence and absence of CagA at each time point after CagA induction (12, 15, and 18 h) (Fig. 4B), indicating that CagA does not accelerate cell cycle progression. Furthermore, CagA expression did not influence the number of cells in anaphase (Fig. 4C). The results indicate that CagA specifically delays the progression from prophase to anaphase during mitosis.FIGURE 4Delay in prophase and metaphase by CagA. A, WT-A10 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Dox.

Error bars indicate the mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.05, statistically significant (Student舗s t test) (n = 3).

Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M. Nature. 2007; 447: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To investigate whether inhibition of PAR1 by CagA is involved in the CagA-mediated delay in prophase-metaphase transition, we produced a recombinant adenovirus that expresses omni-tagged PAR1b, one of four PAR1 isoforms in mammals (30Macara I.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Infection with PAR1b-transducing adenovirus in WT-A10 abolished the ability of CagA to induce the prophase-metaphase delay (Fig. 5). On the other hand, infection with adenovirus transducing a dominant-negative PAR1b (PAR1b MC) increased the number of cells in prophase/metaphase cells in the absence of CagA (Fig. 5). Induction of CagA in cells expressing PAR1b MC did not have an additional effect on prophase-metaphase delay caused by PAR1b MC. These results indicate that CagA delays progression from prophase to anaphase through inhibition of PAR1. Through the time-lapse analysis of mitotic cells, we noticed that a fraction of CagA-expressing cells exhibited aberrant cell division, the direction of which is not parallel to culture dish (Fig. 2 and supplemental video 2). To investigate the mechanism, we sought to examine chromosomal positioning during mitosis in more detail. To this end, we determined the chromosomal orientation of A10/H2B-GFP cells during anaphase by using a confocal fluorescence microscope. In the absence of CagA, most daughter chromosomes separated parallel to the culture dish. In contrast, in the presence of CagA, a significant fraction of cells displayed mispositioning of daughter chromosomes (Fig. 6A). The angles between the inclination of two daughter chromosomes and the culture dish surface (Fig. 6B, left, α) were then measured in anaphase cells. In the presence of CagA, the percentage of cells with spindle misorientation, in which the angle α inclines more than 10°, was significantly increased compared with the percentage of CagA-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that CagA expression causes spindle misorientation and thereby perturbs the cell division axis. As a consequence, two daughter cells failed to attach to the culture dish evenly (supplemental Fig. 1). Perturbation of mitotic progression by CagA suggests that chronic exposure of cells to CagA causes chromosomal instability in cells. To test this possibility, WT-A10 cells were cultured for 6 days with or without intermittent induction of CagA by depleting Dox from the culture on days 1, 3, and 5. Consistent with the above-described data showing mitotic delay by CagA, flow cytometric analysis of DNA contents revealed that CagA exposure increases cells in mitosis (M-phase). The results also revealed the appearance of cells with an 8N peak only in cells chronically exposed to CagA (Fig. 7). In these CagA-expressing cells, the percentage of cells with DNA content of more than 4N was about three-times greater than that of control cells. On the other hand, the number of cells in G1 phase was significantly reduced in the presence of CagA, most probably due to an increase in the number of cells in G2/M as well as dramatic accumulation of cells with >4N. Effect of CagA on S-phase was marginal. These results indicate that chronic exposure to CagA induces aneuploidy and polyploidy in cells. The results are also in agreement with the results of a previous study showing that checkpoint activation (mitotic delay) is often transient, with some cells slipping past the arrest and producing a tetraploid population due to defective cell division (40Storchova Z. Pellman D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). From the observations, we conclude that repeated exposure to CagA, which represents chronic infection with cagA-positive H. pylori in vivo, induces chromosomal instability in host cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that expression of H. pylori CagA results in delay of the progression from prophase to metaphase in mitosis and causes spindle misorientation at the onset of anaphase due to a destabilized cell division axis, resulting in induction of chromosomal instability. We previously demonstrated that CagA specifically binds to PAR1, comprising four isoforms (PAR1a, b, c, and d), and inhibits the kinase activity (25Saadat I. Higashi H. Obuse C. Umeda M. Murata-Kamiya N. Saito Y. Lu H. Ohnishi N. Azuma T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Hatakeyama M. Nature. 2007; 447: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PAR1 acts as an MARK and thereby plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule stability upon MAP phosphorylation (32Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 33Ebneth A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PAR1-mediated MAP phosphorylation causes dissociation of MAPs from the microtubules and destabilizes microtubules. Given that microtubules are essentially involved in mitosis as components of the mitotic spindle, our results indicate that CagA perturbs mitosis by binding to PAR1 kinase and inhibiting its activity. In metazoans, the spindle-assembly checkpoint plays a critical role in mitosis to ensure appropriate alignment of chromosomes prior to the onset of anaphase to enable segregation of genetic materials to each daughter cell (41Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 42Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). At the beginning of mitosis, when kinetochores are unattached, the spindle-assembly checkpoint proteins are activated to coordinate the variable duration of microtubule-chromosome attachment and chromosomal alignment with subsequent loss of sister-chromatid cohesion at metaphase to anaphase transition. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that CagA delays chromosomal separation. The observations imply that CagA subverts mitotic spindle organization and/or attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, both of which are attributable to the impaired microtubule functions caused by CagA-mediated PAR1 inhibition, thereby keeping the spindle checkpoint machinery in its active state. Another abnormality that was found to be associated with CagA expression during mitosis is spindle misorientation at the end of metaphase. Equal attachment of two daughter cells to the culture dish is ensured by the positioning of the spindle axis parallel to the long cell axis during mitosis. In turn, spindle misorientation causes uneven attachment of the two daughter cells to the dish following mitosis, as observed in cells expressing CagA. Théry et al. reported that the spindle orientation is controlled by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (43Théry M. Racine V. Pépin A. Piel M. Chen Y. Sibarita J.B. Bornens M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Toyoshima and Nishida showed that the spindle is oriented parallel to the cell-extracellular matrix adhesion plane via β1-integrin-mediated signaling (44Toyoshima F. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This observation provides a molecular basis for the spindle misorientation in cells expressing CagA: CagA inhibits PAR1 and thereby perturbs microtubule stability, which in turn causes malfunctioning of microtubules, including astral microtubules. Consequently, cells expressing CagA generate an inadequate cell division axis and thereby initiate aberrant cell division, the direction of which is not parallel to culture dish. Interestingly, when ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, PAR1a, PAR1b, and PAR1c are distributed uniformly to the cytoplasm, whereas PAR1d preferentially localizes to the centrosome and microtubules. Notably, acentrosomal cells lack radial arrays of astral microtubules and are therefore defective in spindle positioning, indicating that the centrosome ensures the fidelity of chromosomal segregation (45Varmark H. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 904-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, PAR1d might be a primary target of CagA in perturbing the mitotic process. Also, it is noted that mitotic spindles are oriented parallel to the substratum through a mechanism that is dependent on integrin-mediated cell-substrate adhesion (44Toyoshima F. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 46Toyoshima F. Matsumura S. Morimoto H. Mitsushima M. Nishida E. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 796-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this regard, CagA-deregulated SHP-2 is known to dephosphorylate FAK and thereby inhibit focal adhesions. Accordingly, CagA-mediated SHP-2 activation may cooperate with CagA-mediated inhibition of PAR1 to induce destabilization of spindle orientation and formation of an improper cell division axis. Inhibition of proteins involved in spindle assembly causes mitotic delay and ultimately promotes segregation errors and aneuploidy, leading to chromosomal instability (47Wu G. Lin Y.T. Wei R. Chen Y. Shan Z. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3652-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our study also showed that chronic exposure to CagA induces chromosomal instability in cells. This CagA activity, caused by malfunctioning of the mitotic process, may significantly contribute to carcinogenesis. Notably, the effect of CagA on mitosis is relatively mild. However, compared with drastic perturbations of chromosomal segregation that would immediately trigger apoptosis, mild perturbation of chromosomal alignment is more likely to increase the chance to generate variant cells that can escape from the mitotic spindle checkpoint (41Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 48Weaver B.A. Silk A.D. Montagna C. Verdier-Pinard P. Cleveland D.W. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Our present work reveals that CagA exploits the chromosomal segregation system for pathogenesis. The newly identified CagA activity increases the chance for cells to acquire additional genetic alterations that contribute to tumor progression toward more aggressive phenotypes. Our findings therefore reveal a bifunctional role of CagA as an oncoprotein. On the one hand, CagA stimulates unscheduled cell proliferation by targeting signal transducing molecules such as SHP-2, and, on the other hand, it increases genetic instability by disturbing the microtubule-based mitotic spindles. The dual function of CagA may cooperatively contribute to the progression of multistep gastric carcinogenesis. We thank Dr. Teru Kanda for the H2B-GFP expression vector.

Previously, we reported on the development of an anti-AM antibody that potently inhibits tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Here, we report the effect of anti-AM receptor antibodies (alphaAMRs) on angiogenesis and tumor growth. We demonstrate that alphaAMRs decrease in a dose-dependent manner the growth of U87 glioblastoma cells and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells, but not A549 lung cancer cells, in vitro. In vivo, AM in Matrigel plugs induces angiogenesis by promoting recruitment of endothelial cells, pericytes, myeloid precursor cells, and macrophages and by promoting channel formation. Remarkably, systemic administration of alphaAMRs every 3 d markedly reduced neovascularization of Matrigel plugs in a dose-dependent fashion, as demonstrated by reduced numbers of the recruited cells and vessel structures. Several human tumor xenografts in athymic mice were used to examine the effect of alphaAMR treatment on tumor angiogenesis and growth. AlphaAMR treatment significantly suppressed the growth of glioblastoma, lung, and colon tumors. Histological examination of alphaAMR-treated tumors showed evidence of disruption of tumor vascularity with decreased microvessel density, depletion of endothelial and pericyte cells, and increased tumor cell apoptosis. These findings support the conclusion that alphaAMR treatment inhibits tumor growth by suppression of angiogenesis and tumor growth and suggest that AMRs may be useful therapeutic targets."

However, the antineoplastic activity of two natural occuring triterpenoid alcohols extracted from olive oil, erythrodiol (an intermediate from oleanolic acid), and its isomer, uvaol, has barely been reported, particularly on brain cancer cells. Astrocytomas are among the most common and aggressive type of primary malignant tumors in the neurological system lacking effective treatments, and in this study, we addressed the effect of these two triterpenic diols on the human 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line. Principal Findings Erythrodiol and uvaol effectively affected cell proliferation, as well as cell cycle phases and induced 1321N1 cell death. Both triterpenes successfully modulated the apoptotic response, promoting nuclear condensation and fragmentation. They caused retraction and rounding of cultured cells, which lost adherence from their supports, while F-actin and vimentin filaments disappeared as an organized cytoplasmic network. At molecular level, changes in the expression of surface proteins associated with adhesion or death processes were also observed. Moreover, triterpene exposure resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and correlated with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The presence of catalase reversed the triterpenic diols-induced mitochondrial depolarization, JNK activation, and apoptotic death, indicating the critical role of ROS in the action of these compounds. Conclusions Overall, we provide a significant insight into the anticarcinogenic action of erythrodiol and uvaol that may have a potential in prevention and treatment of brain tumors and other cancers."

Because longitudinal investigations of primary HIV-infection is limited by the availability of lymphoid organs, we studied the tissue-specific B-cell dysfunctions in acutely simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mac251-infected Cynomolgus macaques. Methods and Findings Experiments were performed on three groups of macaques infected for 14, 21 or 28 days and on three groups of animals treated with HAART for two-weeks either initiated at 4 h, 7 or 14 days post-infection (p.i.). We have simultaneously compared changes in B-cell phenotypes and functions and tissue organization of B-cell areas in various lymphoid organs. We showed that SIV induced a steady decline in SIgG-expressing memory (SIgD−CD27+) B-cells in spleen and lymph nodes during the first 4 weeks of infection, concomitant to selective homing/sequestration of B-cells to the small intestine and spleen. SIV non-specific Ig production was transiently increased before D14p.i., whereas SIV-specific Ig production was only detectable after D14p.i., coinciding with the presence of CD8+ T-cells and IgG-expressing plasma cells within germinal centres. Transient B-cell apoptosis on D14p.i. and commitment to terminal differentiation contributed to memory B-cell loss. HAART abrogated B-cell apoptosis, homing to the small intestine and SIV-specific Ig production but had minimal effect on early Ig production, increased B-cell proportions in spleen and loss of memory B-cells. Therefore, virus–B-cell interactions and SIV-induced inflammatory cytokines may differently contribute to early B-cell dysfunction and impaired SIV/HIV-specific antibody response. Conclusions These data establish tissue-specific impairments in B-cell trafficking and functions and a generalized and steady memory B-cell loss in secondary lymphoid organs. Characterization of underlying mechanisms would be helpful in designing new therapeutic strategies to dampen B-cell activation and increases HIV/SIV specific antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W2074437085,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most frequent inherited neuromuscular disorder, affecting 1 person in 2500. CMT1A, the most common form of CMT, is usually caused by a duplication of chromosome 17p11.2, containing the PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein-22) gene; overexpression of PMP22 in Schwann cells (SC) is believed to cause demyelination, although the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report an abnormally high basal concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in SC from CMT1A rats. By the use of specific pharmacological inhibitors and through down-regulation of expression by small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that the high [Ca2+]i is caused by a PMP22-related overexpression of the P2X7 purinoceptor/channel leading to influx of extracellular Ca2+ into CMT1A SC. Correction of the altered [Ca2+]i in CMT1A SC by small interfering RNA or with pharmacological inhibitors of P2X7 restores functional parameters of SC (migration and release of ciliary neurotrophic factor), which are typically defective in CMT1A SC. More significantly, stable down-regulation of the expression of P2X7 restores myelination in co-cultures of CMT1A SC with dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. These results establish a pathogenetic link between high [Ca2+]i and impaired SC function in CMT1A and identify overexpression of P2X7 as the molecular mechanism underlying both abnormalities. The development of P2X7 inhibitors is expected to provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of CMT1A neuropathy.

By the use of specific pharmacological inhibitors and through down-regulation of expression by small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that the high [Ca2+]i is caused by a PMP22-related overexpression of the P2X7 purinoceptor/channel leading to influx of extracellular Ca2+ into CMT1A SC. Correction of the altered [Ca2+]i in CMT1A SC by small interfering RNA or with pharmacological inhibitors of P2X7 restores functional parameters of SC (migration and release of ciliary neurotrophic factor), which are typically defective in CMT1A SC. More significantly, stable down-regulation of the expression of P2X7 restores myelination in co-cultures of CMT1A SC with dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. These results establish a pathogenetic link between high [Ca2+]i and impaired SC function in CMT1A and identify overexpression of P2X7 as the molecular mechanism underlying both abnormalities. The development of P2X7 inhibitors is expected to provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of CMT1A neuropathy.

Karnes J.L. Lambert E.H. Neurology. 1989; 39: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With a prevalence of 1 case in 2500, CMT1 is the most common hereditary neurologic disorder, and in the majority of cases (CMT1A) the disease is associated with a duplication on chromosome 17p11.2 of the gene for PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein 22) (2Lupski J.R. de Oca-Luna R.M. Slaugenhaupt S. Pentao L. Guzzetta V. Trask B.J. Saucedo-Cardenas O. Barker D.F. Killian J.M. Garcia C.A. Chakravarti A. Patel P.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 219-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). PMP22 is a 22-kDa glycoprotein mainly expressed by myelinating Schwann cells (SC) and localized in compact myelin (3Suter U. Scherer S.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 714-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The transgenic rat model of CMT1A, obtained by overexpression of PMP22 (4Sereda M. Griffiths I. Pühlhofer A. Stewart H.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 1049-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), confirms a role of PMP22 in the pathogenesis of CMT1A. Both PMP22 overexpression because of gene duplication and point mutations of PMP22 are associated with a CMT1A phenotype.

The biochemical mechanisms correlating PMP22 dysfunction with demyelination are still unclear. Some reports indicate that a perturbed homeostasis of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) might be causally involved in the demyelination process. Conditions inducing an increased [Ca2+]i in SC impair cell differentiation and myelination (5Smith K.J. Hall S.M. Schauf C.L. J. Neurol. Sci. 1985; 71: 19-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Stevens B. Fields R.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), similarly to what occurs in CMT1A. Incubation of intact rat nerves with Ca2+ and ionophores causes a progressive demyelination, spreading from the paranodes and invading regions of formerly compact myelin, which is dependent upon a rise in the [Ca2+]i of SC (5Smith K.J. Hall S.M. Schauf C.L. J. Neurol. Sci. 1985; 71: 19-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the detrimental effect of a [Ca2+]i elevation on myelin production by SC comes from application of ATP to murine SC monocultures, inducing an immediate and large increase in the [Ca2+]i. As a result of ATP treatment, maturation and differentiation of SC, as well as expression of the myelin basic protein and production of compact myelin, are completely prevented (6Stevens B. Fields R.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above observations indicate that abnormally elevated Ca2+ levels are causally related to impairment of myelin production by SC. In this study, we addressed the possible correlation between PMP22 overexpression and alteration of the [Ca2+]i homeostasis in SC from a rat model of CMT1A. We recorded higher levels of basal [Ca2+]i in affected than in control cells, and we identified the mechanisms responsible for the perturbation of the [Ca2+]i levels in CMT1A SC. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors and with small interfering RNA (siRNA) unequivocally demonstrated a correlation in CMT1A SC between overexpression of the purinergic receptor P2X7 and influx of extracellular [Ca2+]i across this plasma membrane receptor/channel. In addition, correction of the abnormally elevated [Ca2+]i levels by the use of a P2X7 antagonist or through down-regulation of the expression of P2X7 by transfection with siRNA or with short hairpin RNA-expressing plasmid (shRNA) restored the normal phenotype in CMT1A SC. These findings suggest that CMT1A should be considered as a “calcium disease.” Identification of P2X7 activation as the pathogenetic mechanism underlying demyelination may provide the rationale for a new therapeutic strategy for CMT1A, a disease with no currently available treatment. Commercially available monoclonal antibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP) (MAB386, Millipore, Milano, Italy), myelin protein zero (MPZ) (P07 extracellular domain, Astexx Ltd. & Co. KEG, Graz, Austria), L1 (MAB5272, Millipore), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (G3893, Sigma), and β-tubulin (clone TUB2.1) (T4026, Sigma) and polyclonal antibodies against the transcription factor Krox-20 (Egr2) (PRB-236P, Covance, Princeton, NJ), P2X7 (Calbiochem), and total neurofilament (N4142, Sigma) were used in these experiments. Polyclonal antibody against Gas3/PMP22 was kindly provided by Dr. C. Brancolini (Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia and MATI Center of Excellence, Università di Udine, Italy). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) were used in Western blot analyses; ALEXA488 anti-mouse IgG and ALEXA594 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) antibodies were used for immunofluorescence reactions. Transgenic Sprague-Dawley rats overexpressing PMP22 (CMT1A rats) were genotyped by PCR (4Sereda M. Griffiths I. Pühlhofer A. Stewart H. Rossner M.J. Zimmerman F. Magyar J.P. Schneider A. Hund E. Meinck H.M. Suter U. Nave K.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1049-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Heterozygous (+/−) animals and normal age-matched littermates were used for experiments. Rearing conditions were consistent with the guidelines of the Italian Health Ministry relating to the use and storage of transgenic organisms. Primary SC cultures were isolated from sciatic nerves of adult and newborn CMT1A rats, as described previously (7Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 8Nobbio L. Vigo T. Abbruzzese M. Levi G. Brancolini C. Mantero S. Grandis M. Benedetti L. Mancardi G. Schenone A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 16: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Control SC cultures were obtained from wild type rats with the corresponding genetic background. SC from adult animals were grown for 4 days in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10−5m cytosine arabinoside (Sigma). SC cultures were then processed for molecular, biochemical, and functional assays (migration and release of ciliary neurotrophic factor) 24 h later or after 3 more weeks in culture (5- and 25-day-old cultures, respectively). Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed on 5-day-old cultures from adult CMT1A or from wild type rats. Characterization of these cells was performed by Western blot and immunofluorescence (see below). SC from newborn rats were used for molecular, biochemical, and myelination experiments. Primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons were established from 15-day-old wild type rat embryos. After extraction under sterile conditions, 35–40 DRG were removed from each embryo, incubated for 30 min with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' solution, and minced to obtain a suspension of DRG cells. Cells were washed and resuspended in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum, ascorbic acid (100 μg/ml final concentration), and nerve growth factor (NGF) at 5 ng/ml final concentration. This suspension was plated on collagen-coated ACLAR dishes at a density of 15 × 104 cells/dish. After 48 h, cells were treated with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine medium (neurobasal medium, 15% newborn calf serum, NGF, ascorbic acid, and 10−5m 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine and uridine) (Invitrogen) for two 48-h cycles to eliminate fibroblasts. For myelination, 3 × 105 primary SC from newborn rats were seeded onto DRG neurons (see below). Characterization of CMT1A and wild type SC by real time PCR analyses for PMP22, MPZ, MBP, L1, Krox-20, and GFAP was performed as described below. SC lysates from wild type and CMT1A rats were prepared in 100 μl of the lysis buffer specific for the protein analyzed (myelin proteins buffer: 95 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.01% protease inhibitor mixture; transcription factor (Krox-20) buffer: 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; cytoskeleton proteins BUST buffer: 0.5% SDS, 8 m urea, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Total protein content was determined by the protein detection kit (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) from normal and transgenic animals were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with the specific primary antibodies against PMP22, MBP, MPZ, L1, KROX-20, or GFAP for 18 h and with the antibody against β-tubulin for 1 h. Following ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences), band intensity was measured with the Gel Doc 1000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). The expression of each protein was normalized on β-tubulin. Adherent (on 20-mm coverslips) wild type and CMT1A SC were incubated with 10 μm Fura-2AM in complete medium for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). The coverslips were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM35, Germany), and [Ca2+]i calibrations were performed as described previously (9Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Wild type and CMT1A SC were also seeded in 96-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells/well) incubated with 10 μm Fluo-3AM in complete medium for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed with HBSS. Ca2+ measurements upon addition of 1 mm ATP were performed in 96-well plates, and fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm) was measured every 3 s with a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima; BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany), as described (10Moreschi I. Bruzzone S. Nicholas R.A. Fruscione F. Sturla L. Benvenuto F. Usai C. Meis S. Kassack M.U. Zocchi E. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31419-31429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The intensity of emitted light was plotted as a function of time. Wild type and CMT1A SC were cultured in 60 × 10-mm dishes; the medium was removed, and adherent cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of HBSS. Cells were then scraped in 340 μl of water, and 10 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid were added to 300 μl of the cell extract, whereas the rest of the lysate was used for protein content determination (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Acid excess was removed with diethyl ether, and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of cell nucleotides was performed as described (12Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were washed and incubated in HBSS containing 10 mm HEPES in the presence of 10 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester at 37 °C for 1 h. Cell fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica TCS SL confocal microscope, equipped with a HCX PL APO CS 63.0 × 1.40 oil objective, at 30-s intervals. The difference between the level of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester fluorescence before and after addition of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (2 μm) was calculated for each cell and was considered as a measure of the ΔΨm (13Bruzzone S.

Wild type and CMT1A SC were cultured in 60 × 10-mm dishes; the medium was removed, and cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of HBSS. Cells were then scraped in 300 μl of water; 20 μl of perchloric acid (9 m) was added to 250 μl of the cell extract, and the rest of the cell lysate was used for protein content determination (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Intracellular IP3 levels were measured on the neutralized cell extracts with a specific radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences), as described (10Moreschi I. Bruzzone S. Nicholas R.A. Fruscione F.

The cADPR content was measured on the neutralized cell extracts by a highly sensitive enzymatic cycling assay (10Moreschi I. Bruzzone S. Nicholas R.A. Fruscione F. Sturla L. Benvenuto F. Usai C.

Cells were incubated in HBSS at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm NAD+. Aliquots (300 μl) were withdrawn at various times, and 20 μl of 9 m perchloric acid were added to each aliquot; the cADPR concentrations were measured by the enzymatic cycling assay (14Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Bruzzone S. De Flora A. Usai C. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from SC using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions and performing the on-column DNase treatment to remove trace amounts of genomic DNA; total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was used as template for real time PCR analysis; reactions were performed in an iCycler iQ5 real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The rat specific primers were designed by using Beacon Designer 2.0 software (Bio-Rad), and their sequences were as follows: P2X7 forward 5′-CTGGAATTGCAGGTGGATATGAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGATGTGGTTGTGAAGGTGTAGG-3′; PMP22 forward 5′-AATAATCCGCTGCCCGAATCAATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCCGCCTTCAGGGTCAAGTG-3′; Krox-20 forward 5′-CTCACGCCACTCTCCACCATC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTCACCGCCTCCACTTGC-3′; MPZ forward 5′-CTGTTGCTGCTGTTGCTCTTCTAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TTGGTGCTTCGGCTGTGGTC-3′; MBP forward 5′-GCACAGAGACACGGGCATCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGGCATGAGAAGGCAGAGG-3′; L1 forward 5′-TCTTGCTCCTCATCCTGCTCATC-3′ and reverse 5′-CACTGTACTCGCCGAAGGTCTC-3′; neural cellular adhesion molecules forward 5′-ACCATACTCCAGCACAGCACAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCGACTTCCACTCAGCCTTG-3′; GFAP forward 5′-GAAGGTTGAGTCGCTGGAGGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCTGTGAGGTCTGGCTTGG-3′; and p75 forward 5′-CCAGCAGACCCATACGCAGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCAGATGTCGCCAGGTATCC-3′. Each sample was assayed in triplicate in a 25-μl amplification reaction, containing 30 ng of cDNA, primers mixture (0.4 μm each of sense and antisense primers), and 12.5 μl of 2× iQ SYBR Green Supermix Sample (Bio-Rad). The amplification program included 40 cycles of two steps, each including heating to 95 and 60 °C, respectively. Fluorescent products were detected at the last step of each cycle. To verify the purity of the products, a melting curve was produced after each run. Values were normalized to GAPDH, and β-actin mRNA expression was measured using the following primers: GAPDH forward 5′-ATGATTCTACCCACGGCAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGGAAGATGGTGATGGGTT-3′; and β-actin forward 5′-GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGGCAGTGGCCATCTC-3′. Statistical analysis of the quantitative real time PCR was obtained using the iQ5 Optical System Software version 1.0 (Bio-Rad) based on the 2−ΔΔCt method, which calculated relative changes in gene expression of the target normalized to GAPDH and β-actin. The quantitative PCR efficiencies were determined by series of 5-fold dilutions for each experiment and each gene and were always between 95 and 102%. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Transfection of SC was performed using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Preliminary experiments were carried out with pmaxGFP to select the cell concentration and the program yielding the highest percentage of cell transfection, which was monitored by measuring green fluorescent protein-positive cells. Moreover, viability of SC after transfection was estimated measuring propidium iodide-positive cells by flow cytometry. Thus, the following protocol (giving a transfection efficiency of up to 60% and a cell viability of ∼80–90%) was chosen as optimal. SC were transfected with 2 μg of pmaxGFP, with 2 μm P2X7 or PMP22 targeting duplex small interference RNA (siRNA1 and siRNA2) and with 2 μm negative control (scramble) using the rat neuron Nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Nucleofector program A-033). The P2X7 targeting and negative control siRNA were StealthTM siRNA obtained from Invitrogen (siRNA1, P2X7-RSS310827, 5′-GAUACUUGAAGCCACUGUACUGCCC-3′; siRNA2, P2X7-RSS310829, 5′-AGACAGUUCCAAGAAGUCCGUCUGG-3′); the PMP22-targeting siRNA were ON-TARGETplusTM siRNA obtained from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). Immediately after transfection, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 24 h. Untransfected (UT) SC were treated identically using an equal volume of nucleofection buffer in place of siRNA oligos. After 24 h, green fluorescent protein-positive cells were evaluated by using a FACS-Canto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data, expressed as percentage of propidium iodide-negative (live) cells, were analyzed by using DIVA software. Twenty four and 48 h, 1 week, and 10 days after transfection, RNA was extracted, and real time PCR analyses were performed as described previously; migration and CNTF release were tested on transfected and untransfected cells (see below). The plasmid pcDNA3 containing the full-length rat P2X7 cDNA was kindly provided by Prof. F. Di Virgilio (Dept. of Experimental and Diagnostic Medicine, University of Ferrara, Italy). Wild type SC were transfected using the Nucleofector system, as described above, in the presence of 3 μg of plasmid encoding for the rat P2X7 or in the presence of the empty plasmid (NC). The [Ca2+]i and migration were evaluated 24 h after transfection. Stable transfection with shRNA was performed using the SureSilencingTM shRNA plasmid kit for rat P2X7 (KR44893N SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). The most efficient target sequence for RNA interference was selected among four sequences. The final selected target sequence for rat P2X7 corresponded to coding region 826–846 (5′-CCAGGAAATCGGAGAGAACTT-3′). The shRNA plasmid targeting P2X7 (shRNA-P2X7) or the negative control shRNA plasmid was transfected, as described above, into SC cells from newborn rats. After 48 h, the transfected cells were subcultured at an appropriate density in fresh DMEM/F-12 containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). G418-resistant cell populations were established within 10 days. RNA was extracted, and real time PCR analyses were performed as described above; myelination was tested on transfected cells co-cultured with normal sensory neurons (see below). To test the ability of CMT1A SC to migrate after the P2X7 receptor siRNA-specific suppression or inhibition by the use of P2X7 receptor inhibitor KN-62, we followed a published protocol (8Nobbio L. Vigo T. Abbruzzese M. Levi G. Brancolini C. Mantero S. Grandis M. Benedetti L. Mancardi G. Schenone A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 16: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Meintanis S. Thomaidou D. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Matsas R. Glia. 2001; 34: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In P2X7 down-regulation experiments by specific siRNA, SC were electroporated in the absence of siRNA oligos UT or transfected with P2X7-targeting StealthTM siRNA (Invitrogen). In P2X7 overexpression experiments, SC were electroporated in the presence of the empty plasmid (NC) or of the pcDNA3 containing the full-length rat P2X7 cDNA. After transfection, cells were immediately plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-mm coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells/coverslip in a 40-μl drop. After 4 h, 200 μl of basal medium (DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum) were added, and cells were cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with basal medium supplemented with 8 μm forskolin (FSK), which mimics the presence of the axon in primary cultures of SC (17Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In KN-62 inhibition experiments, SC were plated as described above; after 24 h, the medium was supplemented with 8 μm FSK in the presence of 100 nm KN-62. Twenty four h later, a cell-free area was generated by gently scratching the cell monolayer with a sterile yellow Gilson pipette tip, thus resulting in the formation of an ∼1-mm-wide gap. Immediately after scratching (time zero, T0), the medium was replaced, and the first microscopic image of the cells was acquired. Twelve hours later (T1), the same SC cultures were photographed again, and images were saved. The extent of cell migration was assessed by subtracting the average gap width at T1 from the average gap width at T0. SC migration was monitored for a maximum of 12 h to avoid interference in the evaluation because of SC proliferation (16Meintanis S. Thomaidou D. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Matsas R. Glia. 2001; 34: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Assessment of migration distance was performed on 10 SC cultures for each condition, using the Image Pro-Plus Software (Immagini e Computer, Rho, Milan, Italy). CMT1A and wild type SC were electroporated without siRNA UT or transfected with P2X7-targeting StealthTM siRNA (Invitrogen), and 1 × 106 SC were immediately plated on 60-mm poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. Moreover, 1 × 106 SC/dish were also plated to be treated with 100 nm KN-62. In both experimental settings, SC cultures were supplemented with 8 μm FSK, and 48 h later, the culture medium was collected, and the cells were mechanically disrupted in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma). The cell protein concentration was measured (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), and CNTF content in the culture medium was determined using a Rat CNTF DuoSet kit (R & D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary SC from newborn rats (wild type and CMT1A) transfected with the shRNA-P2X7 plasmid or with the negative control shRNA plasmid were seeded (3 × 105 cells/dish) onto DRG neurons in neurobasal medium, supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 5 ng/ml NGF, and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. The myelination medium was changed three times every week, and the cultures were allowed to myelinate for up to 4 weeks and used for light microscopy morphological and morphometric analyses and molecular studies. For immunocytochemistry, rat DRG-SC co-cultures on ACLAR dishes were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min in cold methanol at −20 °C, and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in PBS). Incubation with the primary antibodies was performed for 18 h at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against MBP (1:100) and a polyclonal antibody against neurofilaments (1:100) in blocking buffer. After washing, cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-mouse ALEXA594-IgG and goat anti-rabbit ALEXA488-IgG antibodies at a 1:250 dilution for 1 h at 25 °C. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and ACLAR dishes were sealed on slides. Images were taken with an Olympus PROVIS AX60 microscope, connected to an Olympus DP70 digital camera. For morphometric analysis, DRG-SC co-cultures were washed in PBS, fixed overnight in Trump's fixative at 4 °C, post-fixed the following day in 2% osmium tetroxide, and stained with 1% Sudan black in 70% ethanol. Each culture was analyzed for the presence of myelin and for the morphology of the observed fibers. The morphometric study was performed directly on the cultures after fixation, staining, and mounting on slides. It is essential to use a systematic sampling technique because of the following: (i) the culture dish does not provide a completely uniform physical environment; (ii) myelinated fibers are not randomly distributed throughout the dish; and (iii) the differences between control and dys/demyelinating cultures are sometimes so obvious as to compromise a blinded study. A 1-cm diameter circle was superimposed on the culture, with the center of the circle overlying the center of the culture. From each culture 250–300 images were acquired and stored using the ×40 objective.

https://openalex.org/W2121808275,"Selective attention and memory seem to be related in human experience. This appears to be the case as well in simple model organisms such as the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations affecting olfactory and visual memory formation in Drosophila, such as in dunce and rutabaga, also affect short-term visual processes relevant to selective attention. In particular, increased optomotor responsiveness appears to be predictive of visual attention defects in these mutants.To further explore the possible overlap between memory and visual attention systems in the fly brain, we screened a panel of 36 olfactory long term memory (LTM) mutants for visual attention-like defects using an optomotor maze paradigm. Three of these mutants yielded high dunce-like optomotor responsiveness. We characterized these three strains by examining their visual distraction in the maze, their visual learning capabilities, and their brain activity responses to visual novelty. We found that one of these mutants, D0067, was almost completely identical to dunce(1) for all measures, while another, D0264, was more like wild type. Exploiting the fact that the LTM mutants are also Gal4 enhancer traps, we explored the sufficiency for the cells subserved by these elements to rescue dunce attention defects and found overlap at the level of the mushroom bodies. Finally, we demonstrate that control of synaptic function in these Gal4 expressing cells specifically modulates a 20-30 Hz local field potential associated with attention-like effects in the fly brain.Our study uncovers genetic and neuroanatomical systems in the fly brain affecting both visual attention and odor memory phenotypes. A common component to these systems appears to be the mushroom bodies, brain structures which have been traditionally associated with odor learning but which we propose might be also involved in generating oscillatory brain activity required for attention-like processes in the fly brain."
https://openalex.org/W1984099860,"Plastid genome content and arrangement are highly conserved across most land plants and their closest relatives, streptophyte algae, with nearly all plastid introns having invaded the genome in their common ancestor at least 450 million years ago. One such intron, within the transfer RNA trnK-UUU, contains a large open reading frame that encodes a presumed intron maturase, matK. This gene is missing from the plastid genomes of two species in the parasitic plant genus Cuscuta but is found in all other published land plant and streptophyte algal plastid genomes, including that of the nonphotosynthetic angiosperm Epifagus virginiana and two other species of Cuscuta. By examining matK and plastid intron distribution in Cuscuta, we add support to the hypothesis that its normal role is in splicing seven of the eight group IIA introns in the genome. We also analyze matK nucleotide sequences from Cuscuta species and relatives that retain matK to test whether changes in selective pressure in the maturase are associated with intron deletion. Stepwise loss of most group IIA introns from the plastid genome results in substantial change in selective pressure within the hypothetical RNA-binding domain of matK in both Cuscuta and Epifagus, either through evolution from a generalist to a specialist intron splicer or due to loss of a particular intron responsible for most of the constraint on the binding region. The possibility of intron-specific specialization in the X-domain is implicated by evidence of positive selection on the lineage leading to C. nitida in association with the loss of six of seven introns putatively spliced by matK. Moreover, transfer RNA gene deletion facilitated by parasitism combined with an unusually high rate of intron loss from remaining functional plastid genes created a unique circumstance on the lineage leading to Cuscuta subgenus Grammica that allowed elimination of matK in the most species-rich lineage of Cuscuta."
https://openalex.org/W2037249963,"p120 catenin is a major regulator of cadherin stability at cell-cell contacts and a modulator of Rho GTPase activities. In C2C12 myoblasts, N-cadherin is stabilized at cell contacts through its association with cholesterol-rich membrane domains or lipid rafts (LR) and acts as an adhesion-activated receptor that activates RhoA, an event required for myogenesis induction. Here, we report that association of p120 catenin with N-cadherin at cell contacts occurs specifically in LR. We demonstrate that interaction of p120 catenin with N-cadherin is required for N-cadherin association with LR and for its stabilization at cell contacts. LR disruption inhibits myogenesis induction and N-cadherin-dependent RhoA activation as does the perturbation of the N-cadherin-p120 catenin complex after p120 catenin knockdown. Finally, we observe an N-cadherin-dependent accumulation of RhoA at phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-enriched cell contacts which is lost after LR disruption. Thus, a functional N-cadherin-catenin complex occurs in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains which allows the recruitment of RhoA and the regulation of its activity during myogenesis induction. p120 catenin is a major regulator of cadherin stability at cell-cell contacts and a modulator of Rho GTPase activities.

Skeletal myogenesis is a multistep process regulated by diffusible molecules and the interaction of muscle cell precursors with their neighbors and the extracellular matrix (1Buckingham M. Curr.

Particularly, N-cadherin-dependent intercellular adhesion has a major role in cell cycle exit and induction of skeletal muscle differentiation through activation of the Rho family GTPases. RhoA positively regulates MyoD expression and skeletal muscle differentiation because it is required for serum response factor-mediated activation of several muscle-specific gene promoters (3Carnac G.

Their extracellular domain mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion, whereas the intracellular domain associates with catenins that produce attachment sites for the F-actin cytoskeleton (5Yap A.S.

The juxtamembrane domain of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail binds to p120 catenin, which regulates cadherin stability at cell contacts and modulates Rho GTPase activities (8Wildenberg G.A. Dohn M.R.

Cadherin stability is directly dependent on p120 catenin, and in its absence most cadherins are internalized and often degraded, suggesting that p120 catenin controls cadherin turnover at the cell surface (11Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 12Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the E-cadherin region that bind to p120 catenin dissociate the E-cadherin-p120 catenin complex and disrupt strong cell adhesion, although interaction with other catenins remains intact (13Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z.

Cadherin stability at cell-cell contacts is also regulated by homophilic binding between extracellular domains and association with the F-actin cytoskeleton (14Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Lambert M. Choquet D. Mège R.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Association of N-cadherin with cholesterol-enriched microdomains, called lipid rafts (LR), at cell contacts, also stabilizes N-cadherin (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because p120 catenin interaction with cadherins and N-cadherin association with LR at cell contact sites are both involved in cadherin stability at cell contact sites, we asked whether p120 catenin association with N-cadherin required LR. We observed that their association occurred specifically in these cholesterol-rich domains. Moreover, using an N-cadherin mutant unable to bind to p120 catenin, we showed that the N-cadherin/p120 catenin interaction was required for N-cadherin association with LR and its stabilization at cell contacts. Because N-cadherin is implicated in the commitment to myogenesis through RhoA activation, we questioned whether its association with p120 catenin in LR was a prerequisite for RhoA activation. LR disruption inhibited myogenesis induction, association of p120 catenin with N-cadherin, and N-cadherin-dependent RhoA activation, as did the perturbation of the N-cadherin-p120 catenin complex after p120 catenin knockdown. Together, these data suggest a crucial role for the N-cadherin/p120 catenin association in LR in the regulation of RhoA activity during myogenesis induction. plasma membrane amphotericin B cholesterol oxidase differentiation medium fluorescence recovery after photobleaching green fluorescent protein monosialotetrahexosylganglioside lipid raft(s) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid nonlipid raft pleckstrin homology phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid phospholipase C red fluorescent protein short hairpin RNA wild type yellow fluorescent protein. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum; mouse L cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. p120 catenin knockdown C2C12 cell lines were obtained after infection with pRS human p120 catenin small interfering RNA or mouse p120 catenin small interfering RNA retroviruses (11Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Different clones were isolated by limited dilution and grown in 3–5 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were treated with amphotericin B (ampho B) (25 μg/ml for 4 h; Sigma), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (4 mm for 6 h; Sigma), or cholesterol oxidase (CO) (1 unit/ml for 2 h; Calbiochem) in culture medium containing 10 or 2% delipidized serum (Sigma-Aldrich). C2C12 myoblasts and L cells were transfected with N-cadherin-GFP, N-cadherin-RFP, N-cadherinAAA-YFP, PH-PLCδ-GFP, and RhoAWT-RFP by jetPEI (Qbiogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ganglioside GM1 patching was performed as described (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) followed by a 2-min permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were p120 catenin (1:100; BD Transduction Laboratories), N-cadherin (1:200; BD Transduction Laboratories), myogenin (1:30; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and troponin T (1:100; Sigma). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 350-, Alexa Fluor 546-, or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were stained for F-actin with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate or coumarin isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich), and nuclei were stained with Hoechst (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Images were captured with a MicroMax 1300 CCD camera (RS-Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) driven by MetaMorph software (version 7, Universal Imaging Corp., Westchester, PA). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Cell lysates or PM-enriched fractions of C2C12 or L cells transfected or not with N-cadherin-GFP or N-cadherinAAA-YFP were fractionated through a 4-ml sucrose gradient as described (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fractions enriched in PM were prepared as described (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions 3–5 (LR fractions) and 8–10 (nonlipid raft (NLR) fractions) or fractions enriched in PM were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of N-cadherin, α-, β-, γ-, and p120 catenins, caveolin (antibodies from BD Transduction Laboratories), actin (Sigma-Aldrich), or transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Alternatively, LR and NLR fractions were also used for immunoprecipitation with anti-N-cadherin antibodies. In this case, fractions 3–5 were pooled and diluted 5-fold in 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 18 h. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mm PIPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 60 mm N-octylglucoside. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). C2C12 myoblasts expressing N-cadherinAAA-YFP were lysed, and extracts were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody (1:100; Roche Applied Science) and processed as described (17Mary S. Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Travo P. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Parental or p120 catenin shRNA C2C12 myoblasts were lysed and processed to measure the total and GTP-bound RhoA levels as described previously (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Alternatively, C2C12 myoblasts plated on N-cadherin-Fc chimera-coated dishes obtained as described (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) were used. Lateral diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions of N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP expressed in mouse L cells were measured by FRAP using a Zeiss LSM Meta 510 confocal microscope as described (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanisms of catenin association with N-cadherin, we questioned whether the localization in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains influenced cadherin-catenin complex formation. Therefore, we co-immunoprecipitated similar amounts of proteins from either pooled fractions 3–5 (corresponding to LR fractions) or pooled fractions 8–10 (corresponding to NLR fractions) obtained from Triton X-100 lysates loaded onto sucrose density gradients (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although α-, β-, and γ-catenins associated with N-cadherin in both LR and NLR fractions, p120 catenin interacted with N-cadherin only in LR fractions (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the interaction of p120 catenin with N-cadherin was impossible in NLR fractions, we repeated the experiment but using a 10-fold higher amount of proteins from NLR fractions. Again, p120 catenin did not interact with N-cadherin, whereas α-, β-, and γ-catenins strongly associated with N-cadherin under these conditions (Fig. 1B, panel a). We confirmed that N-cadherin, β-catenin, and p120 catenin were present in both LR and NLR fractions (Fig. 1B, panel b). To confirm further the co-distribution of N-cadherin and p120 catenin in LR, we used a technique based on lateral cross-linking of the raft-associated ganglioside GM1 (19Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Patching of GM1 with the cholera toxin B subunit and antibodies against cholera toxin B resulted in co-patching of both N-cadherin and p120 catenin (Fig. 1C). Moreover, LR disruption by cholesterol chelation through the addition of ampho B impaired p120 catenin association with N-cadherin monitored by immunoprecipitation without modifying their concentration (Fig. 1D, panels a and b). This result contrasts with previous data showing that CO treatment did not affect p120 catenin association with N-cadherin, although it perturbed N-cadherin accumulation and stabilization at cell-cell contacts (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, we carefully reinvestigated the effect of three drugs (i.e. ampho B, CO, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin) that affect cholesterol and confirmed that LR disruption by these compounds efficiently perturbed p120 catenin association with N-cadherin (data not shown). Nevertheless, data from cholesterol depletion experiments must be interpreted with caution because interactions between LR and F-actin cytoskeleton exist, and association of N-cadherin with LR requires F-actin cytoskeleton (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data suggest that p120 catenin associates with N-cadherin specifically in LR and that LR are essential for p120 catenin/N-cadherin association. To analyze whether p120 catenin binding to N-cadherin was involved in the recruitment of N-cadherin in LR, we used an N-cadherin mutant with a triple alanine mutation in the juxtamembrane domain (N-cadherinAAA) that abolishes binding to p120 catenin (20Chen X. Kojima S. Borisy G.G. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although N-cadherinAAA did not bind to p120 catenin, it surprisingly co-localized with p120 catenin in C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown). This unexpected observation was actually explained by the formation of heterodimers between N-cadherinAAA and endogenous wild-type (WT) N-cadherin that we detected in immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Thus, to examine the p120 catenin contribution to the recruitment of N-cadherin into LRs, we decided to pursue our experiments using the N-cadherinAAA mutant in mouse L cells that do not express endogenous cadherins. Indeed, in these cells, the problem of heterodimerization between WT N-cadherin and N-cadherinAAA was excluded. In L cells, N-cadherin-GFP accumulated at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2A, panel a) as it does in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2C, panel b). Conversely, N-cadherinAAA-YFP was rarely at cell contacts in L cells (Fig. 2A, panel c). This difference in N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP localization in L cells was not because of a variation in p120 catenin expression level (Fig. 2A, right panel). We analyzed the recruitment of N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP in LR by isolating LR from enriched PM preparations on sucrose gradient. We observed a similar amount of N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP at the PM by Western blotting (Fig. 2B, panel a) and by monitoring the level of PM-associated N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP by cell surface biotinylation (data not shown). Conversely, in pooled fractions 3–5 (corresponding to LR fractions) we detected N-cadherin-GFP but not N-cadherinAAA-YFP (Fig. 2B, panel b). Finally, we analyzed the distribution of N-cadherin-GFP and the LR marker ganglioside GM1 in parental and p120 catenin shRNA C2C12 myoblasts (see Fig. 6, A and B, for a description of these cells). In parental cells, both N-cadherin and p120 catenin co-localized at cell-cell contacts with GM1, in agreement with their common distribution and association in biochemically isolated LR (6Drees F. Pokutta S. Yamada S. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 2005; 123: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1) (Fig. 2C). In p120 catenin shRNA myoblasts, N-cadherin neither accumulated nor co-localized with GM1 at cell-cell contacts. These data indicate that recruitment of N-cadherin in LR requires interaction with p120 catenin.FIGURE 6Effect of p120 catenin silencing on myogenic differentiation and RhoA activation.

The histogram represents the percentage of myogenin-positive cells and summarizes the data from three independent sets of experiments; 60–70 cells were analyzed in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We showed previously that N-cadherin association with LR allows its stabilization at cell-cell contacts, enabling the formation of a functional adhesive complex (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of p120 catenin binding in N-cadherin stabilization at the cell contacts, we compared the assembly dynamics of N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP using fluorescent recovery after FRAP experiments. We measured the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions of N-cadherin-GFP and N-cadherinAAA-YFP at cell-cell contacts of living L cells. We found a 2-fold increase in the lateral diffusion of N-cadherinAAA-YFP compared with N-cadherin-GFP (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, the N-cadherinAAA-YFP mobile fraction was bigger than that of N-cadherin-GFP, indicating that N-cadherinAAA-YFP was free to diffuse in the PM for the entire duration of the experiment. Typical images of FRAP experiments from N-cadherin-GFP- and N-cadherinAAA-YFP-expressing cells are shown in Fig. 3C. Altogether, these data suggest that association of p120 catenin with N-cadherin participates in the recruitment of this cadherin to LR and in its immobilization during contact establishment. We showed previously that LR disruption leads to inhibition of cell-cell adhesion and disorganization of N-cadherin- dependent cell-cell contacts (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We now analyzed the effect of LR disruption on myogenesis. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with ampho B impaired N-cadherin association with LR (Fig. 4A) as observed after the addition of CO or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We next examined whether LR disruption could affect the expression of muscle-specific proteins by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Although parental C2C12 myoblasts expressed myogenin and troponin T after the addition of differentiation medium (DM), C2C12 myoblasts treated with ampho B (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively) or with CO or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (data not shown) did not. We were also unable to detect myotube formation (data not shown). The addition of culture medium with cholesterol restored myogenesis (Fig. 4D). Treatment with ampho B (Fig. 4E) or CO (data not shown) also led to a marked decrease in RhoA activity, known to be essential for myogenesis (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Lovett F.A. Gonzalez I. Salih D.A. Cobb L.J. Tripathi G. Cosgrove R.A. Murrell A. Kilshaw P.J. Pell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4828-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether LR disruption specifically impaired the increase in RhoA activity mediated by N-cadherin adhesion. We measured RhoA activity by pulldown assays in C2C12 myoblasts plated onto dishes coated with either anti-Fc antibody or N-cadherin-Fc ligand, which allowed us to mimic N-cadherin-mediated adhesion (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). LR disruption by incubation with ampho B again decreased RhoA activity (Fig. 4F), which was restored by the addition of culture medium with cholesterol (data not shown). These experiments clearly show that LR are involved in the activation of RhoA downstream of N-cadherin. We next wanted to analyze at the cell-cell contacts the content in lipid second messengers known to play a major role in protein recruitment and activation. Thus, we investigated whether PI(4,5)P2, a phosphoinositide known to be accumulated in LR (22Bodin S. Giuriato S. Ragab J. Humbel B.M. Viala C. Vieu C. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15290-15299Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), was present at the N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with a construct expressing the PH domain of PLCδ fused to GFP (PH-PLCδ-GFP) that specifically binds to PI(4,5)P2 (24Holz R.W. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Stuenkel E.L. Bittner M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17878-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). At cell contacts in C2C12 myoblasts, PI(4,5)P2 accumulated and co-localized with N-cadherin (Fig. 5A, panels a and b). This co-localization was lost after Ca2+ chelation with EGTA (panels c and d) and after LR disruption (data not shown). In L cells, PI(4,5)P2 accumulated at cell contacts only when N-cadherin was expressed (Fig. 5C, compare panel a with d). In the absence of N-cadherin expression, PI(4,5)P2 was found in F-actin-rich polymerization areas (panels a and b). LR disruption impaired the recruitment of PI(4,5)P2 at N-cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts (panels f–h). We also investigated whether PI(4,5)P2 localization at cell-cell contacts correlated with RhoA accumulation in the same place. For this purpose, C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with PH-PLCδ-GFP and RhoAWT-RFP. In isolated C2C12 myoblasts, we observed no co-localization between RhoA and PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5B, panels a–d), whereas in contacting cells in which N-cadherin was engaged in cell-cell contacts, RhoA and PI(4,5)P2 were co-localized (panels e–h). Treatment with ampho B impaired co-localization of RhoA and PI(4,5)P2 in contacting C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown). In L cells, RhoA was not accumulated at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 5D, panel a), whereas it did so after N-cadherin expression (panels b–d). Again, LR disruption impaired the recruitment of RhoA at N-cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts (panels e–g). Conversely, N-cadherinAAA did not recruit RhoA at cell contacts (Fig. 5E). Altogether, these data show that N-cadherin engagement and its subsequent recruitment in LR allow PI(4,5)P2 localization at cell-cell contacts, enabling RhoA accumulation at this place. To investigate further the role of N-cadherin-p120 catenin complexes in RhoA activation and myogenesis induction, we generated stable C2C12 cell lines in which the expression of p120 catenin was inactivated by RNA interference (p120 catenin shRNA) (Fig. 6, A and B). Parental and C2C12 myoblasts expressing human p120 catenin shRNA (hp120 catenin shRNA) were used as controls (data not shown). As reported previously (11Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 25Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), we observed that p120 catenin silencing led to a decrease in N-cadherin expression (Fig. 6, A and B). We next examined whether p120 catenin silencing affected the expression of myogenin and troponin T (Fig. 6C). After 4 days in DM, parental C2C12 myoblasts expressed myogenin and troponin T, whereas p120 catenin shRNA myoblasts did not. In addition, we observed many myotubes in parental (Fig. 6D, panel a) and control hp120 catenin shRNA cells (data not shown) but only few in the p120 catenin shRNA myoblasts (Fig. 6D, panel b). Because N-cadherin-mediated adhesion activates RhoA, which allows myogenesis induction (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Lovett F.A. Gonzalez I. Salih D.A. Cobb L.J. Tripathi G. Cosgrove R.A. Murrell A. Kilshaw P.J. Pell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4828-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of p120 catenin silencing on RhoA activity in parental or p120 catenin shRNA C2C12 myoblasts. We first used the organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton as a functional read-out. No modification was observed in either parental or p120 catenin shRNA C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 6E). We then analyzed RhoA activity using pulldown assays. We observed an increase in the RhoA GTP level after DM addition in parental but not in p120 catenin shRNA C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 6F). To confirm the involvement of RhoA in myogenesis inhibition after p120 catenin knockdown, we transfected p120 catenin shRNA C2C12 myoblasts with an RFP-tagged construct expressing RhoA WT. Cells were cultured in DM, fixed, and analyzed for expression of myogenin (Fig. 6G). RhoA expression partially rescued the inhibition of myogenesis induction caused by p120 catenin silencing. This shows that perturbation of the N-cadherin-p120 catenin complex inhibits RhoA activation and subsequently myogenesis induction. Skeletal myogenesis is a multistep process regulated by various molecules (1Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Knudsen K.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). N-cadherin-dependent adhesion controls induction of myogenesis through activation of RhoA which positively regulates MyoD expression and activation of several muscle-specific gene promoters (3Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R.

Dynamic association of cadherin complexes at the PM is crucial for cadherin-mediated signaling. The juxtamembrane domain of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail binds p120 catenin, which is a major regulator of cadherin stability at cell-cell contacts and a modulator of Rho GTPase activities (8Wildenberg G.A. Dohn M.R. Carnahan R.H. Davis M.A. Lobdell N.A. Settleman J. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 2006; 127: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 9Reynolds A.B. Biochim.

Mutations in the region of E-cadherin that binds to p120 uncoupled the E-cadherin-p120 catenin complex and disrupted strong adhesion, although the interaction with other catenins remains intact (13Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Moreover, association of N-cadherin with cholesterol-enriched microdomains called LR at the cell-cell contacts also stabilizes N-cadherin (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because p120 catenin association with cadherins and N-cadherin association with LR at the cell-cell contact sites are both involved in cadherin stability, we have analyzed whether p120 catenin association with N-cadherin requires LR. We observed that the association of p120 catenin with N-cadherin occurs specifically in these microdomains and reciprocally that LR are essential for p120 catenin/N-cadherin association. It has been suggested that p120 catenin is a relatively minor component of the cadherin complex because only a fraction of p120 catenin co-precipitates with cadherins in the presence of detergents (26Staddon J.M. Smales C. Schulze C. Esch F.S. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This fraction of p120 catenin might be the one associated with N-cadherin in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. Although it is known that binding to p120 catenin promotes cadherin stabilization at cell-cell contacts, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown (9Reynolds A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 13Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28Anastasiadis P.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that p120 catenin associates with N-cadherin specifically and exclusively in LR and that, when this interaction is abolished, N-cadherin is not accumulated in LR and not stabilized at cell-cell contacts. This finding raises questions about how p120 catenin is recruited in LR and which mechanisms are involved in cadherin stabilization. Besides the function of the Arm domain of p120 catenin which binds to the N-cadherin juxtamembrane domain, p120 catenin could also sense the lipid environment or interact with a protein located in these microdomains. Recently, the p120 catenin C-terminal region was proposed to be involved in the recruitment of cytoplasmic E-cadherin to the plasma membrane (29Liu H. Komiya S. Shimizu M. Fukunaga Y. Nagafuchi A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2007; 32: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). p120 catenin has been also involved in membrane stabilization of Desmoglein 3 through its binding to a juxtamembrane domain of this cadherin. This observation reinforces the potential contribution of the lipid environment in p120 catenin binding to this cadherin (30Kanno M. Isa Y. Aoyama Y. Yamamoto Y. Nagai M. Ozawa M. Kitajima Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the p120 catenin C-terminal region revealed the presence of potential cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus motifs 5N. Taulet, F. Comunale, C. Fayard, S. Charrasse, S. Bodin, and C. Gauthier-Rouvière, unpublished observations. that favor the interaction with cholesterol (31Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In summary, binding to p120 catenin might stabilize N-cadherin through interaction with cholesterol-rich microdomains. This might contribute to N-cadherin clustering, which enhances its adhesive strength. Moreover, binding to p120 catenin also has an indirect stabilizing function because it masks a conserved dileucine motif in N-cadherin juxtamembrane domain that is necessary for endocytosis (32Miyashita Y. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11540-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Indeed, unstabilized cadherin caused by deficient binding to p120 catenin is endocytosed (11Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show that the association of p120 catenin with N-cadherin in LR is involved in N-cadherin-mediated RhoA activation. This suggests that at cell contacts, the N-cadherin/p120 catenin association with LR allows the stabilization and formation of a functional adhesive complex able to organize signal transduction pathways in this specific area of the membrane (16Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier- Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because RhoA is recruited at cell contacts after N-cadherin engagement (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and its activity is required for N-cadherin stabilization at cell contacts in C2C12 myoblasts (33Comunale F. Causeret M. Favard C. Cau J. Taulet N. Charrasse S. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Biol. Cell. 2007; 99: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we conclude that p120 catenin is required for N-cadherin-dependent RhoA activation which in turn allows N-cadherin stabilization at cell contacts. Interestingly mammalian RhoA and its Drosophila homolog, Rho1, interact directly with p120 catenin (34Magie C.R. Pinto-Santini D. Parkhurst S.M. Development. 2002; 129: 3771-3782PubMed Google Scholar, 35Castaño J. Solanas G. Casagolda D. Raurell I. Villagrasa P. Bustelo X.R. García de Herreros A. Duñach M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1745-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and we have also detected a fraction of RhoA in LR (data not shown). Moreover, at cell contacts in C2C12 myoblasts, N-cadherin, RhoA, and PI(4,5)P2, a phosphoinositide known to be accumulated in LR (22Bodin S. Giuriato S. Ragab J. Humbel B.M. Viala C. Vieu C. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15290-15299Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and to play a critical role in the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton (36Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 37Janmey P.A. Lindberg U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), were co-localized (Fig. 5, A and B). This co-localization was lost after LR disruption. In L cells, PI(4,5)P2 and RhoA accumulated at cell contacts only when N-cadherin was expressed. Again, LR disruption impaired the recruitment of PI(4,5)P2 and RhoA at N-cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts. Conversely, N-cadherinAAA did not recruit RhoA at N-cadherin-mediated cell contacts. Recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase γ at sites of N-cadherin ligation resulting in PI(4,5)P2 production have been reported (38El Sayegh T.Y. Arora P.D. Ling K. Laschinger C. Janmey P.A. Anderson R.A. McCulloch C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3026-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Segregation of PI(4,5)P2 might allow the recruitment of PH domain-containing proteins, such as a guanine exchange factor for RhoA that still remains to be identified. Altogether, these data suggest that p120 catenin might be involved in recruiting RhoA in LR at cell contacts to allow its activation by a guanine exchange factor and consequently its downstream function. Finally, our results show that LR are required for the formation of the N-cadherin complex, downstream RhoA activation, and subsequent myogenesis induction. Inhibition of myogenesis was already reported after perturbation of the N-cadherin-p120 catenin complex upon silencing of p120 catenin (39Gavard J. Marthiens V. Monnet C. Lambert M. Mège R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36795-36802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to data obtained in fibroblasts (8Wildenberg G.A. Dohn M.R. Carnahan R.H. Davis M.A. Lobdell N.A. Settleman J. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 2006; 127: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), p120 knock down in myoblasts does not increase RhoA activity as measured by Rhotekin pulldown assay and analysis of actin stress fibers, but the loss of p120 catenin impairs RhoA activation induced by specific N-cadherin engagement. This was confirmed by the rescue of myogenesis inhibition in p120 catenin shRNA myoblasts after RhoA expression. These data obtained in myoblasts agree with the role of RhoA during myogenesis induction (18Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Lovett F.A. Gonzalez I. Salih D.A. Cobb L.J. Tripathi G. Cosgrove R.A. Murrell A. Kilshaw P.J. Pell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4828-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, RhoA has been reported to regulate MyoD expression and skeletal muscle cell differentiation positively because it has been demonstrated to be required for serum response factor-mediated activation of several muscle-specific gene promoters (3Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R.

Roles for p120 catenin in controlling Rho GTPases activity emerged underlying the existence of cell type-specific mechanisms. Indeed, in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, p120 catenin can target suppression of Rho to cadherin complexes via transient recruitment of p190RhoGAP (8Wildenberg G.A. Dohn M.R. Carnahan R.H. Davis M.A. Lobdell N.A. Settleman J. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 2006; 127: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and in CHO cells, p120 appears to be essential for cadherin-mediated activation of Rac1 (40Goodwin M. Kovacs E.M. Thoreson M.A. Reynolds A.B. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20533-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). p120 catenin is known to regulate cell-cell adhesion through its interaction with the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain of cadherins. Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which p120 catenin acts as a direct stabilizator of N-cadherin at the cell contacts through its association with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains. How p120 catenin senses this peculiar lipid membrane environment remains to be determined. LR serve as plateforms for protein segregation and signaling and are often modified in cancer cells. Such modifications might thus participate in the pertubation of p120 catenin activity in tumor cells. We thank the imaging facility at CRBM and C. Benistant for discussions. We are grateful to Al Reynolds for shp120 catenin and to K. Green for N-cadherinAAA-YFP constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2100716544,"Acetylcholine (ACh) contributes to learning processes by modulating cortical plasticity in terms of intensity of neuronal activity and selectivity properties of cortical neurons. However, it is not known if ACh induces long term effects within the primary visual cortex (V1) that could sustain visual learning mechanisms. In the present study we analyzed visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in V1 of rats during a 4–8 h period after coupling visual stimulation to an intracortical injection of ACh analog carbachol or stimulation of basal forebrain. To clarify the action of ACh on VEP activity in V1, we individually pre-injected muscarinic (scopolamine), nicotinic (mecamylamine), α7 (methyllycaconitine), and NMDA (CPP) receptor antagonists before carbachol infusion. Stimulation of the cholinergic system paired with visual stimulation significantly increased VEP amplitude (56%) during a 6 h period. Pre-treatment with scopolamine, mecamylamine and CPP completely abolished this long-term enhancement, while α7 inhibition induced an instant increase of VEP amplitude. This suggests a role of ACh in facilitating visual stimuli responsiveness through mechanisms comparable to LTP which involve nicotinic and muscarinic receptors with an interaction of NMDA transmission in the visual cortex."

We have previously shown the importance of chromosomal aneusomy in lung cancer progression. Here, we tested whether genomic gains in six specific loci, TP63 on 3q28, EGFR on 7p12, MYC on 8q24, 5p15.2, and centromeric regions for chromosomes 3 (CEP3) and 6 (CEP6), may provide further value in the prediction of lung cancer. Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained by LIFE bronchoscopy from 70 subjects (27 with prevalent lung cancers and 43 individuals without lung cancer). Twenty six biopsies were read as moderate dysplasia, 21 as severe dysplasia and 23 as carcinoma in situ (CIS). Four-micron paraffin sections were submitted to a 4-target FISH assay (LAVysion, Abbott Molecular) and reprobed for TP63 and CEP 3 sequences. Spot counts were obtained in 30–50 nuclei per specimen for each probe. Increased gene copy number in 4 of the 6 probes was associated with increased risk of being diagnosed with lung cancer both in unadjusted analyses (odds ratio = 11, p<0.05) and adjusted for histology grade (odds ratio = 17, p<0.05). The most informative 4 probes were TP63, MYC, CEP3 and CEP6. The combination of these 4 probes offered a sensitivity of 82% for lung cancer and a specificity of 58%. These results indicate that specific cytogenetic alterations present in preinvasive lung lesions are closely associated with the diagnosis of lung cancer and may therefore have value in assessing lung cancer risk."

In the present study, effects of retinoids on osteoclast differentiation in cultured mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs), bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), spleen cells, and RAW264.7 cells were evaluated by analyzing osteoclast formation and expression of genes important in signal transduction and osteoclast function. All-irans-retinoic acid (ATRA) did not stimulate osteoclastogenesis in BMCs, but inhibited hormone and RANKL-induced gene expression and formation of osteoclasts. In BMMs, spleen cells, and RAW264.7 cells, osteoclast differentiation and formation stimulated by M-CSF/RANKL were inhibited (IC50 = 0.3 nM) by ATRA The effect was exerted at an early step of RANKL-induced differentiation. ATRA also abolished increases of the transcription factors c-Fos and NFAT2 stimulated by RANKL and suppressed down-regulation of the antiosteoclastogenic transcription factor MafB. By comparing effects of several compounds structurally related to ATRA, as well as by using receptor antagonists, evaluation pointed to inhibition being mediated by RARα, with no involvement of PPARβ/δ. The results suggest that activation of RARα by retinoids in myeloid hematopoietic precursor cells decreases osteoclast formation by altering expression of the transcription factors c-Fos, NFAT2, and MafB.—Conaway, H.

https://openalex.org/W1996236104,"Background African horse sickness virus (AHSV) causes a non-contagious, infectious disease in equids, with mortality rates that can exceed 90% in susceptible horse populations. AHSV vaccines play a crucial role in the control of the disease; however, there are concerns over the use of polyvalent live attenuated vaccines particularly in areas where AHSV is not endemic. Therefore, it is important to consider alternative approaches for AHSV vaccine development. We have carried out a pilot study to investigate the ability of recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccines expressing VP2, VP7 or NS3 genes of AHSV to stimulate immune responses against AHSV antigens in the horse. Methodology/Principal Findings VP2, VP7 and NS3 genes from AHSV-4/Madrid87 were cloned into the vaccinia transfer vector pSC11 and recombinant MVA viruses generated. Antigen expression or transcription of the AHSV genes from cells infected with the recombinant viruses was confirmed. Pairs of ponies were vaccinated with MVAVP2, MVAVP7 or MVANS3 and both MVA vector and AHSV antigen-specific antibody responses were analysed. Vaccination with MVAVP2 induced a strong AHSV neutralising antibody response (VN titre up to a value of 2). MVAVP7 also induced AHSV antigen–specific responses, detected by western blotting. NS3 specific antibody responses were not detected. Conclusions This pilot study demonstrates the immunogenicity of recombinant MVA vectored AHSV vaccines, in particular MVAVP2, and indicates that further work to investigate whether these vaccines would confer protection from lethal AHSV challenge in the horse is justifiable."

In this study, we determined the crystal structures of two different conformers of mouse L-PGDS, one with an open cavity of the beta-barrel and the other with a closed cavity due to the movement of the flexible E-F loop. The upper compartment of the central large cavity contains the catalytically essential Cys65 residue and its network of hydrogen bonds with the polar residues Ser45, Thr67, and Ser81, whereas the lower compartment is composed of hydrophobic amino acid residues that are highly conserved among other lipocalins. SH titration analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the Cys65 residue is activated by its interaction with Ser45 and Thr67 and that the S45A/T67A/S81A mutant showed less than 10% of the L-PGDS activity. The conformational change between the open and closed states of the cavity indicates that the mobile calyx contributes to the multiligand binding ability of L-PGDS."

To date, we have genotyped 340 SNPs from 94 candidate genes or regions, in up to 1,491 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 3,145 unaffected controls from three different population based studies from the UK, Denmark and USA.After adjusting for population stratification by genomic control, 18 SNPs (5.3%) were significant at the 5% level, and 5 SNPs (1.5%) were significant at the 1% level. The most significant association was for the SNP rs2107425, located on chromosome 11p15.5, which has previously been identified as a susceptibility allele for breast cancer from a genome wide association study (P-trend = 0.0012). When SNPs/genes were stratified into 7 different pathways or groups of validation SNPs, the breast cancer associated SNPs were the only group of SNPs that were significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk (P-heterogeneity = 0.0003; P-trend = 0.0028; adjusted (for population stratification) P-trend = 0.006). We did not find statistically significant associations when the combined data for all SNPs were analysed using an admixture maximum likelihood (AML) experiment-wise test for association (P-heterogeneity = 0.051; P-trend = 0.068).These data suggest that a proportion of the SNPs we evaluated were associated with ovarian cancer risk, but that the effect sizes were too small to detect associations with individual SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2136063721,"Mycelia of higher fungi consist of interconnected hyphae that are compartmentalized by septa. These septa contain large pores that allow streaming of cytoplasm and even organelles. The cytoplasm of such mycelia is therefore considered to be continuous.Here, we show by laser dissection that septa of Schizophyllum commune can be closed depending on the environmental conditions. The most apical septum of growing hyphae was open when this basidiomycete was grown in minimal medium with glucose as a carbon source. In contrast, the second and the third septum were closed in more than 50% and 90% of the cases, respectively. Interestingly, only 24 and 37% of these septa were closed when hyphae were growing in the absence of glucose. Whether a septum was open or closed also depended on physical conditions of the environment or the presence of toxic agents. The first septum closed when hyphae were exposed to high temperature, to hypertonic conditions, or to the antibiotic nourseothricin. In the case of high temperature, septa opened again when the mycelium was placed back to the normal growth temperature.Taken together, it is concluded that the septal pores of S. commune are dynamic structures that open or close depending on the environmental conditions. Our findings imply that the cytoplasm in the mycelium of a higher fungus is not continuous per se."
https://openalex.org/W1988668596,"The hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus belongs to the deepest branch in the bacterial genealogy. Although it has long been recognized that this unique Gram-negative bacterium carries genes for different steps of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) formation, data on the LPS itself or detailed knowledge of the LPS pathway beyond the first committed steps of lipid A and 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) synthesis are still lacking. We now report the functional characterization of the thermostable Kdo transferase WaaA from A. aeolicus and provide evidence that the enzyme is monofunctional. Compositional analysis and mass spectrometry of purified A. aeolicus LPS, showing the incorporation of a single Kdo residue as an integral component of the LPS, implicated a monofunctional Kdo transferase in LPS biosynthesis of A. aeolicus. Further, heterologous expression of the A. aeolicus waaA gene in a newly constructed Escherichia coli DeltawaaA suppressor strain resulted in synthesis of lipid IVA precursors substituted with one Kdo sugar. When highly purified WaaA of A. aeolicus was subjected to in vitro assays using mass spectrometry for detection of the reaction products, the enzyme was found to catalyze the transfer of only a single Kdo residue from CMP-Kdo to differently modified lipid A acceptors. The Kdo transferase was capable of utilizing a broad spectrum of acceptor substrates, whereas surface plasmon resonance studies indicated a high selectivity for the donor substrate."

The cellular form, PrPC, consists of an unstructured N-terminal “tail” of residues 23–125 and a globular domain of residues 126–231, and is attached by a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to the outer plasma membrane. This structure ensures a role of membrane interactions in the physiological function of PrPC and probably also in the disease-related events leading to TSEs. For example, transgenic mice expressing a prion protein variant lacking the GPI membrane anchor did not develop the typical clinical signs of TSE after inoculation with infectious brain homogenate, although significant amounts of PrPSc accumulated in the brain (4Chesebro B.

In this report we describe investigations of PrP interactions with a membrane mimetic and focus on the mutations P102L, P105L, and A117V, which have been linked with familial Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome in humans (2Collinge J.

Our interest in these variant proteins is related to open questions about the mechanisms by which pathogenic mutations predispose humans for prion diseases. We studied the interactions of a recombinant wild-type mouse prion protein fragment, mPrP-(90–231), and the variants mPrP[P102L]-(91–231), mPrP[P105L]-(91–231), mPrP[A117V]-(90–231), mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231), and mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231). For these studies, we used the N-terminally truncated protein composed of residues 90–231. This region contains the transmembrane segment, all known disease-associated point mutations, the entire polypeptide fragment with proteinase K-resistance in PrPSc, which is also sufficient to transmit disease (1Prusiner S.B.

The amino acid substitutions in these variant PrPs are located either within a hydrophobic stretch of residues 112–127, which is highly conserved in mammalian PrPs (27Schätzl H.M. Da Costa M.

We also included the M129V polymorphism into this study, which was reported to have a significant influence on the susceptibility of humans to prion diseases and on the disease phenotype. For example, the mutations P105L and A117V are only pathogenic in the presence of valine at position 129 (2Collinge J. Annu. Rev.

The zwitterionic detergent dodecylphosphocholine (DPC, Fig. 1A) was used as a biomembrane mimetic model system, and NMR spectroscopy was employed to screen for protein-detergent micelle interactions, and for the structural characterization of the various prion protein constructs interacting with the detergent micelles. The construction of the plasmids encoding the mouse PrP polypeptide segments mPrP-(91–231), mPrP[P102L]-(91–231), and mPrP[P105L]-(91–231) has been described (29Lysek D.A. Wüthrich K.

The plasmids for other mouse prion protein variants were obtained with mPrP-(90–231) or mPrP-(91–231) as a template, using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. The following mutagenesis primers were used: 5′-AGG GGC TGC GGT AGC TGG GGC AG-3′ and 5′-CTG CCC CAG CTA CCG CAG CCC CT-3′ for mPrP[A117V]-(90–231), 5′-CCA ACC TCA AGC ATG TGG TAG GGG TCG CGG CAG TGG GGG CAG TAG TGG GGG GCC TTG GT-3′ and 5′-ACC AAG GCC CCC CAC TAC TGC CCC CAC TGC CGC GAC CCC TAC CAC ATG CTT GAG GTT GG-3′ for mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231), 5′-CCA AAA ACC AAC CTC ATC ATC GTG GCA GGG GCT GCG GCA-3′ and 5′-TGC CGC AGC CCC TGC CAC GAT GAT GAG GTT GGT TTT TGG-3′ for mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231), and 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC GTG CTG GGG AGC GCC ATG-3′ and 5′-CAT GGC GCT CCC CAG CAC GTA GCC ACC AAG-3′ for mPrP[M129V]-(91–231). For the generation of mPrP[P105L,M129V]-(91–231) and mPrP[A117V,M129V]-(90–231), the plasmids mPrP[P105L]-(91–231) and mPrP[A117V]-(90–231), respectively, were used as templates with the same mutagenesis primers as applied for the generation of mPrP[M129V]-(91–231). All the aforementioned constructs were expressed and purified as uniformly 15N-labeled proteins (29Lysek D.A. Wüthrich K.

Uniformly 15N- or 13C,15N-labeled protein samples were prepared in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 in 90% H2O/10% D2O. The protein concentration was 1.0–1.4 mm, unless otherwise indicated. Tentative initial backbone 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO resonance assignments for mPrP-(90–231) at pH 7.0 were generated by transfer of the published assignments of mPrP-(121–231) at pH 4.5, and of human PrP-(90–230) at pH 7.0 (29Lysek D.A.

The assignments were then confirmed using standard triple resonance NMR experiments with the uniformly 13C,15N-labeled mPrP-(90–231) at pH 7.0. The 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO resonance assignments for all except two (see below) of the prion protein variants were guided by the thus obtained assignments for wild-type mPrP-(90–231), using HNCA, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO spectra measured with the variant proteins. For mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231), additional CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB spectra were used to confirm the assignments. For mPrP[P105L,M129V]-(91–231) and mPrP[A117V,M129V]-(90–231) the assignments were derived from comparison with the chemical shifts of the corresponding single-residue variants. The 13Cα assignments for uniformly 13C,15N-labeled mPrP-(90–231), mPrP[P105L]-(91–231), and mPrP[A117V]-(90–231) in the presence of 12.9 mm DPC were obtained using HNCA experiments recorded at a protein concentration of 135 μm. All NMR experiments were performed at 20 °C on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with a triply tunable cryogenic probehead. The NMR data were processed with the programs XWINNMR and T0PSPIN 2.0, and the program CARA (www.nmr.ch) was used for the spectral analysis (31Keller R. The Computer-aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial CARA. Cantina Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). For the titration experiments, 150 μm samples of 15N-labeled protein were prepared in 5 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0, which contained 10% D2O. The experiments were carried out by the addition of aliquots of a 129 mm stock solution of DPC in 5 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0, which contained 10% D2O. Two-dimensional 15N,1H-HSQC spectra were recorded at each DPC concentration to measure the 15N chemical shifts. A mean dissociation constant for the micelle-protein complex, KD, was obtained from the dependence of the 15N chemical shifts of selected prion protein residues on the DPC concentration for mPrP[P105L]-(90–231), using Equation 1 (32Hiller S. NMR Methods for Studies of Folded and Unfolded Forms of Globular Proteins. Diss. ETH No. 16729, ETH Zürich, Switzerland2006: 98-103Google Scholar). Δδ(N15)=Δδmax[M0]−cmcKD*n+[M0]−cmc(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, Δδ(15N) is the chemical shift difference between the backbone amide nitrogen resonances at a given DPC concentration and in the absence of DPC, Δδmax is the chemical shift difference at the final DPC concentration, [M0] is the monomeric DPC concentration, cmc is the critical micelle concentration, and n is the aggregation number of DPC. The latter two values were used as specified by the manufacturer (Anatrace, Maumee, OH), i.e. cmc = 1.5 mm and n = 54. Hydrophobic moments were calculated according to Eisenberg et al. (33Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Free energy changes for transferring amino acid residues between a lipid and a water environment were calculated according to White & Wimley using the function octanol from the program EMBOSS (35White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). The prion proteins used for this study were cloned, expressed, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To establish a platform for studies of protein-detergent micelle interactions at a resolution of individual amino acid residues, we determined sequence-specific backbone assignments for all the proteins in 90% H2O/10% D2O containing 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and T = 20 °C. The NMR assignments were based on standard triple resonance experiments (36Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, London1996Google Scholar), using a strategy described under “Experimental Procedures.” The backbone assignments are complete, with the following exceptions: in all the proteins the HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13CO resonances of His96 and the residues 165–170, which are located in the β2–α2 linker peptide segment (Fig. 1B) could not be assigned due to line broadening of the HN and 15N resonances caused by conformational exchange (37Gossert A.D. Bonjour S. Lysek D.A. Fiorito F. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, the HN and 15N resonances could not be assigned for the residues Asn97, Asn171, and Phe175 in all the proteins, Lys104 in mPrP[P105L]-(91–231), Val129 in mPrP[M129V]-(91–231), mPrP[P105L,M129V]-(91–231), and mPrP[A117V,M129V]-(90–231), and Asn108 in mPrP-(90–231), mPrP[M129V]-(91–231), and mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231). In all the proteins the HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13CO resonances of Gly93 and Gly94 are degenerate and could only be assigned as a group. In the tetrapeptide segment Ala115-Ala116-Ala117-Ala118, the resonances of Ala115 and Ala118 could be assigned from the sequential connectivities to Gly114 and Gly119 (Fig. 1C). The HN and 15N resonances of Ala116 and Ala117 were assigned by comparing mPrP-(90–231) with mPrP-(90–231) [A117V], where the HN and 15N resonances of residue 117 are at chemical shifts typical of Val residues. The resonance assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession numbers: mPrP-(90–231), 16071; mPrP[M129V]-(91–231), 16075; mPrP[P102L]-(91–231), 16076; mPrP[P105L]-(91–231), 16077; mPrP[A117V]-(90–231), 16078; mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231), 16079; and mPrP[K110I, H111I]-(90–231), 16080). At the beginning of our study, we tested several detergents and phospholipid bicelles as possible membrane mimetics. The best results were obtained with DPC, whose phosphocholine head groups are expected to simulate a membrane interface, and which is the most widely used detergent for NMR studies of both single α-helical membrane proteins and integral membrane β-barrel proteins (38Arora A. Tamm L.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). These studies include proteins and peptides that have been reported to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane such as the N-terminal membrane anchor segment of thromboxane A2 synthase (40So S.P. Li D. Ruan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40679-40685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the N-terminal membrane anchor domain of prostaglandin I2 synthase (41Ruan K.H. So S.P. Zheng W. Wu J. Li D. Kung J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic domain of the canine Sec61 gamma protein from the protein translocation pore of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (42Beswick V. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Képès F. Neumann J.M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14717-14724Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interactions of the detergent DPC with mPrP-(90–231) and the prion protein variants shown in Fig. 1C were characterized by observing 15N chemical shift changes of the backbone resonances in the two-dimensional 15N,1H-HSQC spectra caused by addition of increasing amounts of DPC at pH 7.0. The resonance assignments for the free prion proteins were used as a starting point, and the positions of the backbone 15N,1H signals were then recorded as a function of the concentration of added DPC. Using this approach, the backbone HN and 15N resonances could be assigned up to a DPC concentration of 40 mm in all the proteins except mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231) and mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231). For the latter two proteins, assignments could only be obtained up to concentrations of 6.8 mm and 18.6 mm DPC, respectively, because at higher DPC concentrations there was line-broadening and reduced solubility that prevented reliable assignment of the resonances. In all proteins the HN-15N cross peak of His111 could not be followed after addition of DPC, due to resonance overlap. Fig. 2 shows superpositions of an expanded region of the two-dimensional 15N,1H-HSQC spectra obtained for wild-type mPrP-(90–231), and for the two variants mPrP[P105L]-(91–231) and mPrP[A117V]-(90–231) in the absence and presence of 12.9 mm DPC. Whereas the wild-type protein shows only small chemical shift differences upon addition of DPC, individual 15N resonances in the two variants exhibit significant changes in their resonance positions and many of the affected resonances show significant line-broadening of the shifted cross-peaks. Because the HN resonances were only slightly affected, we performed our analysis using the 15N chemical shift changes. However, analysis performed with combined 1HN and 15N chemical shift changes do not change our conclusions (data not shown). Histograms displaying the amide 15N chemical shift changes after addition of 6.8 mm DPC for the individual residues in the proteins (Fig. 3) reveal that DPC interactions cause mainly upfield shifts of 15N resonances. In all the proteins, the largest 15N chemical shift changes between the free and DPC-bound states of the proteins were found for the residues 107–127, identifying this polypeptide segment as the DPC binding region. All other amino acid residues in the proteins were at most only slightly affected, except that the binding region is N-terminally extended to residue 102 for mPrP[P102L]-(91–231), and to residue 105 for mPrP[P105L]-(91–231) and mPrP[P105L,M129V]-(91–231) (Fig. 3, C–E). Judging from the size of the 15N chemical shift changes, the two designed variants mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231) and mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231) (Fig. 3, H and I) show the strongest interaction with DPC, followed by the other proteins in the order mPrP[P105L]-(91–231) > mPrP[A117V]-(90–231) > mPrP[P102L]-(91–231). Only weak interactions were observed for mPrP-(90–231) and mPrP[M129V]-(91–231). Within the aforementioned binding regions, the largest chemical shift changes were observed for the residues Val113, Val118, and Gly123 in mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231), and for the residues Val112, Ala113, and Gly123 in mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231). The resonances that show the largest 15N chemical shift changes upon addition of DPC also exhibit the greatest degree of line-broadening. Comparison of pairs of proteins carrying either methionine or valine at position 129, with otherwise identical amino acid sequences, showed that they have nearly identical 15N chemical shift changes upon addition of DPC (in Fig. 3, compare A and B, D and E, and F and G, respectively), indicating that the M129V polymorphism does not noticeably influence the interactions of the proteins with DPC. To further investigate the nature of the detergent interactions causing the 15N chemical shift changes in Fig. 3, two-dimensional 15N,1H-correlation NMR spectra of mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231) were measured during a titration with small DPC concentrations. Below the critical micelle concentration of 1.5 mm, no changes in the 15N chemical shifts were observed, indicating that the protein does not interact with DPC monomers, but is rather interacting with DPC micelles (Fig. 4). To obtain an estimate of the stability of the PrP-detergent micelle complexes, we measured 15N chemical shift changes for selected well resolved resonances upon stepwise addition of DPC in the range above the cmc up to a concentration of 40 mm. Fig. 5 shows for all the proteins studied that over this range of concentrations the upfield chemical shift changes increase monotonously with increasing DPC concentrations. The slope of the 15N chemical shift changes versus the DPC concentration over the near-linear part of the curves in Fig. 5 was highest for mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231) and mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231), and for the other proteins it decreased in the order mPrP[P105L]-(91–231), mPrP[P105L,M129V]-(91–231), mPrP[A117V]-(90–231), mPrP[A117V,M129V]-(90–231), mPrP[P102L]-(91–231), mPrP[M129V]-(90–231), and mPrP-(90–231) (Fig. 5). The addition of DPC micelles also caused line broadening and precipitation of variable fractions of the individual proteins. For mPrP[A113V,A115V,A118V]-(90–231) and mPrP[K110I,H111I]-(90–231), these side effects limited the data analysis to DPC concentrations below 18.6 and 6.8 mm, respectively (Fig. 5, H and I). Although the 15N chemical shifts show a linear dependence on the detergent concentration over most of the DPC concentration range covered in Fig. 5, saturation at the higher DPC concentrations could be measured and fitted with Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) for mPrP[P105L]-(91–231), which shows the strongest binding among the proteins for which data could be obtained up to 40 mm DPC concentration (Fig. 5). This approach yielded a dissociation constant, Kd, of 0.9 ± 0.2 mm, which can be considered to represent an upper limit of the affinity of DPC micelles for the PrP species of Fig. 1C with the exception of the last two species listed. These may bind more tightly. However, the limited solubility of these two species at elevated DPC concentrations prevents a quantitative statement regarding their affinity for DPC micelles. The proteins mPrP[P105L]-(91–231) and mPrP[A117V]-(90–231) were selected for further studies, based on the fact that they show large chemical shift changes upon interaction with DPC and are associated with TSEs in humans, to quantify the population and determine the residue boundaries of helical conformation induced by the interaction with the micelles. The 13Cα downfield chemical shifts induced by the addition of DPC in these two proteins (Fig. 6, B and C) indeed manifest increased α-helical character of the polypeptide segments 102–124 and 110–122, respectively, which had independently been identified as the DPC binding regions (Fig. 3). Wild-type mPrP-(90–231) was used as a control, and it showed no specific DPC effects on 13Cα shifts (Fig. 6A). The striking result of this in vitro study is that amino acid exchanges in PrP, which are ot"

The PKD2 gene is one of the two genes mutated in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (1.Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M.

It encodes polycystin-2, a 968-amino acid-long protein with 6 putative membrane-spanning domains. According to structural predictions, both its N and C termini extend into the cytoplasm; furthermore, a pore-forming region has been postulated between the fifth and sixth membrane-spanning domains. By sequence comparison a coiled-coil domain and a Ca2+-binding EF-hand have been predicted in the C terminus of polycystin-2 (1.Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 28305-28312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, so far only indirect evidence for the presence of these motifs has been presented. Electrophysiological measurements by several groups have demonstrated that polycystin-2 is a non-selective cation channel and that its channel activity is regulated by calcium. One report has shown the activation of polycystin-2 by the addition of 1 μm Ca2+ to the bath solution and its inhibition by millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (3.Vassilev P.M. Guo L. Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Peng J.B. Basora N. Babakhanlou H. Cruger G. Kanazirska M. Ye C.p. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). An R742X mutant protein, however, did not respond to the addition of Ca2+. These initial observations were confirmed by other publications that reported that Ca2+ concentrations of up to 1.26 mm increase the probability for the open state of full-length polycystin-2 (4.Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), whereas higher concentrations are inhibitory (4.Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E.

Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Again, the activity of a truncated protein, this time a 703-amino acid mutant, is not modulated by calcium (4.Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). From the above it seems obvious that the C terminus via binding of Ca2+ exerts a modulatory activity on the channel activity of polycystin-2. This part of the protein, however, also is of particular interest because it interacts with a wide variety of other proteins, among them polycystin-1, ion channels (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, polycystin-2 itself, and TRPC1), cytoskeletal proteins (α-actinin, CD2AP, mDia1, troponin I, and tropomyosin-1), intracellular trafficking proteins (PACS-1, PACS-2, and PIGEA-14) and even a transcription factor (Id2) (6.Witzgall R. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2007; 179: 363-375Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Whether all of these interactions are direct or require additional cofactors is not clear at present; furthermore, it is not known whether any of them are cooperative or exclusive. We have therefore decided to subject the C terminus of polycystin-2 to an extensive biochemical and structural analysis. A fragment coding for amino acids 680–796 of human polycystin-2 (Fig. 1) was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) grown and adapted in a modified new minimal medium (NMM) (7.Budisa N. Steipe B.

The recombinant protein was purified as published earlier by us (9.Schumann F.H. Hoffmeister H. Schmidt M. Bader R. Besl E. Witzgall R. Kalbitzer H.R. Biomol.

The finally obtained polycystin-2-(680–796) fragment contains six additional amino acids (Gly-Ser-Thr-Ala-Ile-Gly) encoded by the vector. For quantitative experiments the initial protein concentration was determined photometrically by using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ280 of 4470 m−1 cm−1 calculated according to Pace et al.

Polycystin-2-(680–796) was dissolved at a concentration of 51.9 μm in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl. The amount of bound calcium ions was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy with a JY 70 Plus spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, München, Germany) at a wavelength of 393.366 nm and under a gas pressure of 0.8 MPa. Alternatively, the inherent Ca2+ concentration was determined by titrating the sample with EDTA until the NMR signals of Ca2+-free EDTA were observed. Both methods gave identical results in the limits of error of ±10%. Data were recorded at a magnetic field strength of 14.1 and 18.8 tesla (T) using a Bruker AVANCE 600 and AVANCE 800 spectrometer equipped with TXI and TCI cryogenic probes operating at 1H resonance frequencies of 600.13 and 800.20 MHz. Usually, NMR spectra were acquired at 293 K. Unless stated otherwise, the NMR measurements were performed on a 0.5 mm protein sample in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.1 mm DSS containing 90% H2O and 10% D2O. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to DSS used as internal standard. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to DSS as described by Wishard et al. (11.Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Sensitivity improved 1H-15N-HSQC experiments were recorded with 128 × 2048 complex data points using a sweep width of 8400 Hz in the 1H dimension and 2400 Hz in the 15N dimension. The sequential backbone assignment was performed on the 13C/15N-labeled protein sample of polycystin-2-(680–796) using HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCANNH, HNCO, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, and 1H-15N-NOESY-HSQC three-dimensional spectra. Side-chain assignments are based on HCCH-TOCSY, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, and two-dimensional NOESY spectra. NOE distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional NOESY spectra and from 13C- or 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra. For all NOESY spectra a mixing time of 120 ms was used. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the TOPSPIN 2.1 software (Bruker Biospin) and AUREMOL (12.Gronwald W. Kalbitzer H.R. Prog. NMR Spectr. 2004; 44: 33-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ϕ and ψ angle restraints were obtained from an analysis of the proton, nitrogen, and carbon chemical shifts with the program TALOS 1999.019.15.47 (13.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement restraints were used only in a qualitative manner, because the protein contains two closely spaced metal binding sites. Hydrogen bonds were derived from the secondary structure prediction and confirmed by an analysis of the NOE patterns. For the ISIC refinement the x-ray structure of the calmodulin-like domain from soybean CDPK-α (pdb code 1S6I) (14.Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol.

After sequence alignment residues 87–135 of 1S6I (corresponding to residues 415–463 of CDPK-α) show 30.6% sequence identity in the region 730–778 of polycystin-2.

High temperature torsional angle dynamics were run at 50,000 K for 1,000 steps with a time step of 0.015 ps. In the first cooling stage, torsional angle dynamics were used for 1,000 steps with a starting temperature of 50,000 K and a time step 0.015 ps. The second cooling stage was performed with 3,000 steps of Cartesian dynamics with a time step of 0.005 ps and a starting temperature of 3,000 K. Final energy minimization was performed for 2,000 steps. The 10 lowest energy structures were refined using the ISIC procedure (16.Brunner K. Gronwald W. Trenner J.M. Neidig K.P. Kalbitzer H.R.

Out of 1000 calculated final structures, the 10 structures with the lowest pseudo-energies were further refined in explicit solvent (17.Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M.

Secondary structure elements, root mean square deviation values, and Ramachandran plots were calculated with the program MOLMOL 2K.2. The agreement of the NOESY data with the calculated structures was calculated from a two-dimensional-NOESY and a three-dimensional-NOESY-1H, 15N-HSQC with AUREMOL-RFAC-3D (19.Gronwald W. Brunner K.

Reson. 1994; 108: 255-258Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (gradient lengths, 2 ms). In addition, during longitudinal evolution, spoiler gradients of 2- and 1-ms lengths were used. At least 32 scans were accumulated for each gradient strength. The data were evaluated as described by Munte et al. (22.Munte C.E. Gäde G. Domogalla B. Kremer W. Kellner R. Kalbitzer H.R. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The tyrosine fluorescence of polycystin-2 was measured by exciting the protein sample at 280 nm and measuring light emission from 290 nm through 310 nm using the fluorescence spectrophotometer Cary Eclipse (Varian). The slit-width used for excitation and emission was 5 nm. All fluorescence measurements were performed at 295 K. The polycystin-2-(680–796) fragment was dissolved at a concentration of 50 μm in buffer A (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl). A solution of 10 mm CaCl2 in buffer A was added in increments of 1 and 2 μl to 1 ml of the protein solution. Dilution effects were corrected by measuring a set of data using the same amounts of Ca2+-free buffer A. After each addition of CaCl2 the sample was mixed for 10 s and incubated for another 60 s before the fluorescence measurement was performed. Care was taken to use Ca2+-free solutions by using H2O additionally purified over a Chelex 100 column (Sigma). 41.5 μm unlabeled polycystin-2-(680–796) was dissolved in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl, 90% H2O, 10% D2O. A solution of CaCl2 (stock solution 10 mm) in the same buffer was titrated in 2-μl aliquots to the sample. At every titration step a proton experiment was carried out using a Watergate W5 water suppression (23.Lui M. Mao X. Ye C. Huang H. Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 132: 125-129Crossref Scopus (458) Google Scholar). A recycle delay of 3.36 s was used with 1024 scans/free induction decay (FID) to obtain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. KD values for the binding of Ca2+ ions were obtained from chemical shift changes Δδ or changes of signal volumes ΔI measured at different titration steps. The dissociation constant KD1 for a single independent binding site can be calculated from the chemical shift Δδ1 by Equation 1, Δδ1=ΔδP−L12CptotalCPtotal+CLtotal+KD1−CPtotal+CLtotal+KD12⋅CPtotal⋅CPtotal+Δδ01(Eq. 1) with cPtotal and cLtotal the total concentrations of the protein and the ligand (Ca2+ ion), respectively. Δδ1 is defined as δ1 − δ01, Δδ01 as δP1 − δ01, and ΔδP-L1 as δP-L1 − δP1. δ01, δP1, and δP-L1 are the chemical shifts at the lowest ligand concentration, in the ligand-free state, and the completely bound state, respectively. Equation 1 accounts for the case when spectra for the ligand-free state are not available, and Δδ01 is an additional fit parameter. An analogous equation holds for fluorescence intensity changes ΔI and cross-peak intensity changes when slow exchange conditions prevail. In Equation 2, ΔI=ΔIP - L2CPtotalCPtotal+CLtotal+KD1−CPtotal+CLtotal+KD12−4⋅CPtotal⋅CLtotal+ΔI0(Eq. 2) ΔΙ is defined as I − I0, ΔΙ0 as IP − I01, and ΔΙP-L as IP-L − IP. I0, IP, and IP-L are the fluorescence intensities at the lowest ligand concentration, in the ligand-free state and the completely bound state, respectively, saturation. In case of slow exchange conditions in one-dimensional spectroscopy Equation 2 also holds but the intensity of the line under consideration in the absence of ligand must be zero. In case of two-dimensional HSQC spectra the situation is more complex, because relaxation effects during the mixing time may also influence the result (24.Maurer T. Meier S. Kachel N. Munte C.E. Hasenbein S. Koch B. Hengstenberg W. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5906-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The above functions were either entered in the fit program Origin, or, alternatively, the fluorescence data were evaluated with the specialized Origin software (MicroCal, LCC), which also assumes a single binding site model and gave the same results. The NMR data show that an additional weaker Ca2+-binding site exists. The corresponding intensity changes ΔΙ2 were fitted by Equation 3, ΔI2=ΔIP - L22CPtotalCPtotal+CPtotal+KD2−CPtotalΔδ1+Δδ01ΔδP - L1+Δδ01−CPtotal+CLtotal+KD2−CPtotalΔδ1+Δδ01ΔδP-L1+Δδ012−4⋅CPtotal⋅CLtotal−CPtotalΔδ1+Δδ01ΔδP-L1+Δδ01+ΔI02(Eq. 3) with KD2 the dissociation constant of the second binding site. The corresponding equation for the chemical shift changes is then Equation 4. Δδ1=ΔδP-L12CPtotalCPtotal+CLtotal+KD1−CPtotalΔI2+ΔI02ΔIP-L2+ΔI02−CPtotal+CLtotal+KD1−CPtotalΔI2+ΔI02ΔIP-L2+ΔI02−4⋅CPtotal⋅CLtotal−CPtotalΔI2+ΔI02ΔIP-L2+ΔI02+Δδ01(Eq. 4) In principle, these equations have to be solved simultaneously. However, the fitting procedure can also be used iteratively by improving KD1 with the obtained ΔI2P−L and so on. The hydropathy analysis of polycystin-2 predicts 6 membrane-spanning domains of which the most C-terminal region ends with amino acid 679. Because amino acids 754–782 may represent an EF-hand motif (1.Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J.

Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), we have started our structural characterization of polycystin-2 with a region extending from amino acids 680–796 (Fig. 1). This region was produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2). The obtained 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum (Fig. 3, left panel) was poorly resolved and contains significantly less than the expected number of 126 amide back bone signals. After addition of 1 mm CaCl2 the spectral quality improved dramatically (Fig. 3, right panel). The spectrum showed satisfactory chemical shift dispersion, although still a rather large number of resonances were found at random-coil positions.FIGURE 31H-15N HSQC spectra of polycystin-2-(680–796). The sample conditions were: 0.25 mm polycystin-2-(680–796) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.1 mm DSS containing 90% H2O and 10% D2O.

Because the spectral quality increased substantially after addition of CaCl2, a reduction of the effective molecular mass and/or the suppression of chemical exchange broadening must occur after calcium binding (Fig. 3). Because the line broadening in the absence of divalent ions could be due to protein aggregation, diffusion measurements were performed (Fig. 4). Using DSS as reference apparent molecular masses of ∼24,300 g·mol−1 and 9,200 g·mol−1 are obtained for polycystin-2-(680–796) in the absence and presence of 2 mm CaCl2, respectively (Table 1). The value in the absence of CaCl2 is clearly larger than 13,515 g·mol−1 expected for a monomeric polycystin-2 fragment and corresponds closely to that expected for a dimer. The addition of CaCl2 reduces the relative hydrodynamic radius significantly, and the experimentally determined apparent mass is smaller than that calculated for a monomer. Addition of 2 mm MgCl2 does not have a significant effect on the diffusion constant determined and thus on the aggregation state of the protein.TABLE 1Apparent molecular masses and relative hydrodynamic radii of polycystin-2-(680–796) in the presence and absence of Ca2+ ionsCompoundDaThe diffusion constant was quantified by measuring the signal decay in 99.9% D2O, 0.1% H2O as a function of the gradient strength and assuming a diffusion constant of HDO of 1.872·10−9·m2·s−1 at 298 K.Rh/Rh,DSSbRatio of the hydrodynamic radii of polycystin-2 and DSS.MexpcApparent molar mass of polycystin-2 experimentally obtained using DSS (196.34 g mol−1) as reference.McalcdMolar mass calculated from the sequence.10−12 m2·s−1g·mol−1g·mol−1Polycystin-2-(680–796)1.51 ± 0.044.98 ± 0.1424,249 ± 2,04513,515Polycystin-2-(680–796)·2Ca2+2.09 ± 0.093.60 ± 0.179,160 ± 1,29713,595Polycystin-2-(680–796), MgCl21.47 ± 0.055.15 ± 0.1726,742 ± 0,90213,515a The diffusion constant was quantified by measuring the signal decay in 99.9% D2O, 0.1% H2O as a function of the gradient strength and assuming a diffusion constant of HDO of 1.872·10−9·m2·s−1 at 298 K.b Ratio of the hydrodynamic radii of polycystin-2 and DSS.c Apparent molar mass of polycystin-2 experimentally obtained using DSS (196.34 g mol−1) as reference.d Molar mass calculated from the sequence. Open table in a new tab Because the diffusion constant is not only a function of the molecular mass but in addition also dependent on the macromolecular shape, the Ca2+-induced changes could also be caused at least partly by a change of the molecular shape. CD spectroscopy in the absence and presence of CaCl2 can be used to analyze the secondary structure of the protein (Fig. 5). The so-obtained CD spectra are indicative of a partially folded protein and reveal small changes of secondary structure on calcium binding. Without CaCl2 added the secondary structure analysis results in relative contents of α-helix, β-strand, turns, and unordered regions of 30, 16, 14 and 40%, respectively. In the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 the secondary structure is 47% α-helical, 12% β-strand, another 12% coiled, and 28% unordered conformation, that is, the α-helical content increases from 30% to 47% and the β-strand content decreases somewhat after addition of CaCl2. The assignments of the resonance lines of polycystin-2-(680–796) were performed with heteronuclear methods (9.Schumann F.H. Hoffmeister H. Schmidt M. Bader R. Besl E. Witzgall R. Kalbitzer H.R. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in the Ca2+-saturated state and are deposited in the BMRB (Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank) under accession number 16191. From the 127 amino acids of the polycystin-2 sequence (not counting the 6 linker residues), it was possible to assign sequentially the backbone HN, Hα, N, C′, and Cα resonances of 92 amino acids. This corresponds to the backbone signals of ∼95% of all residues where an amide signals could be reliably detected in the HSQC spectrum. From these residues ∼80% of the corresponding side-chain resonances could be identified. The combined backbone chemical shift changes (26.Schumann F.H. Riepl H. Maurer T. Gronwald W. Neidig K.P. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 39: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) are plotted in Fig. 6a as function of the sequence. The N-terminal amino acids originating from the vector show very narrow lines and typical random coil chemical shifts. Amino acids 680–705 from polycystin-2 are characterized by somewhat broader lines and chemical shift values that are still close to the random-coil values. The amide signals of amino acids 707–724 are broadened beyond detection probably by slow or intermediate exchange processes. The following amino acids show large deviations from the random-coil chemical shifts and solely the last 6 amino acids show chemical shifts that are typically expected for an unstructured peptide. The heteronuclear NOE data fit into the picture (Fig. 6b): the first two N-terminal amino acids show a high mobility characterized by negative NOEs, the heteronuclear NOEs for the next amino acids slowly increase up to values of 0.6 as it is typical for mobile, weakly structured elements. In the central part NOEs typical for well folded structures are found. The 6 C-terminal amino acids show again decreasing NOEs that are typical for highly mobile peptides, whereas the terminal Leu-796 is again characterized by a negative NOE. The chemical shift index (Fig. 6c) predicts two β-strands B1 and B2 from Lys-735 to Asn-737 and Glu-769 to Thr-771 and two α-helices H2 and H3 from Phe-738 to Gln-743 and from Ala-753 to Tyr-762, respectively. An analysis of the short and intermediate range NOE patterns reveals the existence of two additional helices H1 and H4, helix H1 from Leu-729 to Lys-735 and helix H4 from Thr-771 to His-775. According to this analysis, helix H2 is extending from Phe-738 to Leu-745 and helix H3 from Asp-752 to Tyr-762. This result fits into the picture of two paired helix-loop-helix (EF hand) motifs connected to each other by another small loop (Lys-746 to His-751). The structural elements are arranged in the topology αβααβα. The two β-strands B1 and B2 show the typical strong dαN(i,i+1) NOEs (Leu-736 Hα-Asn-737 HN, Asn-737 Hα-Phe-738 HN, Glu-769 Hα-Leu-770 HN, and Leu-770 Hα-Thr-771 HN). Additionally, the mutual arrangement of the β-strands is well defined by long range NOEs (Leu-736 HN-Glu-769 HN, Leu-736 HN-Leu-770 HN, Asn-737 HN-Leu-770 HN, and Asn-737 Hα-Leu-770 HN) between the two β-strands. This NOE pattern is typical for an antiparallel β-sheet. Because we observed a strong effect of CaCl2 at submillimolar concentrations under high salt conditions (500 mm NaCl), polycystin-2-(680–796) must have at least one binding site for Ca2+ ions. Titrations with EGTA show that the protein samples always contain some calcium even if they are prepared in calcium free buffers. This was also confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy measurements. In the freshly prepared samples the protein has initially 0.1–0.2 calcium ions bound per polycystin-2-(680–796) even if calcium was not added to the sample. Human polycystin-2-(680–796) contains three tyrosine residues at positions 684, 708, and 762; one of them (Tyr-762) is located close to the predicted calcium binding site, the two others in the unfolded regions of the protein. It can be expected that the tyrosine fluorescence intensity changes when Ca2+ ions are bound. Indeed, the fluorescence intensity increased when CaCl2 was added (Fig. 7). Taking into account that initially 8.4 μm calcium is contained in the sample as determined by optical emission spectroscopy, the data can be fitted well by Equation 2 (“Experimental Procedures”) that assumes a single calcium binding site. This is a good approximation even if a second binding site exists as long as the affinity of the second site is significantly low"
https://openalex.org/W2063819454,"Lipoproteins that play critical roles in various cellular functions of Gram-negative bacteria are localized in the cells inner and outer membranes. Lol proteins (LolA, LolB, LolC, LolD, and LolE) are involved in the transportation of outer membrane-directed lipoproteins from the inner to the outer membrane. LolA is a periplasmic chaperone that transports lipoproteins, and LolB is an outer membrane receptor that accepts lipoproteins. To clarify the structural basis for the lipoprotein transfer from LolA to LolB, we examined the interaction between LolA and mLolB, a soluble mutant of LolB, using solution NMR spectroscopy. We determined the interaction mode between LolA and mLolB with conformational changes of LolA. Based upon the observations, we propose that the LolA·LolB complex forms a tunnel-like structure, where the hydrophobic insides of LolA and LolB are connected, which enables lipoproteins to transfer from LolA to LolB.

Gram-negative bacteria express lipid-modified proteins, lipoproteins, which are anchored to the cellular membrane via acyl chains attached to N-terminal cysteine residues of the lipoproteins. Putative lipoproteins have been found in various bacteria. For example, Escherichia coli has at least 90 types of lipoproteins (1.Tokuda H. Matsuyama S. Tanaka-Masuda K. Ehrmann M. The Periplasm. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2007: 67-79Google Scholar), and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi has 105 putative lipoproteins (2.Fraser C.M. Casjens S. Huang W.M. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. Lathigra R. White O. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R. Hickey E.K. Gwinn M. Dougherty B. Tomb J.F. Fleischmann R.D. Richardson D. Peterson J. Kerlavage A.R. Quackenbush J. Salzberg S.

Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the functions of the majority of lipoproteins, some of the lipoproteins play essential roles in various cellular functions of Gram-negative bacteria, such as cell surface structure stabilization, cell shape maintenance, substrate transport, cell growth, and cell signaling (3.Braun V. Wu H.C. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1994: 319-341Google Scholar). Lipoproteins are located at three cellular membrane sites; they are the periplasmic side of the inner membrane, the periplasmic side of the outer membrane, and the outside of the outer membrane (4.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli most of the lipoproteins are anchored to the periplasmic side of the outer membrane, whereas others are anchored to that of the inner membrane (1.Tokuda H. Matsuyama S. Tanaka-Masuda K. Ehrmann M. The Periplasm. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2007: 67-79Google Scholar). Therefore, the transportation of the lipoproteins to the outer membrane is essential for E. coli. Five Lol proteins, LolA, LolB, LolC, LolD, and LolE, play central roles in the outer membrane-directed lipoprotein localization. The Lol·CDE complex, which is anchored to the inner membrane, transfers the lipoproteins from the membrane to a soluble monomer periplasmic protein, LolA (182 amino acids) in an ATP-dependent manner (5.Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6.Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat.

LolA transports the lipoproteins from the inner membrane through the periplasmic space to the outer membrane and transfers them to an outer membrane lipoprotein, LolB (186 amino acids). LolB is anchored to the membrane by acyl chains attached to its N-terminal cysteine, and it finally inserts the lipoproteins into the outer membrane (8.Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9.Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10.Tanaka K. Matsuyama S.I. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6538-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Among the Lol proteins the crystal structures of LolA and LolB have been solved. As for LolB, the soluble mutant of LolB, mLolB, in which the N-terminal cysteine residue was replaced with an alanine residue, was used for the structural analysis. Although LolA and mLolB share only 8% primary sequence identity, their tertiary structures are similar to each other (11.Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The structures of both LolA and mLolB resemble an open β-barrel with a lid. The convex side of the β-barrel is fully solvent-exposed, whereas the concave side is partly exposed (supplemental Fig. S1). The open β-barrels of LolA and LolB comprise 11 antiparallel β-strands (β1–β11) and an extra β-strand, β12 for LolA and β11′ for LolB. The lid is composed of three α-helices (α1–α3) and is embedded in the concave side of the β-barrel. The concave sides of LolA and LolB contain many hydrophobic residues. Therefore, this concave side of the proteins is speculated to be the binding site for the hydrophobic acyl chains of lipoproteins. Interestingly, one of the crystal structures of LolB accommodated a molecule of polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, PEGMME2000, on the hydrophobic surface of the concave side (supplemental Fig. S1). The specific interaction between LolA and LolB is a decisive step in correctly sorting lipoproteins from LolA via LolB to the outer membrane. However, the structural aspects of the interaction, which would clarify how LolA transfers lipoproteins to LolB, remain unknown. To address this issue, we focused on the interaction between LolA and LolB. Here we investigated the interaction of LolA with LolB by NMR spectroscopy. We used LolA with a His6 tag and mLolB, which retain the biological activities similar to those of the wild type protein (8.Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12.Narita S. Kanamaru K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

In addition, we identified the binding sites of an acyl chain analogue, decanoate, on LolA and mLolB.

A 10-μl aliquot of this decanoate-treated mLolB solution was added to 90 μl of a mixture containing the LolA·[35S]L10P complex and outer membranes followed by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h. The membrane incorporation of [35S]L10P was examined by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described (15.Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) after fractionation into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. We conducted chemical shift perturbation experiments of LolA and mLolB upon the addition of decanoate. Decanoate was titrated to 15N-labeled samples of LolA (0.28 mm) or mLolB (0.28 mm), and each 1H,15N TROSY spectrum was recorded. The weighted sum of the 1H and 15N chemical shift changes for each residue was calculated with the equation Δδwei = Δδ(1HN) + 0.2 Δδ(15N) upon the addition of 5 mm decanoate. To determine the dissociation constant (Kd) of the LolA·mLolB complex, we conducted isothermal titration calorimetry measurements using a VP-ITC (MicroCal) instrument at 25 °C. LolA and mLolB samples were prepared in a buffer containing 66 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.9) and 100 mm NaCl. mLolB was injected into LolA in 29 aliquots of 10 μl each at 240-s intervals. The data acquired from the mLolB injections into the buffer were subtracted from the experimental data. The data were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin software. NMR samples (0.3–0.5 ml) were prepared using 0.3–2.0 mm LolA and/or mLolB in the following buffers. For the assignments of LolA in the LolA·mLolB complex and the chemical shift perturbation experiments of LolA with mLolB or decanoate, NMR samples (0.3–0.5 ml) using buffer A (66 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.9), 100 mm NaCl) were used. For other NMR measurements buffer B (38 mm 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.9) was used. For cross-saturation experiments buffer B contained 60% 2H2O. For other NMR experiments the buffers contained 10% 2H2O. For the dimensional NMR experiments of the LolA assignments in the complex state with mLolB, a Bruker AVANCE 800 MHz spectrometer was used. For the cross-saturation experiments, a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer with a cryogenic probe was used. For the other NMR experiments, a Varian UNITY-INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer was used. All NMR spectra were recorded at 37 °C. Backbone resonance assignments of LolA and mLolB in the free state were performed as described elsewhere (13.Nakada S. Takahashi H. Sakakura M. Kurono M. Shimada I. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2007; 1: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 14.Nakada S. Sakakura M. Takahashi H. Tokuda H. Shimada I. Biomol. NMR. Assign. 2007; 1: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The assignments of LolA and mLolB in the LolA·mLolB complex were derived from titration experiments, and the assignments of free state LolA and mLolB were supported by three-dimensional NMR experiments. In the titration experiments 1H,15N TROSY spectra of the labeled LolA or mLolB with a series of concentrations of the unlabeled binding partner were measured. The molar ratios of unlabeled mLolB or LolA to labeled LolA or mLolB were varied from 0 to 5.5. At the molar ratio of 3:1 (unlabeled protein/labeled protein), where no more chemical shift changes of the labeled proteins occurred, the weighted sum of 1H and 15N chemical shift changes was calculated with the equation Δδwei = Δδ(1HN) + 0.2 Δδ(15N). In the cross-saturation experiments (19.Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 20.Nakanishi T. Miyazawa M. Sakakura M. Terasawa H. Takahashi H. Shimada I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) we prepared a sample containing LolA or mLolB labeled with 2H and 15N and the unlabeled binding partner. The molar ratio of the unlabeled protein to the labeled protein was set to 4:1. Saturation transfer from the unlabeled protein to the labeled protein was made using the WURST decoupling scheme with the saturation frequency set at 0.833 ppm. The saturation time was 2.0 s, and relaxation delay was 2.0 s. All spectra were processed using nmrPipe (21.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar). Data analysis was facilitated by the Sparky software (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, Sparky 3, University of California, San Francisco). For site-directed spin labeling, five single Cys substituted mutants of LolA, i.e. V24C, V32C, I58C, L59C, and Q145C, were prepared. The proteins were modified with the spin-label reagent MTSL ((1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate)(Toronto Research Chemicals), which attaches the nitroxide spin label via a disulfide bond to the single cysteine (22.Berliner L.J. Grunwald J. Hankovszky H.O. Hideg K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The spin label reagent MTSL in acetonitrile was added to the solution of each LolA mutant at a molar ratio of 7–8:1 (MTSL:LolA) and incubated at 25 °C for 20–24 h. After the reaction, the buffer was changed to buffer B, and the excess MTSL was removed. The molar ratio of each spin-labeled LolA to 15N-labeled mLolB was set to 3:1, where no more chemical shift changes of 15N-labeled mLolB occurred. 1H,15N TROSY spectra of 15N-labeled mLolB with each spin-labeled LolA were recorded before and after the MTSL was reduced by an incubation with ascorbate (Wako) at room temperature for 2 h. The analyses of lipoprotein interactions with LolA and LolB are important to elucidate the molecular mechanism of lipoprotein localization. However, no structural information about the interaction is currently available because of the low aqueous solubility of the lipoproteins due to their acyl chains. In the present study we used a saturated fatty acid as an analogue of the acyl chains of lipoproteins. In the major lipoproteins a saturated hydrocarbon with 16 carbon atoms is most frequently adopted as the acyl chains (23.Hantke K. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 24.Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the aqueous solubility of the saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms, palmitic acid, was less than 0.5 mm at room temperature, which was too low to perform NMR analyses. On the other hand, decanoate, a saturated fatty acid with 10 carbon atoms, possesses the sufficient solubility of more than 200 mm and is suitable for the NMR experiments. To assess the validity of the use of decanoate as the analogue of an acyl chain of the lipoprotein, we examined the inhibitory effect of decanoate on the lipoprotein (L10P) transfer activity of mLolB (Fig. 1). The amount of L10P incorporated into the outer membrane decreased depending on the concentration of decanoate preincubated with mLolB. These results suggested that the lipoprotein transfer reactions from LolA to mLolB and/or mLolB to outer membranes are sensitive to decanoate. To determine the decanoate binding sites on LolA and mLolB, chemical shift perturbation experiments were performed (Fig. 2) (supplemental Fig. S2). Here we calculated the weighted chemical shift changes (Δδwei) using the equation (25.Hajduk P.J. Dinges J. Miknis G.F. Merlock M. Middleton T. Kempf D.J. Egan D.A. Walter K.A. Robins T.S.

Engl. 2003; 42: 864-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) Δδwei = Δδ(1HN) + 0.2 Δδ(15N). Upon the addition of 5 mm decanoate, 11 residues (supplemental Table S1) of LolA showed Δδwei of >0.1 ppm. Among the affected residues, Gly-86 is located on the loop preceding α-helix 2. Phe-90 and Met-91 are located on α-helix 2, embedded in the hydrophobic cavity. The other affected residues are located on β-strands 1–2, 9, and 11 (Fig. 2A). Among the 11 affected residues, 6 hydrophobic residues are located in the core of the molecule, and their side chains are directed toward the concave side of the β-barrel. Although the other affected residues, Gln-33, Gly-86, Thr-128, Lys-155, and Ser-156, direct their side chains toward the outside of the protein surface, the amide groups of Gly-86, Thr-128, Lys-155, and Ser-156 are in close proximity to the affected hydrophobic residues. The observation that the residues with substantial chemical shift changes were mainly located inside the concave surface indicates that LolA accommodates decanoate on the concave side. Upon the addition of decanoate, 12 residues (supplemental Table S1) of LolB showed Δδwei of >0.4 ppm. These residues are located on α-helices 2–3, β-strands 1–2, 9, and 11 (Fig. 2B). Among the 12 affected residues, Ale-38 and Thr-55 direct their side chains to the convex side of the β-barrel, whereas the other residues direct their side chains toward the concave side of the β-barrel. Interestingly, the side chains of Thr-105, Met-107, Leu-114, and Ile-118 are located in close proximity to the binding site of PEGMME2000 found in the crystal structure, suggesting that decanoate and PEGMME2000 bind to LolB in a similar manner. Using isothermal titration calorimetry analyses, we determined the dissociation constant Kd of LolA for mLolB. The analysis revealed a Kd value of 30.7 × 10−6m and a stoichiometry of 1.1 mol mLolB/mol of LolA. These results indicate that LolA and mLolB can specifically interact with each other even in the absence of a lipoprotein. By using LolA uniformly labeled with 2H, 13C, and 15N ([13C/2H/5N]LolA) and mLolB labeled with 2H and 15N ([2H/15N]mLolB), we recorded 1H,15N TROSY spectra. The superimposed 1H,15N TROSY spectra of [13C/2H/5N]LolA (Fig. 3A) and [2H/15N]mLolB (Fig. 3B) with various amounts of the binding partner are shown. We previously established the backbone resonance assignments of [13C/2H/5N]LolA and [2H/15N]mLolB in their free states (13.Nakada S. Takahashi H. Sakakura M. Kurono M. Shimada I. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2007; 1: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 14.Nakada S. Sakakura M. Takahashi H. Tokuda H. Shimada I. Biomol. NMR. Assign. 2007; 1: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The backbone resonance assignments of [13C/2H/5N]LolA and [2H/15N]mLolB complexed with each binding partner were determined by following the chemical shift changes upon the titration of each binding partner. Triple-resonance experiments were also performed to confirm the assignments of the complexed forms. Of 175 non-proline residues in LolA and mLolB, 82 and 84% of the resonances originating from the backbone amide groups could be assigned in their bound states, respectively, although the other resonance assignments could not be established, mainly because of line-broadening upon the addition of the binding partner. Upon the addition of a 3-fold molar ratio of mLolB, 34 residues of LolA exhibited Δδwei of >0.3 ppm, and 20 residues of LolA showed Δδwei of 0.2–0.3 ppm (supplemental Table S2). In addition, the cross-peaks originating from 16 residues of LolA disappeared upon the addition of mLolB. Upon the addition of a 3-fold molar ratio of LolA, 12 residues of mLolB exhibited Δδwei of >0.3 ppm, and 9 residues of mLolB showed Δδwei of 0.2–0.3 ppm (supplemental Table S2). In addition, the cross-peaks originating from nine residues of mLolB disappeared upon the addition of LolA. To identify the residues located on the interface between LolA and mLolB in the complex, we used cross-saturation methods. Either LolA or mLolB labeled with 2H, 15N, and/or 13C was bound to its unlabeled binding partner. LolA/mLolB molecule-selective saturation was achieved by applying the radio frequency irradiation centered at 0.833 ppm, which corresponds to the CH2/CH3 protons within the non-labeled protein. Residue-selective signal intensity reductions were observed with an irradiation length of 2.0 s. Among the 131 analyzed signals originating from the main chain amide groups of LolA, three signals from Val-32, Gln-75, and Gln-145 exhibited intensity reduction ratios of >0.5, and signals from 25 residues showed intensity reduction ratios from 0.3 to 0.5 (Fig. 4A) (residue lists in supplemental Table S3). The residues affected by the saturation are indicated on the crystal structure of LolA (Fig. 4B). Most of the affected residues were located along the edge of the β-barrel. Specifically, the N-terminal ends of β-strands 2, 6, 9, and 11, the C-terminal ends of β-strands 1 and 10, the middle regions of β-strands 3 and 5, and all of β-strand 4 are involved in the LolB recognition. In addition to the affected β-barrel residues, 2 residues on α-helix 2, Leu-92 and Ala-94, exhibited remarkable signal intensity reductions, indicating that α-helix 2 is part of the mLolB binding surface. Among the affected residues, five acidic residues, Glu-34, Glu-56, Asp-146, Asp-147, and Asp-178, and one basic residue, Arg-149, are located along the edge of the β-barrel structure. Among the 123 analyzed signals originating from the main chain amide groups of mLolB, signals from 8 residues exhibited intensity reduction ratios of >0.5, and signals from 14 residues showed intensity reduction ratios from 0.3 to 0.5 (Fig. 5A) (residue lists are shown in supplemental Table S3). The affected residues are predominantly located on β-strands 1 and 2 and the loop connecting β-strands 5 and 6 (Fig. 5B). These residues are clustered in a limited area on the convex surface of the β-barrel of mLolB. The interfacial surface of mLolB includes six basic residues, whereas no acidic residue is present. Among the six basic residues, Arg-34, Lys-45, Arg-49, Arg-91, and Lys-177 are located on the β-strands. Lys-88 is located in the loop connecting β-strands 5 and 6. In contrast to LolA, the α-helices of mLolB in the complex are not affected, which indicates that the convex side of mLolB is involved in the interaction. To determine the relative orientations of LolA and mLolB, we introduced site-directed spin-labeling and performed PRE experiments. This technique provides distance information from the spin center up to 20–25 Å (27.Gillespie J.R. Shortle D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Spin labels were introduced at each of positions 24, 32, 58, 59, and 145 of LolA (Fig. 6A). The residues at these positions were identified as the interfacial residues by the cross-saturation method. The residues at positions 24, 32, and 145 are on the edge of the β-barrel. On the other hand, the residues at positions 58 and 59 are in the middle of the β-barrel. The side chain at position 58 is directed toward the convex side of the β-barrel, whereas the side chain at position 59 points toward the concave side of the β-barrel. We recorded the 1H,15N TROSY spectra of 15N-labeled mLolB complexed with LolA spin-labeled with MTSL in the presence and absence of a reducing agent, ascorbic acid, which reduces the spin-label agent covalently attached to each of the five positions of LolA. The chemical shifts of the amide resonances originating from mLolB complexed with each spin-labeled LolA in the reduced states were almost identical to those observed for mLolB complexed with the wild type LolA, suggesting that the cysteine mutations and the MTSL labeling for LolA exerted minimal influence on the conformations of LolA and mLolB and the binding mode between LolA and mLolB. We compared the signal intensities of the spectra with and without ascorbic acid. The mLolB residues that showed marked signal intensity reductions are mapped on the crystal structure (Figs. 6, B–F) (complete lists of affected residues are shown in supplemental Table S4). Upon complex formation with LolA spin-labeled at position 24, the backbone amide signals originating from 11 residues were broadened to undetectable levels. The signal intensities of six residues were remarkably reduced (intensity ratio <0.3) (Fig. 6B). Upon complex formation with LolA spin-labeled at position 32, the signals originating from 18 residues disappeared. The signals from seven residues showed reduced intensities (intensity ratio <0.3) (Fig. 6C). Upon complex formation with LolA spin-labeled at position 59, the signals originating from eight residues were broadened to undetectable levels. The signal intensity of one residue, Tyr-39 was reduced (intensity ratio <0.3) (Fig. 6E). Upon complex formation with LolA spin-labeled at position 145, the signals originating from 10 residues were broadened to undetectable levels. The signal intensities of seven residues were reduced (intensity ratio <0.3) (Fig. 6F). In contrast, upon complex formation with LolA spin-labeled at position 58, only one residue on mLolB, Tyr-47, displayed a weak signal intensity reduction (intensity ratio <0.3) (Fig. 6D). These selective signal intensity reductions suggest the spatial proximity of the affected mLolB residues to each spin-labeled position of LolA. The spin center at position 59, in the middle region of β-strand 4 of LolA, markedly affected the edge of the β-barrel of mLolB (Fig. 6E). On the other hand, the spin center located on the convex side at position 58 had only a minimal effect on mLolB (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that the concave side of the β-barrel of LolA interacts with mLolB. The spin centers at positions 24 and 32, located at the C-terminal end of β-strand 1, affected β-strands 1–4, 11, and 11′ of mLolB (Figs. 6, B and C). The spin center at position 145 at the C-terminal end of β-strand 10 of LolA affected β-strands 1–6 of mLolB (Fig. 6F). Therefore, the C-terminal end of β-strand 1 of LolA in the complex and the C-terminal end of β-strand 10 of LolA in the complex are located in close proximity to β-strand 1 and/or 2 of mLolB and to β-strand 3 and/or 4 of mLolB, respectively. None of the mLolB residues on α-helices 2 and 3, which reside on the concave face of the β-barrel, was affected by complex formation with the spin-labeled LolAs. Taken together, we concluded that the concave side of LolA interacts with the convex side of mLolB. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the lipoprotein translocation process requires the structural basis for the interactions between the Lol proteins. Toward this goal, we have undertaken NMR studies, including the cross-saturation and PRE experiments, aimed at the structural characterizations of the interaction between LolA/LolB and an analogue of acyl chains of lipoproteins, decanoate, and the interaction between LolA and LolB. Although it has been speculated that hydrophobic concave sides of LolA and LolB preferably accommodate the hydrophobic acyl chain part of lipoproteins, there was no evidence to confirm this speculation. The chemical shift perturbations of LolA and mLolB upon the addition of decanoate, which was used as an analog of the acyl chain of lipoproteins, revealed that decanoate binds to the concave sides of the Lol proteins. Therefore, LolA and mLolB recognize the acyl chains of lipoproteins by using the hydrophobic area of the concave sides of the molecules and some conformational changes of LolA and mLolB, as the crystal structures of both proteins show insufficient space for accommodating three acyl chains. The isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed that LolA and mLolB interact with each other even in the absence of a lipoprotein. It is likely that the LolA and mLolB molecules partially exist as the complexed form in vivo, although the biological significance of the complex remains unknown. The cross-saturation experiments successfully identified the binding site of mLolB to LolA. mLolB recognized LolA using the convex side of the molecule. However, the cross-saturation data did not provide sufficient information about the binding mode of LolA, as the assignments of LolA in the bound form could not be established completely, mainly because of the broadening of the signals from the flexible nature of LolA (see below). Therefore, to determine the binding mode between LolA and mLolB in detail, we further observed the PREs from LolA to mLolB. The introduction of MTSL to the concave side of LolA caused remarkable PREs to the convex side of mLolB (Fig. 6E), suggesting that the concave side of LolA is responsible for mLolB binding. Using the combination of the cross-saturation and PRE experiments, the interfacial residues in the LolA·mLolB complex and their relative orientations in the complex were identified. A central feature of the mLolB binding mode to LolA is that part of the concave side of the β-barrel of LolA is used for the binding of mLolB, and the remaining part is exposed to the solvent. The complete usage of the concave side of LolA for binding to mLolB is obstructed by α-helix 2, which serves as a plug. In contrast, the LolA binding site on mLolB is the convex side of the β-barrel, and no residue on three helices of mLolB was involved in the binding. The electrostatic potential mapping of each protein supports our concave-convex interaction mode. Interestingly, the electrostatic potential map of LolA revealed that the concave side is predominantly composed of negatively charged residues (circled in supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, the convex side of mLolB possesses positive charges. Therefore, it is most likely that the complementary electrostatic potential is responsible for the complex formation between LolA and mLolB. The photo-cross-linking experiments suggested that some residues that were identified by the preset study exhibited the high efficiency of the cross-linking (28.Okuda S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5877-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, these observations also support the interaction mode. It is impossible to make the LolA·mLolB complex model by using the currently available crystal structures because of steric hindrance. Therefore, either or both LolA/mLolB must undergo conformational changes upon complex formation. To gain insights into the conformational changes, we compared the results of the cross-saturation experiments with those of the chemical shift perturbation experiments. The weighted sum of the chemical shift changes of the backbone amide protons and nitrogen atoms of LolA and mLolB caused by binding to the binding partner are summarized (Figs. 7A and 8A).FIGURE 8Chemical shift changes of mLolB amide groups upon the addition of LolA and mapping of affected residues on the crystal structure.

The other residues that are assigned but unaffected are white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The residues that displayed the chemical shift perturbation upon complex formation are indicated on the crystal structures (Figs. 7B and 8B). The affected LolA residues are spread all over the β-barrel (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the residues of mLolB with the substantial chemical shift perturbations upon LolA binding were almost identical to the interfacial residues identified in the cross-saturation experiments (Figs. 5B and 8B). Considering the fact that the chemical shift perturbations reflect secondary effects, which are the effects of the conformational changes caused by binding as well as the direct effects of the binding, we conclude that LolA undergoes a conformational change of its β-barrel to an open form upon mLolB binding as represented in Fig. 9, whereas the structure of mLolB does not. We also observed a substantial difference in the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange rates of the amide groups between LolA and mLolB in the free state (supplemental “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. S4). This observation suggests that LolA exhibits higher plasticity than mLolB, supporting the conformational changes of LolA upon complex formation. Furthermore, we measured 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts of labeled LolA in the presence and absence of unlabeled mLolB. The small but substantial changes in the 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts of LolA were observed upon binding of mLolB (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that some conformational changes occur. In the LolA·mLolB binding mode suggested by the present study, a contiguous hydrophobic surface, which is composed of part of the concave side of LolA and mLolB, is generated upon complex formation. On the basis of the NMR analyses, we propose the following mechanism of lipoprotein transfer from LolA to LolB (Fig. 9). 1) LolA receives a lipoprotein from the Lol·CDE complex in the inner membrane. In the LolA-lipoprotein complex, LolA accommodates the acyl chains of the lipoprotein on its hydrophobic concave side and undergoes some conformational changes (29.Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25421-25427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30.Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). LolA then transports the lipoprotein from the inner to the outer membrane. 2) The LolA-lipoprotein complex interacts with LolB, which is anchored to the inner side of the outer membrane. In the LolA·LolB complex, the concave side of the β-barrel of LolA contacts with the convex side of the β-barrel of LolB. Accordingly, the hydrophobic insides of LolA and LolB are connected, and a hydrophobic tunnel-like structure is formed. 3) The acyl chains in LolA are smoothly transferred through the hydrophobic tunnel, from LolA to LolB. The driving force of the lipoprotein transfer from LolA to LolB might simply be the higher affinity of a lipoprotein for LolB than for LolA. Good evidence for this can be found in the previous study (31.Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). They revealed that an outer membrane-directed lipoprotein, Pal, forms a tighter complex with mLolB than with LolA. Therefore, the difference in the affinities between LolA and LolB is responsible for the lipoprotein transfer in the complex. Although several fatty acid-protein interactions have been investigated based on the structural analysis (32.Hamilton J.A. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2004; 43: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), only limited structural information about protein-protein or protein-membrane interactions involving the fatty acid-binding proteins has been available. Our clarification of the interactions between the lipoprotein-binding proteins may provide new insights into these aspects of fatty acid-interacting proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2076619153,"Background During the first trimester of pregnancy, HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission is relatively rare despite the permissivity of placental cells to cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection. The placenta interacts directly with maternal uterine cells (decidual cells) but the physiological role of the decidua in the control of HIV-1 transmission and whether decidua could be a source of infected cells is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings To answer to this question, decidual mononuclear cells were exposed to HIV-1 in vitro. Decidual cells were shown to be more susceptible to infection by an R5 HIV-1, as compared to an X4 HIV-1. Infected cells were identified by flow cytometry analysis. The results showed that CD14+ cells were the main targets of HIV-1 infection in the decidua. These infected CD14+ cells expressed DC-SIGN, CD11b, CD11c, the Fc gamma receptor CD16, CD32 and CD64, classical MHC class-I and class-II and maturation and activation molecules CD83, CD80 and CD86. The permissivity of decidual tissue was also evaluated by histoculture. Decidual tissue was not infected by X4 HIV-1 but was permissive to R5 HIV-1. Different profiles of infection were observed depending on tissue localization. Conclusions/Significance The presence of HIV-1 target cells in the decidua in vitro and the low rate of in utero mother-to-child transmission during the first trimester of pregnancy suggest that a natural control occurs in vivo limiting cell-to-cell infection of the placenta and consequently infection of the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W2169378195,"Background HIV-infected persons suffering from tuberculosis experience high mortality. No programmatic studies from India have documented the delivery of mortality-reducing interventions, such as cotrimoxazole prophylactic treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). To guide TB-HIV policy in India we studied the effectiveness of delivering CPT and ART to HIV-infected persons treated for tuberculosis in three districts in Andhra Pradesh, India, and evaluated factors associated with death. Methods and Findings We retrospectively abstracted data for all HIV-infected tuberculosis patients diagnosed from March 2007 through August 2007 using standard treatment outcome definitions. 734 HIV-infected tuberculosis patients were identified; 493 (67%) were males and 569 (80%) were between the ages of 24–44 years. 710 (97%) initiated CPT, and 351 (50%) collected >60% of their monthly cotrimoxazole pouches provided throughout TB treatment. Access to ART was documented in 380 (51%) patients. Overall 130 (17%) patients died during TB treatment. Patients receiving ART were less likely to die (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3–0.6), while males and those with pulmonary TB were more likely to die (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.7, and HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2 respectively). Conclusions Among HIV-infected TB patients in India death was common despite the availability of free cotrimoxazole locally and ART from referral centres. Death was strongly associated with the absence of ART during TB treatment. To minimize death, programmes should promote high levels of ART uptake and closely monitor progress in implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2046857042,"Background The very recent availability of fully sequenced individual human genomes is a major revolution in biology which is certainly going to provide new insights into genetic diseases and genomic rearrangements. Results We mapped the insertions, deletions and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are present in Craig Venter's genome, more precisely on chromosomes 17 to 22, and compared them with the human reference genome hg17. Our results show that insertions and deletions are almost absent in L1 and generally scarce in L2 isochore families (GC-poor L1+L2 isochores represent slightly over half of the human genome), whereas they increase in GC-rich isochores, largely paralleling the densities of genes, retroviral integrations and Alu sequences. The distributions of insertions/deletions are in striking contrast with those of SNPs which exhibit almost the same density across all isochore families with, however, a trend for lower concentrations in gene-rich regions. Conclusions Our study strongly suggests that the distribution of insertions/deletions is due to the structure of chromatin which is mostly open in gene-rich, GC-rich isochores, and largely closed in gene-poor, GC-poor isochores. The different distributions of insertions/deletions and SNPs are clearly related to the two different responsible mechanisms, namely recombination and point mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2056078845,"Management of human teeth has moved from a surgical to a more conservative approach of inhibiting or preventing lesion progression. Increasing enamel mineralization is crucial in this regard. A potential difficulty is the preferential mineralization of the outermost portion of the enamel that can prevent overall mineralization. We describe a strategy for increasing the mineralization potential of dental enamel.Extracted human premolar teeth enamel (n = 5) were exposed to a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide with an energizing source. Samples were stored in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 1 wk. A desktop X-ray micro-CT system was used to evaluate the mineral density of samples. Mineral distribution was polarized between the lower and the higher mineralized portion of enamel by charged oxygen free radicals due to activation of permeated hydrogen peroxide. The kinetics of energy absorption in the deeper enamel region demonstrated improvement of preferential mineralization into the region without restricting overall mineralization of the enamel. Subsequent increasing mineralization, even in the dense mineralized outer portion of enamel, was also achieved.This increased mineralization may promote resistance to acidic deterioration of the structure. The present study is one of the primary steps towards the development of novel application in reparative and restorative dentistry."
https://openalex.org/W2134310105,"Background α-Dystroglycan is a negatively charged glycoprotein that covers the apical and basolateral membrane of the podocyte. Its transmembrane binding to the cytoskeleton is regulated via tyrosine phosphorylation (pY892) of β-dystroglycan. At the basolateral side α-dystroglycan binds the glomerular basement membrane. At the apical membrane, it plays a role in the maintenance of the filtration slit. In this study, we evaluated whether ligation of α-dystroglycan with specific antibodies or natural ligands induces intracellular signaling, and whether there is an effect on podocyte architecture. Methodology/Principal Findings Conditionally immortalized podocytes were exposed in vitro to antibodies to α-dystroglycan, and to fibronectin, biglycan, laminin and agrin. Intracellular calcium fluxes, phosphorylation of β-dystroglycan and podocyte architecture were studied. Antibodies to α-dystroglycan could specifically induce calcium signaling. Fibronectin also induced calcium signaling, and led to dephosphorylation of pY892 in β-dystroglycan. Ligation of α-dystroglycan resulted in an altered actin architecture, a decreased number of podocyte pedicles and a more flattened appearance of the podocyte. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that ligation of α-dystroglycan on podocytes induces intracellular calcium signaling, which leads to an altered cytoskeleton architecture akin to the situation of foot process effacement. In particular the ability of fibronectin to induce intracellular signaling events is of interest, since the expression and excretion of this protein is upregulated in several proteinuric diseases. Therefore, fibronectin-induced signaling via dystroglycan may be a novel mechanism for foot process effacement in proteinuric diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2108830140,"Cardiac arrest caused by startling stimuli, such as visual and vibration stimuli, has been reported in some animals and could be considered as an extraordinary case of bradycardia and defined as reversible missed heart beats. Variability of the heart rate is established as a balance between an autonomic system, namely cholinergic vagus inhibition, and excitatory adrenergic stimulation of neural and hormonal action in teleost. However, the cardiac arrest and its regulating nervous mechanism remain poorly understood. We show, by using electrocardiogram (ECG) data loggers, that cardiac arrest occurs in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) at the moment of gamete release for 7.39±1.61 s in females and for 5.20±0.97 s in males. The increase in heart rate during spawning behavior relative to the background rate during the resting period suggests that cardiac arrest is a characteristic physiological phenomenon of the extraordinarily high heart rate during spawning behavior. The ECG morphological analysis showed a peaked and tall T-wave adjacent to the cardiac arrest, indicating an increase in potassium permeability in cardiac muscle cells, which would function to retard the cardiac action potential. Pharmacological studies showed that the cardiac arrest was abolished by injection of atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, revealing that the cardiac arrest is a reflex response of the parasympathetic nerve system, although injection of sotalol, a β-adrenergic antagonist, did not affect the cardiac arrest. We conclude that cardiac arrest during gamete release in spawning release in spawning chum salmon is a physiological reflex response controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system. This cardiac arrest represents a response to the gaping behavior that occurs at the moment of gamete release."
