https://openalex.org/W2016568386,"Each of six peptides derived from the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor very closely matches a part of the deduced sequence of the v-erb-B transforming protein of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV). In all, the peptides contain 83 amino acid residues, 74 of which are shared with v-erb-B. The AEV progenitor may have acquired the cellular gene sequences of a truncated EGF receptor (or closely related protein) lacking the external EGF-binding domain but retaining the transmembrane domain and a domain involved in stimulating cell proliferation. Transformation of cells by AEV may result, in part, from the inappropriate acquisition of a truncated EGF receptor from the c-erb-B gene."

https://openalex.org/W1601256941,"The gene coding for protein A from Staphylococcus aureus has been isolated by molecular cloning, and a subclone containing an 1.8-kilobase insert was found to give a functional protein A in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the insert, including the structural gene and the 5' and 3' flanking sequences, has been determined. Starting from a TTG initiator codon, an open reading frame comprising 1527 nucleotides gives a preprotein of 509 amino acids and a predicted Mr = 58,703. The structural gene is flanked on both sides by palindromic structures followed by a stretch of T residues, suggesting transcriptional termination signals. Thus, it appears that protein A is translated from a monocistronic mRNA. The sequence reveals extensive internal homologies involving a 58-amino acid unit, responsible for IgG binding, repeated 5 times and an 8-amino acid unit, possibly responsible for binding to the cell wall of S. aureus, repeated 12 times. Comparisons between the repeated regions show a marked preference for silent mutations, indicating an evolutionary pressure to keep the amino acid sequence preserved. The structure of the gene also suggests how the gene has evolved."

https://openalex.org/W2055170574,"Neurons process and transmit information in the form of electrical signals. Their electrical excitability is due to the presence of voltage-sensitive ion channels in the neuronal plasma membrane. In recent years, the voltage-sensitive sodium channel of mammalian brain has become the first of these important neuronal components to be studied at the molecular level. This article describes the distribution of sodium channels among the functional compartments of the neuron and reviews work leading to the identification, purification, and characterization of this membrane glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1653329430,"A procedure is described for purification of the sodium channel 1380-fold from rat brain to essential homogeneity. The channel is solubilized in Triton X-100 and stabilized by addition of phosphatidylcholine and 10 mM CaCl2. It is purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, hydroxylapatite, and wheat germ agglutinin/Sepharose followed by sedimentation through sucrose gradients. The final preparation binds 2910 pmol of saxitoxin (STX)/mg of protein or 0.9 mol of STX/mol of sodium channel of Mr approximately 316,000. Three polypeptide subunits comprise 90% of the silver stain intensity on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels of the pure protein and migrate as a stoichiometric complex coincident with STX-binding activity in sucrose gradient sedimentation: alpha with Mr approximately 260,000, beta 1 with Mr approximately 39,000, and beta 2 with Mr approximately 37,000. The alpha subunit, both purified and in intact synaptosomes, is shown to behave anomalously during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis exhibiting an unusually high extrapolated electrophoretic free mobility. A subunit stoichiometry of alpha 1(beta 1)1(beta 2)1 is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1678580492,"Bacteriophage P1 encodes a site-specific recombination system that consists of a site (loxP) at which recombination occurs and a gene, cre, whose protein product is essential for recombination. The loxP-Cre recombination event can be studied in greater detail by the use of an in vitro system that efficiently carries out recombination between two loxP sites. This paper presents a purification and characterization of the Cre protein (Mr = 35,000), which is the only protein required for the in vitro reaction. No high energy cofactors are needed. The purified Cre protein binds to loxP-containing DNA and makes complexes that are resistant to heparin. Cre efficiently converts 70% of the DNA substrate to products and appears to act stoichiometrically. The action of Cre on a loxP2 supercoiled substrate containing two directly repeated loxP sites results in product molecules that are topologically unlinked. Several models to account for the ability of Cre to produce free supercoiled products are discussed."

Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography was used to separate, detect, and isolate several metabolites. Three metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatography as 1,2-cis- and trans-2,7-diamino-1-hydroxymitosene and 2,7-diaminomitosene. Three metabolites were phosphate-dependent, and two of them were identified to be 1,2-cis- and trans-2,7-diaminomitosene 1-phosphate. The amounts of the five identified metabolites generated during the reduction of mitomycin C varied with pH and nucleophile concentration. At pH 6.5, 2,7-diaminomitosene was essentially the only metabolite formed, whereas from pH 6.8 to 8.0, trans- and cis-2,7-diamino-1-hydroxymitosene increased in quantity as 2,7-diaminomitosene decreased. The disappearance of mitomycin C and the production of metabolites were enzyme and mitomycin C concentration-dependent. Substrate saturation was not reached for either enzyme up to 5 mM mitomycin C. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies demonstrated the formation of mitomycin C radical anion as an intermediate during enzymatic activation. Our results indicate that either enzyme catalyzed the initial activation of mitomycin C to a radical anion intermediate. Subsequent spontaneous reactions, including the elimination of methanol and the opening of the aziridine ring, generate one active center at C-1 which facilitates nucleophilic attack. Simultaneous generation of two reactive centers was not observed. All five primary metabolites were metabolized further by either flavoenzyme. The secondary metabolites exhibited similar changes in their absorbance spectra and were unlike the primary metabolites, suggesting that a second alkylating center other than C-1 was generated during secondary activation. We propose that secondary activation of monofunctionally bound mitomycin C is probably a main route for the bifunctional binding of mitomycin C to macromolecules and that the cytotoxic actions of mitomycin C result from multiple metabolic activations and reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2075615473,"Cell-free conditioned media from human T cells transformed by human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV-I) were tested for the production of soluble biologically active factors, including several known lymphokines. The cell lines used were established from patients with T-cell leukemia-lymphoma and from human umbilical cord blood and bone marrow leukocytes transformed by HTLV-I in vitro. All of the cell lines liberated constitutively one or more of the 12 biological activities assayed. These included macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF), leukocyte migration enhancing factor (MEF), macrophage activating factor (MAF), differentiation inducing factor (DIF), colony stimulating factor (CSF), eosinophil growth and maturation activity (eos. GMA), fibroblast activating factor (FAF), gamma-interferon and, in rare instances, T-cell growth factor (TCGF). Some cell lines produced interleukin 3 (IL-3), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or B-cell growth factors (BCGF). Such cells should prove useful for the production of lymphokines and as sources of specific messenger RNA's for their genetic cloning."
https://openalex.org/W1581304111,"The volume of aqueous solvent present during subcellular fractionation of mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cells influences the distribution of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) receptors between the nuclear and cytosolic fractions. When the effects of dilution are minimized, at least 80% of the receptors associate with nuclei. The receptors bind relatively strongly to nuclei, as measured by their release by KCl. TCDD-receptor complexes bind more strongly to nuclei than do unoccupied receptors. A temperature-dependent event further enhances the binding of TCDD-receptor complexes to nuclei. A class of variant cells contains receptors which bind relatively weakly to nuclei; this defect accounts for the variant phenotype. We conclude that, in the intact cell, TCDD receptors are located within the nucleus and that the temperature-dependent event in the induction of cytochrome P1-450 gene expression is one which strengthens the binding of the TCDD-receptor complex to chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1548593517,"Apolipoprotein (apo-) E2 and beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) (which were isolated from type III hyperlipoproteinemic subjects) both demonstrated defective binding to apo-E and apo-B,E receptors on dog liver membranes and to apo-B,E low density lipoproteins (LDL) receptors on fibroblasts. The defective binding activity of the apo-E2 and beta-VLDL varied from very poor to nearly normal. The ability of the beta-VLDL to interact with hepatic apo-E receptors was enhanced by the addition of normal apo-E3 to the beta-VLDL. Furthermore, cysteamine treatment of the apo-E2 in beta-VLDL enhanced binding of the beta-VLDL to both apo-E and apo-B,E receptors. The importance of apo-E in mediating the receptor binding of beta-VLDL to these receptors was confirmed by using monoclonal antibodies. The residual binding activity of beta-VLDL to apo-E and apo-B,E receptors was inhibited by greater than 90% with anti-apo-E, while the addition of anti-apo-B had little effect. The apo-B in the beta-VLDL was capable of binding to apo-B,E receptors after the hydrolysis of the beta-VLDL triglycerides with milk lipoprotein lipase. Lipase treatment yielded, two subfractions of beta-VLDL. One fraction (d = 1.02 to 1.03 g/ml) was enriched with apo-B100; the other fraction (d less than 1.006 g/ml) was enriched with apo-B48 and apo-E2. Significantly increased amounts of the apo-B100-enriched fraction bound to apo-B,E receptors. Inhibition of this binding caused by the addition of anti-apo-B indicated that the binding activity of this subfraction was mediated by apo-B100. The apo-B48-enriched fraction did not show a significant increase in receptor binding, suggesting that apo-B48 does not bind to these receptors. In a control experiment, it was shown that triglyceride-rich VLDL, which contain normal apo-E3 and apo-B100, bind significantly to both liver apo-E receptors and fibroblast apo-B,E receptors. This binding activity was inhibited by greater than 90% with anti-apo-E. Lipase hydrolysis of the VLDL did not further enhance their receptor-binding activity. These results demonstrate that apo-E, and not apo-B, is the major determinant mediating the receptor-binding activity of cholesterol-rich beta-VLDL and triglyceride-rich VLDL."
https://openalex.org/W1551647197,"The antimycin-sensitive ubisemiquinone radical (QC) of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase of submitochondrial particles and chromatophores of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides Ga has been studied by a combination of redox potentiometry and EPR spectroscopy. This g = 2.005 radical signal appears at physiological pH values and increases in intensity with increasing pH up to pH 7.6 in submitochondrial particles and pH 9.0 in R. sphaeroides after which its intensity remains unchanged. The Em7 (ubiquinone/quinol) of the signal, estimated from redox titration data is 80 mV for submitochondrial particles, and 150 mV in chromatophores. Each of these values is higher than that of the quinone pool by 20 mV in submitochondrial particles and 60 mV in R. sphaeroides. This indicates that the quinone at the binding site is out of equilibrium with the pool, and that binding site preferentially binds quinol over quinone. Analysis of the shapes of the semiquinone titration curves, taken together with the midpoint elevation, indicates a quinone-binding site: cytochrome c1 stoichiometry of 1:1 in both submitochondrial particles and chromatophores. At its maximal intensity, the semiquinone concentration at the binding site is 0.26 in submitochondrial particles (greater than pH 7.6) and 0.4 in chromatophores (greater than pH 9.0). In both systems, the midpoint of the ubiquinone/ubisemiquinone couple is constant as the pH is raised up to the pH of maximal semiquinone formation whereafter it becomes more negative at the rate of -60 mV/pH unit. The midpoint of the ubisemiquinone/quinol couple, on the other hand, varies by -120 mV/pH unit at pH values up to the transition pH, after which it, too, changes by -60 mV/pH unit. This seemingly anomalous behavior may be explained by invoking a protonated group at or near the quinone-binding site whose pK corresponds to the pH transition point in the quinone/semiquinone/quinol redox chemistry when the site is free or when quinone or quinol occupies the site. This pK is elevated to at least pH 9.0 in submitochondrial particles and 10.5 in R. sphaeroides when semiquinone is bound to the site."

https://openalex.org/W1517351575,"The ability of negative supercoiling to induce a left-handed helix in the recombinant plasmid pRW777, which contains a tract of 64 base pairs of almost perfect (dT-dG) . (dC-dA) from the mouse kappa immunoglobin gene, was studied. S1 nuclease recognizes and cleaves within the junction region which must exist adjacent to the (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA)n tract when in a left-handed state. The cleavage pattern indicates conformational flexibility and structural differences between the two existing junctions. The 64-base pair alternating copolymer undergoes the supercoil-induced formation of a left-handed state over the superhelical density range of -0.04 to -0.06, indicating that (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA) sequences form a left-handed helix less readily than (dC-dG)n . (dC-dG)n sequences of equivalent length. However, these supercoil densities are within the range found in vivo. Supercoil relaxation and antibody binding studies confirmed that the (dT-dG)n . (dC-dA)n tract in supercoiled pRW777 was in a left-handed helix."
https://openalex.org/W1508738567,"The triphosphate of 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG) competitively inhibits incorporation of dGTP into DNA catalyzed by DNA polymerases specified by both type 1 and type 2 herpes simplex virus. K1 values were estimated to be 33 nM for type 1 and 46 nM for type 2-specified DNA polymerase. DHPG acted as an alternate substrate to dGTP for the virus-specified DNA polymerase. Incorporation of DHPG into DNA resulted in the slowing down of the rate of DNA synthesis. The position of DHPG incorporation was analyzed, and it was found to enter both internal and terminal linkages. DNA which contained DHPG at termini was found to competitively inhibit utilization of activated DNA as primer. DNA polymerase alpha and DNA polymerases from several phosphonoformic acid-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 strains were examined for sensitivity to 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine triphosphate. A lack of correlation between the in vivo sensitivities of the virus mutants and the K1 values of the DNA polymerases was noted."
https://openalex.org/W1553693448,"The rat brain Na+ channel was purified to homogeneity and reconstituted into pure egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles or vesicles composed of a mixture of egg phosphatidylcholine and rat brain lipid. In each case, the binding affinities at 37 degrees C for saxitoxin (STX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) are nearly identical with those measured for intact Na+ channels. Approximately 50% of the reconstituted channels are oriented right-side-out. Veratridine stimulates the initial rate of 22Na+ uptake 8- to 15-fold with a K0.5 of 28 microM. External TTX blocks the fraction of Na+ channels oriented right-side-out with a Ki of 14 nM. All of the veratridine-stimulated 22Na+ uptake is blocked when TTX is present on both sides of the vesicle membrane, or when tetracaine is added to the external medium. The veratridine-activated reconstituted Na+ channel transports cations with a permeability ratio of PNa+/PRb+/PCa+ = 1.0:0.25:0.12. We estimate that at least 30% and perhaps as many as 70% of the reconstituted channels are active. Purified sodium channels reconstituted in egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles do not bind 125I-scorpion toxin (125I-LqTx). In contrast, when incorporated into vesicles containing rat brain lipids, 76% of the Na+ channels bound 125I-LqTx with an average KD of 80 nM. Thermal denaturation of purified Na+ channels at 36 degrees C prior to reconstitution causes a parallel loss of both the [3H]STX- and 125I-LqTx-binding activity measured after reconstitution. Sea anemone toxin II displaces bound 125I-LqTx with a KD 60-fold greater than that of unlabeled LqTx. These data indicate that the alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 subunits of the sodium channel are sufficient for reconstitution of both selective, veratridine-stimulated ion transport and 125I-LqTx binding."
https://openalex.org/W1483539527,"Chromatin-bound ADP-ribosyltransferase from adult hen liver nuclei was purified to a homogeneous state through salt extraction, gel filtration, hydroxyapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, Cm-cellulose, and DNA-Sepharose. The ADP-ribosyltransferase has a pH optimum at 9.0 and does not require DNA for reaction. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 27,500 +/- 500. Agmatine sulfate, arginine methyl ester, histones, and casein proved to be effective acceptors for the ADP-ribose molecule. Among histones, H3 was most active, followed by H2a, H4, and H2b, in that order, the lowest activity seen with H1. With all the acceptors tested, the rate of nicotinamide release was in excess of the ADP-ribosylation. However, changes in the ratio of nicotinamide release to ADP-ribosylation seemed to depend on concentrations of the acceptor used. ADP-ribose-whole histones X adducts formed by ADP-ribosyltransferase served as initiators for poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis when these adducts were incubated in the presence of NAD, DNA, Mg2+, and the purified poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, in which poly(ADP-ribose) formation can occur."

https://openalex.org/W1557172514,"Taking advantage of overproduction of the uvrD protein in cells that harbor multicopy plasmids carrying the uvrD gene, we have purified protein to physical homogeneity. The purified protein possesses single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA unwinding activities, and both activities are equally inactivated by antibodies raised against DNA helicase II. Molecular weight (75,000) and chromatographic properties of the uvrD protein are also similar to those of DNA helicase II and DNA-dependent ATPase I (Richet, E., and Kohiyama, M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 808-812; Abdel-Monem, M., Durwald, H., and Hoffmann-Berling, H. (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 79, 39-45). Thus, it is concluded that the uvrD protein is identical with DNA helicase II and DNA-dependent ATPase I. Expression of the uvrD gene, as assayed by DNA-dependent ATPase activity, was stimulated by exposure of bacteria to nalidixic acid or mitomycin C. No increase in ATPase activity was observed with recA mutant cells, although basic levels of DNA-dependent ATPase activity in recA+ and recA- strains were almost the same. Thus, the uvrD gene is constitutively expressed but also regulated in a recA-dependent fashion."

https://openalex.org/W1587318143,"Abstract The addition of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to serum-starved quiescent Reuber H35 hepatoma cells results in a rapid 5- to 11-fold increase in the incorporation of 32Pi into a Mr = 32,000 ribosomal protein. The Mr = 32,000 protein was the major phosphorylated protein extracted from isolated 80 S ribosomes and was identified as the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 based upon its migration in two-dimensional gels. Insulin, which has been demonstrated to increase the phosphorylation of S6 in a number of cell lines, caused a 10- to 20-fold increase in the incorporation of 32Pi into this Mr = 32,000 ribosomal protein. S6 phosphorylation was dose- and time-dependent being detected as early as 5 min following the addition of 1.6 microM TPA. Maximal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 was achieved by 60 min and remained elevated for at least 90 min in the presence of TPA. The 50% effective dose for TPA was estimated to be 0.14 microM. Based upon the altered migration of S6 in pH 8.5 urea-polyacrylamide gels, it was demonstrated that the increased 32Pi labeling of S6 by TPA was due to a net increase in the incorporation of phosphates into the S6 molecule. Non-tumor-promoting phorbol esters were ineffective in increasing the phosphorylation of S6. In whole cells, exogenously added 1 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate failed to substantially increase phosphorylation of S6 suggesting that the TPA-induced phosphorylation of S6 occurs via a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism. The S6 amino acid residue phosphorylated in response to TPA was phosphoserine. A possible role for protein kinase C in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1609685783,"Mono[125I]iodoapamin bound to specific sites on cultured rat embryonic neurons. The dissociation constant for the receptor-neurotoxin complex measured at equilibrium was 60-120 pM at pH 7.2 and 4 degrees C, with a maximal binding capacity of 3-8 fmol/mg of cell protein. Apamin inhibited calcium ionophore-induced 86Rb+ release from cell cultures. The dose effect curve for this pharmacological test corresponded closely to the displacement of 125I-apamin by native apamin in binding experiments. Formation of the 125I-apamin receptor complex requires exogenous K+. Reduced binding in the absence of K+ was due to diminished binding capacity rather than a lower affinity. The apamin receptor seems to be associated with a cell surface K+ site which shows 50% occupancy at 1.6 mM, and which could be involved in the regulation of channel activity. Apamin sites were present at the earliest developmental stage tested and their number did not evolve during 8 days in culture. In the same period, however, alpha-scorpion toxin binding increased by a factor of 10. The ontogenesis of Ca2+-activated K+ channels does not seem to occur in parallel with that of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels."

https://openalex.org/W1522809555,"Abstract gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most common inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, acts by increasing the conductance of the neuronal membrane to chloride ions. The addition of GABA to monolayer cultures of chick cerebral neurons produced a 3-fold increase in the uptake of 36Cl-. This stimulation was maximal during the first 20 s after GABA addition but declined rapidly thereafter. The GABA-dependent uptake activity was doubled by increasing the external K+ concentration from 5.5 to 40 mM. The dependence of the 36Cl- entry rate on the external concentrations of GABA (K0.5 = 6 microM; Vmax = 4.4 nmol/mg of cell protein/s) and Cl-(Km = 105 mM; Vmax = 9.9 nmol mg-1 s-1) followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The GABA analog, muscimol, produced a similar response (K0.5 = 8 microM; Vmax = 5.2 nmol mg-1 s-1). While 50 microM 3-aminopropane sulfonate also stimulated 36Cl- uptake, 2,4-diaminobutyrate, taurine, and glycine were without effect. Bicuculline (Ki = 3.5 microM) was a noncompetitive inhibitor of GABA-dependent Cl- entry, while the inhibition by picrotoxin (Ki = 1.0 microM) was uncompetitive with GABA. Nearly one-half of the basal activity, observed in the absence of GABA, was blocked by the anion transport inhibitors, furosemide or 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene sulfonate, but these compounds gave no significant inhibition of the GABA-dependent activity. These results indicate that the basal route for 36Cl- entry into cerebral neurons involves electroneutral processes while the GABA-dependent influx occurs via specific ligand-gated Cl-channels."
https://openalex.org/W1529855698,"We have studied the subcellular localization of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases in rat caudal epididymal sperm. Our studies indicated that a large fraction of the cAMP-binding activity (approximately 60%), as well as a significant portion of the catalytic activity (approximately 40%), remained associated with insoluble material after the plasma membrane was extracted with 1% Triton X-100. Only 15% of the cAMP-binding activity in sperm was membrane bound. To explore the possibility of a surface location for the membrane-associated cAMP-binding proteins, whole sperm were subjected to proteolysis. Sperm treated with alpha-chymotrypsin lost cAMP-binding activity in cytoplasmic, detergent-soluble, and detergent-resistant fractions. These results demonstrate that alpha-chymotrypsin had access to intracellular locations and to all of the cAMP-binding proteins in sperm. Photoaffinity labeling studies using 8-azido-[32P]cAMP suggest that the regulatory subunit (R) present in the membrane was predominantly RI, while the major species present in the cytoplasm and on detergent-resistant structures was RII. Detergent-resistant sperm structures could be depleted of endogenous catalytic activity by the addition of cAMP, and cAMP-dependent kinase activity could be subsequently regained by the addition of bovine heart catalytic subunits. Separation of head and tailpieces showed that the detergent-resistant regulatory subunits were almost exclusively located on the tailpiece. This finding is consistent with the involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinases in sperm motility."
https://openalex.org/W1564279375,"A rapid method for purifying glycogen synthase a from rat liver was developed and the enzyme was tested as a substrate for nine different protein kinases, six of which were isolated from rat liver. The enzyme was phosphorylated on a 17-kDa CNBr fragment to approximately 1 phosphate/87-kDa subunit by phosphorylase b kinase from muscle or liver with a decrease in the activity ratio (-Glc-6-P/+Glc-6-P) from 0.95 to 0.6. Calmodulin-dependent glycogen synthase kinase from rabbit liver produced a similar phosphorylation pattern, but a smaller activity change. The catalytic subunit of beef heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase incorporated greater than 1 phosphate/subunit initially into a 17-kDa CNBr peptide and then into a 27-30-kDa CNBr peptide, with an activity ratio decrease to 0.5. Glycogen synthase kinases 3, 4, and 5 and casein kinase 1 were purified from rat liver. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 rapidly phosphorylated liver glycogen synthase to 1.5 phosphate/subunit with incorporation of phosphate into 3 CNBr peptides and a decrease in the activity ratio to 0.3. Glycogen synthase kinase 4 produced a pattern of phosphorylation and inactivation of liver synthase which was very similar to that caused by phosphorylase b kinase. Glycogen synthase kinase 5 incorporated 1 phosphate/subunit into a 24-kDa CNBr peptide, but did not alter the activity of the synthase. Casein kinase 1 phosphorylated and inactivated liver synthase with incorporation of phosphate into a 24-kDa CNBr peptide. This kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 4 were more active against muscle glycogen synthase. Calcium-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase from brain phosphorylated liver and muscle glycogen synthase on 17- and 27-kDa CNBr peptides, respectively. However, there was no change in the activity ratio of either enzyme. The following conclusions are drawn. 1) Liver glycogen synthase a is subject to multiple site phosphorylation. 2) Phosphorylation of some sites does not per se control activity of the enzyme under the assay conditions used. 3) Liver contains most, if not all, of the protein kinases active on glycogen synthase previously identified in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1595095757,"The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase appears to be the only enzyme catalyzing the formation and hydrolysis of Fru-2,6-P2. The enzyme as we isolate it, contains a trace of tightly bound Fru-6-P. In this condition, it exhibited an ATPase activity comparable to its kinase activity. Inorganic phosphate stimulated all of its activities, by increasing the affinity for all substrates and increasing the Vmax of ATP and Fru-2,6-P2 hydrolysis. The enzyme catalyzed ADP/ATP and Fru-6-P/Fru-2,6-P2 exchanges at rates comparable to net reaction rates. It was phosphorylated by both [gamma-32P]ATP and [2-32P] Fru-2,6-P2, and the label from either donor was chased by either unlabeled donor, showing that the bound phosphate is hydrolyzed if not transferred to an acceptor ligand. The rate of labeling of the enzyme by [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 was 2 orders of magnitude greater than the maximal velocity of the bisphosphatase and therefore sufficiently fast to be a step in the hydrolysis. Both inorganic phosphate and Fru-6-P increased the rate and steady state of enzyme phosphorylation by ATP. Fru-2,6-P2 inhibited the ATPase and kinase reactions and Fru-6-P inhibited the Fru-2,6 bisphosphatase reaction while ATP and ADP had no effect. Removal of the trace of Fru-6-P by Glu-6-P isomerase and Glu-6-P dehydrogenase reduced enzyme phosphorylation by ATP to very low levels, greatly inhibited the ATPase, and rendered it insensitive to Pi, but did not affect ADP/ATP exchange. (alpha + beta)Methylfructofuranoside-6-P did not increase the rate or steady state labeling by ATP. These results suggest that labeling of the enzyme by ATP involved the production of [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 from the trace Fru-6-P. The 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, and ATP/ADP exchange were all inhibited by diethylpyrocarbonate, suggesting the involvement of histidine residues in all three reactions. These results can be most readily explained in terms of two catalytic sites, a kinase site whose phosphorylation by ATP is negligible (or whose E-P is labile) and a Fru-2,6 bisphosphatase site which is readily phosphorylated by Fru-2,6-P2."

First, sedimentation equilibrium analysis using 0.2% SDS or 1% deoxycholate containing buffer as solvents yielded a point weight average molecular weight exclusive of bound detergent of 0.9 to 1.3 X 10(6) and a weight average molecular weight of all poly(C9) complexes of 1,050,000 +/- 40,000 (S.D.). SDS and deoxycholate binding to poly(C9) was measured in an air-driven ultracentrifuge and was determined to be 0.53 +/- 0.065 (S.D.) g of SDS and 0.26 +/- 0.015 (S.D.) g of deoxycholate/g of poly(C9), respectively. Second, the mass of 27 S poly(C9) devoid of bound detergent was determined by electron scattering of unstained specimens in the scanning transmission electron microscope. The molecular weight obtained by this method was 1,078,000 +/- 194,000. The inner diameter of poly(C9) tubules imaged in top view projections by negative staining electron microscopy varied between 9 and 12 mm. The accumulated data suggest a true heterogeneity of the molecular weight of poly(C9) due to polymers with varying protomer numbers. Using a mean value of 73,500 for the molecular weight of monomeric C9, the protomer number of poly(C9) tubules appear to vary between 12 and 18 C9 subunits. Approximately 50-75% of the tubules have 14 to 16 subunits as deduced from the mass distribution determined by electron scattering and from ring size measurements. It is suggested that poly(C9) tubules with various protomer numbers may arise due to limited flexibility in the C9-C9 interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1558747066,"Abstract 2',5'-oligoadenylates can be assayed sensitively in cell extracts by use of an antiserum having maximum specificity for any compound containing the moiety -pA2'pA2'pA-. These compounds reached high concentrations (25-2000 nM) in monkey CV-1 cells after infection with simian virus 40 (SV40) and treatment with human leukocyte interferon. The levels were highest late in infection and increased in parallel with the accumulation of SV40 late messenger RNAs. Alone, neither interferon nor SV40 caused the 2',5'-oligoadenylate concentrations to increase above the levels present in untreated CV-1 cells, 3 nM or less. Analyses by high performance liquid chromatography revealed little or no (p)pp(A2'p)2A or (p)pp(A2'p)3A, and the extracts showed only very low activity in functional assays with ppp(A2'p)nA-dependent nucleases, equivalent to 3 nM ppp(A2'p)3A or less. Some of the 2',5'-oligoadenylates eluted in the positions of the nonphosphorylated cores, (A2'p)nA, and a substantial fraction was found in several peaks intermediate between ppp(A2'p)3A and cores. The positions of most of these peaks did not change when digestion with alkaline phosphatase was performed before chromatography, indicating that most of the 2',5'-oligoadenylates lack exposed phosphate groups. In contrast to the effects of infection with SV40, addition of poly(I) X poly(C) to interferon-treated CV-1 cells led to accumulation of high levels (up to 3000 nM) of 2',5'-oligoadenylate-5'-di- or triphosphates capable of activating the ppp(A2'p)nA-dependent ribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1596603243,"The interaction of xanthine oxidase with the substrate analog 8-bromoxanthine has been examined in an effort to determine the nature of interaction of purines with the active site of the enzyme. It is found that 8-bromoxanthine is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase with a Ki of approximately 400 microM; inhibition is uncompetitive with respect to xanthine and noncompetitive with respect to molecular oxygen. While 8-bromoxanthine has only a slight effect on the reaction of reduced enzyme with oxygen, it dramatically slows the rate of enzyme reduction by xanthine, suggesting that inhibition does involve the interaction of 8-bromoxanthine with the molybdenum center of the enzyme. KD determinations for binding of 8-bromoxanthine to oxidized and reduced xanthine oxidase indicate that the inhibitor binds preferentially to the fully reduced form of the molybdenum center (MoIV), with dissociation constants of 1.5 mM and 18 microM for oxidized and reduced enzyme, respectively. This preferential binding to the reduced form of the enzyme is manifested in a significant increase in the oxidation-reduction potentials of the molybdenum center as determined by potentiometric titrations with 8-bromoxanthine complexed with xanthine oxidase. The shape of the Mov EPR signal observed in the course of these titrations as well as a comparison with results of reductive titrations and KD determinations with uric acid and xanthine indicate that 8-bromoxanthine interacts with the molybdenum center of xanthine oxidase in a way that is typical of purine substrates and products, despite the presence of the bulky Br group. The inhibitor thus has a potential as a probe of enzyme-substrate interactions, particularly using the technique of x-ray absorption spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1706221043,"The assimilatory nitrate reductase from Chlorella contains flavin, heme, and molybdenum as prosthetic groups. The molybdenum in assimilatory nitrate reductase is associated with a pterin moiety (molybdopterin) as evidenced by the ability of the enzyme to donate active molybdenum cofactor to the Neurospora nitrate reductase mutant nit-1 and by the oxidative conversion of the pterin to two well characterized fluorescent derivatives. The properties of the molybdenum center have been examined by EPR spectroscopy. A molybdenum V signal, absent in the resting enzyme, is elicited upon reduction with NADH and abolished upon reoxidation with nitrate. Reaction of the reduced enzyme with cyanide also abolishes the molybdenum V signal. The line shape and g values of the signal show pH dependence analogous to those observed previously with hepatic sulfite oxidase. The gav for molybdenum V at pH 7.0 was 1.977 and at pH 9.0, 1.961. The signal observed at pH 7.0 exhibits interaction with a single exchangeable proton. Potentiometric titration of the molybdenum center at pH 7.0 indicates that the oxidation-reduction potentials of the molybdenum VI/V and molybdenum V/IV couples are -34 and -54 mV, respectively. These potentials are significantly different from the potentials of the molybdenum center of respiratory-type nitrate reductase and in fact quite closely resemble those of hepatic sulfite oxidase. The oxidized enzyme exhibits the EPR signal of a low spin ferric heme which is abolished upon reduction with NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1543074215,"Abstract Two fragments, each corresponding to approximately half of the ovotransferrin (OTf) molecule and containing an iron-binding site were produced by digestion with affinity bound trypsin and were purified by isoelectric focusing and gel filtration chromatography. The immunologically distinct individually have little ability to bind to transferrin receptors on chick embryo red blood cells or to donate iron to them. Combining them, however, leads to both binding and iron donation approaching that found for holo-OTf. Furthermore, similar amounts of radiolabeled iron can be extracted into the putative heme fraction from Fe2OTf and from the various combined half-molecules. These findings conflict with those reported by Keung and Azari ( (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1184-1188) for subtilisin-derived half-molecules of OTf examined in a similar system. They found that each half-molecule appeared to bind at a level of approximately one-third that of Fe2OTf and that the half-molecules competed with each other for binding sites. In contrast, our equilibrium binding studies, in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol to prevent iron removal, led to the determination of 4.79 X 10(4) binding sites/cell for Fe2OTf, 4.44 X 10(4) for the NH2-terminal half-molecules in the presence of excess COOH-terminal half-molecules and 4.17 X 10(4) for COOH-terminal half-molecules in the presence of NH2-terminal half-molecules; apparent binding constants were estimated to be 3.29 X 10(6), 1.19 X 10(6), and 0.67 X 10(6) M-1 for these same samples. Problems associated with equilibrium binding studies in which a narrow range of concentrations of ligand is used and/or iron is being removed are discussed. Labeled combined half-molecules were half as effective as labeled Fe2OTf in competition with unlabeled Fe2OTf. These findings are consistent with the lower apparent binding constant found in the equilibrium binding studies. Equimolar apo-OTf had no effect on binding of either Fe2OTf or the combined half-molecules. It seems apparent from our studies that the NH2- and COOH-terminal half-molecules each contain a recognition region both of which are necessary for binding to the transferrin receptor and iron donation to the chick embryo red blood cell."
https://openalex.org/W1564066839,"The stoichiometry of vectorial H+ ejection, coupled to ferrocytochrome c oxidation by a three-subunit bacterial cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) from the thermophilic bacterium PS3, was measured. Three methods of measuring the H+/e- ratio were applied to proteoliposomes containing a relatively small amount of PS3 cytochrome oxidase, which showed a relatively low oxidation rate and a very low H+ leakage, as follows: (a) simultaneous measurements of H+ ejection and cytochrome c oxidation upon addition of a yeast ferrocytochrome c pulse, which enable us to calculate the H+/e- ratio as H+ ejected per cytochrome c oxidized; (b) computer simulations to find out the fit for the pH meter trace by changing the H+/e- ratio and the velocity constant of leakage; and (c) two successive measurements of initial rates of H+ movement in the absence and presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. The H+/e- ratios obtained were 1.39, the 10-s value after ferrocytochrome c addition in (a), 1.35 in (b), and 1.33 in (c). This high H+/e- stoichiometry observed, exceeding 1 and as high as 1.4, is discussed with respect to the controversy of the H+/e- ratio at the cytochrome oxidase site."
https://openalex.org/W1550950218,"Gonadotropin receptors with specificity, high affinity and low capacity for luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been identified in rat luteal cells. To investigate the nature of the receptor, we have employed disuccinimidyl suberate, a cross-linker noncleavable by reducing agents, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), a cleavable cross-linker, to covalently cross-link the 125I-hCG . receptor complex. The molecular weight of 125I-hCG-linked receptor complex and the receptor subunit structure were determined by electrophoresis in either 10 or 4.5% acrylamide in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate with or without reducing agents. Autoradiographic analysis of the 125I-hCG-linked receptor separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing condition revealed a single labeled band corresponding to Mr = 305,000 +/- 15,000. However, electrophoresis performed in the presence of 50 mM dithiothreitol and 2% beta-mercaptoethanol resulted in the appearance of four labeled bands corresponding to Mr = 105,000 +/- 4,000, 96,000 +/- 5,000, 74,000 +/- 4,000, and 62,000 +/- 4,000 concomitant with the loss of the labeled band in the Mr = 305,000 region. Further experiments demonstrated that these four labeled bands were derived from the same molecular species. In addition, the 125I-hCG-linked receptor in the absence of reducing agent was not dissociated into subunits even by treatment with strong denaturing agent (8 M urea). The appearance of the cross-linked 125I-hCG . receptor was effectively inhibited by the unlabeled beta-subunit of hCG, intact hCG, and luteinizing hormone and partially inhibited by the alpha-subunit of hCG but not by choleratoxin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, insulin or bovine serum albumin. These data suggest that 1) the hCG/luteinizing hormone receptor is an oligomeric complex linked by disulfide bonds and 2) that under reducing conditions, the oligomeric receptor dissociates into four nonidentical subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1518839137,"Resealed erythrocyte membranes (ghosts) filled with (Fe3+)cytochrome c were used as an assay system to measure the release of superoxide (O-2) from human phagocytes into the incubation medium. Neutrophils, activated by either opsonized zymosan particles or the soluble stimulus phorbol myristate acetate, released O-2, which subsequently entered the ghosts and reduced (Fe3+)cytochrome c. This reaction was dependent on the time of incubation, the concentration of neutrophils, the concentration of stimulus, and the concentration of ghosts. The reaction was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase and by 4,4‘-diisothiocyano-2,2‘-disulfonic acid, a specific blocker of anion channels in membranes. The reduction of (Fe3+)cytochrome c free in solution was about four times as fast as the reduction of (Fe3+)cytochrome c in the ghosts. Human eosinophils stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate reacted similarly to human neutrophils; the rate of O-2 production/cell was about twice as high for eosinophils as for neutrophils. In contrast, eosinophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan particles only reduced (Fe3+)cytochrome c free in solution, but not (Fe3+)cytochrome c in ghosts. This lack of reaction was not due to production of an inhibitor or below threshold generation of O-2 for the ghost assay. These results indicate: 1) activated human neutrophils and eosinophils can release O-2 or a similar product into the incubation medium; and 2) reduction of (Fe3+)cytochrome c free in solution is no proof for O-2 excretion by phagocytes."

CDP-diglyceride synthetase and phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase co-enriched with penicillin-binding protein activity, a known cytoplasmic membrane marker, throughout fractionation of cell-free extracts of both chemoheterotrophically and photoheterotrophically grown cells. PS decarboxylase also co-enriched with the cytoplasmic membranes in fractions derived from chemoheterotrophically and photoheterotrophically grown cells, but substantially greater quantities of PS decarboxylase activity was found in the chromatophores derived from photoheterotrophically grown cells than could be accounted for by cytoplasmic membrane contamination of this sample. PS synthase (60% of the recovered activity) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (90% of the recovered activity) were found in the supernatant fraction after high speed centrifugation of crude cell lysates, suggesting that these enzyme activities were not tightly membrane associated. The localization of phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme activity in R. sphaeroides is discussed in terms of the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1552838908,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase was incubated with p-hydroxybenzyl cyanide, ascorbate, and O2 and the products of the hydroxylation reaction were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography. At early times, p-hydroxymandelonitrile was the sole product but this compound slowly decomposed to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and cyanide. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also inhibited under these reaction conditions but the amount of cyanide produced was insufficient to account for the extent of enzyme inhibition. Incubation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase with [ring-3H]p-hydroxybenzyl cyanide, ascorbate, and O2 resulted in incorporation of detectable radiolabel into enzyme only when 100% O2 (0.4 X Km) was present. The amount of incorporated radiolabel was substoichiometric with respect to enzyme subunits (approximately 30%) and also did not correlate with the total amount of inhibited dopamine beta-hydroxylase. These data suggest two different modes of inhibition: covalent-adduct formation at early times and inhibition due to cyanide generated at the active site. Separate K14CN binding studies with dopamine beta-hydroxylase corroborated the latter suggestion since 2 mol of cyanide were bound per tetramer. Tyramine stabilized [14C]cyanide binding to dopamine beta-hydroxylase, consistent with the lack of enzyme reactivation observed under certain conditions (Colombo, G., Giedroc, D. P., Rajashekhar, B., and Villafranca, J. J. 1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1601-1606). EPR data for dopamine beta-hydroxylase-bound Cu2+ directly demonstrated that a quaternary complex with tyramine and cyanide was formed, since the spectrum of dopamine beta-hydroxylase-Cu2+-tyramine-cyanide is distinct from that of dopamine beta-hydroxylase-Cu2+-cyanide and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-Cu2+-tyramine. A comprehensive mechanism for dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibition by benzyl cyanides is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1585679227,"The effect of monoclonal antibodies to the human transferrin receptor on transferrin and iron uptake by rat and rabbit reticulocytes has been examined. The antibodies used were as follows: T58/1.4, B3/25.4, 42/6.3, T56/14.3.1, and 43/31. The effects were the same, irrespective of the antibody. Transferrin and iron uptake were stimulated in both rat and rabbit reticulocytes. The stimulation was not due to an increase in the number or affinity of the receptors, but rather to an increase in the rate of turnover of the receptors. Electron microscopy suggested that the antibody acted by facilitating the formation of coated pits containing the transferrin-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1509826844,"Abstract The DNA sequences of three major class III T3 RNA polymerase promoters located at 45.0, 55.0, and 64.8% on the standard T3 genetic map have been determined. The precise RNA initiation sites were also determined by 5'-terminal RNA sequence analysis of the transcripts synthesized from the promoter-containing DNA fragments. Alignment of these three class III promoters and a previously determined T3 RNA polymerase promoter at 1.05% on T3 genetic map, with start points of transcription (+1) in register, indicates a high degree of sequence conservation among the four T3 RNA polymerase promoters. The sequences are identical between positions -12 and +4 and are uniformly A-T between -12 and -17. The conserved portion of the (-) strand sequence is 5' (sequence in text) Upstream from -17 and downstream from +4 the sequences diverge. Comparison of this sequence with a prototype 23-base pair promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase shows overall homology between positions -17 and +4 with conserved divergence at residues -2 and between -10 and -12. Furthermore, careful examination of the nucleotide sequences around 45.0 and 64.8 T3 map units shows that the putative RNA sequences arising from these regions by overlapping transcription from upstream promoters can be arranged into stable stemloop structures thought to be required for RNase III cleavage. This pattern is similar to those reported for the corresponding T7 RNA polymerase promoters on T7 DNA (Dunn. J. J., and Studier, F. W. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 166, 477-535)."
https://openalex.org/W1607850722,"We recently reported the partial purification of a cAMP-independent and Ca2+-calmodulin-independent glycogen synthase kinase from porcine renal cortex (Schlender, K. K., Beebe, S. J., and Reimann, E. M. (1981) Cold Spring Harbor Conf. Cell Proliferation, 389-400). Subsequent purification indicated that the enzyme preparation consisted of at least three forms of glycogen synthase kinase which could be resolved by ATP gradient elution from aminoethylphosphate-agarose (AEP-agarose). The predominant form of glycogen synthase kinase, which eluted from AEP-agarose between 2 and 6 mM ATP, was purified approximately 800-fold and is designated GSK-A1. It had a molecular weight of 45,000-50,000 as determined by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It catalyzed the transfer of 1 mol of 32P/mol of synthase subunit into a low molecular weight (10,000) CNBr peptide which was tentatively identified as Ser-7 (site 2) by high performance liquid chromatography. This phosphorylation decreased the activity ratio (activity in the absence of glucose-6-P divided by activity in the presence of 7.2 mM glucose-6-P) from 0.95 to about 0.55. GSK-A1 appeared to be specific for and had low s0.5 values for both substrates, ATP (13 microM) and glycogen synthase (0.3-0.4 microM). The enzyme could not use GTP as the phosphate donor. GSK-A1 was not affected by the protein kinase inhibitor, cAMP, cGMP, Ca2+-calmodulin, EGTA, or trifluoperazine and had a broad pH optimum (pH 7.0-8.5). A second form, GSK-A2, was eluted from AEP-agarose between 7 and 9 mM ATP. GSK-A2 could transfer a 2nd mol of 32P/mol of synthase subunit and decreased the activity ratio to 0.30. The interrelation among these multiple forms is not clear, but the data suggest that multiple kinases are required to form the highly inactivated glycogen synthase in renal tissues."
