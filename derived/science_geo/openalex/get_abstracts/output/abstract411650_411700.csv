Michael Köhl and colleagues report the observation of a pseudogap — a phenomenon that precedes superfluid fermionic pairing in an ultracold, two-dimensional atomic quantum gas. The gap appears above the superfluid transition temperature and is detected through momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that ultracold atomic gases can be used to emulate the physics of correlated two-dimensional superconductors, with the ultimate goal of understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Pairing of fermions is ubiquitous in nature, underlying many phenomena. Examples include superconductivity, superfluidity of 3He, the anomalous rotation of neutron stars, and the crossover between Bose–Einstein condensation of dimers and the BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) regime in strongly interacting Fermi gases. When confined to two dimensions, interacting many-body systems show even more subtle effects1, many of which are not understood at a fundamental level. Most striking is the (as yet unexplained) phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, which is intimately related to the two-dimensional geometry of the crystal structure. In particular, it is not understood how the many-body pairing is established at high temperature, and whether it precedes superconductivity. Here we report the observation of a many-body pairing gap above the superfluid transition temperature in a harmonically trapped, two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas in the regime of strong coupling. Our measurements of the spectral function of the gas are performed using momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy2,3, analogous to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the solid state4. Our observations mark a significant step in the emulation of layered two-dimensional strongly correlated superconductors using ultracold atomic gases."

AR plays a central role in the development of prostate cancer and progression to castration resistance during and after androgen deprivation therapy. Here, we identified miR-let-7c as a key regulator of expression of AR. miR-let-7c suppresses AR expression and activity in human prostate cancer cells by targeting its transcription via c-Myc. Suppression of AR by let-7c leads to decreased cell proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. Down-regulation of Let-7c in prostate cancer specimens is inversely correlated with AR expression, whereas the expression of Lin28 (a repressor of let-7) is correlated positively with AR expression. Our study demonstrates that the miRNA let-7c plays an important role in the regulation of androgen signaling in prostate cancer by down-regulating AR expression. These results suggest that reconstitution of miR-let-7c may aid in targeting enhanced and hypersensitive AR in advanced prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W1980954879,"Hepatic insulin resistance has been attributed to both increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and accumulation of intracellular lipids, specifically diacylglycerol (DAG). The ER stress response protein, X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1), was recently shown to regulate hepatic lipogenesis, suggesting that hepatic insulin resistance in models of ER stress may result from defective lipid storage, as opposed to ER-specific stress signals. Studies were designed to dissociate liver lipid accumulation and activation of ER stress signaling pathways, which would allow us to delineate the individual contributions of ER stress and hepatic lipid content to the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance. Conditional XBP1 knock-out (XBP1Δ) and control mice were fed fructose chow for 1 week. Determinants of whole-body energy balance, weight, and composition were determined. Hepatic lipids including triglyceride, DAGs, and ceramide were measured, alongside markers of ER stress. Whole-body and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity were determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. Hepatic ER stress signaling was increased in fructose chow-fed XBP1Δ mice as reflected by increased phosphorylated eIF2α, HSPA5 mRNA, and a 2-fold increase in hepatic JNK activity. Despite JNK activation, XBP1Δ displayed increased hepatic insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, which was associated with increased insulin-stimulated IRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation, reduced hepatic DAG content, and reduced PKCε activity. These studies demonstrate that ER stress and IRE1α-mediated JNK activation can be disassociated from hepatic insulin resistance and support the hypothesis that hepatic insulin resistance in models of ER stress may be secondary to ER stress modulation of hepatic lipogenesis."

Previously, we demonstrated that intracellular degradation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides by microglia is dramatically enhanced in the presence of apoE. However, the molecular mechanisms subserving this effect remain unknown. This study reports a mechanistic link between apoE-regulated cholesterol homeostasis and Aβ degradation. We demonstrate that promoting intracellular Aβ degradation by microglia is a common feature of HDL apolipoproteins, including apoE and apoA-I. This effect was not dependent on the direct interaction of apoE and Aβ. Regulation of Aβ degradation was achieved by solely manipulating cellular cholesterol levels. The expression and the activity of Aβ degrading enzymes, however, were not regulated by cholesterol. We observed that reducing cellular cholesterol levels by apoE resulted in faster delivery of Aβ to lysosomes and enhanced degradation. Moreover, apoE facilitated the recycling of Rab7, a small GTPase responsible for recruiting the motor complex to late endosomes/lysosomes. These data indicate that faster endocytic trafficking of Aβ-containing vesicles in the presence of apoE resulted from efficient recycling of Rab7 from lysosomes to early endosomes. Thus, apoE-induced intracellular Aβ degradation is mediated by the cholesterol efflux function of apoE, which lowers cellular cholesterol levels and subsequently facilitates the intracellular trafficking of Aβ to lysosomes for degradation.

We have demonstrated that apoE plays a direct role in the normal, physiological clearance of Aβ from the brain. ApoE was shown to facilitate both intracellular and extracellular proteolytic degradation of Aβ in an isoform- and lipidation status-dependent manner (8Jiang Q. Lee C.Y. Mandrekar S. Wilkinson B.

ApoE is the predominant apolipoprotein in the central nervous system (CNS) and acts to scaffold the formation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. ApoE regulates the redistribution and homeostasis of cholesterol within the CNS, which is necessary for the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of synapses and membranes (9Mahley R.W. Apolipoprotein E, cholesterol transport protein with expanding role in cell biology.Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 10Kim J. Basak J.M. Holtzman D.M.

In the brain apoE is mainly produced by astrocytes and to a much lesser extent by microglia. Cholesterol is transferred to apoE through the activity of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and related transporters, including ABCG1 and ABCG4, to form HDL particles, resulting in the reduction of cellular cholesterol levels (11Lund-Katz S.

Conversely, cells can use HDL as an exogenous source of cholesterol through a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway (14Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M.

Epidemiological studies also suggested a positive correlation of hypercholesterolemia and a high incidence of coronary artery disease to the increased risk of AD (15Martins I.J. Berger T.

Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statins was shown to decrease the Aβ levels and AD pathology in several animal models of AD (16Refolo L.M. Pappolla M.A. LaFrancois J. Malester B. Schmidt S.D.

Although cholesterol has been widely investigated in the production of Aβ, there is limited knowledge about its involvement in the clearance of Aβ. Deficiency of Abca1 results in the accumulation of cholesterol and exacerbates the formation of amyloid plaques, whereas overexpression of Abca1 reduces brain Aβ levels and amyloid deposition (13Wahrle S.E.

Invest. 2008; 118: 671-682PubMed Google Scholar). Amyloid precursor protein processing and Aβ production were not affected by these genetic manipulations, indicating their influence on AD pathology was a result of alternations in Aβ clearance. Increasing apoE expression through liver X receptor activation promotes Aβ degradation both in vitro and in vivo (8Jiang Q. Lee C.Y. Mandrekar S. Wilkinson B. Cramer P. Zelcer N. Mann K. Lamb B. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Richardson J.C. Smith J.D. Comery T.A. Riddell D. Holtzman D.M. Tontonoz P. Landreth G.E. ApoE promotes the proteolytic degradation of Aβ.Neuron. 2008; 58: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ability of apoE to facilitate Aβ clearance is dependent upon the lipidation status of apoE, as highly lipidated species were more effective in promoting Aβ degradation. Indeed, microglia deficient in Abca1, which have poorly lipidated apoE-HDLs, exhibited impaired cholesterol efflux function and were unable to efficiently degrade soluble Aβ (sAβ). These reports combined suggest the importance of the cholesterol efflux function of apoE in its effects on intracellular sAβ degradation. In this study we report that apoE facilitates intracellular Aβ degradation by microglia through modulation of cellular cholesterol levels. This activity does not require direct interaction between apoE and Aβ. Depleting cellular cholesterol through its transfer to apoE-containing HDL particles alone was sufficient to promote Aβ degradation. Furthermore, we observed that the intracellular transport of Aβ through the endocytic system was accelerated in the presence of apoE. The cholesterol lowering effect of apoE enhanced the recycling of Rab7, a small GTPase protein in the motor complex on late endocytic vesicles, which in turn facilitated the trafficking of Aβ-containing vesicles to lysosomes for degradation. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation of apoE-facilitated intracellular Aβ degradation and demonstrate a direct role for cholesterol in AD. Human apoE and apoA-I were purchased from rPeptide (Bogart, GA) and Sigma (St. Louis, MO), respectively. The 4F peptide (Ac-DWFKAFYDKVAEKFKEAF-NH2) (24Handattu S.P. Garber D.W.

Lovastatin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol-loaded MβCD), and U18666A were purchased from Sigma. Primary microglia were derived from the brains of C57BL/6 or Apoe−/− mice at postnatal days 1–3 using a mild trypsinization protocol as previously described (25Saura J. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J.

Purified microglia were then maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 3–5 days before further experiments. Lyophilized unlabeled (American Peptide) or Alexa 555-labeled Aβ1–42 (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) and Aβ12–28 (American Peptide) were dissolved to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in DMSO and stored at −80 °C until use. For flow cytometry, the Aβ1–42 was then labeled with Alexa 488 fluorophores (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol as previously described (8Jiang Q. Lee C.Y. Mandrekar S. Wilkinson B.

In brief, the Aβ reaction mixture was allowed to fibrilize at 37 °C overnight. Unincorporated fluorophores were then removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in DMSO, sonicated, and ultracentrifuged. The steps were subsequently repeated until most of the pellet fraction was solubilized in DMSO. The supernatant contains the operationally defined “soluble Aβ,” which consists of primarily monomeric Aβ, with only low levels of small oligomeric species (28Shen C.L. Murphy R.M. Solvent effects on self-assembly of β-amyloid peptide.Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 640-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Primary microglia were plated overnight in 12-well plates at a density of 2.2 × 105 cells/well in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 2% FBS (Invitrogen). On the day before pretreatment, cells were switched to serum-free DMEM/F-12 overnight. Microglia were then treated with apoE, apoA-I, 4F peptide, U18666A, or cholesterol-loaded MβCD at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. For experiments in which MβCD or Aβ12–28 were used, microglia were incubated with these reagents for 30 min before the addition of Aβ. For lovastatin-treated groups, cells were incubated with lovastatin supplemented with 250 μm mevalonate and 2% lipoprotein-deficient fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in DMEM/F-12 for 48 h (29Chen H. Yang J. Low P.S. Cheng J.X. Cholesterol level regulates endosome motility via Rab proteins.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1508-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After pretreatments, cells were then incubated with 2 μg/ml Aβ1–42 for 18 h. After washing extensively with PBS to remove residual extracellular Aβ, cells were lysed in 1% SDS containing protease inhibitor mixture, including 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 μm PMSF. Remaining intracellular Aβ was quantified by ELISA using 6E10 as the capture antibody and 4G8-HRP as the detection antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ). Synthetic Aβ1–42 was used to generate a standard curve. Plates were developed using a TMB substrate kit (Pierce), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m HCl. The results were read using a Spectramax colorimetric plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of remaining intracellular Aβ was normalized to the total protein in the lysates. Primary murine microglia were plated at a density of 7 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate in DMEM/F-12 containing 2% FBS. On the day before pretreatment, culture media were replaced with serum-free DMEM/F-12 overnight. Cells were then pretreated with the drugs of interest for 24 h followed by administrating Alexa 488-labeled Aβ for 6 h. For experiments in which MβCD or Aβ12–28 were used, microglia were incubated with these reagents for 30 min before the addition of Alexa 488-labeled Aβ. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and collected for analysis by flow cytometry using the EPICS-XL MCL (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA). Cellular cholesterol levels were measured by an Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction and normalized to protein levels measured with a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Inhibition of Aβ1–42 binding to natural apoE3 particles in the presence of Aβ12–28 was performed as described (30Sadowski M. Pankiewicz J. Scholtzova H. Ripellino J.A. Li Y. Schmidt S.D. Mathews P.M.

In brief, 100 μl of Aβ1–42 (2 μg/ml in 0.5 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was incubated on polystyrene 96-well plates at 4 °C overnight to immobilize Aβ1–42. Plates were then washed with PBS plus 0.01% Tween20 (PBST) and blocked with 1% skim milk in PBST for 1 h at 37 °C. Immortalized E3-DSE astrocytes (a gift from Dr. Holtzman, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) were cultured in serum-free DMEM/F-12 with 1 mm sodium pyruvate for 3 days to obtain condition media containing lipidated apoE3 particles. Phosphoramidon (10 μm) was added to the conditioned media to block insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin activity (8Jiang Q. Lee C.Y. Mandrekar S. Wilkinson B. Cramer P. Zelcer N. Mann K. Lamb B.

ApoE promotes the proteolytic degradation of Aβ.Neuron. 2008; 58: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The conditioned media was preincubated with an increasing concentration of Aβ12–28 (0–10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and added to the 96-well plate containing immobilized Aβ for an additional 3 h. In parallel, a series of apoE dilutions was incubated on the wells coated with an anti-apoE antibody (WUE-4, a gift from Dr. Holtzman) to generate a standard curve for calibration. The plate was then washed with PBS, and apoE bound to Aβ1–42 was detected using a HRP-conjugated anti-apoE antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The chromogenic reaction was developed with a TMB substrate kit (Pierce), stopped by the addition of 1 m HCL, and measured using a Spectramax colorimetric plate reader (Molecular Devices). OD values were first calibrated to the standard curve and then converted to percentages, considering the binding of apoE3 to Aβ1–42 in the absence of Aβ12–28 as 100%. Nonspecific binding was determined by replacing coated Aβ1–42 with bovine serum albumin and/or omitting the conditioned media in the assay. Primary microglia were plated on coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well plate in DMEM/F-12 containing 2% FBS. Cells were serum-starved overnight and pretreated with the drugs of choice for 24 h. To label the late endosomes and lysosomes, Alexa 488-labeled microspheres (20 nm, Invitrogen) were diluted (1:10) and incubated in PBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min at room temperature, washed with serum-free DMEM/F-12, and applied to the cells at 10 μl/ml for 30 min. After being washed extensively to remove non-internalized microspheres, cells were incubated for 4 h in 37 °C to allow microspheres to accumulate in late endosomes/lysosomes. Colocalization of Aβ and late endosomes/lysosomes was measured by a pulse-chase experiment. Cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml Alexa 555-labeled Aβ, washed thoroughly, and further incubated in 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. For measuring the colocalization of Aβ and Rab7, the cells were treated as stated above but omitted the step of applying microspheres. Rab7 was detected using an anti-Rab7 antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) followed by a corresponding Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The microscopic images were subjected to the colocalization assay using NIH ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD) with both Intensity Correlation Analysis (31Li Q. Lau A. Morris T.J. Guo L. Fordyce C.B. Stanley E.F. A syntaxin 1, Gα(o), and N-type calcium channel complex at a presynaptic nerve terminal. Analysis by quantitative immunocolocalization.J.

The algorithm of these two methods takes a specific approach to automatically estimate the threshold for both channels and to exclude the overlaps from randomly distributed fluorescent signals. In our samples, colocalization coefficients calculated using both methods were very close. Thus, only the Pearson correlation coefficients obtained from Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin were plotted. Primary microglial cells were plated on Delta T tissue culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/plate. Cells were incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM/F-12 and treated with 1 μg/ml apoE or 10 μm U18666A for 24 h as indicated. Cells were stained with DiD (Invitrogen) for 5 min to visualize membrane and vesicles. Alexa 488-labeled Aβ1–42 (1 μg/ml) was applied to the cell for 5 min. After a brief wash, live cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. A heated stage and objectives were used to maintain the temperature of culture media at 37 °C. Immediately after washing off extracellular Aβ, time-lapse images were taken every 10 s for 10 min. Images of 512 × 512 pixels were acquired at 7.5 s/frame (29Chen H. Yang J. Low P.S. Cheng J.X. Cholesterol level regulates endosome motility via Rab proteins.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1508-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The paths of movement were tracked using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) to calculate the velocity of these vesicles. 12–20 vesicles per cell were analyzed. It normally took 15- 20 min for Aβ-containing vesicles to traffic from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear compartments. The fluorescently labeled vesicles then stayed in that region for a long period of time with minimal movement, indicating the fluorophores reached lysosomes and stayed. Since we were focusing on the trafficking of endolytic vesicles, these immobile vesicles were excluded in the statistic analysis. To avoid bias exclusion of certain vesicles, only four most motile Aβ-containing vesicles per cell were selected to represent the directed movement of endolytic vesicles. To eliminate the perturbations from photo or mechanical drifting while recording, four most stationary vesicles were set as the base-line motility (VS) and subtracted that from the speed of motile vesicles (VM), V = VM − VS. The average trafficking speed in the first 6 min of recording of the four most motile vesicles was plotted as one data point in the figure. Primary microglia plated in 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight and treated with drug of interest for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed by incubation in relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3) on ice for 15 min followed by 10 s of sonication. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 1 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The resulting supernatant was collected and saved as the “cytosolic” fractions, and the pellet was resuspended in relaxation buffer as the “membrane” fractions. These subcellular fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the relative amount of Rab7 in each fraction. The membrane marker flotillin was used to assess the efficacy of the fractionation procedure. The in vitro extraction of Rab7 by GDI was evaluated as described (33Ganley I.G. Pfeffer S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2014327275,"The antigen-binding fragment of functional heavy chain antibodies (HCAbs) in camelids comprises a single domain, named the variable domain of heavy chain of HCAbs (VHH). The VHH harbors remarkable amino acid substitutions in the framework region-2 to generate an antigen-binding domain that functions in the absence of a light chain partner. The substitutions provide a more hydrophilic, hence more soluble, character to the VHH but decrease the intrinsic stability of the domain. Here we investigate the functional role of an additional hallmark of dromedary VHHs, i.e. the extra disulfide bond between the first and third antigen-binding loops. After substituting the cysteines forming this interloop cystine by all 20 amino acids, we selected and characterized several VHHs that retain antigen binding capacity. Although VHH domains can function in the absence of an interloop disulfide bond, we demonstrate that its presence constitutes a net advantage. First, the disulfide bond stabilizes the domain and counteracts the destabilization by the framework region-2 hallmark amino acids. Second, the disulfide bond rigidifies the long third antigen-binding loop, leading to a stronger antigen interaction. This dual beneficial effect explains the in vivo antibody maturation process favoring VHH domains with an interloop disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W2110195051,"T-type calcium channels represent a key pathway for Ca(2+) entry near the resting membrane potential. Increasing evidence supports a unique role of these channels in fast and low-threshold exocytosis in an action potential-independent manner, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unknown. Here, we report the existence of a syntaxin-1A/Ca(v)3.2 T-type calcium channel signaling complex that relies on molecular determinants that are distinct from the synaptic protein interaction site (synprint) found in synaptic high voltage-activated calcium channels. This interaction potently modulated Ca(v)3.2 channel activity, by reducing channel availability. Other members of the T-type calcium channel family were also regulated by syntaxin-1A, but to a smaller extent. Overexpression of Ca(v)3.2 channels in MPC 9/3L-AH chromaffin cells induced low-threshold secretion that could be prevented by uncoupling the channels from syntaxin-1A. Altogether, our findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of a syntaxin-1A/T-type Ca(2+) channel signaling complex and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which these channels control low-threshold exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2002432156,"Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most dramatic examples of massive stellar deaths, usually as- sociated with supernovae (Woosley et al. 2006). They release ultra-relativistic jets producing non-thermal emission through synchrotron radiation as they interact with the surrounding medium (Zhang et al. 2004). Here we report observations of the peculiar GRB 101225A (the ""Christmas burst""). Its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followed by a bright X-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual optical counterpart. During the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as an expanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistent with a faint supernova, emerged. We determine its distance to 1.6 Gpc by fitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the optical emission with a GRB-supernova template. Deep optical observations may have revealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. Our proposed progenitor is a helium star-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling its hydrogen envelope. The resulting explosion created a GRB-like jet which gets thermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thus creating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernova dominated. An alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutron star in the Galaxy (Campana et al. 2011)."

https://openalex.org/W2086011639,"A correlation of TCF12 mRNA overexpression with colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis was suggested by microarray data and validated by the survey of 120 patients. Thirty-three (27.5%) of the 120 patients showed tumor TCF12 mRNA overexpression and had a higher rate of metastatic occurrence (p = 0.020) and a poorer survival outcome (p = 0.014). Abundant TCF12 levels were also observed in human CRC cell lines such as SW620 and LoVo, but a relatively low level was detected in SW480 cells. Knockdown of TCF12 expression in SW620 and LoVo cells drastically reduced their activities of migration, invasion, and metastasis. Tight cell-cell contact and an increase in E-cadherin but a concomitant decrease in fibronectin were observed in TCF12-knockdown cells. Connexin 26, connexin 43, and gap-junction activity were also increased upon TCF12-knockdown. In contrast, ectopic TCF12 overexpression in SW480 cells facilitated fibronectin expression and cell migration and invasion activities but diminished cellular levels of E-cadherin, connexin 26, connexin 43, and gap junction. A physical association of TCF12 with the E-cadherin promoter was evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. TCF12 was tightly correlated with cellular expression of Bmi1 and EZH2 and was co-immunoprecipitable with Bmi1 and EZH2, suggesting that TCF12 transcriptionally suppressed E-cadherin expression via polycomb group-repressive complexes. Clinically, TCF12 mRNA overexpression was also correlated with E-cadherin mRNA down-regulation in the tumor tissues of our 120 patients (p = 0.013). These studies suggested that TCF12 functioned as a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and its overexpression was significantly correlated with the occurrence of CRC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2032672329,"Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is a multitransmembrane domain-spanning endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located protein that is evolutionarily conserved and protects against apoptosis and ER stress. Furthermore, BI-1 is proposed to modulate ER Ca2+ homeostasis by acting as a Ca2+-leak channel. Based on experimental determination of the BI-1 topology, we propose that its C terminus forms a Ca2+ pore responsible for its Ca2+-leak properties. We utilized a set of C-terminal peptides to screen for Ca2+ leak activity in unidirectional 45Ca2+-flux experiments and identified an α-helical 20-amino acid peptide causing Ca2+ leak from the ER. The Ca2+ leak was independent of endogenous ER Ca2+-release channels or other Ca2+-leak mechanisms, namely translocons and presenilins. The Ca2+-permeating property of the peptide was confirmed in lipid-bilayer experiments. Using mutant peptides, we identified critical residues responsible for the Ca2+-leak properties of this BI-1 peptide, including a series of critical negatively charged aspartate residues. Using peptides corresponding to the equivalent BI-1 domain from various organisms, we found that the Ca2+-leak properties were conserved among animal, but not plant and yeast orthologs. By mutating one of the critical aspartate residues in the proposed Ca2+-channel pore in full-length BI-1, we found that Asp-213 was essential for BI-1-dependent ER Ca2+ leak. Thus, we elucidated residues critically important for BI-1-mediated Ca2+ leak and its potential channel pore. Remarkably, one of these residues was not conserved among plant and yeast BI-1 orthologs, indicating that the ER Ca2+-leak properties of BI-1 are an added function during evolution.

The Ca2+ concentration in the ER ([Ca2+]ER) is dynamically regulated by Ca2+-uptake pumps of the sarco/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+-ATPase family, intraluminal Ca2+-binding proteins, like calreticulin and calnexin, and Ca2+-release channels, like inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) (2Berridge M.J.

In a resting cell, the steady-state [Ca2+]ER is ultimately determined by the equilibrium between the active uptake and the basal or passive leak of Ca2+ from the ER. The control of [Ca2+]ER requires a tight handling of these mechanisms, because an increase in [Ca2+]ER renders cells hypersensitive toward agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling, whereas a decrease in [Ca2+]ER may provoke ER stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (3Madeo F.

However, the exact topology of BI-1 in the ER membrane and the position of the Ca2+ pore are still unresolved. In this work, we present data on the topology of BI-1 in the ER membrane and results of screening a set of peptides representing the C-terminal hydrophobic part of BI-1 for their potential Ca2+-leak activity in unidirectional Ca2+ fluxes. We identified an α-helical 20-amino acid peptide that is responsible for the Ca2+ leak from the ER independently of other endogenous ER Ca2+-release channels and Ca2+-leak mechanisms, such as IP3Rs, RyRs, translocons, and presenilins. The Ca2+-flux properties of the peptide were confirmed in lipid bilayer experiments. Using mutant peptides, we identified critical negatively charged aspartate residues contributing to the potential Ca2+-channel pore and we show that Ca2+ release properties of the BI-1 peptide require its hydrophobic and α-helical structure. Using peptides corresponding to BI-1 from other organisms, we found that Ca2+-transport properties are conserved among animal orthologs, but not in plant and yeast orthologs. Hence, this study identified a peptide derived from the C-terminal part of BI-1 that may be involved in the formation of a Ca2+-channel pore. Importantly, we found that replacing one of the critical aspartate residues in the proposed Ca2+-channel pore in the full-length BI-1 was sufficient to abolish the BI-1-mediated Ca2+ leak. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells) were cultured at 37 °C in a 9% CO2 incubator in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3.8 mm l-glutamine, 85 units ml−1 of penicillin, and 85 μg ml−1 of streptomycin. All media were obtained from Invitrogen. DT40 cells were cultured as previously described (24Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. Encoding of Ca2+ signals by differential expression of IP3 receptor subtypes.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For the 45Ca2+ fluxes, MEF cells were seeded in 12-well clusters (Costar, MA, 4 cm2) at a density of ∼104 to 2 × 104 cells cm−2. Experiments were carried out with confluent monolayers of cells (7.5 × 104 cells cm−2) between the 5th and 7th day after plating. Lvec control cells were seeded in 12-well clusters (Greiner) at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well, whereas IP3R1-overexpressing L15 cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells per well. These fibroblast L cell lines have been previously created and characterized (25Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K.

Experiments were carried out on confluent cell monolayers between the 6th and 8th day after seeding. Human cervical carcinoma cells HeLa T1 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2% Glutamax, 100 units ml−1 of penicillin, and 100 units ml−1 of streptomycin (Invitrogen). For studies of full-length BI-1, 3 × 104 cells were seeded on 2-chamber borosilicate slides (Nunc) 1 day before transfection. All synthetic peptides were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (Ulm, Germany) at a purity of more than 90%. The identity of the peptides was confirmed via mass spectrometry and the purifications were performed via HPLC. 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, ryanodine, and anisomycin were obtained from Sigma. Neuro2A cells were transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged (HA) BI-1 (HA-BI-1), BI-1-HA, ERp44-HA, or empty vector in 10-cm cell culture dishes at a confluence of 80–90% using the Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h later, cells were harvested and the cell suspension was divided into three fractions. These fractions of suspended cells were permeabilized with either 20 μm digitonin or 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min on a rocking platform at room temperature or were kept unpermeabilized in PBS. For incubation with Triton X-100, cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. After permeabilization, cells were washed twice with either PBS containing 2 μm digitonin or 0.01% Triton X-100, or in PBS alone, and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-HA tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:20 in wash buffer for 30 min on a shaker protected from light. After two wash steps cells were transferred to FACS tubes and analyzed on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). Unidirectional 45Ca2+ flux experiments were performed essentially as previously described (27Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R.

The 12-well clusters were fixed on a thermostated plate at 25 °C on a mechanical shaker. The culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were permeabilized by incubating them for 10 min in a solution containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μg ml−1 of saponin. The non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores were then loaded for 45 min in 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, and 150 nm free 45Ca2+ (28 μCi ml−1). Then, 1 ml of efflux medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), and 1 mm EGTA was added and replaced every 2 min. The indicated [IP3] or 10 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 were added for 2 min, after 2, 10, or 20 min of efflux. At the end of the experiment, all 45Ca2+ remaining in the stores was released by incubation with 1 ml of a 2% (w/v) SDS solution for 30 min. Concentration-response curves were fitted using Origin 7.0 (Northampton, MA) software using the Hill equation. These experiments were performed as described (30Tovey S.C. Sun Y. Taylor C.W.

Briefly, DT40 and triple IP3R-knock out (TKO) cells were grown to a density of about 1 × 106 cells/ml−1 and loaded with Mag-Fluo4 AM (20 μm) for 60 min at 20 °C. Cells were permeabilized by incubation with saponin (10 μg·ml−1) for 4 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in Mg2+-free cytosol-like medium (140 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0), supplemented with 375 μm CaCl2 and 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, which inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Cells were dispensed into a 96-well black-walled assay plate pre-coated with poly-l-lysine and centrifuged to spin the permeabilized cells to the bottom of the wells. Cells were incubated with 90 μl of fresh Mg2+-free cytosol-like medium, supplemented with 375 μm CaCl2 and 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Mag-Fluo4 signals were measured with FlexStation3 with automated additions (settings: excitation 490 nm, emission 525 nm, reading sensitivity normal (five readings), and photomultiplier tube sensitivity high). At 30 s, 10 μl of 15 mm Mg-ATP (1.5 mm final) was added to initiate Ca2+ uptake. After reaching steady-state store loading, 20 μl of 6 μm thapsigargin (1 μm final) was added and 40 s later, 20 μl of peptides were added at 7× final concentration in the medium. This medium contained a final concentration of 1 μm thapsigargin to block Ca2+ pumps and 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone to block mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes. Thirty thousand HeLa T1 cells were seeded on borosilicate 2-chamber slides (Nunc). The next day, cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and 0.25 μg of pcDNA3.1-mCherry and 0.25 μg of pcDNA3.1 (mock), pcDNA3.1 myc-BI-1, or myc-BI-1-D213R. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were loaded with 1.25 μm Fura-2-AM (Invitrogen) diluted in Krebs-Ringer solution (11 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 13 mm glucose, pH 7.5) and prepared for microscopy. For recording cytosolic [Ca2+], we used a Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 microscope with a Fluor ×20/0.75 objective, Sutter Lambda DG-4 monochromator and filter sets 21 and 62 (Zeiss) for Fura-2 and mCherry, respectively. Images were recorded with an AxioCamHsM camera in the AxioVision version 4.6 software physiology module. mCherry-positive cells were preselected for the recordings, and Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded every 2 s. For the chelation of Ca2+, we used 3 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (Invitrogen), which rapidly chelates the extracellular Ca2+. Release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores was induced with 4 μm thapsigargin, which specifically inhibits the activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps at low micromolar concentrations. Ca2+ traces were calibrated by incubating the cells for 10 min, first with Krebs-Ringer solution containing 50 mm EGTA and 2 μm ionomycin (LC Labs), and then with 250 mm CaCl2 and 2 μm ionomycin. Traces were then converted into [Ca2+] using the formula, Ca2+=KF380,maxRmax−RF380,maxR−Rmin where Kd = 225 nm (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. A new generation of Ca2+ indicators with greatly improved fluorescence properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells from 2-chamber slides were trypsinized and lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford method and 10 μg of total protein lysate was prepared in urea sample buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 m urea, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm DTT). Samples were heated for 10 min at 37 °C before loading on a precasted NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred in running buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 10% methanol) on a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20. Expression of the Myc-BI-1 fusion protein was detected using an anti-Myc antibody (Sigma). The membrane was stripped with a mild stripping buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and reblotted with an antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) as a loading control. Planar lipid bilayer were formed (3:1 mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) dissolved in decane) on a 200-μm diameter aperture separating cis and trans chambers containing: (cis) 95 mm Tris-OH, 200 mm HEPES (pH 7.3, ∼300 mosmol; [Ca2+]free = 10 nm) and (trans) 50 mm Ba(OH)2, 55 mm HEPES (pH 7.3, ∼285 mosmol) solutions, respectively. Peptides dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide were added to the cis chamber at gradually increasing concentrations, and stirred continuously between the periods of membrane current recordings that were done using the Axopatch 1 amplifier and pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments). The cis chamber was grounded. Experiments were done at room temperature. Holding potential (Vh) was 0 mV for all experiments except when indicated. Off-line current-trace filtering (500 Hz), calculations of the mean current passing by lipid bilayer (Imean), and histogram calculations and statistics analysis were done using pClamp10 and OriginPro 7.5 (OriginLab) software. The attempt to attribute a Ca2+-channel function to BI-1 is hampered by unresolved exact topology of the BI-1 in the ER membrane. We have previously shown that the C terminus of BI-1 resides in the cytosol (16Henke N. Lisak D.A. Schneider L. Habicht J. Pergande M. Methner A. Cell Calcium. 2011; 50: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which results in two different models (Fig. 1A). In model A, which is supported by TMpred, the N terminus is located in the ER lumen. In model B, which is bioinformatically supported by TMHMM, the N terminus is cytosolic and the semi-hydrophobic seventh transmembrane domain, which bears some homology to the loop domain of the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN5A, would dip into the membrane, creating a loop domain (Fig. 1B). Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the enhanced green fluorescent protein protease-protection assay used previously (16Henke N. Lisak D.A. Schneider L. Habicht J. Pergande M. Methner A. Cell Calcium. 2011; 50: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to distinguish between these two models, because the addition of an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein alters the function of BI-1, 4L. Schneider and A. Methner, unpublished results. indicating that the bulky enhanced green fluorescent protein moiety at the N terminus might alter the topology or intracellular localization of BI-1. We therefore modified the assay by using cells overexpressing proteins tagged with the very short HA tag and selective membrane permeabilization. Digitonin makes epitopes in the cytosol, but not in the ER lumen, accessible to fluorescent antibodies, which can be quantified by flow cytometry. Treatment with Triton X-100, in contrast, permeabilizes all membranes and leads to staining of both luminal and cytosolic epitopes. We overexpressed HA-BI-1 or BI-1-HA in Neuro2a cells and used the luminal endoplasmic-reticulum protein (ERp) 44-HA as negative control (Fig. 1C). Both HA-BI-1 and BI-1-HA resulted in a similar increase in immunoreactivity after digitonin treatment, whereas ERp44 staining never exceeded the level apparent in cells transfected with an empty vector. Permeabilization with Triton X-100, on the other hand, dramatically increased HA immunoreactivity in ERp44-HA-transfected cells and had no further significant effect on HA-BI-1 and BI-1-HA. These results favor model B, although it cannot be completely excluded that the fusion with HA itself may alter the topology of BI-1. The model supported by the experiments in Fig. 1 suggested a possibility of the presence of a pore domain right before the proposed C-terminal domains of BI-1 interacting with IRE1α (12Lisbona F.

However, the role of mitochondrial (mt) BER and SSBR proteins in mt genome maintenance is not completely clear. Here we show the presence of the oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylase Nei-like 2 (NEIL2) and the DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) in purified human mitochondrial extracts (MEs). Confocal microscopy revealed co-localization of PNKP and NEIL2 with the mitochondrion-specific protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (MT-CO2). Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed association of NEIL2 and PNKP with the mitochondrial genes MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3); importantly, both enzymes also associated with the mitochondrion-specific DNA polymerase γ. In cell association of NEIL2 and PNKP with polymerase γ was further confirmed by proximity ligation assays. PNKP-depleted ME showed a significant decrease in both BER and SSBR activities, and PNKP was found to be the major 3'-phosphatase in human ME. Furthermore, individual depletion of NEIL2 and PNKP in human HEK293 cells caused increased levels of oxidized bases and SSBs in the mt genome, respectively. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the critical role of NEIL2 and PNKP in maintenance of the mammalian mitochondrial genome."

However, sequence variation in ECL2 of these claudins is likely responsible for slightly different conformation in the turn region, which is in line with different cCPE interaction modes of Cld3 and Cld4.

CPE194–319 with N-terminal GST fusions as well as GST (control) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. For use of GST fusion proteins, see supplemental Comment. Bacteria were grown to A600 = 0.6–0.8, and expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three h later bacteria were harvested (10 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) and lysed in PBS with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated with Vibra CellTM model 72434 (BioBlock Scientific, Strasbourg, France) by 10 × 1-s pulses. To remove insoluble cell debris, lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The proteins were purified from supernatants using glutathione-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), and eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA Protein kit (Thermo Scientific). MDCK I cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium with Earle's salts (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% l-alanyl-l-glutamine. HEK293 cells (HEK cells) were maintained and transfected as described (28Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Formation of tight junction: determinants of homophilic interaction between classic claudins.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described previously (23Winkler L. Gehring C. Wenzel A. Müller S.L. Piehl C. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Piontek J. Molecular determinants of the interaction between Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin fragments and claudin-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18863-18872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, transient or stable transfected HEK cells or MDCK I cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in PBS. The 10,000 × g supernatant was incubated with GST-cCPE constructs bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h on a shaker at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and bound proteins eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Cld3, anti-Cld4, or anti-GFP antibodies. After stripping, membranes were incubated with anti-GST antibodies to verify that similar amounts of GST-cCPE were bound to the beads. Two to 3 days after transient transfection or 1 day after plating of stable lines, HEK cells expressing claudin constructs were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml GST-CPE constructs (30 min, 37 °C) in 12- or 24-well plates (Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+), scraped, harvested (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and lysed with radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), supernatants were analyzed for the amount of bound GST-cCPE by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Alternatively, for detection of bound GST-cCPE with fluorescence plate reader (Tecan), cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+), fixed (10 min with 2.4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS) followed by quenching (20 min with 100 mm glycine in PBS) and blocking (10 min with 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS). Cells were incubated with PhycoLink® anti-GST-R-phycoerythrin conjugate in 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 2 μm Hoechst 33258 in PBS for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. Bound GST-cCPE was detected via fluorescence intensity of PhycoLink® α-GST at λex 545 ± 12 nm/λem 578 ± 12 nm; claudins were detected at λex 506 ± 5 nm/λem 525 ± 5 nm for YFP-tagged, or λex 488 ± 5 nm/λem 510 ± 5 nm for GFP-tagged claudins. Cell number was monitored with Hoechst dye at λex 365 ± 12 nm/λem 480 ± 12 nm. Untransfected HEK cells were used as a negative control (fluorescence intensity of GST-cCPE bound to Cld3WT was 15.4 ± 0.8 times higher than the negative control). Fluorescence intensity of bound cCPE was normalized to amount of claudins (YFP or GFP intensity) or cell number (Hoechst intensity). Subconfluent cultures of MDCK I cells, expressing both Cld3 and Cld4 endogenously, were seeded in Millicell® culture inserts (Millipore). TER of cell monolayers was measured every 3 h by using a CellZscope® (NanoAnalytics). Normalization of TER values by area of the cell monolayers was done automatically by CellZscope. When TER values reached the plateau, indicating a stable tight junction barrier, MDCK I monolayers were treated with GST (negative control), GST-cCPEWT or its mutants (R227A, L254A/S256A/I258A/D284A, Y306A) on both basal and apical sides of the chamber. The background (value of blank Millicell® culture insert) was subtracted from the measured TER. TER values 18 h after the addition of cCPE were normalized to the TER values immediately before the cCPE addition. Homology models for murine Cld3-ECL2134–164 and human Cld4-ECL2135–165 were created based on the model for murine Cld5-ECL2135–165 as described previously (28Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Formation of tight junction: determinants of homophilic interaction between classic claudins.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Due to sequence and binding differences of Cld3 and Cld4 in the N-terminal region (153–158, 154–159, respectively) of the C-terminal helix an extensive search for further templates was conducted by performing sequence similarity searches (FASTA program) of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For murine Cld3-ECL2 parts of the PDB structure 1W5C (Photosystem II from Thermo-synechococcus elongatus) were used as template for the N-terminal helix cap region of ECL2 helix 2. For human Cld4-ECL2, no further sufficient template was found (cCPE crystal structure used as deposited by Van Itallie et al. PDB 2QUO (18Van Itallie C.M. Betts L. Smedley 3rd, J.G.

All manual reciprocal dockings, manipulations, optimizations of ECL2 models, and calculations of hydrophobic and electrostatic potentials on the molecular surfaces were performed with Sybyl X1.2 (Tripos, Inc.). Models were energetically minimized using the AMBER7 FF99 force field. Unless stated otherwise, results are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

Ala substitution of the cCPE residues Tyr306, Tyr310, Tyr312, and Leu315 crucially inhibits Cld4 binding (16Takahashi A. Komiya E. Kakutani H. Yoshida T. Fujii M. Horiguchi Y. Mizuguchi H.

Mapping these positions (blue sticks in Fig. 1C) onto the surface of the cCPE structure reveals that they are located close to, or in, the potential binding cavity for claudins. The cavity is formed by two pits and surrounded on the upper rim by the residues Leu223, Asp225, Arg227, and Ser313, on the lower rim by Leu254, Ser256, Lys257, Ile258, and Asp284 (Fig. 1C). Displaying the calculated hydrophobic potential on the cCPE surface indicates a deep, large, and strong hydrophobic pit (yellow in Fig. 1B) lined by the triple Tyr motif (Tyr306, Tyr310, and Tyr312) and a smaller, less deep and weaker hydrophobic or nonpolar pit (Fig. 1B, gray) surrounded by the triple Leu motif to the left (Leu223, Leu254, and Leu315). This second pit is less hydrophobic because it is flanked by polar amino acids (Fig. 1B, green) on both the upper (Asp225, Arg227, and Ser313) and the lower rim (Ser256, Lys257, and Asp284).FIGURE 4Cld3-mimicking substitutions in Cld4 (A153P/S154E/G155A) decrease Cld4-related strong inhibitory effect of R227A and L223A/D225A/R227A in cCPE.

Mutants of GST-CPE194–319 (GST-cCPE) were analyzed by previously established pulldown assay (23Winkler L. Gehring C. Wenzel A. Müller S.L. Piehl C. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Piontek J.

Since Y306A in cCPE was shown to inhibit binding to Cld4, it was used as a positive control. As expected, Y306A inhibited binding of full-length Cld4 to GST-cCPE in pulldown assays (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, Y306A inhibited binding of full-length Cld3 to GST-cCPE (Fig. 2, A and B). First, residues on the upper rim of the putative binding pocket were analyzed. L223A in GST-cCPE strongly reduced binding of Cld3. D225A had no effect, and R227A slightly weakened binding to Cld3. However, the latter did not reach statistical significance. Surprisingly, the corresponding triple substitution L223A/D225A/R227A affected Cld3 binding less than L223A alone. On the lower rim, L254A showed strong reduction of Cld3 binding. S256A and I258A resulted in a slightly weakened, but not statistically significant, reduction of Cld3-cCPE interaction. However, the triple substitution L254A/S256A/I258A reduced binding more strongly than each of the three single substitutions. D284A severely affected Cld3 binding whereas K257A showed no clear reduction. L254A/S256A/I258A/D284A blocked Cld3 binding completely. Taken together, the pulldown data indicate involvement of Leu223, Leu254, Asp284, and possibly Ser256 and/or Ile258 of cCPE in the interaction with Cld3 (Fig. 2, A and B).

Part of this polymorphism is due to preparation conditions, but surprisingly, most structural studies seem to agree on a general U-shaped β-strand-turn-β-strand motif of the Aβ peptides in fibrils, with some variation in the register of the opposing β-strand zippers (5Bertini I.

Interestingly, the molecular dynamics of Aβ fibrils, which is an essential part of the structural biology of amyloid structures, has not been comprehensively studied. In fact, only a very few reports on fibrillar dynamics in general exist so far (15Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M.

These studies showed that the investigation of the fibril dynamics can significantly support the structural analysis and further characterize the respective structural elements. The combination of structural and dynamical analysis leads to a much more complete picture of the structural biology of the fibrils and therefore improves the understanding of the fibrillation process and the mode of action of the investigated structures. Here, we have studied the molecular dynamics of mature Aβ(1–40) fibrils in a site-specific manner using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. For this investigation, eight Aβ(1–40) peptides with uniformly 13C/15N-labeled amino acids in different positions were synthesized using standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl protocols. The individual Aβ(1–40) peptides with sequence DAEFRHDSGY EVHHQKLVFF AEDVGSNKGA IIGLMVGGVV were isotopically labeled at the following amino acids: peptide I, Val12, Phe20, Ala30, and Gly38; peptide II, Asp1, Gly9, Phe19, and Val39; peptide III, Asp23, Ser26, Gly29, and Val40; peptide IV, Glu3, Val18, Ala21, and Gly33; peptide V, Ala2, Glu11, Val24, and Gly37; peptide VI, Phe4, Asp7, Gly25, and Val36; peptide VII, Ser8, Glu22, and Ile31; and peptide VIII, Lys16, Ile32, and Leu34. Aβ(1–40)-labeled peptide was solubilized in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 9) at a concentration of 6 mg/ml. The sample was seeded and incubated at 37 °C for 1 week. Seeds consisted of mature Aβ(1–40) fibrils previously grown and seeded under the same conditions (second generation) and were sonicated for 10 min before addition to the sample. The presence of mature fibrils was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mature fibrils were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C using a TLA 120.2 rotor and a Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge. For the NMR measurements, the pellet was lyophilized, rehydrated with 50 or 75 weight % H2O, and homogenized by freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen and thawing it at 37 °C. TEM samples were prepared by applying 5-ml droplets from the sample after 1:10 dilution with pure water onto a carbon film (floating carbon method), counterstained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and analyzed with a Zeiss 900 electron microscope (80 kV). The 13C cross-polarized MAS NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 750 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at a resonance frequency of 749.7 MHz for 1H and 188.5 MHz for 13C. A 4-mm double-resonance MAS probe was used. The cross-polarized contact time was 700 μs; typical lengths of the 90° pulses were 5 μs for 13C and 4 μs for 1H. For heteronuclear two-pulse phase modulation decoupling, a 1H radiofrequency field of 65 kHz was applied. 13C chemical shifts were referenced externally relative to TMS. Two-dimensional 13C-13C proton-driven spin exchange spectra with a mixing time of 50 ms were acquired for peak assignment (21Szeverenyi N.M. Sullivan M.J. Maciel G.E. Observation of spin exchange by two-dimensional Fourier transform 13C cross polarization magic-angle spinning.J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 462-475Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Constant time dipolar coupling and chemical shift (DIPSHIFT) experiments using frequency-switched Lee-Goldberg homonuclear decoupling (80-kHz decoupling field) were carried out to measure the 13C-1H dipolar couplings (22Munowitz M.G. Griffin R.G. Bodenhausen G. Huang T.H. Two-dimensional rotational spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance in solids: correlation of chemical shift and dipolar interactions.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 2529-2533Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). DIPSHIFT experiments were conducted as two-dimensional measurements, where each increment in the indirect dimension refers to one-time increment to sample the dipolar dephasing curve of the respective backbone signal. Spectra were only Fourier-transformed in the direct dimension, allowing us to directly read off the intensities of the dipolar dephasing curve in the indirect dimension for each resolved backbone signal. Thus, a single two-dimensional DIPSHIFT experiment provides the complete dipolar dephasing curve for each resolved carbon (23Huster D. Investigations of the structure and dynamics of membrane-associated peptides by magic angle spinning NMR.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2005; 46: 79-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After simulating the dipolar dephasing curve over one rotor period, the order parameter was derived by dividing the determined coupling by the known rigid limit (24Barré P. Zschörnig O. Arnold K. Huster D. Structural and dynamical changes of the bindin B18 peptide upon binding to lipid membranes. A solid-state NMR study.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8377-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Huster D. Xiao L. Hong M. Solid-state NMR investigation of the dynamics of the soluble and membrane-bound colicin Ia channel-forming domain.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7662-7674Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at a temperature of 303 K and a MAS frequency of 7 kHz. Aβ(1–40) fibrils were grown in 50 mm sodium borate buffer at pH 9. To assess the morphological homogeneity of the samples used in this study, Fig. 1 shows typical TEM pictures of four different preparations. TEM pictures of all eight peptide preparations are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. This choice of buffer system provided the most homogeneous Aβ preparations as can be assessed from the TEM pictures. We also compared the NMR spectra of Aβ(1–40) fibrils grown in sodium borate buffer at pH 9 with fibrils grown in sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (data not shown). The NMR spectra from both fibril preparations showed signals with identical chemical shifts; however, the fibrils prepared in borate buffer provided slightly narrower lines in the NMR spectra. Therefore, we continued our investigations with this system. To study the molecular dynamics of Aβ fibrils, we carried out solid-state NMR experiments. The DIPSHIFT pulse sequence (22Munowitz M.G. Griffin R.G. Bodenhausen G. Huang T.H. Two-dimensional rotational spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance in solids: correlation of chemical shift and dipolar interactions.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 2529-2533Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar) allowed us to measure the molecular order parameters of mature Aβ(1–40) fibrils prepared from the eight differently 13C/15N-labeled peptides in a site-specific manner. From this measurement of the backbone 13C-1H dipolar couplings, we determined the backbone order parameters to characterize the amplitude of motion for the Cα–Hα bond vectors. A fully rigid C–H bond would exhibit the maximal dipolar coupling strength of 22.8 kHz, corresponding to an order parameter of 1, whereas a value of 0 for the order parameter corresponds to fully isotropic motion expressed by a vanishing dipolar coupling. Molecular motions with a given amplitude lead to partial averaging of the dipolar coupling and can be characterized by a specific order parameter. The 13C-1H order parameters sample all motions with correlation times shorter than ∼10 μs. A plot of the backbone order parameter in mature Aβ fibrils at a hydration level of 50 weight % for the Cα atoms calculated from the measured couplings is shown in Fig. 2. Overall, the order parameters for the mature Aβ fibrils are rather high and never drop below 0.4. Typical dipolar dephasing curves of the MAS signals used for the determination of these order parameters of the Aβ preparations are given in supplemental Fig. S2. For Ile32 and Val40, two slightly different order parameters were determined from the NMR signals that exhibited two sets of isotropic chemical shifts. This corresponds to some structural heterogeneity within the fibrils that has already been observed in previous studies (2Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo Z. Yau W.M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Self-propagating, molecular level polymorphism in Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils.Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 3Paravastu A.K. Leapman R.D. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Molecular structural basis for polymorphism in Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18349-18354Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). We also carried out DIPSHIFT measurements on fibrils prepared at a hydration level of 75 weight % (data not shown). Within experimental error, no differences in the order parameters at these two hydration levels were found. To correlate these order parameters with secondary structure motifs in Aβ fibrils, we carried out 13C-13C correlation experiments and analyzed the isotropic chemical shifts of the 13C MAS NMR spectra of the individual Aβ preparations. Typical 13C MAS NMR spectra of our preparations are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. A plot of the secondary chemical shifts (i.e. the chemical shift deviation of a given residue from the random coil values) presented in Fig. 3 shows random coil-like chemical shifts at the peptide N terminus (residues 1–4 and 6–9). In addition, we found two β-sheet regions, comprising residues 11–22 and 30–38, which are connected by a segment with random coil-like chemical shifts, involving residues 23–29. Our isotropic chemical shift data (supplemental Table S1) agree well with existing literature values obtained with other samples of mature Aβ(1–40) fibrils (1Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J.

Soc. 2011; 133: 16013-16022Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This suggests a very similar secondary structure of the fibrils grown in borate buffer compared with the known models. We further note that the region connecting the two β-strands exhibits secondary chemical shifts that are highly variable and show multiple sets of chemical shifts at several positions (supplemental Table S1), which was also observed in previously reported Aβ(1–40) fibril preparations (2Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo Z. Yau W.M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Self-propagating, molecular level polymorphism in Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils.Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 3Paravastu A.K. Leapman R.D. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Molecular structural basis for polymorphism in Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18349-18354Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that the intervening loop connecting the two β-sheets is affected by significant structural polymorphism. As previous chemical shift measurements were carried out with samples that were obtained under significantly different fibrillation conditions and procedures, the presently observed similarities confirm that Aβ peptides adopt a rather well conserved peptide fold even when fibrillated under somewhat different physicochemical conditions. Comparison of the order parameters determined in this study with the identified secondary structural elements shows that the two β-sheet regions, along with the intervening loop, exhibit relatively high order parameters of 0.8–0.95. Such values are indicative of a very rigid peptide backbone structure. Such high order parameters would correspond to segmental motions with amplitudes of ∼15–30°. This is also consistent with previous evidence that a salt bridge between Asp23 and Lys26 (14Tycko R. Molecular structure of amyloid fibrils: insights from solid-state NMR.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 1-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 26Tarus B. Straub J.E. Thirumalai D. Dynamics of Asp23–Lys28 salt-bridge formation in Aβ(10–35) monomers.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 16159-16168Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) stabilizes this short connection and prevents larger backbone motions. The high order parameter values observed for the two central β-sheet regions also correspond well with literature data on the order of PABPN1 fibrils (19Sackewitz M. Scheidt H.A. Lodderstedt G. Schierhorn A. Schwarz E. Huster D. Structural and dynamical characterization of fibrils from a disease-associated alanine expansion domain using proteolysis and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 7172-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and fibrils of the human prion protein (20Helmus J.J. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. Jaroniec C.P. Conformational flexibility of Y145Stop human prion protein amyloid fibrils probed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Slightly lower order parameters (≤0.8) were obtained at the peptide N and C termini (residues 1–4, 7, and 40). This finding indicates that the terminal ends of the mature Aβ fibrils are less well structured than the more central regions. A particularly striking result of our data set is the fact that the first two residues in the Aβ sequence (Asp1 and Ala2) exhibit significantly higher order parameters than the subsequent amino acid (Glu3). This appears to be a very unique feature of the Aβ fibrils that is very unusual and generally not known for soluble proteins. We have also determined the line width of the NMR signals in the respective spectra of Aβ(1–40) fibrils (Fig. 4). Line widths represent a simple measure of the molecular dynamics and have also been analyzed for Aβ fibrils previously (1Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. A structural model for Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils based on experimental constraints from solid-state NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). The line widths for the labeled residues typically vary between ∼1 and 3 ppm, with only Ser8 showing a value of ∼4.5 ppm. There was no clear trend for in increase in the line width toward the N terminus. We have studied the molecular dynamics of mature Aβ(1–40) fibrils by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. 13C MAS NMR chemical shifts detected for the Aβ fibrils studied here agreed well with what has been observed in the literature (1Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. A structural model for Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils based on experimental constraints from solid-state NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Soc. 2011; 133: 16013-16022Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, we have presented a site-specific study of the molecular dynamics of the Cα backbone carbons. The dynamics data are presented as order parameters that provide information about the motional amplitude of the Cα–H bond vector in the protein backbone. A schematic projection of the order parameter values onto the known topology of Aβ fibrils is given in Fig. 5. Collectively, these data indicate the existence of significant structural stability at the peptide N terminus, which specifically affects the first two residues. At first sight, the motional analysis of the mature Aβ fibrils reveals no significant surprises. The two central β-strand elements exhibit high order parameters; molecular order is somewhat decreased in the connecting loop region and the N and C termini, respectively. However, two results of the motional analysis are particularly noteworthy; both concern the N terminus of the mature Aβ fibrils. First, the measured order parameters for the N terminus are still significantly higher than those associated with a purely thermally fluctuating random coil (which is typically ∼0.1–0.3 even under solid-state conditions) (19Sackewitz M. Scheidt H.A. Lodderstedt G. Schierhorn A. Schwarz E. Huster D. Structural and dynamical characterization of fibrils from a disease-associated alanine expansion domain using proteolysis and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 7172-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, such low order parameters would be expected to abolish or to strongly attenuate the cross-polarization signal of these protein parts (27Heise H. Hoyer W. Becker S. Andronesi O.C. Riedel D. Baldus M. Molecular level secondary structure, polymorphism, and dynamics of full-length α-synuclein fibrils studied by solid-state NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15871-15876Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), which was not observed here. Perhaps the tendency of Aβ peptides to form an additional β-strand for amino acids 4–7, which was also observed in some structural studies by solid-state (5Bertini I. Gonnelli L. Luchinat C. Mao J. Nesi A. A new structural model of Aβ40 fibrils.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 16013-16022Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and solution (7Olofsson A. Lindhagen-Persson M. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Ohman A. Amide solvent protection analysis demonstrates that amyloid β(1–40) and amyloid β(1–42) form different fibrillar structures under identical conditions.Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) NMR or molecular dynamics simulation (28Miller Y. Ma B. Nussinov R. The unique Alzheimer β-amyloid triangular fibril has a cavity along the fibril axis under physiological conditions.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 2742-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), can explain the absence of high molecular dynamics in this region. Second, the fact that the order parameters of the first two residues (Asp1 and Ala2) are actually higher than for Glu3 suggests that the N terminus represents a somewhat structurally confined segment that may also be stabilized in the course of peptide aggregation. The molecular dynamics of mature Aβ fibrils has not been systematically studied so far. Therefore, a comparison of our results with the literature can only be done on the basis of a 13C MAS NMR line width measurement carried out previously (1Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. A structural model for Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils based on experimental constraints from solid-state NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). This analysis reported large line widths of 3–5 ppm for the first ∼10 N-terminal residues, whereas the remainder of the sequence showed line widths of ∼2 ppm. This was interpreted as a structurally disordered N terminus. Although the line widths for our preparations of Aβ fibrils were rather homogeneous between 1 and 3 ppm over the entire peptide sequence (Fig. 4), we measured consistently lower order parameters for the N-terminal residues compared with the β-sheet and turn regions. Although the NMR line widths reflect both static structural heterogeneity and the influence of molecular dynamics, order parameters depend only on the fast protein dynamics. This supports the view that the N terminus of the Aβ fibrils is indeed more mobile than the rest of the protein; however, it does not represent a freely fluctuating polypeptide chain, which would have expressed lower order parameters. A recent molecular dynamics simulation showed that the conformational flexibility in the loop region of the mature Aβ fibrils is not significantly increased in comparison with the two opposing β-sheets (29Buchete N.V. Hummer G. Structure and dynamics of parallel β-sheets, hydrophobic core, and loops in Alzheimer Aβ fibrils.Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 3032-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which is also reflected in our experimental work. In the simulation, the conformational dynamics of the residues in the Aβ sequence increased toward the N terminus, starting at about Val12. Unfortunately, the first eight residues in the Aβ sequence were omitted in the simulation, so no comparison with the interesting dynamical behavior of these amino acids in the sequence observed in our experiments is possible. Finally, we compared our data with a recently published study on the structure and dynamics of Aβ protofibrils (15Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M. Solid-state NMR spectroscopic investigation of Aβ protofibrils: implication of a β-sheet remodeling upon maturation into terminal amyloid fibrils.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 2837-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The order parameter profiles for the two Aβ species show a high degree of agreement for most of the amino acids (supplemental Fig. S4), and deviations are mostly within the experimental error. Only Val12 and Lys16 show slightly higher order parameters in mature fibrils compared with protofibrils. This is probably caused by the reduced length of the first β-sheet in protofibrils (15Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M.

At the N terminus, the order parameters of the first two residues in protofibrils are again larger than for residue 3, underlining the putative importance of the N terminus in peptide aggregation and fibril formation. In fact, Asp1 exhibits yet a higher order parameter of 0.75 in Aβ protofibrils compared with 0.65 in mature Aβ fibrils. Also Phe4 has a higher value of 0.79 in protofibrils compared with our data on mature Aβ fibrils (0.61). Altogether, these results may suggest that the N terminus of the Aβ peptides could play a role in the maturation of Aβ fibrils. This is particularly interesting as, structurally, protofibrils show a stronger resemblance to oligomers than to mature Aβ fibrils (15Scheidt H.A. Morgado I. Rothemund S. Huster D. Fändrich M.

Dynamically, however, protofibrils are actually very similar to the mature Aβ fibrils, with the most pronounced differences in the N-terminal region. A next important step would certainly be a comprehensive dynamical characterization of Aβ oligomers. In summary, our data provide a comprehensive description of the fast molecular dynamics of mature Aβ fibrils, showing that the two β-sheets and the turn region linking these two structural elements are essentially rigid and well ordered. The termini undergo somewhat more dynamic reorientation; however, the first two N-terminal amino acids are again slightly more ordered, suggesting that this protein part could actually play a role in the structural biology of Aβ fibrils.

https://openalex.org/W2088977314,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system plays an important role in mammary gland biology as well as in the etiology of breast cancer. The IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), which mediates the biological actions of IGF-I and IGF-II, has emerged in recent years as a promising therapeutic target. The IGF and estrogen signaling pathways act in a synergistic manner in breast epithelial cells. The present study was aimed at investigating 1) the putative translocation of IGF-IR and the related insulin receptor (IR) to the nucleus in breast cancer cells, 2) the impact of IGF-IR and IR levels on IGF-IR biosynthesis in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-depleted breast cancer cells, and 3) the potential transcription factor role of IGF-IR in the specific context of IGF-IR gene regulation. We describe here a novel mechanism of autoregulation of IGF-IR gene expression by cellular IGF-IR, which is seemingly dependent on ER status. Regulation of the IGF-IR gene by IGF-IR protein is mediated at the level of transcription, as demonstrated by 1) binding assays (DNA affinity chromatography and ChIP) showing specific IGF-IR binding to IGF-IR promoter DNA and 2) transient transfection assays showing transactivation of the IGF-IR promoter by exogenous IGF-IR. The IR is also capable of translocating to the nucleus and binding the IGF-IR promoter in ER-depleted, but not in ER-positive, cells. However, transcription factors IGF-IR and IR display diametrically opposite activities in the context of IGF-IR gene regulation. Thus, whereas IGF-IR stimulated IGF-IR gene expression, IR inhibited IGF-IR promoter activity. In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism of IGF-IR gene autoregulation in breast cancer cells. The clinical implications of these findings and, in particular, the impact of IGF-IR/IR nuclear localization on targeted therapy require further investigation."

Channel inhibition by psalmotoxin-1 (PcTX-1) significantly inhibited migration and proliferation of D54-MG glioma cells. Both PcTX-1 and benzamil, an amiloride analog, caused cell cycle arrest of D54-MG cells in G(0)/G(1) phases (by 30 and 40%, respectively) and reduced cell accumulation in S and G(2)/M phases after 24 h of incubation. Both PcTX-1 and benzamil up-regulated expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Similar results were obtained in U87MG and primary glioblastoma multiforme cells maintained in primary culture and following knockdown of one of the component subunits, ASIC1. In contrast, knocking down δENaC, which is not a component of the glioma cation channel complex, had no effect on cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor expression. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also inhibited by PcTX-1, benzamil, and knockdown of ASIC1 but not δENaC in D54MG cells. Our data suggest that a specific cation conductance composed of acid-sensing ion channels and ENaC subunits regulates migration and cell cycle progression in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1997347624,"Several lines of evidence suggest that HAb18G/CD147 interacts with the integrin variants α3β1 and α6β1. However, the mechanism of the interaction remains largely unknown. In this study, mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT), a mammalian two-hybrid method, was used to study the CD147-integrin β1 subunit interaction. CD147 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells was interfered with by small hairpin RNA. Nude mouse xenograft model and metastatic model of HCC were used to detect the role of CD147 in carcinogenesis and metastasis. We found that the extracellular membrane-proximal domain of HAb18G/CD147 (I-type domain) binds at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site in the βA domain of the integrin β1 subunit, and Asp(179) in the I-type domain of HAb18G/CD147 plays an important role in the interaction. The levels of the proteins that act downstream of integrin, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phospho-FAK, were decreased, and the cytoskeletal structures of HCC cells were rearranged bearing the HAb18G/CD147 deletion. Simultaneously, the migration and invasion capacities, secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, colony formation rate in vitro, and tumor growth and metastatic potential in vivo were decreased. These results indicate that the interaction of HAb18G/CD147 extracellular I-type domain with the integrin β1 metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif activates the downstream FAK signaling pathway, subsequently enhancing the malignant properties of HCC cells."

Here we show by reporter assay that the activator protein 1 (AP1) (binding site in the promoter region of MMP-13 gene is primarily responsible for its transcriptional activation by Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling in osteosarcoma cell lines SaOS-2 and U2OS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that c-Jun and ATF2 are crucial transcription factors recruited to the AP1-binding site in the MMP-13 gene promoter during Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling in SaOS-2 cells. Using siRNA-mediated suppression or specific inhibitors, we also show that Dishevelled2 (Dvl2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are required for MMP-13 gene induction presumably via phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2 during Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling in SaOS-2 cells. Interestingly, Dvl2 and Rac1, but not Dvl3, are required for MMP-13 expression in SaOS-2 cells, whereas Dvl3, but not Dvl2 and Rac1, is required for its expression in U2OS cells, indicating the presence of distinct intracellular signaling machineries leading to expression of the same gene, in this case MMP-13 gene in different osteosarcoma cell lines. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling might also be required for expression of MMP-13 gene during the development of the cartilaginous tissue."

Cotreatment of VPA with 5-azaC in cells almost completely blocked this repression effect. Further co-immunoprecipitation assay and enzyme activity analysis demonstrated that SALL4 protein directly interacted with different DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and purified DNMT enzymatic activities from nuclear extracts. In addition, SALL4 isoforms co-occupied the same regions of its own promoter as DNMT corepressors, and ectopic overexpression of SALL4 led to increased CpG island promoter methylation of silenced genes in various cell types. These included primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, fibroblasts, and NB4 leukemic cells. In NB4 cells, treatment of cells with 5-azaC also caused decreased amounts of methylated alleles of SALL4 and PTEN and dramatically increased their mRNA expression. Our studies identify a new mechanism by which SALL4 represses gene expression through interaction with DNMTs. Furthermore, DNMTs and histone deacetylase repressors synergistically contribute to the regulatory effects of SALL4.

https://openalex.org/W2043825283,"Tumor differentiation factor (TDF) is a recently discovered protein, produced by the pituitary gland and secreted into the bloodstream. TDF and TDF-P1, a 20-amino acid peptide selected from the open reading frame of TDF, induce differentiation in human breast and prostate cancer cells but not in other cells. TDF protein has no identified site of action or receptor, and its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we used TDF-P1 to purify and identify potential TDF receptor (TDF-R) candidates from MCF7 steroid-responsive breast cancer cells and non-breast HeLa cancerous cells using affinity purification chromatography (AP), and mass spectrometry (MS). We identified four candidate proteins from the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family in MCF7 cells. Experiments in non-breast HeLa cancerous cells did not identify any TDF-R candidates. AP and MS experiments were validated by AP and Western blotting (WB). We additionally looked for TDF-R in steroid-resistant BT-549 cells and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF-a) using AP and WB. TDF-P1 interacts with potential TDF-R candidates from MCF7 and BT-549 breast cells but not from HeLa or HDF-a cells. Immunofluorescence (IF) experiments identified GRP78, a TDF-R candidate, at the cell surface of MCF7, BT-549 breast cells, and HeLa cells but not HDF-a cells. IF of other HSP70 proteins demonstrated labeling on all four cell types. These results point toward GRP78 and HSP70 proteins as strong TDF-R candidates and suggest that TDF interacts with its receptor, exclusively on breast cells, through a steroid-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1983796862,"Genetic variations in LRP6 gene are associated with high serum LDL cholesterol levels. We have previously shown that LDL clearance in peripheral B-lymphocytes of the LRP6(R611C) mutation carriers is significantly impaired. In this study we have examined the role of wild type LRP6 (LRP6(WT)) and LRP6(R611C) in LDL receptor (LDLR)-mediated LDL uptake. LDL binding and uptake were increased when LRP6(WT) was overexpressed and modestly reduced when it was knocked down in LDLR-deficient CHO (ldlA7) cells. These findings implicated LRP6 in LDLR-independent cellular LDL binding and uptake. However, LRP6 knockdown in wild type CHO cells resulted in a much greater decline in LDL binding and uptake compared with CHO-ldlA7 cells, suggesting impaired function of the LDLR. LDLR internalization was severely diminished when LRP6 was knocked down and was restored after LRP6 was reintroduced. Further analysis revealed that LRP6(WT) forms a complex with LDLR, clathrin, and ARH and undergoes a clathrin-mediated internalization after stimulation with LDL. LDLR and LRP6 internalizations as well as LDL uptake were all impaired in CHO-k1 cells expressing LRP6(R611C). These studies identify LRP6 as a critical modulator of receptor-mediated LDL endocytosis and introduce a mechanism by which variation in LRP6 may contribute to high serum LDL levels."
https://openalex.org/W1985152077,"RNA polymerase II initiates from low complexity sequences so cells must reliably distinguish ""real"" from ""cryptic"" promoters and maintain fidelity to the former. Further, this must be performed under a range of conditions, including those found within inactive and highly transcribed regions. Here, we used genome-scale screening to identify those factors that regulate the use of a specific cryptic promoter and how this is influenced by the degree of transcription over the element. We show that promoter fidelity is most reliant on histone gene transactivators (Spt10, Spt21) and H3-H4 chaperones (Asf1, HIR complex) from the replication-independent deposition pathway. Mutations of Rtt106 that abrogate its interactions with H3-H4 or dsDNA permit extensive cryptic transcription comparable with replication-independent deposition factor deletions. We propose that nucleosome shielding is the primary means to maintain promoter fidelity, and histone replacement is most efficiently mediated in yeast cells by a HIR/Asf1/H3-H4/Rtt106 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2052419236,"The Christmas γ-ray burst of 25 December 2010 (GRB 101225A, first detected by the Swift orbiting observatory) was a very unusual event. It was long lasting without the typical decreasing trend, its X-ray afterglow faded rapidly and its spectrum was atypical. Two papers in this issue offer very different explanations for these puzzling properties. Sergio Campana's group favours a comet crashing onto a neutron star as the cause of the outburst. Christina Thöne's group prefers a more conventional supernova mechanism, in this case involving a merger between a helium star and a neutron star. The tidal disruption of a solar-mass star around a supermassive black hole has been extensively studied analytically1,2 and numerically3. In these events, the star develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an eccentric orbit, the bound debris falls into the black hole, forming an accretion disk and emitting radiation4,5,6. The same process may occur on planetary scales if a minor body passes too close to its star. In the Solar System, comets fall directly into our Sun7 or onto planets8. If the star is a compact object, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. Indeed, one of the first mechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion of comets onto neutron stars in our Galaxy9. Here we report that the peculiarities of the ‘Christmas’ gamma-ray burst (GRB 101225A10) can be explained by a tidal disruption event of a minor body around an isolated Galactic neutron star. This would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compact stellar remnants more frequently than occurs in the Solar System or that minor-body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. A peculiar supernova associated with a gamma-ray burst provides an alternative explanation11."

We report the cloning from prostate cancer cells of new short splice variants of TRPM8, termed short TRPM8α and short TRPM8β. Our results show that both variants are in a closed configuration with the C-terminal tail of the full-length TRPM8 channel, resulting in stabilization of its closed state and thus reducing both its cold sensitivity and activity.

https://openalex.org/W2010035442,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was shown to play a role in Schwann cell myelination by recruiting Par3 to the axon-glial interface, but the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Here we report that Par3 regulates Rac1 activation by BDNF but not by NRG1-Type III in Schwann cells, although both ligands activate Rac1 in vivo. During development, active Rac1 signaling is localized to the axon-glial interface in Schwann cells by a Par3-dependent polarization mechanism. Knockdown of p75 and Par3 individually inhibits Rac1 activation, whereas constitutive activation of Rac1 disturbs the polarized activation of Rac1 in vivo. Polarized Rac1 activation is necessary for myelination as Par3 knockdown attenuates myelination in mouse sciatic nerves as well as in zebrafish. Specifically, Par3 knockdown in zebrafish disrupts proper alignment between the axon and Schwann cells without perturbing Schwann cell migration, suggesting that localized Rac1 activation at the axon-glial interface helps identify the initial wrapping sites. We therefore conclude that polarization of Rac1 activation is critical for myelination."

(i) Deletion of one or two turns in the α-helix in the C-terminal domain of catalytic β subunit at the rotor/stator contact region generates mutant F(1)s, termed F(1)(1/2)s, that rotate with about half of the normal torque.

(ii) Three different half-torque F(0)F(1)(1/2)s were purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. They carry out ATP-driven proton pumping and build up the same small transmembrane ΔpH, indicating that the final ΔpH is directly related to the amount of torque.

However, how the amino acid sequence of melittin contributes in its anti-inflammatory properties is mostly unknown. To determine the importance of the leucine zipper sequence of melittin in its neutralization of LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages and interaction with LPS, anti-inflammatory properties of melittin and its three analogues and their interactions with LPS were studied in detail. Two of these analogues, namely melittin Mut-1 (MM-1) and melittin Mut-2 (MM-2), possess leucine to alanine substitutions in the single and double heptadic leucine residue(s) of melittin, respectively, whereas the third analogue is a scrambled peptide (Mel-SCR) that contains the amino acid composition of melittin with minor rearrangement in its leucine zipper sequence. Although MM-1 partly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 and rat primary macrophage cells in the presence of LPS, MM-2 and Mel-SCR were negligibly active. A progressive decrease in interaction of melittin with LPS, aggregation in LPS, and dissociation of LPS aggregates with alteration in the leucine zipper sequence of melittin was observed. Furthermore, with alteration in the leucine zipper sequence of melittin, these analogues failed to exhibit cellular responses associated with neutralization of LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophage cells by melittin. The data indicated a probable important role of the leucine zipper sequence of melittin in neutralizing LPS-induced proinflammatory responses in macrophage cells as well as in its interaction with LPS."

However, experimental and theoretical investigations of the maximum attainable rates (1James B. Baum G. Perez J. Baum K.

Hydrogenases and hydrogen photoproduction in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 71-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both classes are O2 sensitive, requiring anoxic environments to function maximally (11Gallon J.R. Tansley Review no. 44. Reconciling the incompatible. N2 fixation and O2.New Phytol. 1992; 122: 571-609Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Here we shall describe the hydrogen metabolism by Cyanothece, a genus of unicellular, aerobic, nitrogen-fixing (diazotrophic) cyanobacteria. Unlike the heterocyst-forming diazotrophic cyanobacteria (e.g. Nostoc and Anabaena spp.) that spatially separate oxygen-evolving photosynthesis from oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation (11Gallon J.R. Tansley Review no. 44. Reconciling the incompatible. N2 fixation and O2.New Phytol. 1992; 122: 571-609Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar), Cyanothece performs strictly regulated temporal separation of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation (12Mitsui A.

Strategy by which nitrogen-fixing unicellular cyanobacteria grow photoautotrophically.Nature. 1986; 323: 720-722Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This temporal separation ensures that an intracellular anoxic environment conducive to nitrogenase activity is maintained. Deactivation of photosynthesis and an increased cellular respiration are thought to maintain this anoxia (12Mitsui A. Kumazawa S. Takahashi A. Ikemoto H. Cao S. Arai T.

Specifically, it has been shown in Cyanothece ATCC 51142 that one of the 4 copies of psbA, the gene encoding the D1 subunit of Photosystem II, is highly up-regulated throughout the dark phase of the circadian cycle. This isoform of D1 (psbA4) varies significantly from the isoforms expressed during the light phase, especially at the C-terminal residues involved in binding the manganese cluster and allowing O2 evolution (18Toepel J. Welsh E. Summerfield T.C. Pakrasi H.B. Sherman L.A. Differential transcriptional analysis of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. strain ATCC 51142 during light-dark and continuous-light growth.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3904-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that expression of this isoform and incorporation of the translated D1 protein into the reaction center would lead to a photosystem II (PSII) 2The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIPQplastoquinoneNDHNAD(P)H dehydrogenaseLEDlight emitting diodeEeinsteinDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaDNP2,4-dinitrophenolFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneDCCDN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimideChlchlorophyll. core incapable of evolving O2. Expression of this isoform during the dark phase would allow the cell to retain a viable PSII quaternary framework so that an active D1 can quickly be re-incorporated during the subsequent light phase. Illumination of Cyanothece while this inactive D1 was expressed could afford photobiological H2 production by enzymes normally sensitive to O2. A homolog of this isoform (psbA4) was found in the draft genome of the Cyanothece strain studied herein.The enzymatic reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia in Cyanothece is catalyzed by a molybdenum nitrogenase, the most common and most efficient of the nitrogenase classes. Molybdenum nitrogenase (nitrogenase hereafter) requires 16 ATP and 8 electrons per N2 fixed, with 2 of these electrons diverted to the obligate reduction of H+ to H2. The observed ratio of proton reduction to nitrogen reduction by this class of enzyme is at least 25% (from the reaction stoichiometry) and at maximum 100% (in the absence of N2, where the nitrogenase functions like an ATP-powered hydrogenase, requiring 4 ATP per H2 produced) (7McKinlay J.B. Harwood C.S. Photobiological production of hydrogen gas as a biofuel.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2010; 21: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Bothe H. Schmitz O. Yates M.G. Newton W.E. Nitrogen fixation and hydrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Of note, the alternative nitrogenases (V-nitrogenase and Fe-nitrogenase) found in some strains naturally favor a higher ratio of proton reduction to nitrogen reduction. Cyanothece species accumulate carbohydrate, primarily in the form of glycogen granules, during the day and subsequently degrade this carbohydrate at night to provide the energy and reductant for nitrogenase function and O2 respiration (19Schneegurt M.A. Sherman D.M. Nayar S. Sherman L.A. Oscillating behavior of carbohydrate granule formation and dinitrogen fixation in the cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. strain ATCC 51142.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This natural diurnal cycling, efficient conversion of intracellular carbohydrate to energy, efficient respiration and intracellular anoxia, and presence of both classes of hydrogen producing enzymes makes the Cyanothece species among the best candidates for H2 production (20Min H.

Miami BG 043511 in a photobioreactor.Mar. Biol. 2002; 140: 455-463Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Cyanothece sp. Miami BG 043511 is a marine strain that has been reported to possess both the bidirectional hydrogenase (class 3d, bidirectional NAD-linked H2ase) and nitrogenase, but lacks the membrane bound respiratory or “uptake” hydrogenase (class 2a, cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase) (22Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J. Classification and phylogeny of hydrogenases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), typically found expressed alongside nitrogenase (23Ludwig M. Schulz-Friedrich R. Appel J. Occurrence of hydrogenases in cyanobacteria and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Implications for the phylogenetic origin of cyanobacterial and algal hydrogenases.J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have, however, identified the complete gene coding for the “uptake” hydrogenase in the strain and have observed its transcription under both photoautotrophic and autofermentative conditions. 3N. J. Skizim and A. Krishnan, manuscript in preparation. We can therefore assert that all three hydrogen metabolizing enzymes found in cyanobacteria are present in this strain.NADH and reduced ferredoxin are direct substrates for bidirectional hydrogenases and nitrogenases, respectively, as established by in vitro assays of enzymes from multiple microorganisms (24Maróti J. Farkas A. Nagy I.K. Maróti G. Kondorosi E. Rákhely G. Kovács K.L. A second soluble Hox-type NiFe enzyme completes the hydrogenase set in Thiocapsa roseopersicina BBS.Appl. Environ.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The NADH-dependent reduction of H+ to H2 by hydrogenase is often cited as thermodynamically unfavorable, as the standard potential at pH 7 for NAD+/NADH is −320 mV, compared with −420 mV for H+/H2. However, standard conditions refer to 1 bar H2 pressure, conditions that are never found in biological cells. By contrast, the calculated thermodynamic redox potential for H+/H2 is nearly identical to that of NAD+/NADH in a 0.1% H2 atmosphere (1000 ppm or 0.001 bar) (26Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Investigating and exploiting the electrocatalytic properties of hydrogenases.Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4366-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Consequently, pyridine nucleotides can serve as efficient reductant sources under biological conditions, especially when H2 backpressure is minimized. In addition to NADH and reduced ferredoxin, NADPH can be utilized indirectly, either by the reduction of NADH catalyzed by the pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (if expressed and active), or by the reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool via NAD(P)H dehydrogenase and subsequent reduction of ferredoxin through excitation of PSI (Scheme 1).Cyanobacteria are known to possess two NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) enzymes to exchange reductant between NAD(P)H and the lipid-soluble PQ pool (27Howitt C.A. Udall P.K. Vermaas W.F. Type 2-NADH dehydrogenases in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 are involved in regulation rather than respiration.J.

Plant. 2004; 120: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NDH type-1 is homologous to Complex I of the respiratory chain of mitochondria and bacteria (the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase). Interestingly, however, of the 14 minimal subunits that form the complex in Escherichia coli, only 11 are found in the genomes of cyanobacteria. The missing subunits (genes nuoE, nuoF, and nuoG) encode the NADH dehydrogenase module, which in E. coli functions as the energy input device, and consequently the mechanism by which cyanobacteria use NAD(P)H via this enzyme is still unknown (30Battchikova N. Eisenhut M. Aro E.M. Cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes. Novel insights and remaining puzzles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence has verified that NADPH and NADH can both be oxidized by the complex in purified cyanobacterial membranes (29Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Paumann M. The respiratory chain of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria).Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and a variety of mechanisms for electron donation to the complex have been supposed; this remains an open question (30Battchikova N. Eisenhut M. Aro E.M. Cyanobacterial NDH-1 complexes. Novel insights and remaining puzzles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). NDH type-1 (NDH-1) is capable of oxidizing both NADH and NADPH and (of importance to the present study) translocates (pumps) protons upon each reducing equivalent (NAD(P)H) exchanged. NDH type-2 is comprised of a single subunit, does not pump protons, and can only oxidize NADH.The contribution of dark (autofermentative) hydrogen production arising from either hydrogenase- or nitrogenase-mediated pathways has been largely ignored in cyanobacteria. We show herein that hydrogen production in Cyanothece sp. Miami BG 043511 can be of the dark, autofermentative type (primarily via hydrogenase), as well as light induced (via nitrogenase). By utilizing monochromatic excitation sources and detection of dissolved hydrogen, we monitor the kinetics of hydrogen evolution from both light and dark pathways within the same experimental incubation, thus allowing visualization of the independent responses of each pathway (light and dark) to applied stresses. We show that both intracellular reductant and ATP availability are limiting factors for maximal photo-H2 production, and that by increasing reductant availability via dark anaerobic incubation, or by channeling the flow of reductant through one of the specific NADH dehydrogenases to increase ATP availability, we can substantially increase the rate of photo-H2 production.DISCUSSIONBy designing an experimental method that exposes Cyanothece to segments of both illumination and darkness during a single anoxic incubation, our electrochemical H2 sensor can observe (with high kinetic resolution) the response of both H2 producing enzymes to environmental and biochemical stresses and thereby allows the current mechanistic study. As such we are able to determine the relative contributions from hydrogenase and nitrogenase toward light- and dark-H2 production, identify shared pools for both processes, and indicate factors limiting the yield of each.The complete elimination of photo-H2 production when 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) is added to the sample (inhibiting electron flow through Photosystem I) can be attributed to loss of ATP generation from cyclic electron flow (photophosphorylation) and/or elimination of the production of reduced ferredoxin, based on the known outcome under aerobic conditions (36Falkowski P.G. Raven J.A. Aquatic Photosynthesis. Blackwell, Malden, MA1997: viiiGoogle Scholar). Both are obligate substrates for nitrogenase, and the complete elimination of photo-H2 under these conditions indicates that the sole enzyme responsible for photoinduced H2 production in Cyanothece is nitrogenase. Our data illustrate an increased capacity for photo-H2 production with increasing dark preincubation, independent of PSII-dependent water oxidation. This result indicates the tight coupling of photo-H2 to the dark, anaerobic metabolism, where substrate builds up and becomes kinetically more accessible as anaerobic conditions progress. This increased availability of reductant translates into a greater photo-H2 production rate once the pulsed illumination commences. ATP levels fall during dark anoxia (38Bennette N.B. Eng J.F. Dismukes G.C. An LC-MS-based chemical and analytical method for targeted metabolite quantification in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and thus only accumulation of reductant can be responsible for this increase due to dark time.Scheme 1 presents a minimal diagram of reductant and ATP generation to guide interpretation and assignment of the pathways. Under dark anoxia, cells catabolize their glycogen and sugar reserves to produce glucose 6-phosphate, which enters either glycolysis or the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to produce NADH or NADPH, respectively. Subsequent oxidation of pyruvate by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase generates reduced ferredoxin in the dark (pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase is the primary source of reduced ferredoxin during dark, anaerobic, and anabolic nitrogen fixation for unicellular nitrogen fixers (8Bothe H. Schmitz O. Yates M.G. Newton W.E. Nitrogen fixation and hydrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)). NAD(P)H has a reducing potential of −320 mV, substantially less than that of ferredoxin at −415 mV. As the latter is the obligate electron donor for nitrogenase-dependent H2 production, NAD(P)H can only convert into reduced ferredoxin through either (a) being energized by PSI and light, or (b) interconversion by ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase in the dark, a thermodynamically uphill reaction that requires buildup of NAD(P)H. Our results demonstrate the predominance of the former pathway, where catabolically generated NAD(P)H exchanges hydride (reductant) with the PQ pool via either of two NADPH dehydrogenases. This hydride is energized to the level of reduced ferredoxin and free proton (coupled to ATP generation) by photoexcitation of PSI and made available for nitrogenase. This sudden shift in equilibrium between NAD(P)H and reduced ferredoxin and ATP manifests as the sharp increase in hydrogen evolution observed upon illumination.Hydride exchange from NAD(P)H to the plastoquinone pool can occur in cyanobacteria by either of two NADH dehydrogenases present in the organism: NDH type-1 and NDH type-2. As mentioned earlier, NDH-1 translocates a proton from the stroma to lumen as it reduces plastoquinone (Scheme 1) and thus contributes to the intracellular proton gradient. NDH-2 lacks this ability. The channeling of all hydride flux from NAD(P)H to PQ through NDH-1 (rather than both NDH-1 and NDH-2) would provide the most ATP generation per hydride equivalent exchanged (by the proton pumping of NDH-1) and best accommodate the high ATP demand of nitrogenase. In the case of cells treated with flavone, we indeed see this effect. The maximal sustained (2.5 h) rate of hydrogen production in Cyanothece sp. Miami BG 043511 observed in these experiments was 16.4 μmol of H2 g dry weight−1 h−1 (15.8 ml of H2 liter−1 h−1) with flavone. To ensure that the increase in 735-photo-H2 was not due to an increase in the plastoquinone concentration (arising from regulatory effects of NDH-1 or NDH-2), we measured the PQ pool size and confirmed that it did not change following treatment with either flavone or rotenone (supplemental Fig. S3).Our findings reveal that of the two factors limiting the rate of nitrogenase mediated 735-photo-H2, reductant limitation is stronger than ATP limitation under most physiological conditions, as evidenced by the increase in 735-photo-H2 production rates with increasing prior dark time where reductant accumulates (supplemental Fig. S4), and by the decrease in H2 production rate as the illumination period exhausts the available pool. Only when cells have ample reductant available is an ATP limitation observed, leading to the observed increase in 735-photo-H2 when reductant flux is forced through NDH-1. Further evidence of reductant limitation as the most severe limitation is that photo-H2 production increases in the presence of exogenous reduced carbon (3.3-fold increase when 685 mm glycerol was added to cells). Our H2 production rate of unsupplemented stationary phase cells is 1.64 μmol of H2 mg of Chl−1 h−1. Based on carbohydrate degradation and hydrogen production yields after 20 h, our numbers correspond to a 24% energy conversion efficiency of carbohydrate to hydrogen from the strain.Higher rates have been reported by Borodin and colleagues (21Borodin V.B. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Manifestation of behavioral and physiological functions of Synechococcus sp. Miami BG 043511 in a photobioreactor.Mar. Biol. 2002; 140: 455-463Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) for the same strain grown in a photobioreactor where actively growing cells were held at a chlorophyll concentration of ∼4 μg/ml (6.3 ml of H2 liter−1 h−1, or calculated to 70 μmol of H2 mg of Chl−1 h−1). More recently, extremely high rates of 373 and 465 μmol of H2 mg of Chl−1 h−1 (the latter when supplemented with 50 mm glycerol) have been reported for Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 (39Bandyopadhyay A. Stöckel J. Min H. Sherman L.A. Pakrasi H.B. High rates of photobiological H2 production by a cyanobacterium under aerobic conditions.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 139Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). If confirmed, these would set a new benchmark, as they are significantly higher than the maximum rates published to date for both heterocystous diazotrophs (167.6 μmol of H2 mg of Chl−1 h−1 for Anabaena variabilis sp. ATCC 29413 PK84 mutant) (40Dutta D. De D. Chaudhuri S. Bhattacharya S.K. Hydrogen production by Cyanobacteria.Microb. Cell Fact. 2005; 4: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and for strains that produce H2 via the bidirectional hydrogenase only (3.1 μmol of H2 mg of Chl−1 h−1 for Arthrospira maxima (41Carrieri D. Ananyev G. Costas A.M.G. Bryant D.A. Dismukes G.C. Renewable hydrogen production by cyanobacteria. Nickel requirements for optimal hydrogenase activity.Int. J. Hydrogen Energy. 2008; 33: 2014-2022Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar)). However, our own attempt to replicate the glycerol rate data using the ATCC 51142 strain have yet to confirm these results, and the reported rates exceed the maximum theoretical rate of nitrogenase-mediated H2 production of 40 μmol of H2 mg of Chl−1 h−1 as calculated by Bothe et al. (8Bothe H. Schmitz O. Yates M.G. Newton W.E. Nitrogen fixation and hydrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) based on maximal carbon fixation rates of roughly 100 μmol mg of Chl−1 h−1 and a C/N ratio of 6 in cyanobacteria.It is interesting to note that whereas the addition of the protonophores decreases the yield of photo-H2, they substantially increase the dark-H2 production yield. This confirms that the two mechanisms of hydrogen production (light and dark) are catalyzed by different enzymes that respond differently to cellular energy stress. Although the decreased photophosphorylation with membrane uncouplers in the light serves to limit nitrogenase of its key energy source (ATP), under dark conditions this disruption stimulates the cell to accelerate the rate of carbohydrate catabolism and thus increase ATP generation by substrate level phosphorylation (glycolysis) (Scheme 1, step 8b). Faster carbohydrate catabolism under anoxia increases the ratio of NADH:NAD+ within the cell, which the bidirectional hydrogenase serves to alleviate by reducing protons to H2 and regenerating NAD+ (6McNeely K.

For instance, future improvements to cyanobacterial photo-H2 production via nitrogenases can be anticipated by: 1) maximizing the total pool size of carbohydrate (e.g. by growth in high salt media) and hence NADH and NADPH"

https://openalex.org/W1969065515,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling is negatively controlled by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, which induces proteasomal degradation of β-catenin as part of the β-catenin destruction complex. Amer2 (APC membrane recruitment 2; FAM123A) is a direct interaction partner of APC, related to the tumor suppressor Amer1/WTX, but its function in Wnt signaling is not known. Here, we show that Amer2 recruits APC to the plasma membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids via lysine-rich motifs and that APC links β-catenin and the destruction complex components axin and conductin to Amer2. Knockdown of Amer2 increased Wnt target gene expression and reporter activity in cell lines, and overexpression reduced reporter activity, which required membrane association of Amer2. In Xenopus embryos, Amer2 is expressed mainly in the dorsal neuroectoderm and neural tissues. Down-regulation of Amer2 by specific morpholino oligonucleotides altered neuroectodermal patterning, which could be rescued by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Lef1 that interferes with β-catenin-dependent transcription. Our data characterize Amer2 for the first time as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling both in cell lines and in vivo and define Amer proteins as a novel family of Wnt pathway regulators."

MKK4 and MKK7 are upstream kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), responsible for channeling physiological and environmental signals to their cellular responses. Both kinases are essential for survival of mouse embryos, but because of embryonic lethality, their precise developmental roles remain largely unknown. Using gene knock-out mouse ESCs, we studied the roles of MKK4 and MKK7 in differentiation in vitro. While MKK4 and MKK7 were dispensable for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency maintenance, they exhibited unique signaling and functional properties in differentiation. MKK4 and MKK7 complemented each other in activation of the JNK-c-Jun cascades and loss of both led to senescence upon cell differentiation. On the other hand, MKK4 and MKK7 had opposite effects on activation of the p38 cascades during differentiation. Specifically, MKK7 reduced p38 activation, while Mkk7(−/−) ESCs had elevated phosphorylation of MKK4, p38, and ATF2, and increased MEF2C expression. Consequently, Mkk7(−/−) ESCs had higher expression of MHC and MLC and enhanced formation of contractile cardiomyocytes. In contrast, MKK4 was required for p38 activation and Mkk4(−/−) ESCs exhibited diminished p-ATF2 and MEF2C expression, resulting in impaired MHC induction and defective cardiomyocyte differentiation. Exogenous MKK4 expression partially restored the ability of Mkk4(−/−) ESCs to differentiate into cardiomyocytes.

The MAP kinases (MAPKs) 4The abbreviations used are: MAPKMAP kinaseESCembryonic stem cellEBembryoid bodyFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateMKKmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. are a family of cytosolic kinases responsible for relaying extracellular signals to intracellular responses. In mammalian systems, there are three major MAPK subgroups: ERK (ERK1/2), JNK (1/2/3), and p38 (α/β/γ/δ), all activated through a conserved three-component MAP3K-MAP2K-MAPK signaling cascade (1Davis R.J. The mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this cascade, the MAP3Ks activate the MAP2Ks, which in turn catalyze MAPK phosphorylation and thereby their activation. There are six major MAPKKs with distinct specificity for MAPK phosphorylation (2Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Independent human MAP-kinase signal transduction pathways defined by MEK and MKK isoforms.Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). In principle, MEK1 and MEK2 are responsible for phosphorylation of ERK; MKK4 and MKK7 phosphorylate preferentially JNK, whereas, MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate p38. MAP kinase embryonic stem cell embryoid body fluorescein isothiocyanate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Gene knock-out studies in mice reveal that several of the MAPK signaling events are essential for embryonic development, while analyses of knock-out ESCs provide additional information on how each MAPK contributes to the developmental programs. Collectively, these studies show that the MAPKs are dispensable for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency, but have developmental stage-specific roles in lineage commitment.

Additionally, the JNK1 isoform is shown to repress Wnt4, Wnt6, and BMP4 expression, thereby potentiating neuronal differentiation while blocking epithelial differentiation (13Amura C.R. Marek L.

Mice lacking either MKK4 or MKK7 display an analogous embryonic lethal phenotype that may be attributed, at least in part, to insufficient JNK activation (16Ganiatsas S. Kwee L. Fujiwara Y.

On the other hand, MKK4 and MKK7 have distinct expression pattern and their knock-out embryos exhibit certain unique phenotypic features, suggesting that these MAPKKs have distinct downstream targets in addition to their common effects on JNK. For example, MKK4, but not MKK7, has been shown to phosphorylate p38; however, MKK4 in this case is redundant to MKK3 and MKK6, and the MKK4-p38 cascade is therefore considered non-essential for any biological processes (2Dérijard B.

While the gene knock-out studies have certainly establish that MKK4 and MKK7 are essential for embryogenesis, the knock-out fetuses die at an early stage of development, precluding a clear understanding of how these kinases are involved in developmental processes. Embryonic development starts with fertilization of the ovum, followed by rapid mitotic division and differentiation of ESCs. The ESCs first commit to ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm lineages, followed by more restricted differentiation toward specific fates (21Downs K.M. Davies T. Staging of gastrulating mouse embryos by morphological landmarks in the dissecting microscope.Development. 1993; 118: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These processes ultimately lead to the generation of over 220 different mammalian cell types that are organized into tissues to provide all the functions required for viability and reproduction. The ESCs captured from the pre-implantation embryo can be expanded in vitro for extended periods of time (22Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12274) Google Scholar). These cells are able to either self-renew while they maintain pluripotency or differentiate to give arise to a broad spectrum of lineages (23Smith A.G. Embryo-derived stem cells: of mice and men.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 24Keller G. Embryonic stem cell differentiation: emergence of a new era in biology and medicine.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1129-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Because many of the regulatory machineries effective for embryonic development in vivo also control ESC differentiation in vitro, the in vitro system has emerged as a valuable tool to investigate basic mechanisms in development. The in vitro system is particularly useful to analyze specific gene function in conjunction with knock-out cell lines, especially in the cases when the gene product is required for survival of the embryos in vivo. In the present study, we combined the in vitro ESC differentiation and gene knock-out systems and investigated the roles of MKK4 and MKK7 in mesoderm lineage differentiation. Our results uncovered complementary and unique signaling and functional properties of MKK4 and MKK7 in lineage commitment and differentiation of cardiomyocytes. Results from this work provided new insights into the roles the stress-activated MKK4 and MKK7 play in directing differentiation and govern tissue development.

For in vitro differentiation, the mESCs were cultured in the absence of feeder cells and followed the EB protocol as described (31Gribaldo L. Alison M. Andrews P.W. Bremer S. Donovan P.J.

The cells (20 μl) were applied to the lid of bacterial plates and cultured as “hanging drops” in a CO2 incubator for 3 days to form EBs. The EBs were transferred to a 10 cm2 bacterial plate at ∼100 EBs per plate for 2 days, after which (on day 5), the EBs were transferred to either 10 cm2 or 24-well plates at 1 EB/well. The EBs were observed under microscope and the contractile phenotype was quantified, and RNA and proteins extracted at different days of culture were examined. ESCs at various differentiation days were transfected with 0.3 μg of 2xMef2c-TATA-firefly luc/pGL2 and 0.1 μg β-actin-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids. The cell lysates were examined at 24 h after transfection for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, according to the manufacture's manual (Invitrogen). The relative luciferase activity was calculated based on the ratio of firefly to Renilla activities, with the values in undifferentiated ESCs set as 1. To generate Nkx2.5-ES cell line, pNkx2.5PuroIRES2eGFP was transfected into wild type ES cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. To reconstitute MKK4 expression, the Mkk4(−/−) ESCs were co-transfected with MKK4/SRα and hygromycine/pUC plasmids. Transfected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycine for 3 days, and then in 150 μg/ml for 2 weeks. After selection, single clones were isolated and maintained in 300 μg/ml G418 or 150 μg/ml hygromycine, respectively. Integration of the plasmid DNA was confirmed by PCR genotyping of the genomic DNA isolated from individual stable clones (data not shown). Experiments were done as described previously (25Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. JNKK1 organizes a MAP kinase module through specific and sequential interactions with upstream and downstream components mediated by its amino-terminal extension.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GST-fusion proteins were incubated with 500 μg of cell lysates at 4 °C for 2–4 h, and in some experiments, 100 μg of cell lysates were used for an in vitro kinase assay using GST-MKK4 as a substrate. The fusion proteins were purified with GST Sepharose beads, and were either directly subjected to Western blotting analyses, or used to phosphorylate GST-p38 in an in vitro kinase assay, followed by a Western blotting analysis. Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated ESCs and EBs at different days of differentiation. The RNAs were used for reverse transcription to generate cDNA, while cDNA was used for real-time PCR as described before (32Peng Z. Peng L. Fan Y. Zandi E. Shertzer H.G. Xia Y.

The ΔCt value for each sample was determined using the cycle threshold (CT) value of the specific gene normalized to the CT of Gapdh. The fold change was calculated based on the expression in differentiated versus un-differentiated (control) samples, designated as 1. ChIP was performed following procedures described (33Schnekenburger M. Peng L. Puga A. HDAC1 bound to the Cyp1a1 promoter blocks histone acetylation associated with Ah receptor-mediated trans-activation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1769: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The precipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR, using 6 sets of primers that cover the region between −2.0 kbp and +1 bp of the mouse Mhca promoters. The ΔCt value for each sample was determined using the cycle threshold (CT) value of ChIP DNA normalized to the CT of input DNA. The ΔΔCT was calculated by subtracting control ΔCT values from the corresponding experimental ΔCT. The qRT-PCR results are shown as fold change in specific antibody immunoprecipitation over IgG nonspecific immunoprecipitation controls. The ES cells and EBs were grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslip for different days and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 20 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with rhodamine isothiocyanate- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecule Probes) and Hoechst for nuclei staining at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were examined and pictures were captured using a Zeiss Axio microscope. The fluorescence intensity was quantified, while the relative intensity of rhodamine and FITC was calculated by comparison to that of Hoechst. Data represent the average ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed using analysis of ANOVA or Student's two-tailed paired t test. *, p value <0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001 are considered significant. To evaluate the roles of MKK4 and MKK7 in development, we examined the growth and differentiation of wild type and knock-out ESCs lacking MKK4, MKK7 or both. The knock-out ESCs were similar to the wild type in growth rate and expression of pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG under stem cell growth conditions (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Expression of OCT4 was diminished in ESCs of all the genotypes under differentiation conditions, while expression of MKK4 and MKK7 was consistent with the genotype of the cells and was unaffected by differentiation. Additionally, all the ESCs displayed about 70% efficiency of forming EB regardless their genotype (supplemental Fig. S1C). While the wild type, Mkk4(−/−) and Mkk7(−/−) EBs were morphologically indistinguishable, forming spread and multi-layered colonies, the Mkk4(−/−)/Mkk7(−/−) EBs were clearly different. The compound mutant EBs began to detach on day 6 and displayed significantly reduced density and thinner cell layers on day 13 (Fig. 1A). To determine why the Mkk4(−/−)/Mkk7(−/−) EBs had reduced density, we examined cell proliferation and apoptosis. The EB colonies of different genotypes displayed the same extent of apoptosis; however, the Mkk4(−/−)Mkk7(−/−) EBs had reduced cell number while a marked increase of senescence associated gene expression (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1D). Specifically, Mkk4(−/−)Mkk7(−/−) EBs had significantly higher expression of Transgelin (Sm22), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21) and prosaposin, than wild type, Mkk4(−/−), and Mkk7(−/−) EBs. As these genes are all markers of senescence (34Yu A.L. Birke K. Moriniere J. Welge-Lüssen U. TGF-{β}2 induces senescence-associated changes in human trabecular meshwork cells.Invest Ophthalmol. Vis.

Exploration of senescence-associated genes by differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction: prosaposin as a novel senescence-associated gene.Arch. Pharm. Res. 2009; 32: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), our results suggest that loss of MKK4 and MKK7, while having no effects on stem cell survival, potentiates senescence upon differentiation. The morphological features of the Mkk4(−/−)Mkk7(−/−) EBs are remarkably similar to those described for the Jnk1(−/−)Jnk2(−/−), which are fully competent for self-renewal, but are unable to proliferate and become senescent upon differentiation (12Xu P. Davis R.J. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase is required for lineage-specific differentiation but not stem cell self-renewal.Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 30: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such similarity raises the possibility that loss of MKK4 and MKK7 impairs activation of the JNK cascades. To test this possibility, we examined phosphorylation of JNK in wild type and knock-out ESCs at various days of in vitro differentiation. By Western blotting analyses, we found that phosphorylation of JNK in wild type was undetectable in undifferentiated and early stage differentiated ESCs (day 3), whereas it became readily detectable at later stage (day 9–14) differentiation (Fig. 2A). Ablation of MKK4 or MKK7 markedly reduced p-JNK, while ablation of both completely abolished it. Consistent with the Western blotting data, immunostaining detected p-JNK positive cells being most abundant in wild type, less so in Mkk4(−/−) and Mkk7(−/−), and almost completely absent in Mkk4(−/−)Mkk7(−/−) EBs at 13 days of differentiation (Fig. 2B). One consequence of JNK activation is the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 and 73 (36Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Identification of an oncoprotein- and UV-responsive protein kinase that binds and potentiates the c-Jun activation domain.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar), and accordingly, p-c-Jun was absent in undifferentiated ESCs while it was present in late stage differentiated wild type ESCs (Fig. 2C). Compared with its level in wild type ESCs, p-c-Jun was slightly reduced in cells lacking either MKK4 or MKK7, but markedly decreased in cells lacking both (Fig. 2, C and D). The JNK-c-Jun cascades therefore are quiescent in undifferentiated ESCs, but become activated upon differentiation in a MKK4/MKK7-dependent manner. In addition to activation of the JNK-c-Jun cascade, phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), implicated in neurogenesis and cardiogenesis (37Wang J. Ma H. Tong C. Zhang H.

Furthermore, expression of c-Jun and c-Fos, known as differentiation factors induced by the AP-1 transcriptional complex (40Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. Osteoblasts are target cells for transformation in c-fos transgenic mice.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), was increased upon differentiation. The basal and induced levels of c-Jun and c-Fos were similar in wild type, Mkk4(−/−) and Mkk7(−/−) cells, but were undetectable in Mkk4(−/−)Mkk7(−/−) cells. On the other hand, expression of JNK and β-actin remained constant regardless of differentiation or gene knock-out status, suggesting that lack of c-Jun and c-Fos in the double knock-out cells was not due to global reduction of cellular proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2139648632,"Dbf4 is a conserved eukaryotic protein that functions as the regulatory subunit of the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) complex. DDK plays essential roles in DNA replication initiation and checkpoint activation. During the replication checkpoint, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dbf4 is phosphorylated in a Rad53-dependent manner, and this, in turn, inhibits initiation of replication at late origins. We have determined the minimal region of Dbf4 required for the interaction with the checkpoint kinase Rad53 and solved its crystal structure. The core of this fragment of Dbf4 folds as a BRCT domain, but it includes an additional N-terminal helix unique to Dbf4. Mutation of the residues that anchor this helix to the domain core abolish the interaction between Dbf4 and Rad53, indicating that this helix is an integral element of the domain. The structure also reveals that previously characterized Dbf4 mutants with checkpoint phenotypes destabilize the domain, indicating that its structural integrity is essential for the interaction with Rad53. Collectively, these results allow us to propose a model for the association between Dbf4 and Rad53."
https://openalex.org/W2094425441,"We report that Sh3rf2, a homologue of the pro-apoptotic scaffold POSH (Plenty of SH3s), acts as an anti-apoptotic regulator for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sh3rf2 promotes apoptosis of neuronal PC12 cells, cultured cortical neurons, and C6 glioma cells. This death appears to result from activation of JNK signaling. Loss of Sh3rf2 triggers activation of JNK and its target c-Jun. Also, apoptosis promoted by Sh3rf2 knockdown is inhibited by dominant-negative c-Jun as well as by a JNK inhibitor. Investigation of the mechanism by which Sh3rf2 regulates cell survival implicates POSH, a scaffold required for activation of pro-apoptotic JNK/c-Jun signaling. In cells lacking POSH, Sh3rf2 knockdown is unable to activate JNK. We further find that Sh3rf2 binds POSH to reduce its levels by a mechanism that requires the RING domains of both proteins and that appears to involve proteasomal POSH degradation. Conversely, knockdown of Sh3rf2 promotes the stabilization of POSH protein and activation of JNK signaling. Finally, we show that endogenous Sh3rf2 protein rapidly decreases following several different apoptotic stimuli and that knockdown of Sh3rf2 activates the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway in neuronal cells. These findings support a model in which Sh3rf2 promotes proteasomal degradation of pro-apoptotic POSH in healthy cells and in which apoptotic stimuli lead to rapid loss of Sh3rf2 expression, and consequently to stabilization of POSH and JNK activation and cell death.

Eukaryotic cells depend on signal transduction pathways to allow them to respond to various extracellular stimuli. The evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are sequential kinase cascades involved in a variety of complex physiologic processes such as cell survival, apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, and migration (1Chang L. Karin M. Mammalian MAP kinase signalling cascades.Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4381) Google Scholar). In these pathways, a stimulus causes the activation of a serine/threonine protein kinase (MAPK kinase kinase), which in turn activates a MAPK kinase. The MAPK kinases activate the MAPKs through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues within a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif. The MAPKs then phosphorylate various downstream effectors including members of the AP1 family of transcription factors, which alter the transcription of target genes. In mammals, three families of MAPKs, the p38 MAPKs, the extracellular-signal related kinases (ERKs), and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNKs) have been identified (1Chang L. Karin M. Mammalian MAP kinase signalling cascades.Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4381) Google Scholar). Stresses including DNA damage, trophic factor deprivation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress activate the JNKs, which play a key role in apoptosis following these stimuli (2Bruckner S.R. Tammariello S.P.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1901-1912PubMed Google Scholar). Three distinct genes encode at least 10 distinct isoforms of JNKs. JNK isoforms appear to have especially important physiologic roles in cell death within the nervous system. Gene deletion studies identified a key role for jnk1 and jnk2 in apoptosis in the developing brain (5Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. The Jnk1 and Jnk2 protein kinases are required for regional specific apoptosis during early brain development.Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In addition, hippocampal neurons from jnk3−/− mice are resistant to excitotoxicity-induced death by kainic acid (6Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincón M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P.

Absence of excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus of mice lacking the Jnk3 gene.Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) and sympathetic neurons cultured from these animals exhibit decreases in c-Jun phosphorylation and in apoptosis in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation (2Bruckner S.R.

The JNK pathway also participates in neuronal injury in vivo following a variety of insults including acoustic trauma (7Wang J. Van De Water T.R. Bonny C. de Ribaupierre F. Puel J.L. Zine A.

Increasing evidence suggests that kinase cascades organize into functional modules, in some cases with the help of scaffold proteins. In yeast, members of the MAPK pheromone response pathway interact with the scaffold protein Ste5, and this interaction is required for effective signaling through this pathway (12Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Ste5 tethers multiple protein kinases in the MAP kinase cascade required for mating in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In mammals, the JNK-interacting proteins, JIP1, JIP2, and JIP3, are homologous scaffold proteins involved in the JNK pathway (13Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. The JIP group of mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffold proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The JIPs interact with MKK4/7 and the JNKs and potentiate activation of JNK by upstream signals. Importantly, activation of the JNK pathway in response to excitotoxicity or oxygen-glucose deprivation in hippocampal cultures requires JIP1 (14Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Davis R.J. Requirement of the JIP1 scaffold protein for stress-induced JNK activation.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, JIP1 appeared to be anti-apoptotic when overexpressed following specific stimuli (15Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. A cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway.Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the molar ratio of individual pathway components is important for determining the fate of the cell. Thus, over- or underexpression of a scaffold protein might promote or prevent apoptosis, and this might be context specific. For example, an increase in JIP1 might segregate components of the pathway from one another, preventing their efficient activation, whereas underexpression may also prevent apoptosis by impairing assembly of the signaling cascade. Another JNK scaffold protein POSH (Plenty of SH3s) 4The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology domain 3MLKmixed lineage kinaseJIPJNK-interacting protein. was initially identified as a Rac1-binding protein with four SH3 domains (16Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. A new rac target POSH is an SH3-containing scaffold protein involved in the JNK and NF-κB signalling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). POSH binds to the active (GTP-bound) form of Rac and promotes apoptosis when overexpressed (16Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A.

Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As part of its scaffold function, POSH interacts directly with members of the MLK (mixed lineage kinase) MKKK family and promotes their activation (16Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. A new rac target POSH is an SH3-containing scaffold protein involved in the JNK and NF-κB signalling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. POSH acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex that mediates JNK activation in apoptosis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It also interacts indirectly with MKK4/7 and the JNKs through its interaction with the JIPs (19Kukekov N.V. Xu Z. Greene L.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15517-15524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this capacity, the POSH-JIP interaction leads to formation of a multiprotein complex (POSH-JIP apoptotic complex or PJAC) that brings together key components of the JNK activation cascade. As with the JIPs, POSH is required for c-Jun activation and apoptosis in response to multiple stimuli including NGF deprivation in neuronal PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons (17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. POSH acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex that mediates JNK activation in apoptosis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and in vivo cerebral ischemia (20Zhang Q.G.

Neurochem. 2005; 95: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Src homology domain 3 mixed lineage kinase JNK-interacting protein. Because of its pro-apoptotic activity, levels of POSH appear to be tightly controlled. In healthy cells, POSH levels are low due to rapid turnover of the protein. In response to apoptotic stimuli, POSH appears to be stabilized, thereby permitting formation of a sufficient number of PJAC complexes to drive apoptosis (18Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Regulation of apoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling by a stabilization-based feed-forward loop.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which cellular levels of POSH protein are regulated are presently only partially understood. POSH has a RING domain that has a putative E3 ligase function (17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. POSH acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex that mediates JNK activation in apoptosis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Kim G.H. Park E.

Signal. 2006; 18: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the presence of the RING domain appears to be required for the rapid turnover of POSH. Beyond this, however, the means of POSH turnover in healthy cells are unknown. Likewise, the events that lead to POSH stabilization under apoptotic conditions are not fully clear. One mechanism appears to be a “feed-forward” loop in which activation of JNKs in turn promotes POSH stability (18Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Regulation of apoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling by a stabilization-based feed-forward loop.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, this does not fully account for the increase in POSH levels with apoptotic stimuli and additional mechanisms remain to be described. We previously identified a homologue of POSH, “POSH2,” which contains three SH3 domains as well as a RING domain (22Wilhelm M. Kukekov N.V. Xu Z. Greene L.A. Identification of POSH2, a novel homologue of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase scaffold protein POSH.Dev. Neurosci. 2007; 29: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (NCBI Ref Seq NM_001034187, Sh3rf2). However, a different POSH homologue in humans has also been identified that contains four SH3 domains and is therefore more appropriately called POSH2 (23Kärkkäinen S. Hiipakka M. Wang J.H. Kleino I. Vähä-Jaakkola M. Renkema G.H. Liss M. Wagner R. Saksela K. Identification of preferred protein interactions by phage-display of the human Src homology-3 proteome.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore use the names Sh3rf2 or POSHER (POSH-eliminating RING protein) throughout this manuscript. As in the case of POSH, overexpression of Sh3rf2 promotes JNK activation and apoptosis of neuronal PC12 cells (22Wilhelm M. Kukekov N.V. Xu Z. Greene L.A. Identification of POSH2, a novel homologue of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase scaffold protein POSH.Dev. Neurosci. 2007; 29: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we report that in contrast to siRNA-mediated knockdown of POSH, which is protective, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sh3rf2 promotes apoptotic cell death. This indicates that unlike POSH, endogenous Sh3rf2 has anti-apoptotic activity. We further show that siRNA-mediated “knockdown” of endogenous Sh3rf2 promotes POSH stabilization and, consequentially, activation of the JNK cascade and apoptosis of multiple cell types. In healthy cells, Sh3rf2 binds to POSH and promotes its degradation via a mechanism that requires the RING domains of both proteins, although this domain is not required for their interaction. Finally, we show that degradation of Sh3rf2 rapidly occurs following trophic factor deprivation and DNA damage and knockdown of Sh3rf2 promotes apoptosis of healthy neurons. These findings support a model in which Sh3rf2/POSHER protects healthy cells from apoptotic death by promoting turnover of POSH, and in which apoptotic stimuli lead to degradation of Sh3rf2 and consequent stabilization of POSH and activation of apoptotic JNK signaling.

We generated a vector expressing shSh3rf2 under control of the U6 promoter, which targets this same sequence, using the instructions for the pU6-siRNA vector. For PCR of Sh3rf2 from various tissues, we used primers 5′-GAGTGAGAACCAGGATTGCCTGACCTTCCTC-3′, and GGCTGTAATTCTGAAATCTCACGGTTTTGAC. For qRT-PCR we generated intron-spanning primers for the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A (PPIA) 5′-GGTCCTGGCATCTTGTCCAT and 3′-GCCTTCTTTCACCTTCCCAAA and for Sh3rf2, 5′-TTATCCACCTCCTCTGTGTCCTC and 3′-TCCCTGATTGAACTGGTCTCTG using Primer3 software. Adenovirus expressing shRNAs were produced using the BLOCK-IT Adenoviral RNAi Expression System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The inserted sequences were: Sh3rf2 (top), CACCGAAGCAAGTCAAAACCGTGAGACGAATCTCACGGTTTTGACTTG, Sh3rf2 (bottom), AAAAGCAAGTCAAAACCGTGAGATTCGTCTCACGGTTTTGACTTGCTTC, and control (top), CACCGAATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTCGAAACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAA, control (bottom), AAAATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTTTCGACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAATTC. These sequences generate an shRNA targeting the same sequence as siSh3rf2 (bp 1930–1950). Lentiviral expression constructs were generated using the Sigma Mission lentiviral pLKO.1-puro vector as per the manufacturer's instructions. We used one of the predetermined Sh3rf2 targeting vectors with the cDNA insert CCGGGACATCAGTTATCACGCACAACTCGAGTTGTGCGTGATAACTGATGTCTTTTTG, which targets bp 794–814 of the mouse Sh3rf2 sequence. The Sigma nonsilencing vector was used as the control. HEK293 cells were maintained in 1× DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Culture of PC12 cells, both naive and neuronally differentiated was performed as previously described as was NGF deprivation of PC12 cells (17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A.

Primary cortical cultures were prepared from E18 mouse or rat pups as previously described (26Westmark C.J. Malter J.S. FMRP mediates mGluR5-dependent translation of amyloid precursor protein.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. The final concentration of SP600125 was 20 μm. The final concentration of MG132 was 20 μm. The final concentration of DJNKi1 was 5 μm. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting and in vitro binding assays were performed as previously described (17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. POSH acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex that mediates JNK activation in apoptosis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent signals were digitally acquired using a Kodak Image Station 4000MM and Kodak Molecular Imaging Software version 4.0.0 or with the LiCor Odyssey system. Bands were identified visually and relative intensity was determined using either Kodak or Odyssey software or NIH ImageJ. For the in vitro binding assays, constitutively active (V-) and inactive (N-) Rac1 were subcloned into the PGEX vector. GST-Rac1 (V- or N-) were purified as previously described (17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. POSH acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex that mediates JNK activation in apoptosis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). POSH and Sh3rf2 were used for in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Incubation, washing, and resolution of radiolabeled proteins was performed as previously described (27Wilhelm M. Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Gire S. Greene L.A.

Cellular material was mixed extensively in 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Initial extraction of total RNA was performed in chloroform followed by precipitation in 75% ethanol. Clean up of RNA was performed using the RNeasy Mini Protocol for RNA cleanup (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with final ethanol precipitation in 3 m NaOAc. Purity and concentration of each sample was verified by determination of the A260/A280 nm ratio, with an output of 1.8–2. cDNA for qRT-PCR was synthesized using 1 μg of purified RNA and random hexamers (Invitrogen). Reactions were run on a Lightcycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics) for 45 cycles. Data were normalized to expression in the housekeeping gene, cyclophilin A, and relative values were determined. Strip counting to determine cell survival was performed as previously described (17Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. POSH acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex that mediates JNK activation in apoptosis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nuclear morphology was examined using Hoechst 33342 staining. The individual who carried out the counting was blinded to the experimental groups in all cases. TUNEL labeling was performed using the Click-iT® TUNEL Alexa Fluor® 488 Imaging Assay. A minimum of 100 cells were counted in each condition. Each experiment (in triplicate) was performed a minimum of three separate times. Comparisons between groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise t-tests or Student-Newman-Keuls for comparisons between more than one pair. Given the structural homology to POSH, and the JNK activation that occurs when Sh3rf2 is overexpressed (22Wilhelm M. Kukekov N.V. Xu Z. Greene L.A. Identification of POSH2, a novel homologue of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase scaffold protein POSH.Dev. Neurosci. 2007; 29: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we postulated that Sh3rf2 might bind to components of the JNK pathway. To determine whether Sh3rf2 is capable of binding to upstream members of the JNK pathway, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitations. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, MLK2 and DLK were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antiserum when co-expressed with FLAG-Sh3rf2, but not when co-expressed with empty GFP vector. Furthermore, JIP1, -2, and -3 also co-immunoprecipitated with Sh3rf2 (supplemental Fig. S1B). The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations revealed similar results (data not shown). As seen in supplemental Fig. S1B, the interaction between Sh3rf2 and JIP1 appears stronger than that with JIP2 and JIP3. These observations indicate that overexpressed Sh3rf2, like POSH with which it bears considerable structural similarity, binds multiple members of the JNK pathway. However, because such studies were performed under conditions of overexpression, they left open the role of Sh3rf2 under physiologic conditions. Because POSH was originally detected as a binding partner for activated Rac1, we assessed whether this was also the case for Sh3rf2. When the sequences of POSH and Sh3rf2 are compared, the region of Sh3rf2 corresponding to the putative Rac1-binding site of POSH identified by Tapon et al. (16Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. A new rac target POSH is an SH3-containing scaffold protein involved in the JNK and NF-κB signalling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) has lower homology than other defined domains (22Wilhelm M.

https://openalex.org/W1972159625,"Growing evidence indicates that the protein regulators governing protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity have crucial functions because their deletion drastically affects cell growth and division. PP1 has been found to be essential in Plasmodium falciparum, but little is known about its regulators. In this study, we have identified a homolog of Inhibitor-3 of PP1, named PfI3. NMR analysis shows that PfI3 belongs to the disordered protein family. High affinity interaction of PfI3 and PfPP1 is demonstrated in vitro using several methods, with an apparent dissociation constant K(D) of 100 nm. We further show that the conserved (41)KVVRW(45) motif is crucial for this interaction as the replacement of the Trp(45) by an Ala(45) severely decreases the binding to PfPP1. Surprisingly, PfI3 was unable to rescue a yeast strain deficient in I3 (Ypi1). This lack of functional orthology was supported as functional assays in vitro have revealed that PfI3, unlike yeast I3 and human I3, increases PfPP1 activity. Reverse genetic approaches suggest an essential role of PfI3 in the growth and/or survival of blood stage parasites because attempts to obtain knock-out parasites were unsuccessful, although the locus of PfI3 is accessible. The main localization of a GFP-tagged PfI3 in the nucleus of all blood stage parasites is compatible with a regulatory role of PfI3 on the activity of nuclear PfPP1."
https://openalex.org/W1987584130,"The β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases form a large family of ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze oxidation of various β-hydroxy acid substrates to corresponding semialdehydes. Several known enzymes include β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, 2-(hydroxymethyl)glutarate dehydrogenase, and phenylserine dehydrogenase, but the vast majority of β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases remain uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that the predicted β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase PA0743 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa catalyzes an NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of l-serine and methyl-l-serine but exhibits low activity against β-hydroxyisobutyrate. Two crystal structures of PA0743 were solved at 2.2-2.3-Å resolution and revealed an N-terminal Rossmann fold domain connected by a long α-helix to the C-terminal all-α domain. The PA0743 apostructure showed the presence of additional density modeled as HEPES bound in the interdomain cleft close to the predicted catalytic Lys-171, revealing the molecular details of the PA0743 substrate-binding site. The structure of the PA0743-NAD(+) complex demonstrated that the opposite side of the enzyme active site accommodates the cofactor, which is also bound near Lys-171. Site-directed mutagenesis of PA0743 emphasized the critical role of four amino acid residues in catalysis including the primary catalytic residue Lys-171. Our results provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and activity of β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W2062021057,"The human genome encodes six isoforms of importin α that show greater than 60% sequence similarity and remarkable substrate specificity. The isoform importin α5 can bind phosphorylated cargos such as STAT1 and Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen 1, as well as the influenza virus polymerase subunit PB2. In this work, we have studied the interaction of the nucleoporin Nup50 with importin α5. We show that the first 47 residues of Nup50 bind to the C terminus of importin α5 like a “clip,” stabilizing the closed conformation of ARM 10. In vitro, Nup50 binds with high affinity either to empty importin α5 or to a preassembled complex of importin α5 bound to the C-terminal domain of the import cargo PB2, resulting in a trimeric complex. By contrast, PB2 can only bind with high affinity to importin α5 in the absence of Nup50. This suggests that Nup50 primary function may not be to actively displace the import cargo from importin α5 but rather to prevent cargo rebinding in preparation for recycling. This is the first evidence for a nucleoporin modulating the import reaction by directly altering the three-dimensional structure of an import adaptor.

Previously thought to be restricted to animals, a homolog (P4H1) of HIFα-type PHDs is expressed in the social amoeba Dictyostelium where it also exhibits characteristics of an O2 sensor for development. Dictyostelium lacks HIFα, and P4H1 modifies a different protein, Skp1, an adaptor of the SCF class of E3-Ub ligases related to the E3VHLUb ligase that targets animal HIFα. Normally, the HO-Skp1 product of the P4H1 reaction is capped by a GlcNAc sugar that can be subsequently extended to a pentasaccharide by novel glycosyltransferases. To analyze the role of glycosylation, the Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase locus gnt1 was modified with a missense mutation to block catalysis or a stop codon to truncate the protein. Despite the accumulation of the hydroxylated form of Skp1, Skp1 was not destabilized based on metabolic labeling. However, hydroxylation alone allowed for partial correction of the high O2 requirement of P4H1-null cells, therefore revealing both glycosylation-independent and glycosylation-dependent roles for hydroxylation. Genetic complementation of the latter function required an enzymatically active form of Gnt1. Because the effect of the gnt1 deficiency depended on P4H1, and Skp1 was the only protein labeled when the GlcNAc-transferase was restored to mutant extracts, Skp1 apparently mediates the cellular functions of both P4H1 and Gnt1.

With the successful disruption of the gnt1 locus presented here, the predicted role for Gnt1 in Skp1 glycosylation was confirmed and permitted comparison of the effects of prolyl hydroxylation of Skp1 and HIFα. Surprisingly, hydroxylated Skp1 appeared to be as stable as unmodified Skp1. Nevertheless, hydroxylation partially rescued the high O2 requirement of the P4H1 mutant, and Skp1 was the only substrate of Gnt1 that could be detected in gnt1-null cells, suggesting an alternative primordial mechanism of hydroxylation that nonetheless might still affect the stability of clients of Skp1-dependent Ub ligases. Dictyostelium discoideum cells (see Table 1 for list of strains) were typically grown axenically in HL-5 and cloned by growth on SM-agar plates containing Klebsiella aerogenes (23Fey P. Kowal A.S.

Dictyostelium purpureum (Dp1) was grown on K. aerogenes. Development was monitored after clearing bacteria, or axenically grown cells were centrifugally washed, resuspended in PDF buffer (33 mm NaH2PO4, 10.6 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm KCl, 6 mm MgSO4, pH 5.8), and deposited on cellulose acetate filters (23Fey P.

O2 effects were analyzed by incubating the filters in chambers through which flowed a constant proportion of O2/N2 (15West C.M. van der Wel H. Wang Z.A.

Antisera obtained after three booster injections reacted specifically at 1:100 dilution with DpGnt1 but not DdGnt1 in extracts using Western blotting. Similarly, antisera were raised against a synthetic Pro peptide that included Skp1 residues 137–149 (centered at Pro-143) that had been conjugated via its N terminus to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described (17Wang Z.A. van der Wel H.

Final booster injections were conducted with longer peptides extending to residue 151. Antisera from selected animals exhibited desired Skp1 isoform specificity by Western blotting at titers of 1:5000 (see “Results”). Samples were diluted in concentrated SDS sample buffer to a final concentration of 20 mm dithiothreitol and applied to an Invitrogen NuPAGE® Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris midi gel using the MES buffer system. Proteins were transferred to a 0.2-μm pore diameter nitrocellulose membrane using an Invitrogen iBlot® dry blotting system. Blots were probed with antisera diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk prepared in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), followed by Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (LI-COR Biosciences) also diluted 1:10,000 in the milk solution, and imaged at 700 nm in a LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey infrared scanner. Apparent Mr values were estimated using the Benchmark prestained protein ladder from Invitrogen. αGlcNAcT activity was assayed as described previously (13Teng-Umnuay P van der Wel H West CM Identification of a UDP-GlcNAc:Skp1-hydroxyproline GlcNAc-transferase in the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium.J.

Briefly, soluble (S100) extracts were prepared from the slug or growth stage, desalted, and incubated with 2 μm recombinant HO-Skp1 (prehydroxylated in vitro) in the presence of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc for 2 h. Incorporation of 3H was measured using the SDS-PAGE assay, and the zero time blank value was subtracted. For screening αGlcNAcT acceptor substrates, the reactions were amended with highly purified recombinant DpGnt1, and exogenous Skp1 was not added. Three replacement DNA fragments were designed to disrupt gnt1 by homologous recombination via a double-crossover mechanism. The DNAs were constructed using standard PCR and cloning procedures. At most steps, DNAs were purified by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) SeaKem GTG-agarose (BioWhittaker) gel, extracted using a freeze-squeeze method, and EtOH-precipitated. The 710-nt upstream targeting DNA was amplified from pTYB1GnT51 or pTYB1GnT51(H104D) (14Van Der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. Dell A. Kaplan L. West C.M.

To replace a homopolymeric stretch of poly(N), 310-nt of Gnt1 3′-coding DNA was amplified from D. purpureum genomic DNA using GnG and Gn4 (see Fig. 1B), cloned into pCR4-TOPO to yield pTOPO+2. Amplification fidelity was confirmed by direct sequencing. The 710-nt targeting DNAs were excised using SpeI and StuI and ligated to corresponding sites of pTOPO+2 to yield pTOPO+1+2 and pCR4-TOPO+1(H104D)+2. A 1304-nt downstream targeting DNA was amplified from D. discoideum genomic DNA using primers GnH and Gn2 and cloned into pCR4-TOPO to yield pTOPO+4. The hygromycin resistance cassette from pHygT(plus)/pG7 (a gift from M. Nelson, M. Fukuzawa, and J. G. Williams) was excised using BamHI and cloned in reverse orientation into the BglII site of pTOPO+4, yielding pTOPO+4(hygr)+5. The (710+310)-DNA was excised from the pTOPO+1+2 plasmids with SpeI and BamHI and cloned into similarly digested pTOPO+4(hygr)+5 to yield pTOPO+1(±H104D)+2+4(hygr)+5 (see Fig. 1D). The Y253stop mutation (see Fig. 1D) was introduced into the H104D DNA by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides GnF and Gn7. The replacement DNAs were excised with EcoRI and SpeI, briefly trimmed with Bal31 exonuclease, and electroporated into D. discoideum strain Ax3 or HW288 (phyA−, where phyA is the Dictyostelium gene encoding P4H1) as described previously (15West C.M. van der Wel H.

Site-directed mutagenesis using primers GnE and Gn8 was employed to generate pVSE-DpGnt1(D102A) (see Fig. 1F). These vectors were designed to overexpress native or enzymatically inactive DpGnt1 under control of the ecmA promoter in prestalk cells. After electroporation of plasmids into D. discoideum, G418-resistant cells were initially selected at 20 μg/ml G418 and cloned on bacteria plates. To estimate the rate of total protein synthesis, logarithmically growing cells were centrifuged and resuspended at 107/ml in 1 ml of HL-5 medium containing 71 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (carrier-free Trans-label; Amersham Biosciences), 0.1 mm Met, and 0.1 mm Cys and shaken at 22 °C for 40 min. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min, resuspended in cold PDF buffer, centrifuged again, and frozen at −80 °C. Incorporation of 35S into protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described (24Sassi S. Sweetinburgh M. Erogul J. Zhang P. Teng-Umnuay P. West C.M. Analysis of Skp1 glycosylation and nuclear enrichment in Dictyostelium.Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine incorporation into Skp1 of growing cells, cells were incubated as above in the absence of added unlabeled Met and Cys for 1 h. Incorporation into Skp1 of 15-h developing cells (slugs) was performed by transferring a filter containing the cells into a Petri dish on which had been deposited five 20-μl aliquots of 0.71 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys in PDF and incubating for 1 h. For pulse-chase studies, 1-h labeled cells in HL-5 were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh HL-5 containing unlabeled 0.1 mm Met and 0.1 mm Cys. At the indicated times, cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C, subsequently solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, and protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitors, precleared with 10 μg of mouse IgG and 25 μl of a 25% slurry of UltraLink protein G beads (Thermo Scientific), and immunoprecipitated by the sequential addition of 5 μg of mAb 4E1 (1 h on ice) and 25 μl of the UltraLink protein G bead suspension. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing, beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed in IP buffer. Pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The washed gel was incubated in 1 m sodium sulfosalicylate for 30 min, dried on Whatman 3MM paper, and autoradiographed using BioMax MR film (Kodak) and a Fisher Biotech L-Plus intensifying screen. The films were scanned and densitometrically analyzed using ImageJ software. A semilogarithmic transformation of the data was fitted by linear regression in Microsoft Excel, based on minimizing the sum of the squares of the error terms. Native and recombinant Gnt1 exhibits UDP-GlcNAc:Skp1-Hyp αGlcNAc-transferase activity in vitro. However, efforts to confirm this role in vivo have been thwarted by the inability to disrupt gnt1 using either of two separate linear targeting DNAs expected to homologously recombine via a double-crossover mechanism. 4L.

They also integrate multiple stimuli through their typically polymodal activation. Thus, although the TRPM8 channel has been extensively investigated as the major neuronal cold sensor, it is also regulated by various chemicals, as well as by several short channel isoforms. Mechanistic understanding of such complex regulation is facilitated by quantitative single-channel analysis. We have recently proposed a single-channel mechanism of TRPM8 regulation by voltage and temperature. Using this gating mechanism, we now investigate TRPM8 inhibition in cell-attached patches using HEK293 cells expressing TRPM8 alone or coexpressed with its short sM8-6 isoform. This is compared with inhibition by the chemicals N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxamide (BCTC) and clotrimazole or by elevated temperature. We found that within the seven-state single-channel gating mechanism, inhibition of TRPM8 by short sM8-6 isoforms closely resembles inhibition by increased temperature.

For example, TRPM8 is activated by the “cooling” compound menthol (1McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D.

Two compounds, N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxamide (BCTC) and clotrimazole, have been identified as potent TRPM8 inhibitors. In this study, the effects of these chemical antagonists are compared with physiological channel inhibition by temperature and with that seen in the presence of one of the shorter splice variants, sM8-6, of the full-length channel (10Bidaux G. Beck B. Zholos A. Gordienko D. Lemonnier L. Flourakis M. Roudbaraki M. Borowiec A.S. Fernández J. Delcourt P. Lepage G. Shuba Y. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol.

Alternative mRNA splicing is an important regulatory process that contributes to biological complexity and diversity by altering the primary structure of proteins expressed from a single gene (11Gkika D. Prevarskaya N. Molecular mechanisms of TRP regulation in tumor growth and metastasis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Function may be altered through production of nonfunctional isoforms or alterations in domains necessary for channel opening or subcellular localization. Most TRP channels can be expressed in two or more shorter splice variants that may exhibit different expression profiles in different tissues compared with full-length forms (12Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. An introduction to TRP channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Several examples of altered regulation, function, and ion selectivity have been described, as well as loss of channel function (12Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. An introduction to TRP channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). For example, we recently found that the full-length TRPC4α channel and its shorter TRPC4β isoform differ in their regulation by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (13Otsuguro K. Tang J. Tang Y. Xiao R. Freichel M. Tsvilovskyy V. Ito S. Flockerzi V. Zhu M.X. Zholos A.V. Isoform-specific inhibition of TRPC4 channel by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10026-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative loss-of-function effect is another common feature attributed to short TRP splice variants (12Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. An introduction to TRP channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism is not clear, however, as it may involve reduced channel expression, diminished channel function, or a combination of these two. Quantitative descriptions of the effects of such isoforms in terms of a single-channel gating mechanism would help resolve these questions. TRPM8 splice variants with an altered N terminus have been cloned from lung epithelia and cancerous prostate (11Gkika D. Prevarskaya N. Molecular mechanisms of TRP regulation in tumor growth and metastasis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that some of these isoforms may serve as dominant-negative regulators of full-length TRPM8 (11Gkika D. Prevarskaya N. Molecular mechanisms of TRP regulation in tumor growth and metastasis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In support of this suggestion, our accompanying article (10Bidaux G. Beck B. Zholos A. Gordienko D. Lemonnier L. Flourakis M. Roudbaraki M. Borowiec A.S. Fernández J. Delcourt P. Lepage G. Shuba Y.

These are similar to a previously described N terminus-derived short TRPC2 isoform lacking all transmembrane domains and therefore the pore, which is capable of interacting with the full-length channel to inhibit Ca2+ entry via TRPC2 (14Chu X.

The purpose of this study was to determine the single-channel gating mechanisms underlying the inhibition of TRPM8 channels by coexpression of the short isoform sM8-6 (10Bidaux G. Beck B. Zholos A.

This should provide insight into the mechanism of action underlying sM8-6 inhibition. We first show that our recent single-channel model of TRPM8 regulation by voltage and temperature (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) provides a suitable framework to interpret single-channel activity in the presence of the different inhibitors: sM8-6, BCTC, and clotrimazole. A comparison of the parameters describing channel gating then allowed us to identify similarities and differences in underlying gating mechanisms. Inhibition of TRPM8 by sM8-6 was most similar to inhibition by increasing temperature. In contrast, inhibition by BCTC and clotrimazole had many features in common but differed from that by sM8-6 and increased temperature, suggesting differences in the underlying mechanism. The mechanistic similarities between the actions of increasing temperature and sM8-6 isoforms provide a possible explanation for the pervasive physiological presence of TRPM8 channels in tissues where there is little temperature variation, as short isoforms may exploit similar molecular mechanisms as temperature to alter channel activity. Short TRPM8 isoforms appear to act on the channel by mimicking the effects of increased temperature, presumably by changing the conformation of one or more temperature-sensitive regions in the full-length channel. TRPM8 expression was induced by tetracycline in HEK293 cells maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% kanamycin (16Vanden Abeele F. Zholos A. Bidaux G. Shuba Y.

Chem. 2012; 287: 2948-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were recorded either at room temperature (20–23 °C) or at 30 °C in the cell-attached configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Data are from recordings at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. Currents through single TRPM8 channels were recorded and analyzed as described (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The bath solution initially contained 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). Because TRPM8 is weakly voltage-dependent, being activated by membrane depolarization, to quickly record a sufficiently large number of single-channel events, cell-attached patches were held at 100 or 120 mV positive to the resting potential, which was brought close to 0 mV by equimolar substitution of KCl for NaCl in the bath solution. Rate constants for sM8-6 isoforms recorded at +120 mV were corrected to +100 mV using partial charge estimates from a previous study (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for comparisons of shifts in rate constants with the other inhibitors at +100 mV. The same findings were obtained for corrected and uncorrected sM8-6 data. The pipettes were filled with the same solution used initially for the bath. Pharmacological inhibition was achieved by adding BCTC (stock solution of 10 mm in Me2SO; BIOMOL International) or clotrimazole (stock solution of 10 mm in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) to the bath solution. The single-channel analysis methods used to measure interval durations with the 50% threshold crossing method, to estimate rate constants, and to evaluate kinetic models have been extensively described (17Qin F.

Physiol. 2000; 116: 75-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) to determine the most likely rate constants for transitions among states, as well as the equilibrium occupancies of the states. Whereas each modulator gave large, relatively characteristic visual shifts in the dwell-time distributions for data from different single channels, the estimates of the rate constants for the seven-state model could show considerable variability among different single-channel patches, as is often the case for single-channel data (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consequently, even though the distributions and gating were well described by the model and rate constants for any given single-channel data, the standard errors for the means of combined data were large, so few of the changes in the estimated rate constants were significant. Therefore, to explore similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the various modulators, we examined whether the various modulators acted in the same or a different manner on each of the rate constants using the equivalent of a binomial sign test. The rational for the test is that modulators that act through similar mechanisms might be expected to have similar effects on the various rate constants. To assess the findings, we calculated the probability of the observed direction of changes in rate constants for two compared modulators occurring by chance alone as follows. For each of the 12 rate constants, two random numbers between 0 and 1 were drawn. If the two random numbers for a given rate constant were both ≥0.5 or both <0.5, then the rate constants were considered changed in the same direction by both modulators. For a given trial, the number of rate constants changed in the same direction by both modulators for the 12 rate constants was tabulated and then binned into an array with addresses from 12 to 0. This process was repeated 107 times. Dividing each of the bins by 107 then gave the probability of observing 12, 11, 10, 9, and down to 0 of the rate constants changed in the same direction for the two compared modulators by chance alone. The probabilities from simulation were the same as those obtained from the binomial distribution with n = 12 and p = 0.5 to obtain 0.000244, 0.00293, 0.0161, 0.0537, 0.121, 0.193, 0.226, 0.193, 0.0121, 0.0537, 0.0161, 0.00293, and 0.000244. Cumulative probabilities were then tabulated such that the probabilities of observing 12, 11 or more, 10 or more, 9 or more, 8 or more, 7 or more, and 6 or more of the 12 rate constants changed in the same direction by chance alone were 0.000244, 0.00317, 0.0193, 0.0730, 0.194, 0.387, and 0.613. It is these cumulative probabilities that are used in the study. They can be calculated using Equation 1, PB=∑i=XN Ni×Pi×(1−P) N−i(Eq. 1) where PB is the cumulative probability (which is the sum of the binomial distribution probabilities) for getting X or more of N rate constants changed in the same direction by chance alone (p = 0.5). The binomial of N and i is shown in Equation 2, Ni=N!i!×(N−i)!(Eq. 2) where N! = 1 × 2 … ×N. The cumulative probabilities can also be calculated using GraphPad Software QuickCalcs by selecting sign test and then binomial and sign test. Average data are expressed as means ± S.E., where n equals the number of patches or cells. Where appropriate, Mann-Whitney and nonparametric repeated measures analysis of variance tests were conducted using InStat 3.05 (GraphPad Software). Fig. 1A shows representative single-channel currents recorded at room temperature from a WT TRPM8 channel (upper panel) and from a TRPM8 channel coexpressed with sM8-6 isoforms (lower panel). A pronounced decrease in channel open probability (Po) was induced by the sM8-6 isoforms (10Bidaux G. Beck B. Zholos A. Gordienko D. Lemonnier L. Flourakis M. Roudbaraki M. Borowiec A.S. Fernández J. Delcourt P. Lepage G. Shuba Y. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2948-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which increased channel closed times from 1.67 ± 0.27 ms (n = 6) to 22.7 ± 5.8 ms (n = 5; p = 0.0043). There was a parallel but much smaller decrease in mean open times, from 1.83 ± 0.13 ms (n = 6) to 0.85 ± 0.11 ms (n = 5; p = 0.0043). Thus, sM8-6 isoforms inhibit TRPM8 activity mainly by decreasing the frequency of channel openings rather than the duration. A similar decrease in closed times with smaller changes in open times is also seen with increased temperature and at negative membrane potentials (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An inverse correlation between adjacent open and closed interval durations described previously for WT TRPM8 channels (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was retained in the presence of sM8-6 isoforms (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the two or more independent connections between open and closed states in WT TRPM8 channels are retained in the presence of sM8-6 isoforms. The shifts in the closed interval durations observed in the single-channel records were also revealed in the one- and two-dimensional dwell-time distributions. Coexpression with sM8-6 isoforms produced a shift from briefer toward longer closed intervals, with less of a shift from longer to briefer open intervals. This can be seen both for the one-dimensional open and closed dwell-time distributions (Fig. 1C, black lines for WT TRPM8 alone and blue lines for coexpression of sM8-6 isoforms) and the two-dimensional dwell-time distributions of adjacent open and closed interval durations (Fig. 1D, upper and middle panels). In both cases, the effects of sM8-6 at room temperature were similar to those of increased temperature (30 °C) on WT TRPM8 alone (Fig. 1, C, red lines, and D, lower panel). The shifts in the one-dimensional distributions were quantified by fitting with sums of exponential components. The histograms of dwell times with coexpressed sM8-6 were typically described by two significant open and five significant closed components (supplemental Fig. S1, dashed lines, representing analysis of data in Fig. 1A, lower panel), similar to full-length TRPM8 expressed alone (15Fernández J.A. Skryma R. Bidaux G. Magleby K.L. Scholfield C.N. McGeown J.G. Prevarskaya N. Zholos A.V. Voltage- and cold-dependent gating of single TRPM8 ion channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The areas and time constants of the exponential components for TRPM8 gating in the absence and presence of coexpression with sM8-6 are provided in supplemental Table S1. sM8-6 significantly reduced the time constants of both open components, increased the area of the brief open component, and decreased the area of the long open component, indicating an overall shift from longer to briefer openings. In addition, the area of the briefest closed component (EC1) decreased, the time constant of the next to longest closed component (EC4) increased, and the time constant of the longest closed component (EC5) greatly decreased. The area of the two longest closed components (EC4 and EC5) increased by 11- and 286-fold, respectively, moving 37% of the area into the longer closed components compared with only 2.5% for WT TRPM8. The changes described above suggest that the sM8-6 isoforms modulate the activity of WT TRPM8 channels by shifting areas and time constants of the underlying exponential components describing the dwell-time distributions without affecting the major kinetic structure of channel gating. Fig. 2A shows TRPM8 single-channel currents through a representative patch recorded at room temperature before and after application of BCTC. A dose-dependent decrease in channel activity is readily apparent with increasing BCTC concentration. Po decreased from 0.13 ± 0.03 to 0.04 ± 0.01 with 1 μm BCTC and to 0.03 ± 0.03 with 10 μm BCTC (n = 10; p = 0.0036). As with sM8-6 isoforms, these Po reductions resulted mainly from increases in mean closed times, i.e. the mean closed time significantly increased from 7.5 ± 1.6 ms in the control to 28 ± 10 ms with 1 μm BCTC and to 118 ± 77 ms with 10 μm BCTC (n = 10; p = 0.0036). Although also significant, the decrease in mean open times was much smaller in comparison (0.69 ± 0.04, 0.50 ± 0.03, and 0.42 ± 0.03 ms for the control and 1 and 10 μm BCTC, respectively; p < 0.001). Greater changes in closed compared with open intervals are readily apparent in the one- and two-dimensional dwell-time distributions (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively), where BCTC dramatically shifted closed intervals from briefer to longer, with smaller shifts in open intervals from longer to briefer. Significant shifts at the level of the individual exponential components were limited to a decrease in the area of the faster closed component (EC1) and to increases in some of the time constants and areas of the two slowest closed components (EC4 and EC5) with increasing BCTC concentration (supplemental Table S2). The same types of experiments using the antifungal compound clotrimazole led to shifts in mean interval durations and distributions similar to those observed for BCTC. Increasing clotrimazole concentrations decreased TRPM8 Po (Fig. 3A) from a control value of 0.12 ± 0.02 to 0.09 ± 0.04 with 1 μm clotrimazole and to 0.02 ± 0.01 with 10 μm clotrimazole (n = 6; p = 0.0055). These changes in Po resulted from an increase in the mean closed time from 7.7 ± 2.8 to 13 ± 4 ms with 1 μm clotrimazole and to 50 ± 8 ms with 10 μm clotrimazole (n = 6; p = 0.0055) and from a decrease in the mean open time from 0.74 ± 0.02 to 0.58 ± 0.03 ms with 10 μm clotrimazole (n = 6; p = 0.029). No change was observed in mean open time between the control (0.74 ± 0.02 ms) and 1 μm clotrimazole (0.74 ± 0.10 ms). As was the case with BCTC and sM8-6 isoforms, the increase in the mean closed time was considerably greater (∼7-fold between the control and 10 μm clotrimazole) than the modest decrease in the mean open time (<2-fold between the control and 10 μm clotrimazole). These shifts in closed times to longer durations with clotrimazole are readily apparent in the one- and two-dimensional dwell-time distributions (Fig. 3, B and C), with a significant decrease in the area of the fastest closed component (EC1) (supplemental Table S3) and significant increases in the time constants and/or areas of the two slowest components (EC4 and EC5) (supplemental Table S3). To relate the single-channel recordings to a kinetic gating mechanism for TRPM8 channels, the two-dimensional dwell-time distributions obtained from the single-channel recordings in the absence and presence of the different modulators were individually fitted to a seven-state kinetic scheme (Fig. 4), previously shown to be consistent with WT TRPM8 gating (15Fernández J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2152648826,"Clostridium difficile infection is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, placing considerable economic pressure on healthcare systems and resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The pathogen produces a proteinaceous array on its cell surface known as the S-layer, consisting primarily of the major S-layer protein SlpA and a family of SlpA homologs. CwpV is the largest member of this family and is expressed in a phase-variable manner. The protein is post-translationally processed into two fragments that form a noncovalent, heterodimeric complex. To date, no specific proteases capable of cleaving CwpV have been identified. Using site-directed mutagenesis we show that CwpV undergoes intramolecular autoproteolysis, most likely facilitated by a N-O acyl shift, with Thr-413 acting as the source of a nucleophile driving this rearrangement. We demonstrate that neighboring residues are also important for correct processing of CwpV. Based on protein structural predictions and analogy to the glycosylasparaginase family of proteins, it appears likely that these residues play key roles in determining the correct protein fold and interact directly with Thr-413 to promote nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, using a cell-free protein synthesis assay we show that CwpV maturation requires neither cofactors nor auxiliary enzymes."

However, the role of Ets-2, a transcription factor that is phosphorylated on a critical threonine residue (Thr-72) by the Ras/MAPK pathway in thymocyte development, has not been defined. Transgenic mice overexpressing a phosphomutant Ets-2 (T72A) in the thymus displayed reduced thymus size associated with a 60-80% reduction in thymocyte populations. The transgenic mice exhibited a 20-fold increase in a c-Kit(+) CD4(+) CD8(+) CD3(-) population and a 5-fold increase in a unique CD5(low) population associated with a partial developmental block at the DN2-DN3 stage of thymocytes. Transgenic thymocytes exhibited increased apoptosis, and overexpression of Bcl-2 rescued the hypocellularity and associated thymocyte developmental block in double transgenic mice. The observed defects in these mice are not dependent on Ets-1 expression. These studies implicate for the first time a stage-specific Ets-1-independent regulatory role for Ets-2 in early thymocyte development and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2068618403,"Cytoplasmic desulfothioredoxin (Dtrx) from the anaerobe Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough has been identified as a new member of the thiol disulfide oxidoreductase family. The active site of Dtrx contains a particular consensus sequence, CPHC, never seen in the cytoplasmic thioredoxins and generally found in periplasmic oxidases. Unlike canonical thioredoxins (Trx), Dtrx does not present any disulfide reductase activity, but it presents instead an unusual disulfide isomerase activity. We have used NMR spectroscopy to gain insights into the structure and the catalytic mechanism of this unusual Dtrx. The redox potential of Dtrx (-181 mV) is significantly less reducing than that of canonical Trx. A pH dependence study allowed the determination of the pK(a) of all protonable residues, including the cysteine and histidine residues. Thus, the pK(a) values for the thiol group of Cys(31) and Cys(34) are 4.8 and 11.3, respectively. The His(33) pK(a) value, experimentally determined for the first time, differs notably as a function of the redox states, 7.2 for the reduced state and 4.6 for the oxidized state. These data suggest an important role for His(33) in the molecular mechanism of Dtrx catalysis that is confirmed by the properties of mutant DtrxH33G protein. The NMR structure of Dtrx shows a different charge repartition compared with canonical Trx. The results presented are likely indicative of the involvement of this protein in the catalysis of substrates specific of the anaerobe cytoplasm of DvH. The study of Dtrx is an important step toward revealing the molecular details of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase catalytic mechanism."
