https://openalex.org/W2229830115,"The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) degrades misfolded proteins including those implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the effects of tau accumulation on proteasome function in a mouse model of tauopathy and in a cross to a UPS reporter mouse (line Ub-G76V-GFP). Accumulation of insoluble tau was associated with a decrease in the peptidase activity of brain 26S proteasomes, higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins and undegraded Ub-G76V-GFP. 26S proteasomes from mice with tauopathy were physically associated with tau and were less active in hydrolyzing ubiquitinated proteins, small peptides and ATP. 26S proteasomes from normal mice incubated with recombinant oligomers or fibrils also showed lower hydrolyzing capacity in the same assays, implicating tau as a proteotoxin. Administration of an agent that activates cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling led to attenuation of proteasome dysfunction, probably through proteasome subunit phosphorylation. In vivo, this led to lower levels of aggregated tau and improvements in cognitive performance."
https://openalex.org/W2210381589,"We previously reported the antifungal properties of a monoterpene phenol “Eugenol” against different Candida strains and have observed that the addition of methyl group to eugenol drastically increased its antimicrobial potency. Based on the results and the importance of medicinal synthetic chemistry, we synthesized eugenol-tosylate and its congeners (E1-E6) and tested their antifungal activity against different clinical fluconazole (FLC)- susceptible and FLC- resistant C. albicans isolates alone and in combination with FLC by determining fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) and isobolograms calculated from microdilution assays. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results confirmed that all the tested C. albicans strains were variably susceptible to the semi-synthetic derivatives E1-E6, with MIC values ranging from 1–62 μg/ml. The test compounds in combination with FLC exhibited either synergy (36%), additive (41%) or indifferent (23%) interactions, however, no antagonistic interactions were observed. The MICs of FLC decreased 2–9 fold when used in combination with the test compounds. Like their precursor eugenol, all the derivatives showed significant impairment of ergosterol biosynthesis in all C. albicans strains coupled with down regulation of the important ergosterol biosynthesis pathway gene-ERG11. The results were further validated by docking studies, which revealed that the inhibitors snugly fitting the active site of the target enzyme, mimicking fluconazole, may well explain their excellent inhibitory activity. Our results suggest that these compounds have a great potential as antifungals, which can be used as chemosensitizing agents with the known antifungal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2394663455,"Intestinal chemosensory signaling pathways involving the gustatory G-protein, gustducin, and bitter taste receptors (TAS2R) have been implicated in gut hormone release. Alterations in gut hormone profiles may contribute to the success of bariatric surgery. This study investigated the involvement of the gustatory signaling pathway in the development of diet-induced obesity and the therapeutic potential of targeting TAS2Rs to induce body weight loss. α-gustducin-deficient (α-gust-/-) mice became less obese than wild type (WT) mice when fed a high-fat diet (HFD). White adipose tissue (WAT) mass was lower in α-gust-/- mice due to increased heat production as a result of increases in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity, involving increased protein expression of uncoupling protein 1. Intra-gastric treatment of obese WT and α-gust-/- mice with the bitter agonists denatonium benzoate (DB) or quinine (Q) during 4 weeks resulted in an α-gustducin-dependent decrease in body weight gain associated with a decrease in food intake (DB), but not involving major changes in gut peptide release. Both WAT and 3T3-F442A pre-adipocytes express TAS2Rs. Treatment of pre-adipocytes with DB or Q decreased differentiation into mature adipocytes. In conclusion, interfering with the gustatory signaling pathway protects against the development of HFD-induced obesity presumably through promoting BAT activity. Intra-gastric bitter treatment inhibits weight gain, possibly by directly affecting adipocyte metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2211581083,"The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii develops within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in mammalian cells, where it scavenges cholesterol. When cholesterol is present in excess in its environment, the parasite expulses this lipid into the PV or esterifies it for storage in lipid bodies. Here, we characterized a unique T. gondii homologue of mammalian lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme that produces cholesteryl esters via transfer of acyl groups from phospholipids to the 3-OH of free cholesterol, leading to the removal of excess cholesterol from tissues. TgLCAT contains a motif characteristic of serine lipases “AHSLG” and the catalytic triad consisting of serine, aspartate, and histidine (SDH) from LCAT enzymes. TgLCAT is secreted by the parasite, but unlike other LCAT enzymes it is cleaved into two proteolytic fragments that share the residues of the catalytic triad and need to be reassembled to reconstitute enzymatic activity. TgLCAT uses phosphatidylcholine as substrate to form lysophosphatidylcholine that has the potential to disrupt membranes. The released fatty acid is transferred to cholesterol, but with a lower transesterification activity than mammalian LCAT. TgLCAT is stored in a subpopulation of dense granule secretory organelles, and following secretion, it localizes to the PV and parasite plasma membrane. LCAT-null parasites have impaired growth in vitro, reduced virulence in animals, and exhibit delays in egress from host cells. Parasites overexpressing LCAT show increased virulence and faster egress. These observations demonstrate that TgLCAT influences the outcome of an infection, presumably by facilitating replication and egress depending on the developmental stage of the parasite.

The PLA2 members hydrolyze the sn-2 ester of phospholipids, yielding lysophospholipid and releasing a fatty acid (1Murakami M. Taketomi Y. Sato H. Yamamoto K. Secreted phospholipase A2 revisited.J. Biochem. 2011; 150: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Approximately one-third of the PLA2 family members are secreted from cells and display various localizations post-secretion, reflecting their specialized biological functions (2Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry and physiology of mammalian secreted phospholipases A2.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Among the secretory PLA2, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; EC 2.3.1.43) is characterized by dual activity, PLA2 and acyltransferase. In mammals, this enzyme catalyzes the transacylation of the sn-2 fatty acid liberated from various phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine) to the 3-β-hydroxyl group on the A-ring of cholesterol, thereby forming cholesteryl esters (3Glomset J.A.

A structural model for LCAT predicts the conformation of a catalytic triad formed by Ser-Asp-His residues involved in the phospholipase reaction (7Peelman F. Vinaimont N. Verhee A. Vanloo B.

A proposed architecture for lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT): identification of the catalytic triad and molecular modelling.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mammalian LCATs are primarily expressed in the liver and secreted to the plasma where they circulate in association with HDL (8Sorci-Thomas M. Kearns M.W. Lee J.P. Apolipoprotein A-I domains involved in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activation. Structure:function relationships.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21403-21409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are components of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway by which cholesterol from peripheral cells is delivered to the liver for excretion (9Schaefer E.J. Anthanont P. Asztalos B.F. High-density lipoprotein metabolism, composition, function, and deficiency.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2014; 25: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). LCAT deficiency syndromes (e.g. familial LCAT deficiency or fish-eye disease) result in low plasma concentrations of HDL and reduced plasma cholesteryl esters, which leads to cellular dysfunctions due to alterations in cell and membrane lipid composition (10Saeedi R. Li M. Frohlich J. A review on lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency.Clin. Biochem. 2015; 48: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, some organisms lacking a reverse cholesterol transport pathway also possess an LCAT homologue, suggesting functions for this enzyme other than cholesterol clearance. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses a gene named LRO1 (LCAT-related open reading frame) that codes for a protein whose predicted sequence harbors the conserved catalytic triad SDH and shares 27% overall identity with human LCAT. In contrast to mammalian LCAT that esterifies cholesterol, yeast LRO1 mediates the esterification of diacylglycerol using phosphatidylcholine as the acyl donor (11Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. A lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase-like gene mediates diacylglycerol esterification in yeast.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar); LRO1 has thus been renamed phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase. In plants, Arabidopsis contains one gene product homologue to human LCAT and five genes with similarities to yeast phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (13Ståhl U. Carlsson A.S. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Huang B. Banas W. Banas A. Stymne S.

The function of the human LCAT homologue in plants has not been studied. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii multiplies in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. T. gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes several human and animal pathogens, e.g. the causative agents of malaria and cryptosporidiosis. Approximately 30% of the United States population is infected with T. gondii, a leading opportunistic parasite in immunosuppressive conditions (14Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Toxoplasma encephalatis in AIDS.Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 15Nissapatorn V. Lee C. Quek K.F. Leong C.L. Mahmud R. Abdullah K.A. Toxoplasmosis in HIV/AIDS patients: a current situation.Jpn. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 57: 160-165PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that T. gondii has an unusual lipid metabolism, and interference with lipid transport pathways, e.g. for phospholipid, cholesterol, or sphingolipids, has been proven to be detrimental for the parasite (16Ramakrishnan S.

We previously characterized in Toxoplasma two acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase enzymes that are responsible for cholesterol esterification and storage in lipid bodies (18Nishikawa Y. Quittnat F. Stedman T.T. Voelker D.R. Choi J.Y. Zahn M. Yang M. Pypaert M. Joiner K.A. Coppens I.

Coppens I. Characterization of a second sterol-esterifying enzyme in Toxoplasma highlights the importance of cholesterol storage pathways for the parasite.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87: 951-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and four ATP-binding cassette G family transporters that promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux (20Ehrenman K. Sehgal A. Lige B. Stedman T.T. Joiner K.A. Coppens I. Novel roles for ATP-binding cassette G transporters in lipid redistribution in Toxoplasma.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1232-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), reflecting the importance of the regulation and exportation of lipids for the parasite. In this study, we identified in the Toxoplasma genome database (www.ToxoDB.org) a single gene product that contains the conserved motifs characteristic of PLA2 serine lipases and that is most similar to mammalian LCAT. To gain a wider perspective into the biological significance of conserved LCAT proteins during evolution and to add information to lipid regulatory mechanisms in T. gondii, we examined the activity and function of the T. gondii LCAT homologue (herein named TgLCAT) during the developmental stages of the parasite. Our results demonstrate that TgLCAT is secreted by T. gondii and has a dual PLA2 and cholesteryl esterase activity. Compared with wild-type parasites, T. gondii lacking TgLCAT has reduced replication rate, impaired egress from host cells, and decreased virulence, whereas Toxoplasma overexpressing TgLCAT escapes faster from cells and is more virulent, suggesting a contribution of TgLCAT to the parasite intracellular development and pathogenicity. All chemicals were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher unless indicated otherwise. Solvents and standards for chromatography were of the highest analytical grade (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Silica gel 60 TLC plates were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Radiolabeled reagents included 1-palmitoyl-2[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]DPPC), [4-14C]cholesterol, and [5,6-3H]uracil purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primary antibodies were from the following: rat anti-TgLCAT (this study); mouse anti-SAG1, rabbit anti-GRA6, and mouse anti-GRA4 provided by J. F. Dubremetz (University of Montpellier, France); rabbit anti-GRA7 (21Coppens I. Dunn J.D. Romano J.D. Pypaert M. Zhang H. Boothroyd J.C. Joiner K.A. Toxoplasma gondii sequesters lysosomes from mammalian hosts in the vacuolar space.Cell. 2006; 125: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); mouse α-tubulin, and mouse, or rat anti-HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA). Secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were conjugated to Alexa488, Alexa594, or Alexa350 (Invitrogen). Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF; ATCC CRL-1635) were used in this study and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml per 100 μg/ml). The strains of T. gondii (tachyzoite forms) used throughout this study were propagated in vitro by serial passages in monolayers of HFF (22Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Molecular tools for genetic dissection of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii.Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were searched against the T. gondii database, EuPathDB, and the NCBI database using the BLAST algorithm (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59856) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment was created using ClustalW, and the resulting similarities were then visualized by subjecting the alignment to Boxshade. Percent identity and similarity were calculated using standard tools for sequence analysis from NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). I-TASSER was used for ab initio structural prediction of the LCAT inserted element queried with TgLCAT amino acids 434–606. The highest scoring models encompassed amino acids 465–605. Phyre2 was used for template-dependent modeling of TgLCAT queried with amino acids 40–763, allowing the program to identify the best candidate template for modeling. Human lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2; Protein Data Bank code 4X91) was the highest scoring template upon which the structural model was built. Models were visualized with PyMOL. For the phylogenetic analysis, LCAT orthologues were identified via BLAST search using the TGME49_272420 sequence from the EuPathDB. Representative eukaryotic sequences were chosen from major groups via BLAST of the non-redundant protein database (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). To assess the phylogenetic relationship between the homologues, a multiple sequence alignment of LCAT proteins was performed using ClustalX, from which a bootstrap neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using p-distance method and 1,000 bootstrap support were generated (MEGA version 6.0 software). A schematic tree was predicted by neighbor-joining using the LCAT sequences from Hammondia hammondi (HHA_272420), Neospora caninum (NCLIV_034880), Sarcocystis neurona (SN3_00202440), Eimeria tenella (ETH_00005915), Vitrella brassicaformis (Vbra_21178), Gregarina niphandrodes (GNI_089950), Plasmodium berghei (PBANKA_112810), Plasmodium falciparum (PF3D7_0629300), Plasmodium knowlesi (PKH_111960), Plasmodium vivax (PVX_114565), Trichuris trichiura (GI:669226237), Arabidopsis thaliana (GI:30689946), Xenopus laevis (GI:148229443), Alligator mississipiensis (GI:944443680), Homo sapiens (AAB34898.1), and Mus musculus (AAL11035). Yeast LRO1 was not included in the unrooted analyses because the bootstrap value was below 40%. The FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) was used to perform 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) and 3′-RACE. Total RNA was first purified from freshly harvested tachyzoites (RNeasy, Qiagen). Briefly, total RNA from the RH strain of T. gondii was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and subsequently with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. An RNA adapter oligonucleotide (supplied with the kit) was ligated to the decapped RNA population using T4 RNA ligase. The ligated mRNA was then reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. For the 5′-RLM-RACE, the obtained cDNA was subjected to two rounds of nested PCR. The first PCR was performed using a 5′-RACE outer primer (5′-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3′) provided with the kit and a 5′-RACE gene-specific outer primer (5′-GTTCTTCTGCCTTCGCCAGTTCTT-3′). The second nested PCR was performed using 5′-RACE inner primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGAACACTGCGTTTGCTGGCTTTGATG-3′) and 5′-RACE gene-specific inner primer (5′-CCGTGTATCGGTCCTCGATGTCTGTCTTGA-3′). For the 3′-RLM-RACE also two nested PCRs were performed using 3′-RACE outer primer (5′-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACT-3′) and 3′-RACE outer gene-specific primer (5′-CTCACCCTATTCGCATCTTCGATT-3′) for the first PCR and 3′-RACE inner primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′) and 3′-RACE gene-specific inner primer (5′-CTGATGCTAACCCGTTCTTGTCCTCCCT-3′) for the second PCR). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; and final elongation of 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products of lcat were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector for sequencing. To engineer transgenic RH parasites expressing YFP or HA in fusion with TgLCAT, the 2,292-kb ORF of TgLCAT plus 463 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon were amplified from a T. gondii cDNA library 3V.

Roos (24Nishi M. Hu K. Murray J.M. Roos D.S. Organellar dynamics during the cell cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1559-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which harbor a sagCATsag cassette. Extracellular parasites (107) were transfected with 50 μg of the plasmid pTub-TgLCAT-YFP or pTub-TgLCAT-HA, selected with chloramphenicol, and cloned by limiting dilution as described previously (25Soldati D. Kim K. Kampmeier J. Dubremetz J.F. Boothroyd J.C. Complementation of a Toxoplasma gondii ROP1 knock-out mutant using phleomycin selection.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To generate anti-TgLCAT antibodies, the region of TgLCAT encompassing nucleotides 311–606 was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-CAGGCATGCGAAAATGTTCCCGCCTTTCCCTCGCGTGACCCTTCATT-3′ and 5′-ATAAAGCTTACGAAAGGGGTTGGGATAACTAATTGGGGATTTGCCG-3′ and cloned into the SphI and HindIII sites of the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) to generate N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. The recombinant peptide TgLCAT(106–202) was expressed in Escherichia coli M15 strain, purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin according to the Qiagen protocol, and injected into a rat to produce polyclonal anti-LCAT antibodies (Covance). Before use, the sera containing antibodies were affinity-purified against the recombinant TgLCAT(106–202) according to the protocol by AminoLink Kit (Pierce). For immunodetection, RH and transgenic parasites were lysed by suspension in SDS gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) followed by boiling in a water bath. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a membrane (Immobilon Transfer Membranes, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was immersed in blocking buffer (PBST containing 3% skim milk) for 60 min, and then incubated with antibodies against TgLCAT(1:300), HA (1:5,000), GRA7 (1:3,000), α-tubulin (1:2,500), or SAG1 (1:4,000) in the blocking buffer for 60 min. Unbound antibody was removed by washing the membrane six times with blocking buffer. Next, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:10,000 in PBST for an additional hour, before detection by chemiluminescence using ECL-Plus. Quantification of scanned ECL films was performed using NIH Image J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). For TgLCAT cross-linking assays, HFF were infected with transgenic parasites expressing TgLCAT-HA at a multiplicity of infection of 3. After 24 h, cells were washed and incubated with the membrane-permeable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) at 1 mm (diluted from a 100 mm stock in DMSO) in PBS or with DMSO (control) at room temperature for the intracellular conjugation of TgLCAT fragments. After 30 min, the cross-linking reaction was quenched by washing cells with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in PBS, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agent and Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies (1:2,000). TgLCAT coding sequence was amplified from the T. gondii cDNA library with the primers 5′-GTACGAATTCTTCAAGACGGACGTTGCGTTGTCG-3′ (forward, EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-GATCTCTAGACTACGTGCTGTCTGCCATAATCGC-3′ (reverse, XbaI site underlined) using Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The PCR was cloned into TOPO 2.1 vector and sequenced. For the expression of the recombinant TgLCAT in insect cells, the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) was used. The pFastBac HT A donor vector was used in a first cloning step. For cloning reactions, both vector and amplified cDNA cloned in TOPO 2.1 vector were digested with EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes. The ligation reaction was performed using Quick ligation kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). After generation of the pFastBacHT A donor construct (with TgLCAT cDNA), the purified plasmid was transformed into DH10BacTM E. coli for transposition into the bacmid. Extraction of bacmids was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System). To verify the presence of the lcat gene after transposition, PCR with M13 primers was performed. The obtained amplicons were further sequenced using TgLCAT(EcoRI)f primers and TgLCAT(XbaI)r primers for confirmation of the presence of the lcat gene in the bacmid after transposition. Transfection of insect cells was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System). SF9 insect cells were co-transfected with the TgLCAT transfer vector and linearized baculovirus genomic DNA. After initial passages in SF21 cells, further infection was carried out in High Five cells. The culture medium containing recombinant TgLCAT protein (rTgLCAT) was harvested 96 h p.i. Expression of rTgLCAT and secretion in the culture medium was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-LCAT antibodies. One hundred ml of the culture serum-free medium of insect cells expressing rTgLCAT was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was concentrated ∼15–20 times using the Amicon ultrafiltration system. DTT and PMSF were added to the concentrated supernatant at final concentrations of 10 μg/ml and 0.5 mm, respectively. rTgLCAT was immunoprecipitated by mixing the concentrated supernatant with 50 μl of anti-TgLCAT antiserum (or prebleed serum as negative control) overnight at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were then incubated for 2 h with 500 μl of washed 25% protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. Beads were collected by low speed centrifugation, washed three times with 5 ml of cold washing buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaC1; pH 7.4), and then three times with cold PBS. Purified rTgLCAT was quantified by BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) and stored at −80 °C in an aliquot at a concentration of 100 ng of rTgLCAT/μl until use. The purity of rTgLCAT in our preparation was examined by SDS-PAGE after elution of absorbed material by heating the beads at 90 °C for 10 min in electrophoresis sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 1% SDS and 40% glycerol, pH 6.8) and silver-staining of the gel. Hemolysis was measured using sheep red blood cells as described (26Roiko M.S. Carruthers V.B.

Chem. 2013; 288: 8712-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, red blood cells were washed in PBS, diluted at 2% (v/v) suspension, and incubated at 37 °C in the Hemolysis Assay Buffer (HAB: 0.125 m NaCl, 0.035 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 mg/ml BSA; pH 7.4) with rTgLCAT, at different volumes and time points. Hemolysis was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm, using 1% Triton X-100 to induce total lysis of the red blood cells. TgLCAT activity was measured using single monolayer liposomes containing radioactive lipid substrates as described (27Aron L. Jones S. Fielding C.J. Human plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Characterization of cofactor-dependent phospholipase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7220-7226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For detecting phospholipase activity of TgLCAT, liposomes were made from DPPC, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylglycerol in molar ratio 10:5:2 with 0.3 μmol of [3H]DPPC as described (28Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Lysosomal-type PLA2 and turnover of alveolar DPPC.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L748-L754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]DPPC-containing liposomes were resuspended in an assay medium containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3, and various concentrations of rTgLCAT for different times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), and the lipid mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature to extract lipids. The phases were separated with chloroform and the same volume of 150 mm NaCl, and samples of the lower phase were collected for radiochemical analysis of the products of labeled DPPC catabolism by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The radiolabeled DPPC, lyso-PC, and free fatty acids were separated on silica gel using chloroform/ethanol/triethylamine/water at 30:35:35:7 as solvent, identified by lipid standards, and quantified by scintillation counting. LCAT lipase activity was expressed in nanomoles of fatty acid released per μg of LCAT. For detecting esterase activity of TgLCAT, liposomes were made from DPPC, PC, phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol in molar ratio 10:5:2:3 with 0.025 μmol of [14C]cholesterol as described (28Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Lysosomal-type PLA2 and turnover of alveolar DPPC.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L748-L754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]Cholesterol-containing liposomes were resuspended in the same assay medium as described above with various concentrations of rTgLCAT for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol, and TLC using a neutral solvent system of hexane/ether/acetic acid at 70:30:2 was used to monitor the amount of radioactive cholesteryl esters by scintillation counting. LCAT transferase activity was expressed in nanomoles of cholesteryl esters formed per μg of LCAT. Light and epifluorescence microscopy were performed on infected cells seeded on sterile coverslips in 24-well culture dishes. IFA on parasites or mammalian cells was performed using primary antibodies against TgLCAT (1:100), SAG1 (1:500), GRA7 (1:200), GRA6 (1:250), GRA4 (1:50), or HA (1:1,000) and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies diluted at 1:2,000. Cells were viewed with either 1) a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped with an oil-immersion plan Apo ×100 NA 1.4 objective.

Pathogenic mutations are proposed to retard the post-translational maturation, decrease the structural stability, and hence trigger the misfolding of SOD1 proteins. Despite this, a misfolded and potentially pathogenic conformation of immature SOD1 remains obscure.

Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar). A major pathological change observed in SOD1-related fALS is the abnormal accumulation of misfolded mutant SOD1 proteins in affected motor neurons (2Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Aggregation and motor neuron toxicity of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutant independent from wild-type SOD1.Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Actually, many in vivo as well as in vitro studies have supported that pathogenic mutations facilitate the misfolding of SOD1 proteins (3Furukawa, Y., (2012) Protein aggregates in pathological inclusions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Maurer, M. H., ed.) pp. 335–356,Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanism triggering the misfolding of SOD1 remains controversial. SOD1 is known as one of the most stable proteins to the extent that its melting temperature (Tm) is >90 °C (4Forman H.J. Fridovich I. On the stability of bovine superoxide dismutase: the effects of metals.J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, a misfolding event appears quite unlikely for SOD1. Nonetheless, SOD1 was found to have acquired such high stability through several post-translational processes including copper and zinc binding and disulfide bond formation (Fig. 1A). Actually, disulfide-reduced apoSOD1 exhibits significantly decreased stability (Tm ∼ 42 °C) and is susceptible to unfolding/misfolding at physiological temperatures (5Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V.

Intracellular deregulation of metal binding and/or disulfide formation will, hence, be a key event triggering the misfolding of SOD1. Notably, many pathogenic mutations are found to disturb the post-translational control of SOD1 maturation (7Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S.

Only when both metal ions and disulfide bond are absent, SOD1 forms fibrillar aggregates (11Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. O'Halloran T.V. Nukina N.

Takikawa M. Nakashima K. Hirano A. Cleveland D.W. Kusaka H. Shibata N. Kato M. Nakano I. Ohama E.

In a number of previous studies, the roles of metal binding and disulfide formation in the misfolding of SOD1 have been suggested by a variety of experimental methods (6Lindberg M.J. Normark J.

Biol. 2003; 328: 877-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); however, conformational information on SOD1 in solution lacking both metal ions and the disulfide bond, which is the only state accessible to fibrillar aggregates (11Furukawa Y. Kaneko K. Yamanaka K. O'Halloran T.V. Nukina N. Complete loss of post-translational modifications triggers fibrillar aggregation of SOD1 in familial form of ALS.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24167-24176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), is still limited. Also, a crystal structure of apoSOD1 lacking the disulfide bond has implied little impacts of metal binding and disulfide formation on its overall folding pattern albeit with increased disorder at loop regions (19Strange R.W. Antonyuk S. Hough M.A. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Hart P.J. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Hasnain S.S.

Biol. 2003; 328: 877-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This is probably because the crystallization process sorts the folded conformation out of many other conformations adopted by immature SOD1 in solution. Indeed, significant changes in chemical shifts were concentrated on loop regions (loops IV and VII; Fig. 1A) between the solid state and solution NMR spectra of apoSOD1 with a disulfide bond in crystalline and solution state, respectively (20Banci L. Bertini I. Blaževitš O. Cantini F. Lelli M. Luchinat C. Mao J. Vieru M. NMR characterization of a “fibril-ready” state of demetalated wild-type superoxide dismutase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the degree of disorder in the loop regions of immature SOD1 is still ambiguous. To understand the molecular mechanism of SOD1 misfolding in SOD1-related fALS, conformational features of apoSOD1 lacking a disulfide bond, which is prone to fibrillation, therefore need to be clarified in more detail. Here, we have investigated conformational features of the most immature SOD1 lacking both metal ions and the disulfide bond by using spectroscopic and scattering methods. Although metallated SOD1 with a disulfide bond exists as a homodimer, apoSOD1 without the disulfide bond has been shown to favor a monomeric state and is considered to adopt a protomer conformation (21Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Martinelli M. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. The unusually stable quaternary structure of human SOD1 is controlled by both metal occupancy and disulfide status.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47998-48003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study we nonetheless found that a conformation of disulfide-null apoSOD1 in solution was significantly distinct from that of the SOD1 protomer; in particular, loop regions usually connected via bound metal ions and a disulfide bond (loops IV and VII; Fig. 1A) lost their restraint and were significantly disordered upon both dissociation of metal ions and reduction of the disulfide bond. Such distinct conformational disorder of SOD1 realized only in its most immature state will be discussed in relation to the pathological changes observed in SOD1-related fALS cases. Escherichia coli SHuffleTM (New England BioLabs) was transformed with a pET15b plasmid containing cDNA of human SOD1 with an N-terminal His6 tag, and the expression of His-tagged SOD1 proteins was induced by culturing the transformed cells in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 16 h. His-tagged SOD1 proteins in the lysates were purified with a HisTrap HP (1 ml, GE Healthcare) and dialyzed against 50 mm NaOAc, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 4.0, at 4 °C for 16 h so as to remove the metal ions bound to SOD1. The resultant apoSOD1 was further dialyzed against 100 mm Na-Pi, 100 mm NaCl/5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 (NNE buffer), and then incubated with thrombin at 37 °C for 3 h. Thrombin was removed from the sample solution using HiTrap benzamidine (1 ml, GE Healthcare), and the purified apoSOD1 was obtained using gel filtration column chromatography (Cosmosil 5Diol-300-II, Nacalai Tesque) with NNE buffer as the running buffer. For preparation of the Zn2+-bound form of SOD1, the NNE buffer of apoSOD1 samples was first exchanged to a Chelex-treated buffer without EDTA, and then an equimolar amount of ZnSO4 was added to apoSOD1. Concentrations of copper and zinc ions in the samples were determined by using Metallo Assay Copper LS (Metallogenics) and Metallo Assay Zinc LS (Metallogenics), respectively. Almost no contamination of copper and zinc ions (<1 mol % of total SOD1 concentrations) was confirmed in apoSOD1 samples examined here. The thiol-disulfide status of SOD1 was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE; after protection with a thiol-specific modifier, iodoacetamide, SOD1 samples were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic mobility of SOD1 has been known to increase in the presence of the conserved intramolecular disulfide bond (22Toichi K. Yamanaka K. Furukawa Y. Disulfide scrambling describes the oligomer formation of superoxide dismutase (SOD1) proteins in the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 4970-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and we thereby confirmed that our SOD1S-S samples had the intramolecular disulfide bond (data not shown). 60 μm (∼1 g/liter) SOD1 was loaded on a gel filtration column (TSKgel G2000SW, TOSOH) fitted to an HPLC system (Shimadzu), and the absorbance change at 280 nm of the elution was monitored. For the analysis of apoSOD1, 5 mm EDTA was included in the running buffer (100 mm Na-Pi, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) to prevent the adventitious loading of metal ions to SOD1 during gel filtration. A molecular size of the protein eluted from the column was determined by multi-angle light scattering using miniDAWN TREOS (WYATT Technology) connected online to the HPLC system. The aggregation of SOD1 proteins was monitored by the increase of solution turbidity. 20 μm E,E-SOD1noCys and E,E-SOD1(57/146)S-S in NNE buffer were set in a 96-well plate and agitated with a POM ball (3/32 inch, SANPLATEC) at 1200 rpm at 37 °C. For the examination of Zn2+-bound SOD1, 5 mm EDTA in NNE buffer was replaced with 0.2 mm ZnSO4. Solution turbidity was monitored by absorbance change at 350 nm using a plate reader (Epoch, BioTek). For measurement of circular dichroism spectra, SOD1 samples (10 and 400 μm for far-UV and near-UV regions, respectively) were prepared in a Chelex-treated buffer (20 mm Na-Pi, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and a J-720WI spectropolarimeter (Jasco) was used. Fluorescence spectra of 5 μm SOD1 in NNE buffer were measured using fluorescence spectrophotometry (F-4500, Hitachi) with excitation at 282 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured by using an IRAffinity-1S spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) attached with an attenuated total reflection accessory (DuraSamplIR II, nine reflections). SOD1 proteins (∼1 mm) were demetallated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and redissolved in a deuterated buffer of 100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl at pD 7.0. 15N-Labeled SOD1 proteins were prepared by culturing E. coli SHuffleTM harboring the plasmid for expression of His-tagged SOD1, and the protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside in M9 minimal media containing 15NH4Cl, 3 μm ZnSO4, and 30 μm CuSO4 at 20 °C for 43 h. His tag-free demetallated SOD1 proteins were purified as described above. Using ZebaTM Spin Desalting Columns (ThermoFisher), the NNE buffer in purified SOD1 samples was exchanged to Chelex-treated buffer containing 100 mm Na-Pi and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 (NN buffer). NMR experiments were done at 283 K using Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer and Agilent UNITY Inova 600 MHz equipped with a cold probe. The spectra were processed using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol.

Yokochi, M., Sekiguchi S., and Inagaki, F., Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. 15N-Labeled E,E-SOD1(57/146)S-S and E,E-SOD1noCys in NN buffer (∼3 mm) were diluted 10× with NN buffer containing 10% D2O, and the 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra were then measured as a reference. For hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, the 15N-labeled proteins (∼3 mm) were diluted 10× with a D2O buffer containing 100 mm Na-Pi and 100 mm NaCl at pD 7.4. The 1H,15N HSQC spectra were collected 5 min after dilution, and the spectral changes were monitored every 4 h. The NMR signals were analyzed based on a previously published assignment table (25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Amelio N. Gaggelli E.

SAXS data were obtained using NANO-Viewer (Rigaku) equipped with a high brightness x-ray generator, RA-Micro7 (Rigaku), and a hybrid pixel array detector, PILATUS 200K (DECTRIS). SAXS measurements were performed at 10 °C using a series of samples serially diluted from 6.58 to 2.53 g/liter (SOD1noCys) or 8.64 to 3.11 g/liter (SOD1(57/146)) in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.0. To remove any oligomeric/aggregated species, the E,E-SOD1noCys samples were first loaded on the gel filtration column (G2000SW, TOSOH) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.0, and protein fractions of a symmetrical and sharp elution peak was collected and immediately used for SAXS measurements. A successive series of scattering images (3 min × 10 frames) was recorded, and then only the images free from radiation damages (10 frames in all experiments) were used to obtain scattering curves. The circular averaged data were normalized by exposure time (3 × 10 min) and protein concentration, thereby the scattering curves, I(Q), were obtained, where Q = 4πsin(θ)/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of the x-ray (1.5418 Å). I(Q) at very low angle was fitted with the Guinier approximation using the equation, Ln/(Q)=In/(0)−Rg23⋅Q2(Eq. 1) where I(0) and Rg are the forward scattering intensity (Q = 0) and the radius of gyration, respectively.

Low-resolution shapes of E,E-SOD1noCys were restored from SAXS data using GASBOR (31Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.

Chacón P. Modeling tricks and fitting techniques for multiresolution structures.Structure. 2001; 9: 779-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The rigid-body and ensemble models of E,E-SOD1noCys were refined by using BUNCH (34Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Global rigid body modeling of macromolecular complexes against small-angle scattering data.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1237-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and EOM (35Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. Structural characterization of flexible proteins using small-angle x-ray scattering.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), respectively. During both refinements the β-barrel scaffold (residues 5–52 and 84–124) of E,E-SOD1noCys was treated as a rigid body harboring three flexible loops in its N terminus (residues 1–4), a region including loop IV (residues 53–83), and a region from loop VII to the C terminus (residues 125–157). Coordinates of the rigid body were taken from an x-ray crystal structure of SOD1 (PDB ID 2C9V). The flexible loops were first assumed as dummy residues, and the conformations were then refined against the experimental SAXS data while keeping the rigid body structure intact. In the ensemble modeling, 10,000 hypothetical rigid-body models were randomly generated, from which a plausible ensemble was suggested by refining populations and compositions of the hypothetical structures. SOD1 has four Cys residues in total, among which Cys-57 and Cys-146 form an intramolecular disulfide bond (Fig. 1A). The other two Cys residues (Cys-6 and Cys-111) do not form disulfide bonds in native SOD1 but are susceptible to aberrant oxidation (36Fujiwara N. Nakano M. Kato S. Yoshihara D. Ookawara T. Eguchi H. Taniguchi N. Suzuki K. Oxidative modification to cysteine sulfonic acid of Cys-111 in human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35933-35944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To avoid oxidative modifications during experiments, Cys-6 and -111 of SOD1 in this study were mutated to Ser (SOD1(57/146)); the presence of a Cys-57–Cys-146 disulfide bond in SOD1(57/146) was confirmed electrophoretically (SOD1(57/146)S-S) (data not shown). Also, SOD1 in which all four Cys residues were mutated to Ser (SOD1noCys) was used as the model of SOD1 lacking the disulfide bond. To understand conformational features of the most immature SOD1, a quaternary structure of apoSOD1noCys (E,E-SOD1noCys) was examined by SEC-MALS. Native SOD1 is a homodimeric protein (Fig. 1A), but the monomer-dimer equilibrium has been known to be regulated by the binding of metal ions and the formation of the disulfide bond (21Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Martinelli M. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. The unusually stable quaternary structure of human SOD1 is controlled by both metal occupancy and disulfide status.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47998-48003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 37Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Oxygen-induced maturation of SOD1: a key role for disulfide formation by the copper chaperone CCS.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have successfully reproduced our previous findings (21Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Martinelli M. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. The unusually stable quaternary structure of human SOD1 is controlled by both metal occupancy and disulfide status.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47998-48003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); E,E-SOD1noCys was monomeric with a molecular mass of 16.0 kDa and that either the introduction of a disulfide bond (E,E-SOD1(57/146)S-S) or the binding of a Zn2+ ion (E,Zn-SOD1noCys) was sufficient to render SOD1 dimeric with a 32.0-kDa molecular mass (Fig. 1, B and C). Previous studies have shown that a protomer of the SOD1 dimer can be prepared with F50E/G51E double mutations (38Bertini I. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. A spectroscopic characterization of a monomeric analog of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase.Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); indeed, our SEC-MALS analysis also showed that both apo- and Zn2+-bound forms of SOD1(F50E/G51E) with a disulfide bond were monomeric with a 16.0-kDa molecular mass (Fig. 1, B and C). Quite notably, however, the elution volume of SOD1(F50E/G51E)S-S (8.87 ml) was significantly smaller than that of E,E-SOD1noCys (9.39 ml) even though both SOD1 species were monomeric (Fig. 1B). It is thus expected that monomeric SOD1 in the most immature state adopts a conformation that is significantly altered from that of a protomer of native SOD1 dimer. To further confirm the roles of metal binding and disulfide formation in the conformation of SOD1, we have performed secondary structural analysis on the distinct metallation/thiol-disulfide status of SOD1 using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Matured SOD1 (i.e. a copper- and zinc-bound state with a disulfide bond, Cu,Zn-SOD1(57/146)S-S) exhibits a negative CD signal at 208 nm with a distinct shoulder around 230 nm, consistent with the β-barrel structure of SOD1 (data not shown and Ref. 39Kayatekin C. Zitzewitz J.A. Matthews C.R. Disulfide-reduced ALS variants of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase exhibit increased populations of unfolded species.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 320-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Removing copper ion from Cu,Zn-SOD1(57/146)S-S did not change the CD spectrum (E,Zn-SOD1(57/146)S-S), suggesting limited effects of copper ion to the secondary structure of SOD1 (data not shown and Fig. 2A). In contrast, the binding of a zinc ion and the formation of a disulfide bond were found to play significant roles in attaining the secondary structures (Fig. 2A); upon dissociation of a zinc ion, the peak around 230 nm became vague, and a negative CD signal around 200 nm increased its intensity. In E,E-SOD1noCys (red open circles, Fig. 2A) in particular, a negative CD signal at 208 nm that was evident in other SOD1 species examined in this study was lost, and an additional signal was observed around 200 nm, implying the presence of random coils (40Greenfield N.J. Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2876-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2221851650,"Soil bacteria are major players in driving and regulating ecosystem processes. Thus, the identification of factors shaping the diversity and structure of these communities is crucial for understanding bacterial-mediated processes such as nutrient transformation and cycling. As most studies only target the entire soil bacterial community, the response of active community members to environmental changes is still poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of fertilizer application and sampling time on structure and diversity of potentially active (RNA-based) and the entire (DNA-based) bacterial communities in German grassland soils. Analysis of more than 2.3 million 16S rRNA transcripts and gene sequences derived from amplicon-based sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that fertilizer application and sampling time significantly altered the diversity and composition of entire and active bacterial communities. Although the composition of both the entire and the active bacterial community was correlated with environmental factors such as pH or C/N ratio, the active community showed a higher sensitivity to environmental changes than the entire community. In addition, functional analyses were performed based on predictions derived from 16S rRNA data. Genes encoding the uptake of nitrate/nitrite, nitrification, and denitrification were significantly more abundant in fertilized plots compared to non-fertilized plots. Hence, this study provided novel insights into changes in dynamics and functions of soil bacterial communities as response to season and fertilizer application."
https://openalex.org/W638751764,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a debilitating condition with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Fatigue is frequently reported by patients suffering from primary Sjogren's Syndrome (pSS), a chronic autoimmune condition characterised by dryness of the eyes and the mouth. However, although fatigue is common in pSS, it does not manifest in all sufferers, providing an excellent model with which to explore the potential underpinning biological mechanisms. METHODS: Whole blood samples from 133 fully-phenotyped pSS patients stratified for the presence of fatigue, collected by the UK primary Sjogren's Syndrome Registry, were used for whole genome microarray. The resulting data were analysed both on a gene by gene basis and using pre-defined groups of genes. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used as a feature selection technique for input into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Classification was assessed using area under curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic and standard error of Wilcoxon statistic, SE(W). RESULTS: Although no genes were individually found to be associated with fatigue, 19 metabolic pathways were enriched in the high fatigue patient group using GSEA. Analysis revealed that these enrichments arose from the presence of a subset of 55 genes. A radial kernel SVM classifier with this subset of genes as input displayed significantly improved performance over classifiers using all pathway genes as input. The classifiers had AUCs of 0.866 (SE(W) 0.002) and 0.525 (SE(W) 0.006), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analysis of gene expression data from pSS patients discordant for fatigue identified 55 genes which are predictive of fatigue level using SVM classification. This list represents the first step in understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue in patients with pSS."
https://openalex.org/W2198824178,"Introduction Initial lactate level, lactate clearance, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin in critically ill patients with sepsis are associated with hospital mortality. However, no study has yet discovered which factor is most important for mortality in severe sepsis patients with lactic acidosis. We sought to clarify this issue in patients with lactic acidosis who were supplementing with sodium bicarbonate. Materials and Methods Data were collected from a single center between May 2011 and April 2014. One hundred nine patients with severe sepsis and lactic acidosis who were supplementing with sodium bicarbonate were included. Results The 7-day mortality rate was 71.6%. The survivors had higher albumin levels and lower SOFA, APACHE II scores, vasopressor use, and follow-up lactate levels at an elapsed time after their initial lactate levels were checked. In particular, a decrement in lactate clearance of at least 10% for the first 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours of treatment was more dominant among survivors than non-survivors. Although the patients who were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics showed higher illness severity than those who received conventional antibiotics, there was no significant mortality difference. 6-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour lactate clearance (HR: 4.000, 95% CI: 1.309–12.219, P = 0.015) and vasopressor use (HR: 4.156, 95% CI: 1.461–11.824, P = 0.008) were significantly associated with mortality after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusions Lactate clearance at a discrete time point seems to be a more reliable prognostic index than initial lactate value in severe sepsis patients with lactic acidosis who were supplementing with sodium bicarbonate. Careful consideration of vasopressor use and the initial application of broad-spectrum antibiotics within the first 48 hours may be helpful for improving survival, and further study is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2209346326,"Background Though complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are frequently used by children and adolescents with cancer, there is little information on how and why they use it. This study examined prevalence and methods of CAM, the therapists who applied it, reasons for and against using CAM and its perceived effectiveness. Parent-perceived communication was also evaluated. Parents were asked if medical staff provided information on CAM to patients, if parents reported use of CAM to physicians, and what attitude they thought physicians had toward CAM. Study Design All childhood cancer patients treated at the University Children’s Hospital Bern between 2002–2011 were retrospectively surveyed about their use of CAM. Results Data was collected from 133 patients (response rate: 52%). Of those, 53% had used CAM (mostly classical homeopathy) and 25% of patients received information about CAM from medical staff. Those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be informed about CAM options. The most frequent reason for choosing CAM was that parents thought it would improve the patient’s general condition. The most frequent reason for not using CAM was lack of information. Of those who used CAM, 87% perceived positive effects. Conclusions Since many pediatric oncology patients use CAM, patients’ needs should be addressed by open communication between families, treating oncologists and CAM therapists, which will allow parents to make informed and safe choices about using CAM."

Previous researches in other countries have reported that parents as caregivers (CGs) of children with disability have mental health problems, but the actual situation has not been examined nationwide in Japan so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between mental health of CGs who had children with disability and characteristics of children, CGs, and household based on the nation-wide survey. This study utilized data from 2010 Comprehensive Survey of the Living Conditions, and defined children with disability aged 6 to 17. Individual data of children and CGs were linked, and 549 pairs of them were extracted. The Japanese version of Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess mental health status of caregiver, scored 5 and over represented to general psychological distress. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations of interest. The almost half (44.4%) of CGs had psychological distress (k6 score; 5 +) in nationwide, and 8.9% of CGs might have serious mental illness (K6 score; 13 +). After adjusting covariates of child, CG, and household factors, CG having a current symptom (OR, 95% CI: 3.26, 1.97-5.39), CG's activity restriction (OR, 95% CI: 2.95, 1.38-6.32), low social support (OR, 95%CI: 9.31, 1.85-46.8), three generation family (OR, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.26-0.92), and lower 25% tile group of monthly household expenditure (OR, 95% CI:1.92, 1.05-3.54), were significantly associated with psychological distress of CGs. This study encourages health care providers to pay more attentions toward parent's mental health, especially for in case of having low social support, and lower income family. Further research should examine the detailed information of child's disease and disability, medical service use, and quality and quantity of social support in nationwide to straighten the system for supporting services of both children with disabilities and their CGs."

The interactions between viral proteins and their receptors on the surface of cells in a frontier target tissue are crucial for triggering an infection. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) library was constructed using cDNA obtained from the stomach and gut of Litopenaeus vannamei, to ascertain the role of envelope proteins in WSSV infection. For this purpose, VP37 was used as the bait in the Y2H library screening. Forty positive clones were detected after screening. The positive clones were analyzed and discriminated, and two clones belonging to the peritrophin family were subsequently confirmed as genuine positive clones. Sequence analysis revealed that both clones could be considered as the same gene, LV-peritrophin (LvPT). Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction between LvPT and VP37. Further studies in the Y2H system revealed that LvPT could also interact with other WSSV envelope proteins such as VP32, VP38A, VP39B, and VP41A. The distribution of LvPT in tissues revealed that LvPT was mainly expressed in the stomach than in other tissues. In addition, LvPT was found to be a secretory protein, and its chitin-binding ability was also confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2219830212,"Studies of the energy return on investment (EROI) for oil production generally rely on aggregated statistics for large regions or countries. In order to better understand the drivers of the energy productivity of oil production, we use a novel approach that applies a detailed field-level engineering model of oil and gas production to estimate energy requirements of drilling, producing, processing, and transporting crude oil. We examine 40 global oilfields, utilizing detailed data for each field from hundreds of technical and scientific data sources. Resulting net energy return (NER) ratios for studied oil fields range from ≈2 to ≈100 MJ crude oil produced per MJ of total fuels consumed. External energy return (EER) ratios, which compare energy produced to energy consumed from external sources, exceed 1000:1 for fields that are largely self-sufficient. The lowest energy returns are found to come from thermally-enhanced oil recovery technologies. Results are generally insensitive to reasonable ranges of assumptions explored in sensitivity analysis. Fields with very large associated gas production are sensitive to assumptions about surface fluids processing due to the shifts in energy consumed under different gas treatment configurations. This model does not currently include energy invested in building oilfield capital equipment (e.g., drilling rigs), nor does it include other indirect energy uses such as labor or services."
https://openalex.org/W2197604055,"Brain blood barrier breakdown as assessed by contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MR imaging is currently the standard radiological marker of inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of an alternative model assessing the inflammatory activity of MS lesions by texture analysis of T2-weighted MR images. Twenty-one patients with definite MS were examined on the same 3.0T MR system by T2-weighted, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted and CE-T1 sequences. Lesions and mirrored contralateral areas within the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were characterized by texture parameters computed from the gray level co-occurrence and run length matrices, and by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Statistical differences between MS lesions and NAWM were analyzed. ROC analysis and leave-one-out cross-validation were performed to evaluate the performance of individual parameters, and multi-parametric models using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least squares (PLS) and logistic regression (LR) in the identification of CE lesions. ADC and all but one texture parameter were significantly different within white matter lesions compared to within NAWM (p < 0.0167). Using LDA, an 8-texture parameter model identified CE lesions with a sensitivity Se = 70% and a specificity Sp = 76%. Using LR, a 10-texture parameter model performed better with Se = 86% / Sp = 84%. Using PLS, a 6-texture parameter model achieved the highest accuracy with Se = 88% / Sp = 81%. Texture parameter from T2-weighted images can assess brain inflammatory activity with sufficient accuracy to be considered as a potential alternative to enhancement on CE T1-weighted images."
https://openalex.org/W2287023767,"The creation of an appropriate thin film is important for the development of novel sensing surfaces, which will ultimately enhance the properties and output of high-performance sensors. In this study, we have fabricated and characterized zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films on silicon substrates, which were hybridized with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to obtain ZnO-Aux (x = 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 nm) hybrid structures with different thicknesses. Nanoscale imaging by field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed increasing film uniformity and coverage with the Au deposition thickness. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the AuNPs exhibit an increasing average diameter (5-10 nm). The face center cubic Au were found to co-exist with wurtzite ZnO nanostructure. Atomic force microscopy observations revealed that as the Au content increased, the overall crystallite size increased, which was supported by X-ray diffraction measurements. The structural characterizations indicated that the Au on the ZnO crystal lattice exists without any impurities in a preferred orientation (002). When the ZnO thickness increased from 10 to 40 nm, transmittance and an optical bandgap value decreased. Interestingly, with 50 nm thickness, the band gap value was increased, which might be due to the Burstein-Moss effect. Photoluminescence studies revealed that the overall structural defect (green emission) improved significantly as the Au deposition increased. The impedance measurements shows a decreasing value of impedance arc with increasing Au thicknesses (0 to 40 nm). In contrast, the 50 nm AuNP impedance arc shows an increased value compared to lower sputtering thicknesses, which indicated the presence of larger sized AuNPs that form a continuous film, and its ohmic characteristics changed to rectifying characteristics. This improved hybrid thin film (ZnO/Au) is suitable for a wide range of sensing applications."

Here, we examined the effects of cryopreservation on Tregs. We found that freeze and thaw of murine and human Tregs is associated with reduced expression of L-selectin (CD62L), which was previously established to be an important factor that contributes to the in vivo protective effects of Tregs. Frozen and thawed murine Tregs showed a reduced capacity to bind to the CD62L binding partner MADCAM1 in vitro as well as an impaired homing to secondary lymphoid organs in vivo. Upon adoptive transfer frozen and thawed Tregs failed to protect against lethal GVHD compared with fresh Tregs in a murine model of allogeneic HCT across major histocompatibility barriers. In summary, the direct administration of adoptively transferred frozen and thawed Tregs adversely affects their immunosuppressive potential which is an important factor to consider in the clinical implementation of Treg immunotherapies."

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for IDH among the major ethnicity population i.e. Han, Uygur and Kazakh in Xinjiang, northwestern part of China.In total, 14,618 adult participants (7,799 males, 6,819 females) were recruited from the Cardiovascular Risk Survey conducted during 2007 and 2010. Blood pressure, body mass index and standard lipid profile and fasting glucose level from plasma were measured.The overall prevalence of IDH was 10.8% in the Han, 4.5% in the Uygur and 8.7% in the Kazakh populations. When stratified by gender, IDH prevalence was 9.8% in men and 6.8% in women (P<0.001). The prevalence of IDH also varied significantly with age and it was highest in those aged 35-44 yrs old (9.7%) and lowest in those over 75 yrs old (4.1%, P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that overweight (OR = 1.179, 95%CI: 1.015-1.369) or obesity (OR = 1.202, 95%CI: 1.015-1.424), smoking (OR = 1.362, 95%CI: 1.156-1.604) and high total cholesterol (TC) hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.237, 95%CI: 1.074-1.423) were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of IDH. Identified risk factors for IDH differed among ethnicity groups with male gender, young age (35-44 yrs old), more coffee or tea consumption and high TC hyperlipidemia in the Han; smoking and often coffee or tea consumption in the Uygur and male gender and overweight or obesity in the Kazakh populations.IDH prevalence in the Han population is higher than that in the Uygur and Kazak populations in Xinjiang, northwestern part of China. Male gender, middle age, overweight or obesity, smoking and high TC hyperlipidemia appear to be relevant risk factors of IDH in adults. Different ethnicity background had different sets of risk factors for IDH."

With the aim of better understanding its genetic background we performed global miRNA expression profiling of LSCC cell lines and primary specimens. By this approach we identified a cohort of 33 upregulated and 9 downregulated miRNA genes in LSCC as compared to epithelial no tumor controls.Within this group we identified overexpression of the novel miR-1290 gene not reported in the context of LSCC before. Using a combined bioinformatical approach in connection with functional analysis we delineated two putative target genes of miR-1290 namely ITPR2 and MAF which are significantly downregulated in LSCC. They are interesting candidates for tumor suppressor genes as they are implicated in apoptosis and other processes deregulated in cancer.Taken together, we propose miR-1290 as the new oncomiR involved in LSCC pathogenesis. Additionally, we suggest that the oncogenic potential of miR-1290 might be expressed by the involvement in downregulation of its target genes MAF and ITPR2."
https://openalex.org/W2205540991,"The vasculoprotective properties of delphinidin are driven mainly by its action on endothelial cells. Moreover, delphinidin displays anti-angiogenic properties in both in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis models and thereby might prevent the development of tumors associated with excessive vascularization. This study was aimed to test the effect of delphinidin on melanoma-induced tumor growth with emphasis on its molecular mechanism on endothelial cells. Delphinidin treatment significantly decreased in vivo tumor growth induced by B16-F10 melanoma cell xenograft in mice. In vitro, delphinidin was not able to inhibit VEGFR2-mediated B16-F10 melanoma cell proliferation but it specifically reduced basal and VEGFR2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation. The anti-proliferative effect of delphinidin was reversed either by the MEK1/2 MAP kinase inhibitor, U-0126, or the PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002. VEGF-induced proliferation was reduced either by U-0126 or LY-294002. Under these conditions, delphinidin failed to decrease further endothelial cell proliferation. Delphinidin prevented VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and decreased the expression of the transcription factors, CREB and ATF1. Finally, delphinidin was more potent in inhibiting in vitro cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), PDE1 and PDE2, compared to PDE3-PDE5. Altogether delphinidin reduced tumor growth of melanoma cell in vivo by acting specifically on endothelial cell proliferation. The mechanism implies an association between inhibition of VEGF-induced proliferation via VEGFR2 signalling, MAPK, PI3K and at transcription level on CREB/ATF1 factors, and the inhibition of PDE2. In conjunction with our previous studies, we demonstrate that delphinidin is a promising compound to prevent pathologies associated with generation of vascular network in tumorigenesis."

Here, we performed genome-wide deep RNA sequencing analysis of human urinary bladder samples and identified genes up-regulated in the urinary bladder by comparing the transcriptome data to those of all other major human tissue types. 90 protein-coding genes were elevated in the urinary bladder, either with enhanced expression uniquely in the urinary bladder or elevated expression together with at least one other tissue (group enriched). We further examined the localization of these proteins by immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays and 20 of these 90 proteins were localized to the whole urothelium with a majority not yet described in the context of the urinary bladder. Four additional proteins were found specifically in the umbrella cells (Uroplakin 1a, 2, 3a, and 3b), and three in the intermediate/basal cells (KRT17, PCP4L1 and ATP1A4). 61 of the 90 elevated genes have not been previously described in the context of urinary bladder and the corresponding proteins are interesting targets for more in-depth studies. In summary, an integrated omics approach using transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling has been used to define a comprehensive list of proteins elevated in the urinary bladder."

Study Design and Participants Cross-sectional study of 165 participants (132 women, 33 men) with BMI ≥35 kg/m2 or ≥30 kg/m2 with comorbidities, enrolling in a multidisciplinary obesity treatment program. Method Data collection at admission of present and life-time health issues including symptomatology of anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Adult ADHD Self-Report scale); self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), suicide attempts, health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey), psychosocial functioning related to obesity (Obesity-related Problems Scale), cardiorespiratory fitness (Astrand´s bicycle ergometer test), somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities, cardiometabolic risk factors, and micronutritional status. We used multiple regression analysis to identify variables independently associated with present anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Results Mean body mass index was 39.2 kg/m2 (SD = 5.2). We found evidence of poor mental health, including present psychiatric diagnoses (29%), symptomatology of anxiety (47%), depression (27%) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (37%); low self-esteem (42%), attempted suicide (12%), and low quality of life (physical component score = 46, SD = 11.2; mental component score = 36, SD = 13.9, P<0.001 for difference). Variables independently associated with present anxiety symptomatology (R2 = 0.33, P<0.001) included low self-esteem (P<0.001) and pain (P = 0.003), whereas present depressive symptomatology (R2 = 0.38, P<0.001) was independently associated with low self-esteem (P<0.001), low cardiorespiratory fitness (P = 0.009) and obesity-related problems (P = 0.018).

https://openalex.org/W2407281442,"Peg3 is an imprinted gene that is predicted to encode a DNA-binding zinc finger protein. This was previously demonstrated through Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation-based Sequencing experiments. In the current study, we reanalyzed the previous ChIP-Seq results and further characterized the DNA-binding motif of PEG3. According to the results, PEG3 binds to the promoters and enhancers of a subset of genes that are closely associated with the known functions of Peg3. Some of these identified targets include Tufm, Mrpl45, Cry2, Per1, Slc25a29 and Slc38a2. With this set of targets, we derived a DNA-binding motif of PEG3, 5’-GTGGCAGT-3’, which also provides a tabulated matrix that can be used for predicting other unknown genomic targets. Among the newly identified targets, we analyzed in detail the two loci, Slc38a2 and Slc38a4, which are known to be involved in neutral amino acid transport. The results indicated that PEG3 likely functions as a transcriptional repressor for these two loci. Overall, the current study provides a set of genomic targets and also redefines the DNA-binding motif for the imprinted transcription factor PEG3."
https://openalex.org/W2198830294,"The formation of functional amyloid must be carefully regulated to prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic products. Premelanosome protein (PMEL) forms non-toxic functional amyloid fibrils that assemble into sheets upon which melanins ultimately are deposited within the melanosomes of pigment cells. PMEL is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum but forms amyloid only within post-Golgi melanosome precursors; thus, PMEL must traverse the secretory pathway in a non-amyloid form. Here, we identified two pre-amyloid PMEL intermediates that likely regulate the timing of fibril formation. Analyses by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and sedimentation velocity revealed two native high Mr disulfide-bonded species that contain Golgi-modified forms of PMEL. These species correspond to disulfide bond-containing dimeric and monomeric PMEL isoforms that contain no other proteins as judged by two-dimensional PAGE of metabolically labeled/immunoprecipitated PMEL and by mass spectrometry of affinity-purified complexes. Metabolic pulse-chase analyses, small molecule inhibitor treatments, and evaluation of site-directed mutants suggest that the PMEL dimer forms around the time of endoplasmic reticulum exit and is resolved by disulfide bond rearrangement into a monomeric form within the late Golgi or a post-Golgi compartment. Mutagenesis of individual cysteine residues within the non-amyloid cysteine-rich Kringle-like domain stabilizes the disulfide-bonded dimer and impairs fibril formation as determined by electron microscopy. Our data show that the Kringle-like domain facilitates the resolution of disulfide-bonded PMEL dimers and promotes PMEL functional amyloid formation, thereby suggesting that PMEL dimers must be resolved to monomers to generate functional amyloid fibrils.

https://openalex.org/W2199339413,"The use of carboplatin in cancer chemotherapy is limited by the emergence of drug resistance. To understand the molecular basis for this resistance, a chemogenomic screen was performed in 53 yeast mutants that had previously presented strong sensitivity to this widely used anticancer agent. Thirty-four mutants were responsive to carboplatin, and from these, 21 genes were selected for further studies because they have human homologues. Sixty percent of these yeast genes possessed human homologues which encoded proteins that interact with cullin scaffolds of ubiquitin ligases, or whose mRNA are under the regulation of Human antigen R (HuR) protein. Both HuR and cullin proteins are regulated through NEDDylation post-translational modification, and so our results indicate that inhibition of this process should sensitise resistant tumour cells to carboplatin. We showed that treatment of a tumour cell line with MLN4924, a NEDDylation inhibitor, overcame the resistance to carboplatin. Our data suggest that inhibition of NEDDylation may be a useful strategy to resensitise tumour cells in patients that have acquired carboplatin resistance."

Binding of TF to FVIIa promotes allosteric conformational changes in the FVIIa protease domain and improves its catalytic properties. Extensive studies have revealed two putative pathways for this allosteric communication. Here we provide further details of this allosteric communication by investigating FVIIa loop swap variants containing the 170 loop of trypsin that display TF-independent enhanced activity. Using x-ray crystallography, we show that the introduced 170 loop from trypsin directly interacts with the FVIIa active site, stabilizing segment 215–217 and activation loop 3, leading to enhanced activity. Molecular dynamics simulations and novel fluorescence quenching studies support that segment 215–217 conformation is pivotal to the enhanced activity of the FVIIa variants. We speculate that the allosteric regulation of FVIIa activity by TF binding follows a similar path in conjunction with protease domain N terminus insertion, suggesting a more complete molecular basis of TF-mediated allosteric enhancement of FVIIa activity.

The FVIIa·TF complex initiates the coagulation cascade by activating FIX and FX, leading to thrombin generation and eventually wound healing (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W.

The crystal structure of the complex of blood coagulation factor VIIa with soluble tissue factor.Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In trypsin, the N terminus formed upon activation spontaneously enters the activation pocket to form a salt bridge with residue Asp194. This key interaction leads to optimal alignment and architecture of the oxyanion hole and primary specificity pocket (S1), resulting in a mature active site for substrate binding and catalysis (3Huber R. Bode W. Structural basis of the activation and action of trypsin.Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 266: 114-122Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In FVIIa, the newly formed N terminus fails to completely insert into the activation pocket (4Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. Identification of regions of bovine factor VII essential for binding to tissue factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a non-optimal configuration of the catalytic machinery, rendering FVIIa “zymogen-like” with inferior catalytic efficiency. TF binding allosterically corrects these defects in the catalytic domain by stabilizing the 170 loop (amino acids 170–178) in conjunction with activation loops 1–3 (AL1–3) and promotes N terminus insertion (Fig. 1B) (5Rand K.D.

Previous studies have provided details of TF-binding regions in the FVIIa light chain and on structural changes in the protease domain upon cofactor binding. However, the full extent of TF-mediated structural changes has yet to be fully elucidated, and key components of the allosteric pathways remain elusive (10Persson E. Olsen O.H. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 3156-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular basis of TF-mediated allosteric regulation of FVIIa activity, we considered FVIIa variants displaying superior catalytic efficiency in the absence of TF, variants modified in the vicinity of either the 170 loop (11Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H.

Higashi S. Iwanaga S. Factor VIIa modified in the 170 loop shows enhanced catalytic activity but does not change the zymogen-like property.J. Biol.

Interestingly, FVIIa-YT displays a similar extent of N terminus insertion as FVIIa wild type (WT) in the absence of TF; however, FVIIa-YT displays improved catalytic efficiency.

In particular, segment 215–217 was shown to be vital for substrate access and cofactor-mediated allosteric regulation, which may also be the case in TF-mediated allosteric regulation of FVIIa activity (20Song H. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Rand K.D.

Tissue factor activates allosteric networks in factor VIIa through structural and dynamic changes.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2015; 13: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the improved catalytic efficiency of FVIIa-YT is due to stabilization of the 215–217 segment with Tyr172 playing an important role. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the FVIIa-YT variant and two variants of FVIIa-YT where this tyrosine is either replaced by serine (FVIIa-ST) or phenylalanine (FVIIa-FT) (Fig. 1D). Data presented here confirm that Tyr172 stabilizes the 215–217 segment and AL3 in the absence of TF, maturing the primary specificity pocket and enhancing catalytic efficiency independently of complete protease domain N terminus insertion. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations supported the experimental results and suggested the direct involvement of Trp215 in TF-mediated allosteric changes in the protease domain, further corroborated by fluorescence quenching studies and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) calculations. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that stabilization of segment 215–217 in the open conformation is a key step in TF-mediated allosteric regulation of FVIIa. H-d-Phe-Phe-Arg chloromethyl ketone TFA salt (FFR) was from Bachem (Basel, Switzerland). d-Ile-Pro-Arg p-nitroanilide (S-2288) was from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich and of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. Recombinant wild-type human FVIIa was prepared as described previously (11Persson E.

Structural changes in factor VIIa induced by Ca2+ and tissue factor studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the modification of using the reductase-deficient Escherichia coli strain BL21 Origami (Novagen, Germany). Factor Xa was purchased from Molecular Innovations. Human wild-type FVII cDNA was cloned into a QMCF vector (Icosagen AS, Estonia), and all variants were generated using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method with KOD Xtreme Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) or a QuikChange Lightning XL (Agilent) kit according to the manufacturers' instructions. Introduction of the desired mutations was verified by DNA sequencing of the entire FVII cDNA region (MWG Biotech, Germany). QMCF Technology, a semistable episomal mammalian expression system obtained from Icosagen AS (Estonia), was used for expression of the FVII variants in a QMCF CHO cell line (CHO-EBNALT85), and cells were cultivated according to the manufacturer's instructions. During a period of 3–4 weeks, the transfected cell cultures were expanded to 2–10 liters, and the media were harvested by centrifugation and 0.22-μm filtration. For all FVII variants, expression medium was adjusted to pH 6.0, CaCl2 was added to 5 mm, and benzamidine HCl was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. All purification steps were performed using an ÄKTA Explorer system (GE Healthcare) and consisted of an immunoaffinity purification step (γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain-specific) performed as described (23Persson E.

This was followed by a concentration and purification step using a prepacked 6-ml ResourceQTM (GE Healthcare) column at pH 6.0, eluting with a step gradient to 100 mm NaCl, 60 mm CaCl2 in 10 mm histidine. Activation of FVII variants was performed by passing the protein solution through a custom packed Tricon column (GE Healthcare) with factor Xa coupled to Sepharose 4B FF CNBr (GE Healthcare). Protein identity was verified using intact electrospray ionization-TOF mass spectrometry, and purity was shown to be >95% by Novex 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies). The amount of active protein was determined by active site titration using FFR and measuring residual S-2288 activity (24Persson E. Olsen O.H. Activation loop 3 and the 170 loop interact in the active conformation of coagulation factor VIIa.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3099-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. Preparation of samples for x-ray crystallography was performed by inhibiting FVIIa-YT, -ST, and -FT with FFR and adding sTF in a 1:1 molar relationship. Protein integrity was verified using SDS-PAGE.

The collected data were baseline-corrected, and inner filtering effects were addressed by a correction method for a right-angled fluorescence setup (33Lutz H. Luisi P.L. Correction for inner filter effects in fluorescence spectroscopy.Helv. Chim. Acta. 1983; 66: 1929-1935Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the correction factor being Fcorr = Fobs × 100.125 × [acrylamide] using a ϵ295 of 0.25 m−1 cm−1 for acrylamide and a path length of fluorescence measurement of 0.5 cm. Stern-Volmer plots were generated, and the data were analyzed using a dynamic collision quenching model (34Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2007: 277-293Google Scholar) in GraphPad Prism 6.0. F0F=1+KSV[Q](Eq.1) The observed correlation between the determined Stern-Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) values and the calculated SASA values was evaluated using a Pearson correlation approach in GraphPad Prism 6.0 to determine whether it could be explained by random sampling (α = 0.01). For MD simulations, the FVIIa 170 loop variants were constructed using the x-ray crystallographic structure of FVIIa-YT as a template. For the ST and FT variants, Tyr172 was mutated to Ser and Phe, respectively, while preserving the side chain rotamer of the template. FVIIa-WT was based on a representative structure of benzamidine-inhibited FVIIa (Protein Data Bank code 1kli (35Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.P. Huber R. Bode W. Kresse G.-B. Kopetzki E.

The complex of sTF 1–213 and FVIIa was constructed starting from Protein Data Bank code 1dan as described and graciously provided by Ohkubo et al. (8Ohkubo Y.Z. Morrissey J.H. Tajkhorshid E.

In all structures, the co-crystallized inhibitor was removed. 100-ns conventional MD simulations of the FVIIa-WT·sTF complex, FVIIa-WT, and the three FVIIa variants with the trypsin 170 loops were performed using the NAMD 2.7 software package (36Phillips J.C.

Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926Crossref Scopus (30037) Google Scholar). An integration time step of 1.0 fs was used for the velocity Verlet algorithm. Simulations were carried out at constant pressure (P = 1 atm) and constant temperature (T = 310 K) controlled by the Langevin thermostat (damping coefficient, 5/ps) and the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston barostat (39Martyna G.J. Tobias D.J. Klein M.L. Constant pressure molecular dynamics algorithms.J. Chem. Phys. 1994; 101: 4177Crossref Scopus (3625) Google Scholar, 40Feller S.E. Zhang Y. Pastor R.W. Brooks B.R. Constant pressure molecular dynamics simulation: the Langevin piston method.J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 4613Crossref Scopus (3297) Google Scholar), respectively. Throughout, anisotropic pressure coupling was applied for the barostat using a piston damping coefficient of 5/ps, a piston period of 100 fs, and piston decay of 50 fs. Long range electrostatic forces were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method (41Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. A smooth particle mesh Ewald method.J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15693) Google Scholar) using a grid spacing of ∼1 Å and a fourth order spline for interpolation. Electrostatic forces were updated every 4th fs. van der Waals interactions were cut off at 12 Å in combination with a switching function beginning at 10 Å. Periodic boundary conditions was applied in x-, y-, and z-directions. The potential energy in all systems was initially minimized using 500 steps of the conjugated gradient method. The SASA was calculated for all tryptophans in the simulated FVIIa variants during the entire time course at a probe radius of 1.4 Å using the standard implementation (measure command) in VMD (42Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar). The same calculations were made for the crystal structures with FFR present. For graphical comparison of SASA values for Trp215 between variants, the data were smoothened using the Savistsky and Golay method in GraphPad Prism 6.0 with a window size of 10 and a second degree polynomial. Previous studies have shown that the conformation of the 170 loop is affected by the binding of TF to FVIIa (2Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. The crystal structure of the complex of blood coagulation factor VIIa with soluble tissue factor.Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 6Pike A.C.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8925-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In agreement, impairment of cofactor interaction was observed for the three FVIIa variants as assessed by the effect of sTF on FVIIa amidolytic activity (S-2288) (Fig. 2, A–D, and Table 1). FVIIa-YT displayed an 84-fold compromise in its ability to bind to sTF but could be fully stimulated by the addition of saturating sTF, reaching a higher final amidolytic activity than FVIIa-WT·sTF (Fig. 2, A and D). This indicates that the engineered 170 loop in FVIIa-YT selectively affects sTF binding but is still able to mediate allosteric communication to the FVIIa active site upon sTF binding. From the kinetics of S-2288 hydrolysis, we found that the increased FVIIa-YT activity at saturating sTF concentration was entirely due to an increased kcat value with no change in the Km value compared with the FVIIa-WT·sTF complex (Fig. 2D and Table 1). In addition, we reproduced the higher activity of FVIIa-YT without sTF with an increase in kcat/Km of 8.3-fold over FVIIa-WT (12Soejima K. Mizuguchi J. Yuguchi M. Nakagaki T. Higashi S. Iwanaga S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17229-17235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The importance of Tyr172 was evident as the removal of a single hydroxyl group (FVIIa-FT) resulted in a markedly decreased potentiation of activity and a loss in sTF affinity (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1) with an accompanying reduction of the intrinsic activity to half that of FVIIa-WT (Fig. 2C and Table 1). The FVIIa-ST variant showed a partial rescue of sTF affinity (Table 1), maintaining a 4-fold higher intrinsic activity compared with FVIIa-WT, whereas the activity level at saturating sTF concentration was significantly reduced (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Independent surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed sTF affinity values for the three FVIIa variants obtained by the amidolytic activity strategy (data not shown).TABLE 1Functional investigation of 170 loop variantsS-2288 KMS-2288 kcatkcat/KMpABA KiKNCO t½mms−1s−1/mmμmmin−sTFFVIIa-WT8.9 (0.4)7.7 (0.2)0.9 (0.02)1485.0 (87.7)43.9 (1.0)FVIIa-YT4.0 (0.1)30.4 (0.5)7.5 (0.2)97.6 (10.1)40.8 (0.5)FVIIa-ST5.3 (0.2)19.3 (0.3)3.6 (0.1)190.4 (13.1)43.8 (0.6)FVIIa-FT15.4 (1.3)6.8 (0.4)0.4 (0.01)490.3 (46.3)32.4 (0.7)+sTFFVIIa-WT1.2 (0.03)34.6 (0.2)28.0 (0.4)49.3 (1.8)536.2 (39.6)FVIIa-YT1.2 (0.02)41.7 (0.2)34.4 (0.5)2"

These cells are retained around the oocyte by a hyaluronan-rich extracellular matrix synthesized before ovulation, a process called cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC) expansion. Hyaluronan release and dispersion of the cumulus cells progressively occur after ovulation, paralleling the decline of oocyte fertilization. We show here that, in mice, postovulatory changes of matrix are temporally correlated to cumulus cell death. Cumulus cell apoptosis and matrix disassembly also occurred in ovulated COCs cultured in vitro. COCs expanded in vitro with FSH or EGF underwent the same changes, whereas those expanded with 8-bromo-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) maintained integrity for a longer time. It is noteworthy that 8-Br-cAMP treatment was also effective on ovulated COCs cultured in vitro, prolonging the vitality of the cumulus cells and the stability of the matrix from a few hours to >2 days. Stimulation of endogenous adenylate cyclase with forskolin or inhibition of phosphodiesterase with rolipram produced similar effects. The treatment with selective cAMP analogues suggests that the effects of cAMP elevation are exerted through an EPAC-independent, PKA type II-dependent signaling pathway, probably acting at the post-transcriptional level. Finally, overnight culture of ovulated COCs with 8-Br-cAMP significantly counteracted the decrease of fertilization rate, doubling the number of fertilized oocytes compared with control conditions. In conclusion, these studies suggest that cAMP-elevating agents prevent cumulus cell senescence and allow them to continue to exert beneficial effects on oocyte and sperm, thereby extending in vitro the time frame of oocyte fertilizability.

The formation of the antral cavity in the ovarian follicle separates most of the follicle cells from the oocyte with the exception of a small mass of follicle cells, named cumulus cells or cumulus oophorus, which remain closely associated with the oocyte, forming the cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC). 2The abbreviations used are: COC, cumulus cell-oocyte complex; HA, hyaluronan; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; dbcAMP, N6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; 8-AHA-cAMP, 8-(6-aminohexylamino)adenosine- 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; 6-Mb-cAMP, N6-monobutyryladenosine-3′,5′- cyclic monophosphate; 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; PMSG, pregnant mares' serum gonadotropin. These cells play a critical role in the regulation of meiotic resumption and acquisition of developmental competence by the oocyte during the time preceding ovulation (1Conti M. Hsieh M. Zamah A.M.

Reciprocally, the oocyte deeply influences gene expression in these cells by modulating their response to gonadotropins and paracrine factors synthesized by the cells of the follicle wall, namely mural granulosa cells (6Gilchrist R.B.

One of the most evident changes controlled by the oocyte in mouse cumulus before ovulation is the expansion process (i.e. the synthesis of an abundant extracellular matrix with unique physical properties) (7Russell D.L. Salustri A. Extracellular matrix of the cumulus-oocyte complex.Semin. Reprod. Med. 2006; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).

During this process, the connections among cumulus cells and between cumulus cells and oocyte are progressively lost, but the cells remain associated with the oocyte, being embedded in the expanded matrix. This oocyte envelope is essential for successful ovulation and fertilization. The visco-elasticity of the matrix allows the oocyte to wriggle out of the follicle and to be captured by the ciliary epithelium of the oviduct (13Talbot P. Videotape analysis of hamster ovulation in vitro.J. Exp. Zool. 1983; 225: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Lam X. Gieseke C. Knoll M. Talbot P.

Extracellular matrix of the cumulus-oocyte complex.Semin. Reprod. Med. 2006; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In fact, this matrix can be easily crossed by the sperm, and its integral components, as well as soluble factors released by the cumulus cells, are involved in attracting the sperm toward the oocyte and in promoting capacitation and initiating acrosome reaction, processes required for successful fertilization (15Eisenbach M. Giojalas L.C. Sperm guidance in mammals: an unpaved road to the egg.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 16Jin M. Fujiwara E. Kakiuchi Y. Okabe M.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4892-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is well known that oocytes must be fertilized within a narrow window of time from ovulation. After this time, a series of ooplasmic modifications, collectively known as oocyte aging, rapidly occurs in the female gamete, diminishing its fertilizability and embryo developmental potential (17Fissore R.A.

Update. 2009; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Delayed fertilization of the ovulated oocytes results in early pregnancy loss and increased offspring morbidity in rodents and appears to increase the risk of abortion in humans (19Tarín J.J. Pérez-Albalá S. Cano A. Consequences on offspring of abnormal function in ageing gametes.Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Tarín J.J. Pérez-Albalá S.

Weinberg C.R. Baird D.D. Post-ovulatory ageing of the human oocyte and embryo failure.Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A reduction in meiotic promoting factor, which regulates the exit from Met II block, occurs in the mouse oocyte as early as 6 h after ovulation. Moreover, disorganization of cortical actin cytoskeleton and displacement and instability of the spindle are clearly apparent after 12 h of staying in the oviduct, accounting for the increased incidence of scattering of chromosomes and cytoplasm fragmentation upon fertilization that is a prelude to embryonic aneuploidy (17Fissore R.A.

Update. 2009; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a progressive reduction in cumulus cell mass parallels the aging of the enclosed oocyte, leading almost to oocyte denudation in ∼15 h (i.e. about 28 h after an ovulatory dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)) (22Marston J.H. Chang M.C. The fertilizable life of ova and their morphology following delayed insemination in mature and immature mice.J. Exp. Zool. 1964; 155: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized HA by COCs induced to expand in vitro with FSH allowed the determination that disassembly of the viscoelastic matrix begins 3–4 h after the completion of expansion and continues thereafter, promoting the shedding of cumulus cells (23Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. Effects of exogenous hyaluronic acid and serum on matrix organization and stability in the mouse cumulus cell-oocyte complex.J. Biol.

Control of mouse cumulus cell-oocyte complex integrity before and after ovulation: plasminogen activator synthesis and matrix degradation.Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3033-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The HA was released from the matrix into the medium without any significant variation in size (23Camaioni A. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Salustri A. Effects of exogenous hyaluronic acid and serum on matrix organization and stability in the mouse cumulus cell-oocyte complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20473-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the disassembly of the matrix is not dependent on cleavage of this polymer but rather on degradation of proteins involved in its organization. Degeneration of cumulus cells has been described in mouse postovulatory COCs (25Longo F.J. Aging of mouse eggs in vivo and in vitro.Gamete Res. 1980; 3: 379-393Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and apoptosis signature has been revealed in rat COCs after a prolonged staying in the oviduct (26Szołtys M. Tabarowski Z. Pawlik A. Apoptosis of postovulatory cumulus granulosa cells of the rat.Anat. Embryol. 2000; 202: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, a precise estimate of the functional life of cumulus cells and its correlation with cumulus matrix degradation and oocyte aging is missing. In view of the pressing need to improve the conditions for promoting and preserving the quality of the oocytes during their culture and handling in assisted reproduction programs, we performed a systematic study on temporal patterns of cumulus cell apoptosis and dispersion in ovulated COC and in COC expanded in vitro in order to identify factors regulating these processes and to determine the impact they might have on the fertile life of the oocyte. Pregnant mares' serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and hCG were purchased from Intervet (Boxmeer, The Netherlands). Highly purified rat FSH I-8 was kindly provided by the NIDDK and the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Epidermal growth factor (EGF), cycloheximide, UO126, and Streptomyces hyaluronidase were purchased from Calbiochem. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) was obtained from R&D System. Minimal essential medium, fetal calf serum (FCS), gentamycin, and HEPES buffer were obtained from Gibco, Invitrogen. Mineral oil, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 8-bromo-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), dbcAMP, 8-AHA-cAMP, 6-Mb-cAMP, forskolin, H89, LY294002, and wortmannin were from Sigma. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was from Biolog. Sephadex G50 was from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]Glucosamine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The in situ cell death detection kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Immature 21–22-day-old female Swiss CD1 mice were used for all experiments. Animals were primed by intraperitoneal injection of PMSG (5 IU) to promote the formation of multiple antral follicles and, 44–48 h later, received an intraperitoneal injection of hCG (5 IU) to induce ovulation. All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and carried out according to Italian and European regulations (D.L.vo 116/92; C.E. 609/86). Ovaries were dissected from mice injected 44–48 h earlier with PMSG and transferred to minimal essential medium containing 25 mm Hepes, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 mg/ml BSA. COCs were isolated under the microscope by puncturing the larger follicles with a needle. For each culture, 10 compact COCs were collected by a glass micropipette and transferred to a 20-μl drop of culture medium covered with dimethylpolysiloxane to prevent evaporation. The basal culture medium was minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 3 mm glutamine, 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 ng/ml gentamycin. Expansion was induced by adding to the medium either 20 ng/ml FSH, 1 ng/ml EGF, or 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and the cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Full expansion was achieved at 15 h of culture, and disassembly of the expanded matrix and cumulus cell apoptosis were investigated thereafter at the times indicated under “Results.” When the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on FSH- or EGF-expanded COCs was studied, 2 μl of medium was removed from the 20-μl drop at 15 h of culture and replaced with 2 μl of 10 mm 8-Br-cAMP to reach a final concentration of 1 mm. The same procedure was used to study the effect of H89, LY294002, wortmannin, and UO126 on 8-Br-cAMP action. In this case, the inhibitors were added 1 h before (14 h of culture with FSH or EGF) 8-Br-cAMP. Cultures of isolated cumulus cells were performed by mechanical dissociation of 10 COCs in a 20-μl culture medium drop and removal of the oocytes, as described (27Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Mouse oocytes regulate hyaluronic acid synthesis and mucification by FSH-stimulated cumulus cells.Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Expansion was induced with 100 ng/ml FSH and 5 ng/ml TGFβ. In studies of apoptosis in vivo, animals were sacrificed at 13 h (time of ovulation), 20 h, or 24 h after hCG injection. Oviducts were dissected and transferred to HEPES-buffered medium (see above). Ampullae were opened with a needle, and the ovulated COCs were immediately processed. To study apoptosis in ovulated COCs cultured in vitro, COCs obtained from three oviducts of three different mice were cultured in 500 μl of minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, 3 mm glutamine, 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 ng/ml gentamycin and treated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or other compounds reported under “Results” at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the time indicated. When the effect of H89, LY294002, wortmannin, and UO126 on 8-Br-cAMP action was studied, the inhibitors were added at the beginning of culture, and 8-Br-cAMP was added 1 h later. The dissociation of the matrix was assessed by morphological evaluation and expressed in arbitrary units from 0 (intact COC) to 4 (denuded oocyte). COCs were collected at 13 h after hCG and cultured for 14 h in 500 μl of basal medium containing 5% FCS with or without 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP. To normalize biological variability, the COCs collected from the oviducts of each animal were equally distributed in the two experimental culture conditions. Oocytes denuded of cumulus cells were obtained from COCs isolated at 13 h after hCG by digesting the matrix with 30 units/ml testicular hyaluronidase for 5 min at room temperature. After dispersion of cumulus cells, denuded oocytes were collected and cultured in the same conditions and for the same time as COCs. Cumulus cell oocyte complexes and denuded oocytes either freshly isolated (0 h of culture) or cultured in vitro for 14 h were transferred to a 100-μl drop of Whitten's medium supplemented with 15 mg/ml BSA. Spermatozoa were obtained from the epididymis of CD1-proven breeders and were capacitated (2 h) in the same medium used for fertilization. Subsequently, 10 μl of a sperm suspension containing 5–10 × 106 spermatozoa/ml was added to oocyte cultures. After 6 h, the oocytes were observed via the interference-contrast microscope to determine the fraction undergoing fragmentation and the fraction normally fertilized, by the identification of the two pronuclei. The development of the embryo at the two-cell stage was assessed at 24 h after insemination. COCs were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). After washing with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA, COCs were processed for TUNEL staining. Cells were permeabilized for 2 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After a wash with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA, COCs were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with TUNEL reaction mixture, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A negative control was included by incubating COCs in TUNEL reaction mix without TdT. To visualize chromatin, COCs were counterstained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 5 min and washed extensively with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA. COCs were individually transferred in a small volume on a slide and gently pressed under a coverslip until cumulus cells, dispersed in the tridimensional structure of the matrix, lay on the same focal plane. Cells were examined by an Olympus Axioplan 2 microscope in fluorescent mode. Cells showing a homogeneous and moderate chromatin staining by Hoechst 33258 throughout the entire nucleus resulted in negative TUNEL staining and therefore were considered healthy cells. On the contrary, cells with nuclei containing chromatin deeply stained with Hoechst 33258, either merged into masses aligned with the nuclear membrane, shrunken into a single mass, or fragmented into multiple masses that occurred in clusters immediately adjacent to one another, resulted in TUNEL-positive staining and were therefore defined as apoptotic cells. Pilot experiments showed that quantitative evaluation of apoptosis performed by nuclear morphology matched that made by TUNEL staining. Therefore, in the following experiments, COCs were stained with Hoechst 33258, and cells with healthy and apoptotic features were counted in six random fields for each COC through a ×400 magnification in fluorescent mode. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated for each COC. Between 7 and 10 COCs for each sample were analyzed in each experiment. In order to evaluate the distribution of HA between cell matrix and medium compartments during matrix disassembly, 10 COCs were cultured in a 20-μl drop of medium in the presence of FSH, EGF, or 8-Br-cAMP (see above) and with [3H]glucosamine (100 μCi/ml). Cultures were analyzed at 15 h, when full expansion is achieved, and at later times, as indicated under “Results.” At the end of culture, medium and cell matrix were processed separately, and the percentage of HA in the two compartments was assessed as described previously (28Ievoli E. Lindstedt R. Inforzato A. Camaioni A. Palone F. Day A.J. Mantovani A. Salvatori G. Salustri A. Implication of the oligomeric state of the N-terminal PTX3 domain in cumulus matrix assembly.Matrix Biol. 2011; 30: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the incubation medium was aspirated, and the medium and matrix fractions were separately treated with 20 μl of a papain solution (750 mIU final activity) for 1 h at 65 °C. The extraction was completed by adding 1 volume of 8 m guanidine HCl containing 4% (w/v) Triton X-100. Each extract was heated at 100 °C for 3 min to inactivate the papain and diluted to 500 μl by adding 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 7.3, followed by elution on a column of Sephadex G50 (2-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m sodium acetate, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.3. The excluded volume, containing the labeled macromolecules, was recovered and counted. Each sample was then digested with 1 IU of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 37 °C and then eluted on a column of Sephadex G-50 (8-ml bed volume). The excluded and the included fractions were counted to determine the HA proportion of the total radiolabeled molecules. To compare the rate and time course of HA synthesis in different conditions, the mass of HA synthesized was determined (in hexosamine equivalents) at different times of culture from 3 to 40 h, as described previously (8Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Synthesis and accumulation of hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans in the mouse cumulus cell-oocyte complex during follicle-stimulating hormone-induced mucification.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COCs were stimulated in the presence of [35S]sulfate (∼60 μCi/ml) and [3H]glucosamine (100 μCi/ml), and the specific activity of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pools was calculated from the ratio of 3H to 35S in the proteoglycan 4S disaccharides. COCs were transferred in a 20-μl drop of medium. Movies were captured during aspiration of the medium (i.e. under the pressure exerted by the increase of superficial tension), and during the release back of the medium (i.e. the decrease of the applied force). A Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope using a ×10, numerical aperture 0.25 Nikon PLAN objective and NIS Elements imaging software were used. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance of the difference between two treatments was analyzed by Student's t test, whereas one-way analysis of variance with the addition of Turkey's test was used for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Following hCG injection into PMSG-primed mice, compact COCs undergo volumetric expansion for the deposition of an abundant HA-enriched extracellular matrix. At 13 h after hCG, fully expanded COCs are released from the ovarian follicles and captured by the oviducts. A progressive reduction in cumulus cell mass occurs in the oviduct during the following time leading almost to oocyte denudation in ∼11–15 h (24–28 h after hCG) (Fig. 1A). Nuclear morphology of cumulus cells was examined at different times during the postovulatory period by Hoechst 33258 staining (Fig. 1B). At ovulation (13 h after hCG), almost all cumulus cells showed intact nuclei with low and quite homogeneous chromatin staining, but 7 and 11 h later (at 20 and 24 h after hCG, respectively), a large number of cells with highly condensed chromatin, either shrunken into a single mass or fragmented into multiple masses, was observed. TUNEL staining clearly revealed that cells with the above mentioned morphological features contained fragmented DNA (Fig. 1B). Then, for a quantitative evaluation of apoptosis, chromatin staining was performed, and the number of apoptotic cells was counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells/COC (Fig. 1C). Cumulus cell-oocyte complexes isolated from the ovary 4 h before ovulation (9 h after hCG) showed almost no sign of apoptosis (0.9 ± 0.05%), and those freshly ovulated (13 h after hCG) had very few apoptotic cells (2.3 ± 0.5%). The percentage of apoptotic cells abruptly increased thereafter, ∼8- and 15-fold at 4 and 7 h after ovulation, respectively (17 and 20 h after hCG), reaching a value of 35.8 ± 3%. The apoptotic rate did not apparently increase further during the following 4 h (i.e. at 24 h after hCG). However, at this later time, the number of cells surrounding the oocyte was extremely reduced, and much scattered cellular debris containing a variable amount of condensed chromatin was present (Fig. 1B). For this reason, 20 h after hCG was the time chosen to investigate the apoptotic process in the following experiments. To determine whether cumulus cell apoptosis was induced by the oviductal environment, COCs were collected at 13 h after hCG and cultured in vitro. The number of apoptotic cells/COC was then evaluated after 7 h of culture and compared with that observed in COCs retrieved from the oviducts 7 h after ovulation (i.e. at 20 h after hCG). The results showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells significantly increased during in vitro culture, reaching the same value observed in COCs maintained for the same time in the oviduct (Fig. 1D). Therefore, it seems that cumulus cell death is not due to detrimental effects by the oviduct. A series of studies highlighted the essential role of endocrine and paracrine factors in sustaining mural granulosa cell survival in the ovarian follicles (29Markström E. Svensson E.C. Shao R. Svanberg B. Billig H. Survival factors regulating ovarian apoptosis: dependence on follicle differentiation.Reproduction. 2002; 123: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has been reported that mural granulosa cells cultured in vitro undergo apoptosis unless serum or growth factors, including EGF, basic FGF, insulin-like growth factor, or gonadotropins were added to the cultures. To investigate whether the onset of cumulus cell apoptosis after ovulation could be due to the deprivation of follicle survival factors, ovulated COCs were cultured for 7 h with the factors mentioned above (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, neither serum nor any of the growth factors tested were effective in preventing spontaneous onset of apoptosis by ovulated cumulus cell"

Our aim was to describe the roles of serglycin in processes relevant for endothelial dysfunction. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in vitro and the expression of proteoglycans was investigated. Dense cell cultures representing the quiescent endothelium coating the vasculature was compared to sparse activated cell cultures, relevant for diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Secretion of 35S- proteoglycans increased in sparse cultures, and we showed that serglycin is a major component of the cell-density sensitive proteoglycan population. In contrast to the other proteoglycans, serglycin expression and secretion was higher in proliferating compared to quiescent HUVEC. RNAi silencing of serglycin inhibited proliferation and wound healing, and serglycin expression and secretion was augmented by hypoxia, mechanical strain and IL-1β induced inflammation. Notably, the secretion of the angiogenic chemokine CCL2 resulting from IL-1β activation, was increased in serglycin knockdown cells, while angiopoietin was not affected. Both serglycin and CCL2 were secreted predominantly to the apical side of polarized HUVEC, and serglycin and CCL2 co-localized both in perinuclear areas and in vesicles. These results suggest functions for serglycin in endothelial cells trough interactions with partner molecules, in biological processes with relevance for diabetic complications, cardiovascular disease and cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2214137463,"Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) (NMRs) are the longest living rodents known. They show negligible senescence, and are resistant to cancers and certain damaging effects associated with aging. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have pluripotent actions, influencing growth processes in virtually every system of the body. They are established contributors to the aging process, confirmed by the demonstration that decreased IGF signaling results in life-extending effects in a variety of species. The IGFs are likewise involved in progression of cancers by mediating survival signals in malignant cells. This report presents a full characterization of the IGF system in the NMR: ligands, receptors, IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), and IGFBP proteases. A particular emphasis was placed on the IGFBP protease, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), shown to be an important lifespan modulator in mice. Comparisons of IGF-related genes in the NMR with human and murine sequences indicated no major differences in essential parts of the IGF system, including PAPP-A. The protease was shown to possess an intact active site despite the report of a contradictory genome sequence. Furthermore, PAPP-A was expressed and translated in NMRs cells and retained IGF-dependent proteolytic activity towards IGFBP-4 and IGF-independent activity towards IGFBP-5. However, experimental data suggest differential regulatory mechanisms for PAPP-A expression in NMRs than those described in humans and mice. This overall description of the IGF system in the NMR represents an initial step towards elucidating the complex molecular mechanisms underlying longevity, and how these animals have evolved to ensure a delayed and healthy aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2285187378,"Monocytes and macrophages are critical for the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy. Responses to antibody-coated tumor cells are largely mediated by Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), which become activated upon binding to immune complexes. FcγRIIb is an inhibitory FcγR that negatively regulates these responses, and it is expressed on monocytes and macrophages. Therefore, deletion or down-regulation of this receptor may substantially enhance therapeutic outcomes. Here we screened a panel of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and found that those selective for TLR4 and TLR8 could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcγRIIb. Upon further examination, we found that treatment of monocytes with TLR4 agonists could lead to the ubiquitination of FcγRIIb protein. A search of our earlier microarray database of monocytes activated with the TLR7/8 agonist R-848 (in which FcγRIIb was down-regulated) revealed an up-regulation of membrane-associated ring finger (C3HC4) 3 (MARCH3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, we tested whether LPS treatment could up-regulate MARCH3 in monocytes and whether this E3 ligase was involved with LPS-mediated FcγRIIb down-regulation. The results showed that LPS activation of TLR4 significantly increased MARCH3 expression and that siRNA against MARCH3 prevented the decrease in FcγRIIb following LPS treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2403361004,"Introduction The aim of this study was to assess inequality of experience of dental caries, based on race/ethnicity, among Brazilian adolescents aged 15 to 19 years in 2010 and test whether socioeconomic indicators fully explain ethnic differences in dental caries. Methods Data from a National Oral Health Survey conducted in Brazil in 2010 was analysed. Race/ethnicity was self-assigned and modified to White, African descents, East Asian descents, Mixed Race and Indigenous descents. The prevalence of caries experience by race/ethnic group in 2010(n = 5,367) was calculated. Further analysis included conceptual hierarchical modelling and mediation analysis. Results Caries experience was 76.9% in 15 to 19 year old Brazilians in 2010. While African descents were 32% more likely to have caries experience than Whites, Mixed Race were 69% more likely to have caries experience than Whites. Hierarchical conceptual modelling analysis confirmed the highly significant association between caries and race/ethnicity. Mixed Race and East Asian descents were 1.44 (95% CI 1.24–1.67) and 1.81 (95% CI 1.02–3.20) times more likely to experience caries than Whites after adjusting for age, sex, education and income. The difference in the likelihood of experiencing caries between Whites and African descents was not statistically significant after adjusting for years of education and family income. The results of mediation analysis confirmed that inequality of caries experience between Whites and Mixed Race and East Asian descents was mediated through education and income. The likelihood that Mixed Race and East Asian descents would experience caries compared to Whites was attenuated, by 14.8% and by 9.5% respectively, after adjusting for years of education and income. Conclusions Data analysis demonstrated that Whites have benefited more from the significant reduction in dental caries experience in 15 to 19 year old Brazilians, as compared to African descents and Mixed Race. Education and income fully explained ethnic inequalities in experience of dental caries between Whites and African descents, and largely explained inequalities between Whites and Mixed Race."
https://openalex.org/W2206745786,"Hydrogenotrophic methanogens can use gaseous substrates, such as H2 and CO2, in CH4 production. H2 gas is used to reduce CO2. We have successfully operated a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor (Hf-MBfR) for stable and continuous CH4 production from CO2 and H2. CO2 and H2 were diffused into the culture medium through the membrane without bubble formation in the Hf-MBfR, which was operated at pH 4.5–5.5 over 70 days. Focusing on the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, we analyzed the structure of the microbial community in the reactor. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was conducted with bacterial and archaeal 16S rDNA primers. Real-time qPCR was used to track changes in the community composition of methanogens over the course of operation. Finally, the microbial community and its diversity at the time of maximum CH4 production were analyzed by pyrosequencing methods. Genus Methanobacterium, related to hydrogenotrophic methanogens, dominated the microbial community, but acetate consumption by bacteria, such as unclassified Clostridium sp., restricted the development of acetoclastic methanogens in the acidic CH4 production process. The results show that acidic operation of a CH4 production reactor without any pH adjustment inhibited acetogenic growth and enriched the hydrogenotrophic methanogens, decreasing the growth of acetoclastic methanogens."

These studies reported a critical role for the YXY sequence of BST-2 in signaling, which induces the canonical NF-κB pathway and suggests that BST-2 signals, at least in part, via multimerization and the nitrogen-activated protein kinase TAK1. Although the mechanisms by which BST-2 inhibits HIV-1 release are well understood, little is known regarding the host co-factor(s) of BST-2 (18Miyakawa K. Ryo A. Murakami T. Ohba K. Yamaoka S.

To generate the pNFLAG-BST-2 plasmid, BST-2 was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pNFLAG-Bos plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Takashi Suda, Kanazawa University). The pGBKT7-BST-2-45–160aa was constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified BST-2 fragment (sequence corresponding to amino acids (aa) 45–160) into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech Laboratories Inc.). To construct the HA-tagged ATP1B3 and its deletion mutant expression constructs, the ATP1B3 gene and its deletion mutants were amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3.1-HA plasmid (33Nishitsuji H.

Differentiation of THP-1 cells was induced by treatment with 50 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24–72 h. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the Matchmaker Gold yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human normalized yeast two-hybrid library based on Y187 was purchased from Clontech Laboratories. The cells were transfected with 50 nm siRNA targeting human fibrillin-1 (siFibrillin1-1, catalog number AM4392420-s5044; siFibrillin1-2, catalog number AM4392420-s5045, Life Technologies), human ATP1B3 (siATP1B3-1, catalog number AM16708; s10253, siATP1B3-2, catalog number AM16708-s1739; siATP1B3-3, catalog number AM16708-s1740, Life Technologies), or BST-2 (siBST-2, catalog number AM4392420-s2103, Life Technologies) or were transfected with siRNA control (Silencer® Negative Control No. 1 siRNA, catalog number AM4611, Life Technologies) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies). HeLa cells were treated with 50 nm siATP1B3-1 or 50 nm siControl for 24 h before co-transfection with 100 ng of pNF-κB-luc (Agilent Technologies), along with 5 ng of phRG-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) and 200 ng of pcDNA, pNL4-3, or pNL4-3ΔVpu using Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h after transfection, the cell lysates were assessed using Dual-Luciferase reporter assays (Promega) with firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. 293T cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of pNFLAG or pNFLAG-BST-2 and 500 ng of pcDNA-HA-ATP1B3 or the indicated HA-tagged ATP1B3 deletion mutants using Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and 40 μl of protein G-magnetic beads (Life Technologies) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with PBS containing 0.02% Triton X-100. The immunocomplex was eluted by boiling with 20 μl of 5× sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The cell extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, l μg/ml aprotinin, l μg/ml antipain, l μg/ml bestatin, l μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm PMSF). The level of total protein in each sample was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample (corresponding to 20 μg of total protein) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 5% skim milk. The HIV-1 Gag proteins p55 and p24 were detected with the mouse monoclonal antibody 183-H12-5C (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). The monoclonal antibodies against anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the secondary antibody. 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3 or pNL4-3ΔVpu together with pMD.G (35Miyoshi H. Blömer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Development of a self-inactivating lentivirus vector.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. 293T cells were infected with NL4-3 or NL4-3ΔVpu. At 48 h after infection, the levels of HIV-1 p24 antigen were determined by the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Lumipulse f, Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). Total RNA was extracted from HeLa, 293T and 293 cells using an RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and cDNA was prepared with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) using oligo(dT) primers. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and fluorescent signals were analyzed with the StepOne RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems). BST-2 and GAPDH genes were amplified using the following primer pairs: 5′-TCTCCTGCAACAAGAGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCAGTCGCTCCACCTC-3′, 5′-CGACCACTTTGTCAAGCTCA-3′ and 5′-AGGGGTCTACATGGCAACTG-3′, respectively. HeLa cells and siATP1B3-1- or siBST-2-treated HeLa cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were stained with the following antibodies: mouse anti-ATP1B3 (ab67409; Abcam, Burlingame, CA) and polyclonal rabbit anti-BST-2 (ab14694; Abcam), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies), respectively. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) coupled with a Kr/Ar laser (488- and 594-nm lines). HeLa or 293/BST-2 cells were treated with 50 nm siATP1B3-1 or 50 nm siControl for 48 h. After treatment, the cells were pretreated with 0.5% trypsin, 0.2% EDTA for 10 min to detach adherent cells and were then washed twice with PBS, 0.5% BSA. To measure cell surface protein expression, the cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml BST-2 for 30 min at 4 °C, washed again with PBS/BSA, and then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies). FACS analysis was performed using the FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). HeLa or 293/BST-2 cells were treated with 50 nm siATP1B3-1 or 50 nm siControl. After the cells were treated for 48 h, they were incubated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated times. At each time point, cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. To address the roles of the extracellular domain of BST-2 in NF-κB activation and restriction of HIV-1 production, we identified the binding proteins of the extracellular domain (corresponding to aa 45–160) of BST-2 using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human-normalized cDNA library, which had a wide range of insert sizes (generally >400 bp) that were cloned into the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pGADT7, against the plasmid pGBKT7-BST-2-45–160aa, and obtained seven interacting clones (Table 1). From these seven clones, we chose three, fibrillin-1, EPCAM, and ATP1B3, which are membrane proteins, to further characterize their roles in BST-2-mediated HIV-1 restriction and NF-κB activation.TABLE 1BST-2 binding proteins identified in the yeast two-hybrid screensIsolated genesIsolated fragmentsaAmino acid coordinates of isolated fragments.Accession no.bGenBank accession numbers.No. of coloniesSodium/potassium-transporting ATP1B3180–279; 228–279U51478.14EPCAM81–202NM_002354.22Fibrillin-12706–2872; 2644–2872NM_000138.43E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RING2247–336NM_007212.32Zinc finger protein350–532NM_021632.32S-arrestin289–347NM_000541.42Keratin-like protein KRT222156–295NM_152349.22a Amino acid coordinates of isolated fragments.b GenBank accession numbers. Open table in a new tab First, we determined the endogenous protein levels of fibrillin-1, EPCAM, and ATP1B3 expression by Western blotting analysis of HeLa, 293, 293T, MT-4, and THP-1 cells (Fig. 1). Fibrillin-1 and ATP1B3 were detected in HeLa, 293, 293T, MT-4, and THP1 cells. However, EPCAM expression was not observed in HeLa, 293, and THP-1 cells. To address the role of fibrillin-1 and ATP1B3 in HIV-1 replication, expression of each protein was silenced by RNA interference (Fig. 2A). To eliminate any RNAi-mediated off-target effects by siRNAs, we used two or three target-specific siRNAs. HeLa cells (BST-2-positive cells), THP-1 cells (BST-2-positive macrophages), or 293T cells (BST-2-negative cells) were treated with siRNA for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotyped NL4-3 (pseudo-NL4-3), NL4-3ΔVpu (pseudo-NL4-3ΔVpu), or NL4-3, NL4-3ΔVpu, corresponding to 50 ng of p24, for 48 h. Then, the levels of p24 in the supernatants were determined (Fig. 2B). When compared with control siRNA, the depletion of ATP1B3 reduced the levels of p24 in HeLa cells and THP-1 cells, but not in 293T cells, when the cells were infected with pseudo-NL4-3 or NL4-3. Moreover, this effect was also observed in cells infected with pseudo-NL4-3ΔVpu and NL4-3ΔVpu. Additionally, fibrillin-1 silencing in HeLa, 293T, and THP-1 cells led to reductions in p24 production. These results suggest that ATP1B3 plays an important role in HIV-1 replication in a BST-2-dependent manner and that fibrillin-1 supports HIV-1 replication in a BST-2-independent manner. Therefore, we focused on the role of ATP1B3 as a physiological binding partner of BST-2. Furthermore, we confirmed that off-target effects by siRNAs did not interfere with the results, and therefore, subsequent experiments were performed using siATP1B3-1.FIGURE 2.Knockdown of ATP1B3 or fibrillin-1 in HeLa, 293T, or THP-1 cells impairs HIV-1 replication. A, HeLa, 293T or THP-1 cells were treated with 50 nm fibrillin-1 siRNAs (siFibrillin1-1 and siFibrillin1-2), 50 nm ATP1B3 siRNAs (siATP1B3-1, siATP1B3-2, and siATP1B3-3) or 50 nm control siRNA (siControl). At 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. B, HeLa, 293T or THP-1 cells were treated with 50 nm siFibrillin1-1 and siFibrillin1-2, 50 nm siATP1B3-1, siATP1B3-2, and siATP1B3-3, or 50 nm siControl for 24 h. After treatment, cells were infected with pseudo-NL4-3, pseudo-NL4-3ΔVpu or NL4-3, or NL4-3ΔVpu (corresponding to 50 ng of p24) for 48 h, and supernatants were used to determine the p24 levels by the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Lumipulse f, Fujirebio).

To evaluate whether ATP1B3 could bind to BST-2 in human cells, FLAG-BST-2 and HA-ATP1B3 were co-expressed in 293T cells. The cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation, and BST-2 was shown to bind to ATP1B3 (Fig. 3A). ATP1B3 contains a cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–35), a helical domain (residues 36–56), and an extracellular domain (residues 57–279) (31Malik N. Canfield V.A. Beckers M.C. Gros P. Levenson R.

Genome. 1998; 9: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To map the binding site of ATP1B3, we constructed deletion mutants of ATP1B3 (Fig. 3B). Our results demonstrated that BST-2 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with the full-length ATP1B3. Although the C-terminal truncation mutant Δ181–279 seemed to interact as efficiently as the wild type ATP1B3, Δ151–279 showed no detectable interaction with BST-2. To further verify the association between endogenous ATP1B3 and BST-2 in HeLa cells, we examined the intracellular localization of these two proteins using confocal microscopy and confirmed using each siRNA that ATP1B3 and BST-2 were specifically detected (Fig. 3C). Together, these results indicate that BST-2 associates with the extracellular domain of ATP1B3 at the plasma membrane. Next, we examined the effects of ATP1B3 on HIV-1 production in 293 and 293/BST-2 cells, which constitutively express BST-2. The BST-2 levels in 293/BST-2 cells were significantly enhanced by the depletion of ATP1B3 (Fig. 4, compare lane 5 with lane 6 and compare lane 7 with lane 8). Consistent with Fig. 2B, ATP1B3 knockdown in 293 cells did not affect the level of cell-associated Gag and virions. By contrast, the release efficiency of virions was modestly reduced by ATP1B3 knockdown in pseudo-NL4-3-infected 293/BST-2 cells (Fig. 4, compare lane 5 with lane 6). Moreover, this effect was enhanced in pseudo-NL4-3ΔVpu-infected 293/BST-2 cells (Fig. 4, compare lane 7 with lane 8). These results suggest that ATP1B3 suppresses the antiviral effect of BST-2. To further confirm this effect, we performed flow cytometry (Fig. 5A). As expected, the levels of BST-2 were significantly higher in siATP1B3-1-transfected HeLa and 293/BST-2 cells than in siControl-transfected HeLa or 293/BST-2 cells. Notably, the level of BST-2 mRNA in siATP1B3-1-transfected cells was similar to that in siControl-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). To ascertain the stabilization of BST-2 by the depletion of ATP1B3, we performed pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 5C) and found that BST-2 was rapidly degraded in siControl-transfected HeLa or 293/BST-2 cells. In contrast, the depletion of ATP1B3 prevented the degradation of BST-2. These results indicate that ATP1B3 regulates the stability of BST-2. To assess the role of ATP1B3 in the activation of NF-κB by BST-2, we next performed experiments in which HeLa cells were transfected with either control or ATP1B3-specific siRNAs (siATP1B3-1) and then transfected with an NF-κB reporter plasmid along with pcDNA, pNL4-3, or pNL4-3ΔVpu.

In order to assess the influence of type of maize cultivated and associated maize management on dung beetle communities in Atlantic Forest fragments surrounded by conventional and transgenic maize were evaluated 40 Atlantic Forest fragments of different sizes, 20 surrounded by GM maize and 20 surrounded by conventional maize, in February 2013 and 2014 in Southern Brazil. After applying a sampling protocol in each fragment (10 pitfall traps baited with human feces or carrion exposed for 48 h), a total of 3454 individuals from 44 species were captured: 1142 individuals from 38 species in GM maize surrounded fragments, and 2312 from 42 species in conventional maize surrounded fragments. Differences in dung beetle communities were found between GM and conventional maize communities. As expected for fragmented areas, the covariance analysis showed a greater species richness in larger fragments under both conditions; however species richness was greater in fragments surrounded by conventional maize. Dung beetle structure in the forest fragments was explained by environmental variables, fragment area, spatial distance and also type of maize (transgenic or conventional) associated with maize management techniques. In Southern Brazil's scenario, the use of GM maize combined with associated agricultural management may be accelerating the loss of diversity in Atlantic Forest areas, and consequently, important ecosystem services provided by dung beetles may be lost."
https://openalex.org/W2415758501,"Predicting the transmembrane regions is an important aspect of understanding the structures and architecture of different β-barrel membrane proteins. Despite significant efforts, currently available β-transmembrane region predictors are still limited in terms of prediction accuracy, especially in precision. Here, we describe PredβTM, a transmembrane region prediction algorithm for β-barrel proteins. Using amino acid pair frequency information in known β-transmembrane protein sequences, we have trained a support vector machine classifier to predict β-transmembrane segments. Position-specific amino acid preference data is incorporated in the final prediction. The predictor does not incorporate evolutionary profile information explicitly, but is based on sequence patterns generated implicitly by encoding the protein segments using amino acid adjacency matrix. With a benchmark set of 35 β-transmembrane proteins, PredβTM shows a sensitivity and precision of 83.71% and 72.98%, respectively. The segment overlap score is 82.19%. In comparison with other state-of-art methods, PredβTM provides a higher precision and segment overlap without compromising with sensitivity. Further, we applied PredβTM to analyze the β-barrel membrane proteins without defined transmembrane regions and the uncharacterized protein sequences in eight bacterial genomes and predict possible β-transmembrane proteins. PredβTM can be freely accessed on the web at http://transpred.ki.si/."

The most well-known mechanism of pathogenicity for this bacterial pathogen is xylem vessel occlusion, which results from bacterial movement and the formation of biofilms. The molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence caused by biofilm formation are unknown. Here, we provide evidence showing that virulence-associated protein D in X. fastidiosa (Xf-VapD) is a thermostable protein with ribonuclease activity. Moreover, protein expression analyses in two X. fastidiosa strains, including virulent (Xf9a5c) and nonpathogenic (XfJ1a12) strains, showed that Xf-VapD was expressed during all phases of development in both strains and that increased expression was observed in Xf9a5c during biofilm growth.

https://openalex.org/W2274137152,"Herpesviruses are a large order of animal enveloped viruses displaying a virion fusion mechanism of unusual complexity. Their multipartite machinery has a conserved core made of the gH/gL ancillary complexes and the homo-trimeric fusion protein glycoprotein B (gB). Despite its essential role in starting the viral infection, gB interaction with membrane lipids is still poorly understood. Here, evidence is provided demonstrating that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gB depends on the S-palmitoylation of its endodomain for an efficient interaction with cholesterol-rich membrane patches. We found that, unique among herpesviral gB proteins, the HCMV fusion factor has a Cys residue in the C-terminal region that is palmitoylated and mediates methyl-β-cyclodextrin-sensitive self-association of purified gB. A cholesterol-dependent virus-like particle trap assay, based on co-expression of the HIV Gag protein, confirmed that this post-translational modification is functional in the context of cellular membranes. Mutation of the palmitoylated Cys residue to Ala or inhibition of protein palmitoylation decreased HCMV gB export via Gag particles. Moreover, purified gBC777A showed an increased kinetic sensitivity in a cholesterol depletion test, demonstrating that palmitoyl-gB limits outward cholesterol diffusion. Finally, gB palmitoylation was required for full fusogenic activity in human epithelial cells. Altogether, these results uncover the palmitoylation of HCMV gB and its role in gB multimerization and activity. Herpesviruses are a large order of animal enveloped viruses displaying a virion fusion mechanism of unusual complexity. Their multipartite machinery has a conserved core made of the gH/gL ancillary complexes and the homo-trimeric fusion protein glycoprotein B (gB). Despite its essential role in starting the viral infection, gB interaction with membrane lipids is still poorly understood.

https://openalex.org/W2219733031,"In intensive agriculture areas the use of pesticides can alter soil properties and microbial community structure with the risk of reducing soil quality.In this study the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) evolution has been studied in a factorial lab experiment combining five substrates (a soil, two aged composts and their mixtures) treated with a co-application of three pesticides (azoxystrobin, chlorotoluron and epoxiconazole), with two extraction methods, and two incubation times (0 and 58 days). FAMEs extraction followed the microbial identification system (MIDI) and ester-linked method (EL).The pesticides showed high persistence, as revealed by half-life (t1/2) values ranging from 168 to 298 days, which confirms their recalcitrance to degradation. However, t1/2 values were affected by substrate and compost age down to 8 days for chlorotoluron in S and up to 453 days for epoxiconazole in 12M. Fifty-six FAMEs were detected. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the EL method detected a higher number of FAMEs and unique FAMEs than the MIDI one, whereas principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted that the monosaturated 18:1ω9c and cyclopropane 19:0ω10c/19ω6 were the most significant FAMEs grouping by extraction method. The cyclopropyl to monoenoic acids ratio evidenced higher stress conditions when pesticides were applied to compost and compost+soil than solely soil, as well as with final time.Overall, FAMEs profiles showed the importance of the extraction method for both substrate and incubation time, the t1/2 values highlighted the effectiveness of solely soil and the less mature compost in reducing the persistence of pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W2407053123,"A2E and related toxic molecules are part of lipofuscin found in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in eyes affected by Stargardt's disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and other retinal degenerations. A novel therapeutic approach for treating such degenerations involves slowing down the visual cycle, which could reduce the amount of A2E in the RPE. This can be accomplished by inhibiting RPE65, which produces 11-cis-retinol from all-trans-retinyl esters. We recently showed that phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) inhibits RPE65 enzyme activity in RPE cells. In this study we show that like PBN, certain PBN-derivatives (PBNDs) such as 4-F-PBN, 4-CF3-PBN, 3,4-di-F-PBN, and 4-CH3-PBN can inhibit RPE65 and synthesis of 11-cis-retinol in in vitro assays using bovine RPE microsomes. We further demonstrate that systemic (intraperitoneal, IP) administration of these PBNDs protect the rat retina from light damage. Electroretinography (ERG) and histological analysis showed that rats treated with PBNDs retained ~90% of their photoreceptor cells compared to a complete loss of function and 90% loss of photoreceptors in the central retina in rats treated with vehicle/control injections. Topically applied PBN and PBNDs also significantly slowed the rate of the visual cycle in mouse and baboon eyes. One hour dark adaptation resulted in 75-80% recovery of bleachable rhodopsin in control/vehicle treated mice. Eye drops of 5% 4-CH3-PBN were most effective, inhibiting the regeneration of bleachable rhodopsin significantly (60% compared to vehicle control). In addition, a 10% concentration of PBN and 5% concentration of 4-CH3-PBN in baboon eyes inhibited the visual cycle by 60% and by 30%, respectively. We have identified a group of PBN related nitrones that can reach the target tissue (RPE) by systemic and topical application and slow the rate of rhodopsin regeneration and therefore the visual cycle in mouse and baboon eyes. PBNDs can also protect the rat retina from light damage. There is potential in developing these compounds as preventative therapeutics for the treatment of human retinal degenerations in which the accumulation of lipofuscin may be pathogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2203521604,"The bioavailability and fractionation of Cu reflect its deliverability in soil. Little research has investigated Cu supply to crops in soil under long-term rotation and fertilisation on the Loess Plateau. A field experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design to determine the bioavailability and distribution of Cu fractions in a Heilu soil (Calcaric Regosol) after 18 years of rotation and fertilisation. The experiment started in 1984, including five cropping systems (fallow control, alfalfa cropping, maize cropping, winter wheat cropping, and grain-legume rotation of pea/winter wheat/winter wheat + millet) and five fertiliser treatments (unfertilised control, N, P, N + P, and N + P + manure). Soil samples were collected in 2002 for chemical analysis. Available Cu was assessed by diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) extraction, and Cu was fractionated by sequential extraction. Results showed that DTPA-Cu was lower in cropping systems compared with fallow control. Application of fertilisers resulted in no remarkable changes in DTPA-Cu compared with unfertilised control. Correlation and path analyses revealed that soil pH and CaCO3 directly affected Cu bioavailability, whereas available P indirectly affected Cu bioavailability. The concentrations of Cu fractions (carbonate and Fe/Al oxides) in the plough layer were lower in cropping systems, while the values in the plough sole were higher under grain-legume rotation relative to fallow control. Manure with NP fertiliser increased Cu fractions bound to organic matter and minerals in the plough layer, and its effects in the plough sole varied with cropping systems. The direct sources (organic-matter-bound fraction and carbonate-bound fraction) of available Cu contributed much to Cu bioavailability. The mineral-bound fraction of Cu acted as an indicator of Cu supply potential in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2203907362,"Cytoplasmic streaming (CPS) is well known to assist the movement of nutrients, organelles and genetic material by transporting all of the cytoplasmic contents of a cell. CPS is generated by motility organelles that are driven by motor proteins near a membrane surface, where the CPS has been found to have a flat velocity profile in the flow field according to the sliding theory. There is a consistent mixing of contents inside the cell by CPS if the velocity gradient profile is flattened, which is not assisted by advection diffusion but is only supported by Brownian diffusion. Although the precise flow structure of the cytoplasm has an important role for cellular metabolism, the hydrodynamic mechanism of its convection has not been clarified. We conducted an experiment to visualise the flow of cytoplasm in Nitella cells by injecting tracer fluorescent nanoparticles and using a flow visualisation system in order to understand how the flow profile affects their metabolic system. We determined that the velocity field in the cytosol has an obvious velocity gradient, not a flattened gradient, which suggests that the gradient assists cytosolic mixing by Taylor–Aris dispersion more than by Brownian diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2207930995,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest tumor in human. About 70% sporadic BCCs bear somatic mutations in the PATCHED1 tumor suppressor gene which encodes the receptor for the Sonic Hedgehog morphogen (SHH). PATCHED1 germinal mutations are associated with the dominant Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), a major hallmark of which is a high susceptibility to BCCs. Although the vast majority of sporadic BCCs arises exclusively in sun exposed skin areas, 40 to 50% BCCs from NBCCS patients develop in non photo-exposed skin. Since overwhelming evidences indicate that microenvironment may both be modified by- and influence the- epithelial tumor, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could contribute to BCCs in NBCCS patients, notably those developing in non photo-exposed skin areas. The functional impact of NBCCS fibroblasts was then assessed in organotypic skin cultures with control keratinocytes. Onset of epidermal differentiation was delayed in the presence of primary NBCCS fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, keratinocyte proliferation was severely reduced and showed high levels of nuclear P53 in both organotypic skin cultures and in fibroblast-led conditioning experiments. However, in spite of increased levels of senescence associated β-galactosidase activity in keratinocytes cultured in the presence of medium conditioned by NBCCS fibroblasts, we failed to observe activation of P16 and P21 and then of bona fide features of senescence. Constitutive extinction of P53 in WT keratinocytes resulted in an invasive phenotype in the presence of NBCCS fibroblasts. Finally, we found that expression of SHH was limited to fibroblasts but was dependent on the presence of keratinocytes. Inhibition of SHH binding resulted in improved epidermal morphogenesis. Altogether, these data suggest that the repertoire of diffusible factors (including SHH) expressed by primary NBCCS fibroblasts generate a stress affecting keratinocytes behavior and epidermal homeostasis. Our findings suggest that defects in dermo/epidermal interactions could contribute to BCC susceptibility in NBCCS patients."

Seroprevalence of maternal antibodies to CMV due to CMV exposure prior to pregnancy is currently the most important protective factor against congenital CMV disease. The aim of this study was to identify potential predictors, and to develop and evaluate a risk-predicting model for the maternal CMV serostatus in early pregnancy.Maternal and paternal background information, as well as maternal CMV serostatus in early pregnancy from 882 pregnant women were analyzed. Women were divided into two groups based on their CMV serostatus, and were compared using univariate analysis. To predict serostatus based on epidemiological baseline characteristics, a multiple logistic regression model was calculated using stepwise model selection. Sensitivity and specificity were analyzed using ROC curves. A nomogram based on the model was developed.646 women were CMV seropositive (73.2%), and 236 were seronegative (26.8%). The groups differed significantly with respect to maternal age (p = 0.006), gravidity (p<0.001), parity (p<0.001), use of assisted reproduction techniques (p = 0.018), maternal and paternal migration background (p<0.001), and maternal and paternal education level (p<0.001). ROC evaluation of the selected prediction model revealed an area under the curve of 0.83 (95%CI: 0.8-0.86), yielding sensitivity and specificity values of 0.69 and 0.86, respectively.We identified predictors of maternal CMV serostatus in early pregnancy and developed a risk-predicting model based on baseline epidemiological characteristics. Our findings provide easy accessible information that can influence the counseling of pregnant woman in terms of their CMV-associated risk."

FXS is caused by expansion of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats present in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The aim of this study was to screen children attending special education institutions in Sri Lanka to estimate the prevalence of CGG repeat expansions. The study population comprised a representative national sample of 850 children (540 males, 310 females) with 5 to 18 years of age from moderate to severe mental retardation of wide ranging aetiology. Screening for CGG repeat expansion was carried out on DNA extracted from buccal cells using 3' direct triplet primed PCR followed by melting curve analysis. To identify the expanded status of screened positive samples, capillary electrophoresis, methylation specific PCR and Southern hybridization were carried out using venous blood samples. Prevalence of CGG repeat expansions was 2.2%. Further classification of the positive samples into FXS full mutation, pre-mutation and grey zone gave prevalence of 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.1% respectively. All positive cases were male. No females with FXS were detected in our study may have been due to the small sample size."

Although it is recognized that the expression levels of mouse INSC govern the balance between symmetric and asymmetric stem cell division, regulation of mouse Insc gene expression remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that mouse Insc expression transiently increases at an early stage of differentiation, when mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells differentiate into bipotent mesendoderm capable of producing both endoderm and mesoderm in defined culture conditions. We identified the minimum transcriptional regulatory element (354 bases) that drives mouse Insc transcription in mES cells within a region >5 kb upstream of the mouse Insc transcription start site. We found that the transcription factor reticuloendotheliosis oncogene (c-Rel) bound to the minimum element and promoted mouse Insc expression in mES cells. In addition, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either mouse INSC or c-Rel protein decreased mesodermal cell populations without affecting differentiation into the mesendoderm or endoderm. Furthermore, overexpression of mouse INSC rescued the mesoderm-reduced phenotype induced by knockdown of c-Rel. We propose that regulation of mouse Insc expression by c-Rel modulates cell fate decisions during mES cell differentiation.

Here, we demonstrate that expression of mouse INSC transiently increases during mouse ES (mES) cell differentiation into bipotent mesendoderm cells capable of giving rise to both endoderm and mesoderm lineages in defined culture conditions (36Tada S.

In this system, we identified DNA regulatory elements involved in mouse Insc gene expression, which are located more than 5 kb upstream of the mouse Insc transcription start site (TSS). We specified the minimum transcription-promoting sequences and identified c-Rel as a key transcription factor that drives mouse Insc expression in mES cells. Knockdown of mouse INSC or c-Rel protein leads to a decrease in the proportion of mesoderm cells without alterations in mesendoderm and endoderm cells, indicating a requirement for mouse INSC in the mesoderm cell fate decision. Our results provide further supporting evidence for how c-Rel regulates mesoderm differentiation by promoting mouse Insc expression. This study demonstrates for the first time that the c-Rel/mouse INSC axis regulates mesoderm cell fate decision during mES cell differentiation. embryonic stem mouse ES vascular endothelial growth factor receptor transcription start site quantitative PCR transgenic.

Accordingly, we cultured ES cells harboring a Gsc-gfp transgene (Gscgfp/+ ES cells) to monitor mesendoderm differentiation on collagen IV-coated dishes in SF-O3 serum-free medium containing 10 ng/ml activin A. Consistent with previous studies, after 4 days of differentiation, about 50% of the ES cells became positive for Gsc-GFP (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, they expressed either vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), a mesoderm marker (39Kataoka H. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Tsuchida K. Kodama H. Kunisada T. Risau W. Kita T.

https://openalex.org/W2257885036,"Dual TCRα-expressing T cells outnumber dual TCRβ-expressing cells by ~10:1. As a result, efforts to understand how dual TCR T cells impact immunity have focused on dual TCRα expression; dual TCRβ expression remains understudied. We recently demonstrated, however, that dual TCRβ expression accelerated disease in a TCR transgenic model of autoimmune arthritis through enhanced positive selection efficiency, indicating that dual TCRβ expression, though rare, can impact thymic selection. Here we generated mice hemizygous for TCRα, TCRβ, or both on the C57BL/6 background to investigate the impact bi-allelic TCR chain recombination has on T cell development, repertoire diversity, and autoimmunity. Lack of bi-allelic TCRα or TCRβ recombination reduced αβ thymocyte development efficiency, and the absence of bi-allelic TCRβ recombination promoted γδ T cell development. However, we observed no differences in the numbers of naïve and expanded antigen-specific T cells between TCRα+/-β+/- and wildtype mice, and TCR repertoire analysis revealed only subtle differences in Vβ gene usage. Finally, the absence of dual TCR T cells did not impact induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis pathogenesis. Thus, despite more stringent allelic exclusion of TCRβ relative to TCRα, bi-allelic TCRβ expression can measurably impact thymocyte development and is necessary for maintaining normal αβ/γδ T cell proportions."
https://openalex.org/W2199755366,"The number of pacemaker and ICD implantations has increased substantially in the recent years. Therefore, complications are also observed in a greater number. In many cases, transvenous extraction of the previously implanted device (pacemaker or ICD) is the only solution. One may find in the literature information about the efficacy and safety of that procedure, but data concerning the results of long-term follow up are still limited.The aim of the study was to assess the one-year mortality in the cohort of patients undergoing transvenous lead extraction procedures in our centre.Records of the patients undergoing transvenous lead removal in the Department of Cardiology and Electrotherapy of the Medical University of Gdańsk were analyzed. We collected detailed information about 192 patients that had undergone the procedure from January 2003 until June 2012. Data were collected from medical and surgical records. We analyzed concomitant diseases, indications, and possible complications. Long-term follow-up data were gathered in the follow-up ambulatory records and over-the-phone interviews with patients or families. In several cases, we consulted the database of the Polish National Health Fund.During the early post-operative period 5 patients died, although none of those deaths was associated with the procedure itself. No other major complications were observed. During one-year follow-up other 5 patients died, which gave the overall one-year survival rate of 92.7%. Heart failure, renal failure and an infective indication showed significant association with increased mortality.Results of transvenous lead extraction, a relatively safe procedure, should be assessed over time extending beyond the sole perioperative period. Some complications may be delayed in their nature, and may be observed only during the long-term follow up."
