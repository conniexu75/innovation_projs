https://openalex.org/W2809092342,"Macromolecular crowding has a profound impact on reaction rates and the physical properties of the cell interior, but the mechanisms that regulate crowding are poorly understood. We developed genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein that self-assemble into bright, stable particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can modulate the effective diffusion coefficient of particles ≥20 nm in diameter more than 2-fold by tuning ribosome concentration, without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules ≤5 nm. This change in ribosome concentration affected phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results establish a role for mTORC1 in controlling both the mesoscale biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and biomolecular condensation."

Adult livers can regenerate in response to parenchymal insults, and multiple cellular sources have been reported to contribute to this response. In this study, we modeled human chronic liver injuries, in which such responses are blunted, without genetic manipulations, and assessed potential contributions of non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) to hepatocyte regeneration. We show that NPC-derived hepatocytes replenish a large fraction of the liver parenchyma following severe injuries induced by long-term thioacetamide (TAA) or 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) treatment. Through lineage tracing of biliary epithelial cells (BECs), we show that BECs are a source of new hepatocytes and gain an Hnf4α+CK19+ bi-phenotypic state in periportal regions and fibrotic septa. Bi-phenotypic cells were also detected in cirrhotic human livers. Together, these data provide further support for hepatocyte regeneration from BECs without genetic interventions and show their cellular plasticity during severe liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2809667147,"Chemical reprogramming provides a powerful platform for exploring the molecular dynamics that lead to pluripotency. Although previous studies have uncovered an intermediate extraembryonic endoderm (XEN)-like state during this process, the molecular underpinnings of pluripotency acquisition remain largely undefined. Here, we profile 36,199 single-cell transcriptomes at multiple time points throughout a highly efficient chemical reprogramming system using RNA-sequencing and reconstruct their progression trajectories. Through identifying sequential molecular events, we reveal that the dynamic early embryonic-like programs are key aspects of successful reprogramming from XEN-like state to pluripotency, including the concomitant transcriptomic signatures of two-cell (2C) embryonic-like and early pluripotency programs and the epigenetic signature of notable genome-wide DNA demethylation. Moreover, via enhancing the 2C-like program by fine-tuning chemical treatment, the reprogramming process is remarkably accelerated. Collectively, our findings offer a high-resolution dissection of cell fate dynamics during chemical reprogramming and shed light on mechanistic insights into the nature of induced pluripotency."

Unfortunately, expert judgement is often derived by informal and largely untested protocols, despite evidence that the quality of judgements can be improved with structured approaches. We attribute the lack of uptake of structured protocols to the dearth of illustrative examples that demonstrate how they can be applied within pressing time and resource constraints, while also improving judgements.In this paper, we demonstrate how the IDEA protocol for structured expert elicitation may be deployed to overcome operational challenges while improving the quality of judgements. The protocol was applied to the estimation of 14 future abiotic and biotic events on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Seventy-six participants with varying levels of expertise related to the Great Barrier Reef were recruited and allocated randomly to eight groups. Each participant provided their judgements using the four-step question format of the IDEA protocol ('Investigate', 'Discuss', 'Estimate', 'Aggregate') through remote elicitation. When the events were realised, the participant judgements were scored in terms of accuracy, calibration and informativeness.The results demonstrate that the IDEA protocol provides a practical, cost-effective, and repeatable approach to the elicitation of quantitative estimates and uncertainty via remote elicitation. We emphasise that i) the aggregation of diverse individual judgements into pooled group judgments almost always outperformed individuals, and ii) use of a modified Delphi approach helped to remove linguistic ambiguity, and further improved individual and group judgements. Importantly, the protocol encourages review, critical appraisal and replication, each of which is required if judgements are to be used in place of data in a scientific context. The results add to the growing body of literature that demonstrates the merit of using structured elicitation protocols. We urge decision-makers and analysts to use insights and examples to improve the evidence base of expert judgement in natural resource management."
https://openalex.org/W2809393611,"Dysbiosis in the gut microbiome has been implicated in several diseases including auto-immune diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancers and mental disorders. Keratitis is an inflammatory disease of the eye significantly contributing to corneal blindness in the developing world. It would be worthwhile to investigate the possibility of dysbiosis in the gut microbiome being associated with Keratitis. Here, we have analyzed fungal and bacterial populations in stool samples through high-throughput sequencing of the ITS2 region for fungi and V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene for bacteria in healthy controls (HC, n = 31) and patients with fungal keratitis (FK, n = 32). Candida albicans (2 OTUs), Aspergillus (1 OTU) and 3 other denovo-OTUs were enriched in FK samples and an unclassified denovo-OTU was enriched in HC samples. However, the overall abundances of these 'discriminatory' OTUs were very low (< 0.001%) and not indicative of significant dysbiosis in the fungal community inhabiting the gut of FK patients. In contrast, the gut bacterial richness and diversity in FK patients was significantly decreased when compared to HC. 52 OTUs were significantly enriched in HC samples whereas only 5 OTUs in FK. The OTUs prominently enriched in HC were identified as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lachnospira, Mitsuokella multacida, Bacteroides plebeius, Megasphaera and Lachnospiraceae. In FK samples, 5 OTUs affiliated to Bacteroides fragilis, Dorea, Treponema, Fusobacteriaceae, and Acidimicrobiales were significantly higher in abundance. The functional implications are that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an anti-inflammatory bacterium and Megasphaera, Mitsuokella multacida and Lachnospira are butyrate producers, which were enriched in HC patients, whereas Treponema and Bacteroides fragilis, which are pathogenic were abundant in FK patients, playing a potential pro-inflammatory role. Heatmap, PCoA plots and functional profiles further confirm the distinct patterns of gut bacterial composition in FK and HC samples. Our study demonstrates dysbiosis in the gut bacterial microbiomes of FK patients compared to HC. Further, based on inferred functions, it appears that dysbiosis in the gut of FK subjects is strongly associated with the disease phenotype with decrease in abundance of beneficial bacteria and increase in abundance of pro-inflammatory and pathogenic bacteria."

These results suggest that immunomimetic designer cells could offer a therapeutic approach for early detection, prevention, and cure of pathogenic infections in the post-antibiotic era. Infectious disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, claiming about 15 million lives each year (Fauci and Morens, 2012Fauci A.S. Morens D.M. The perpetual challenge of infectious diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most frequent pathogens, accounting for 11.6 million outpatient and emergency room visits and nearly 500,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States alone (Klein et al., 2007Klein E. Smith D.L. Laxminarayan R. Hospitalizations and deaths caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, United States, 1999-2005.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2007; 13: 1840-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, McCaig et al., 2006McCaig L.F. McDonald L.C. Mandal S. Jernigan D.B. Staphylococcus aureus-associated skin and soft tissue infections in ambulatory care.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2006; 12: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This organism causes a variety of human diseases, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening infections, such as bacteremia, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, meningitis, and sepsis (Tong et al., 2015Tong S.Y. Davis J.S. Eichenberger E. Holland T.L. Fowler Jr., V.G. Staphylococcus aureus infections: epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 28: 603-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). The high morbidity associated with S. aureus has further increased with the rising prevalence of strains that exhibit broad antibiotic resistance, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Dantes et al., 2013Dantes R. Mu Y. Belflower R. Aragon D. Dumyati G. Harrison L.H. Lessa F.C. Lynfield R. Nadle J. Petit S. et al.Emerging Infections Program–Active Bacterial Core Surveillance MRSA Surveillance InvestigatorsNational burden of invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, United States, 2011.JAMA Intern. Med. 2013; 173: 1970-1978PubMed Google Scholar), which causes more deaths annually (∼19,000) than any other single infectious agent in the United States; indeed, the number of deaths caused by MRSA exceeds that associated with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and influenza combined (Boucher and Corey, 2008Boucher H.W. Corey G.R. Epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2008; 46: S344-S349Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). As these staphylococcal strains are highly virulent and are increasingly becoming resistant to every clinically available antibiotic (Stryjewski and Corey, 2014Stryjewski M.E. Corey G.R. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: an evolving pathogen.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2014; 58: S10-S19Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), alternative therapies are urgently needed. One particularly important unmet medical need for anti-S. aureus therapies is to treat implant-associated infections (IAIs) (Darouiche, 2004Darouiche R.O. Treatment of infections associated with surgical implants.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1422-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). IAIs account for half of the 2 million cases of nosocomial infections that occur each year in the United States (Darouiche, 2004Darouiche R.O. Treatment of infections associated with surgical implants.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1422-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) and are one of the most feared and difficult-to-treat medical complications, causing high morbidity and mortality, and leading to substantial healthcare costs (Kapadia et al., 2016Kapadia B.H. Berg R.A. Daley J.A. Fritz J. Bhave A. Mont M.A. Periprosthetic joint infection.Lancet. 2016; 387: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). S. aureus is the leading cause of IAI and is particularly adept at infecting foreign bodies within the human host (Del Pozo and Patel, 2009Del Pozo J.L. Patel R. Clinical practice. Infection associated with prosthetic joints.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This organism is able to persist on implant surfaces, forming biofilms, which are sessile communities of microcolonies encased in an extracellular matrix that adheres to biomedical implants (Bjarnsholt et al., 2013Bjarnsholt T. Alhede M. Alhede M. Eickhardt-Sørensen S.R. Moser C. Kühl M. Jensen P.O. Høiby N. The in vivo biofilm.Trends Microbiol. 2013; 21: 466-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat due to the presence of biomaterials that can reduce the inoculum of S. aureus required to establish an infection by a factor of more than 100,000 (Puhto et al., 2014Puhto A.P. Puhto T.M. Niinimäki T.T. Leppilahti J.I. Syrjälä H.P. Two-stage revision for prosthetic joint infection: outcome and role of reimplantation microbiology in 107 cases.J. Arthroplasty. 2014; 29: 1101-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and it is estimated that sessile bacteria in biofilms are over 1,000-fold less sensitive to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts (Sutherland, 2001Sutherland I.W. The biofilm matrix--an immobilized but dynamic microbial environment.Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Therefore, most implants that are infected by S. aureus have to be surgically removed to achieve a definite cure, leading to a poor patient outcome and considerable economic burden (Darouiche, 2004Darouiche R.O. Treatment of infections associated with surgical implants.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1422-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Human innate immune response is the first line of defense against infectious microbes (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8719) Google Scholar). Early recognition of S. aureus is initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on epithelial cells and innate phagocytic cells (Fournier and Philpott, 2005Fournier B. Philpott D.J. Recognition of Staphylococcus aureus by the innate immune system.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has emerged as the most important of these PRRs in detecting extracellular S. aureus (Fournier and Philpott, 2005Fournier B. Philpott D.J. Recognition of Staphylococcus aureus by the innate immune system.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan embedded in the staphylococcal cell envelope by forming heterodimers with TLR1 (Jin et al., 2007Jin M.S. Kim S.E. Heo J.Y. Lee M.E. Kim H.M. Paik S.G. Lee H. Lee J.O. Crystal structure of the TLR1-TLR2 heterodimer induced by binding of a tri-acylated lipopeptide.Cell. 2007; 130: 1071-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) or TLR6 (Kang et al., 2009Kang J.Y. Nan X. Jin M.S. Youn S.J. Ryu Y.H. Mah S. Han S.H. Lee H. Paik S.G. Lee J.O. Recognition of lipopeptide patterns by Toll-like receptor 2-Toll-like receptor 6 heterodimer.Immunity. 2009; 31: 873-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and the pathogen recognition is facilitated by a CD14 co-receptor (Nilsen et al., 2008Nilsen N.J. Deininger S. Nonstad U. Skjeldal F. Husebye H. Rodionov D. von Aulock S. Hartung T. Lien E. Bakke O. Espevik T. Cellular trafficking of lipoteichoic acid and Toll-like receptor 2 in relation to signaling: role of CD14 and CD36.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, TLR2 and TLR1 or TLR6 initiate downstream signaling events that lead to the translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit phagocytes to the site of infection for the disposal of pathogens (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8719) Google Scholar)). However, S. aureus is a well-adapted pathogen that has evolved many mechanisms for thwarting the human immune response, ranging from blocking neutrophil chemotaxis, lysing leukocytes, and avoiding phagocytosis to resisting phagocytic killing and surviving within host cells (Foster et al., 2014Foster T.J. Geoghegan J.A. Ganesh V.K. Höök M. Adhesion, invasion and evasion: the many functions of the surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). In this study, instead of using the detect-deflect-destroy policy employed by the innate immunity, we apply a direct sense-and-destroy strategy based on engineering of a synthetic genetic circuit that expresses lysostaphin under the regulation of human TLR2, TLR1, TLR6, and CD14. Lysostaphin is a bacteriocin that kills most known staphylococcal species (von Eiff et al., 2003von Eiff C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Becker K. Peters G. In vitro activity of recombinant lysostaphin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates from anterior nares and blood.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3613-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is an endopeptidase that enzymatically cleaves the specific cross-linking polyglycine bridges in the cell walls of staphylococci (Schindler and Schuhardt, 1964Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Lysostaphin: A new bacteriolytic agent for the Staphylococcus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1964; 51: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The bactericidal efficacy of lysostaphin was reported to be higher than those of human native antimicrobials and broad-spectrum antibiotics, including penicillin (Schaffner et al., 1967Schaffner W. Melly M.A. Koenig M.G. Lysostaphin: an enzymatic approach to staphylococcal disease. II. In vivo studies.Yale J. Biol. Med. 1967; 39: 230-244PubMed Google Scholar), oxacillin (Kiri et al., 2002Kiri N. Archer G. Climo M.W. Combinations of lysostaphin with beta-lactams are synergistic against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and vancomycin (Placencia et al., 2009Placencia F.X. Kong L. Weisman L.E. Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in neonatal mice: lysostaphin versus vancomycin.Pediatr. Res. 2009; 65: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is also effective against biofilms (Kokai-Kun et al., 2009Kokai-Kun J.F. Chanturiya T. Mond J.J.

Here, we show that this synthetic gene network can be implemented into a variety of rodent and human cells, providing an autonomous, self-regulated staphylococcal sensing-and-eliminating function. We also show that in a foreign-body infection mouse model, for which therapeutic options are extremely limited, this closed-loop synthetic gene network operating inside microencapsulated designer-cell implants could effectively protect mice from biofilm-forming MRSA infection and cure acute MRSA infection. Infectious Microbial Sensing Gene Network (Infectsen) consists of a synthetic bacteria-responsive signaling cascade in which the constitutive co-expression of human TLR2 (hTLR2; pYL30, PhCMV-hTLR2-pA), human TLR1 (hTLR1; pYL126, PhCMV-hTLR1-pA), human TLR6 (hTLR6; pYL125, PhCMV-hTLR6-pA), and human CD14 (hCD14; pYL25, PhCMV-hCD14-pA) senses extracellular cell-wall components of gram-positive bacteria and triggers a MYD88-dependent signaling pathway that results in activation and translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB into the nucleus (Akira and Takeda, 2004Akira S. Takeda K. Toll-like receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar). By connecting the signaling activation of hTLR2, hTLR1, hTLR6, and hCD14 to a carefully tuned chimeric promoter (PAP-1 × 5-NF-κB × 5-IFNβmin) containing AP-1 and NF-κB response elements, the presence of extracellular microbial components could be directly linked to the expression of a specific target gene (Figure 1A). Since human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) cells already express hTLR1 and hTLR6 endogenously (Godefroy et al., 2014Godefroy E. Gallois A. Idoyaga J. Merad M. Tung N. Monu N. Saenger Y. Fu Y. Ravindran R. Pulendran B. et al.Activation of toll-like receptor-2 by endogenous matrix metalloproteinase-2 modulates dendritic-cell-mediated inflammatory responses.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1856-1870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we characterized the microbial sensor device in HEK293 cells without ectopic expression of hTLR1 and hTLR6. To optimize the gene network, we first screened for synthetic NF-κB-responsive promoters with different NF-κB-binding sites and minimal promoters (Figure S1A). We then validated the signaling activation through AP-1 by incorporating AP-1 binding elements (Figure S1B). Subsequently, to obtain the best overall transgene induction, we compared a series of promoters containing different combinations of AP-1/NF-κB-binding sequences upstream of several minimal promoter variants (Figure S1C). We also showed that system activation is greatly influenced by the expression strength of hTLR2 driven by different constitutive promoters (Figure S1D). In summary, the combinatorial assembly of 5 repeats of AP-1 and NF-κB followed by an IFNB minimal promoter (pYL3, PAP-1 × 5-NF-κB × 5-IFNβmin-SEAP-pA) yielded the greatest signal transduction in response to stimulation of pYL30 (PhCMV-hTLR2-pA), endogenous hTLR1 and 6, and pYL25 (PhCMV-hCD14-pA) (Infectsen) (Figure S1).Figure S1Optimization of Bacteria-Regulated Transgene Expression with Different Promoter Configurations, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Selection of NF-κB binding sites and minimal promoters.

(D) Screening for constitutive promoters driving hTLR2 expression. pYL25/pYL3-transgenic HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding hTLR2 expression unit driven by different promoters (pYL30, PhCMV-hTLR2-pA; pYL37, Pmin-hTLR2-pA; pYL38, PSV40-hTLR2-pA). Cell were induced with 5 μg/mL PGN and assayed for SEAP activity after 24 hr. Fold induction of SEAP expression levels is shown above each figure bar. All data are means ± SD (n = 3). The versatility of the optimized gene circuit was assessed by co-transfection of pYL30, pYL126, pYL125, pYL25 and pYL3 into a set of mammalian and human cell lines. Consistent secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) induction by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) indicated that the system was functional in all tested cell lines, including stem-cell-derived hMSC-hTERT, suggesting broad applicability of this gene control device (Figure 1B). Different expression profiles among cell lines may be due to differences in the transfection efficiency, availability of receptor and adaptor proteins, cellular composition of downstream signaling effectors and regulators, and protein expression and secretion capacities. Considering the basal expression level, maximum expression level and induction fold, we selected HEK293 for further characterization (Figure 1B). Infectsen cells were highly sensitive to either cell-wall components of S. aureus: LTA, PGN (Figure 1C), or heat-killed whole S. aureus (HK_SA) (Figure 1D). The transcriptional activation of SEAP expression was regulated dose dependently and initiated at 103 cells/mL of HK_SA (Figure 1D). A lower inoculum of 102 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL of live S. aureus was already sufficient to activate gene expression (Figure 1E), owing to the replication of bacteria in the cell culture medium. All transcriptional activations, however, were greatly diminished without hTLR2 expression (Figures 1C–1E), indicating that the system is hTLR2-dependent. Furthermore, the metabolism or viability of the cells as scored by constitutive SEAP expression (pSEAP2-control, PSV40-SEAP-pA) was not impacted over the entire concentration range of bacterial components or whole bacteria examined (Figures 1C and 1D). Characterization of the gene expression kinetics of Infectsen cells, cultivated for extended periods of time in medium containing specific concentrations of staphylococcal cell-wall components (LTA, PGN) or whole bacteria (HK_SA), revealed consistently low leakiness and a robust, dose-dependent induction of SEAP over 3 days (Figures 2A–2C), indicating a direct correlation between transgene expression and the microbial concentration and duration of infection. In-depth real-time monitoring of the Staphylococcus-responsive production of intracellular fluorescent reporter gene turboGFP further confirmed the high sensitivity to different concentrations of heat-killed, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (HK_MRSA) and rapid transgene switching of Infectsen (Figure 2D). Importantly, the switching time of the system is strongly dependent on the bacterial dosage; the higher the inoculum, the faster the transgene is switched on (Figure 2E). Furthermore, when Infectsen was exposed to HK_MRSA at varying doses for different pulse durations, high bacteria levels rapidly activated transgene expression, whereas lower levels required a longer induction pulse period to reach significant SEAP production (Figure 2F). Finally, gene expression could be switched on and off in response to the presence or absence of heat-killed S. aureus (Figure 2G). To obtain staphylococcal killing effects, we replaced SEAP with lysostaphin as a therapeutic output under the control of human TLR2, TLR1, TLR6, and CD14 (Infectpro). Functional expression of Lysostaphin in eukaryotic cells was achieved by introducing two base-pair substitutions converting Asn125 and Asn232 to glutamine residues from the mature lysostaphin sequence (Kerr et al., 2001Kerr D.E. Plaut K. Bramley A.J. Williamson C.M. Lax A.J. Moore K. Wells K.D. Wall R.J. Lysostaphin expression in mammary glands confers protection against staphylococcal infection in transgenic mice.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since signal peptide influences protein production in mammalian cells (Knappskog et al., 2007Knappskog S. Ravneberg H. Gjerdrum C. Trösse C. Stern B. Pryme I.F. The level of synthesis and secretion of Gaussia princeps luciferase in transfected CHO cells is heavily dependent on the choice of signal peptide.J. Biotechnol. 2007; 128: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we screened six signal peptides of different origin and selected that derived from Gaussia luciferase in a humanized form for maximal lysostaphin production (Figure S2A). The enzymatic activity of HEK293-expressed lysostaphin was determined by bactericidal plate assay (Figure S2B) and levels of lysostaphin expression were quantified in cell culture supernatant, showing dose-dependent responsiveness upon HK_SA induction (Figure S2C). Further modifications of the therapeutic output can be achieved by fusing the human immunoglobulin G (IgG)-derived Fc (fragment crystallizable) region to the C terminus of lysostaphin to increase its serum half-life (Czajkowsky et al., 2012Czajkowsky D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2809625933,"Cortical deep projection neurons (DPNs) are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Although recent findings emphasize post-mitotic programs in projection neuron fate selection, the establishment of primate DPN identity during layer formation is not well understood. The subplate lies underneath the developing cortex and is a post-mitotic compartment that is transiently and disproportionately enlarged in primates in the second trimester. The evolutionary significance of subplate expansion, the molecular identity of its neurons, and its contribution to primate corticogenesis remain open questions. By modeling subplate formation with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we show that all classes of cortical DPNs can be specified from subplate neurons (SPNs). Post-mitotic WNT signaling regulates DPN class selection, and DPNs in the caudal fetal cortex appear to exclusively derive from SPNs. Our findings indicate that SPNs have evolved in primates as an important source of DPNs that contribute to cortical lamination prior to their known role in circuit formation."
https://openalex.org/W2809229227,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool for pre-surgical evaluation of eloquent cortex. Classic task-based paradigms require patient participation and individual imaging sequence acquisitions for each functional domain that is being assessed. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), however, enables functional localization without patient participation and can evaluate numerous functional domains with a single imaging session. To date, post-processing of this resting state data has been resource intensive, which limits its widespread application for routine clinical use. Through a novel automated algorithm and advanced imaging IT structure, we report the clinical application and the large-scale integration of rs-fMRI into routine neurosurgical practice. One hundred and ninety one consecutive patients underwent a 3T rs-fMRI, 83 of whom also underwent both motor and language task-based fMRI. Data were processed using a novel, automated, multi-layer perceptron algorithm and integrated into stereotactic navigation using a streamlined IT imaging pipeline. One hundred eighty-five studies were performed for intracranial neoplasm, 14 for refractory epilepsy and 33 for vascular malformations or other neurological disorders. Failure rate of rs-fMRI of 13% was significantly better than that for task-based fMRI (38.5%,) (p <0.001). In conclusion, at Washington University in St. Louis, rs-fMRI has become an integral part of standard imaging for neurosurgical planning. Resting state fMRI can be used in all patients, and due to its lower failure rate than task-based fMRI, it is useful for patients who are unable to cooperate with task-based studies."
https://openalex.org/W2809478295,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of cystic fibrosis and antibiotic therapy on intestinal microbiota composition and intestinal inflammation in children and adolescents. A cross-sectional controlled study was conducted with 36 children and adolescents: 19 in the cystic fibrosis group (CFG) and 17 in the control group (CG) matched for age and sex. The CFG was subdivided based on the use of antibiotic therapy (CFAB group) and non-use of antibiotic therapy (CFnAB group). The following data were evaluated: colonization, antibiotic therapy, mutation, breastfeeding, use of infant formula, type of delivery, introduction of solid foods, body mass index, fecal calprotectin and intestinal microbiota composition (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Intestinal inflammation evaluated by fecal calprotectin was significantly higher in the CFG (median: 40.80 µg/g, IQR: 19.80-87.10, p = 0.040) and CFAB group (median: 62.95 µg/g, IQR: 21.80-136.62, p = 0.045) compared to the CG (median: 20.15 µg/g, IQR: 16.20-31.00), and the Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the CFG compared to the CG, whereas the bacteria Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased in the CFG (p < 0.05). The main differences were found between the CG and CFAB group for Eubacterium rectale (p = 0.006), Bifidobacterium (p = 0.017), Escherichia coli (p = 0.030), Firmicutes (p = 0.002), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.001) and Clostridium difficile (p = 0.006). The results of this study confirm intestinal inflammation in patients with CF, which may be related to changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2809459002,"The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene is the main mitochondrial molecular marker playing a pivotal role in phylogenetic research and is a crucial barcode sequence. Folmer's ""universal"" primers designed to amplify this gene in metazoan invertebrates allowed quick and easy barcode and phylogenetic analysis. On the other hand, the increase in the number of studies on barcoding leads to more frequent publishing of incorrect sequences, due to amplification of non-target taxa, and insufficient analysis of the obtained sequences. Consequently, some sequences deposited in genetic databases are incorrectly described as obtained from invertebrates, while being in fact bacterial sequences. In our study, in which we used Folmer's primers to amplify COI sequences of the crustacean fairy shrimp Branchipus schaefferi (Fischer 1834), we also obtained COI sequences of microbial contaminants from Aeromonas sp. However, when we searched the GenBank database for sequences closely matching these contaminations we found entries described as representatives of Gastrotricha and Mollusca. When these entries were compared with other sequences bearing the same names in the database, the genetic distance between the incorrect and correct sequences amplified from the same species was c.a. 65%. Although the responsibility for the correct molecular identification of species rests on researchers, the errors found in already published sequences data have not been re-evaluated so far. On the basis of the standard sampling technique we have estimated with 95% probability that the chances of finding incorrectly described metazoan sequences in the GenBank depend on the systematic group, and variety from less than 1% (Mollusca and Arthropoda) up to 6.9% (Gastrotricha). Consequently, the increasing popularity of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding analysis may lead to overestimation of species diversity. Finally, the study also discusses the sources of the problems with amplification of non-target sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2809522217,"Objectives Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in men and the ninth most common cancer in women, and the WHO expects that there will be 1,341,344 cases in 2034 worldwide. Liver cancer also has the second-highest cancer death rate, accounting for 7% of all cancers. The study is going to explore the relationship between time interval from diagnosis to treatment and survival status of early-stage liver cancer patients. Materials and methods This is a retrospective cohort study using the national database from Taiwan. The datasets include the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database (TCR), the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), and the National Registry of Deaths. The target population for the study was patients newly diagnosed with stage I and stage II liver cancer between the years 2004 and 2010. Total of 26,038 cases were included in the study. Except descriptive analysis, the relationship between patient characteristics and the time interval from diagnosis to treatment was examined by chi-square tests. In addition, modified Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the hazard ratio of patient death with various treatment delay durations. Results There were 20,430 patients (78.46%) who received treatment less than 30 days after diagnosis, while 2,674 patients (10.27%) received treatment between 31 and 60 days after diagnosis, and 2,068 patients (7.94%) received treatment between 61 and 180 days after diagnosis, and 866 patients (3.33%) who received treatment 181 days after diagnosis. Those treated more than 181 days and 61–180 days after diagnosis had a 1.68-fold increased risk of death (95% confidence interval: 1.50–1.88) and a 1.39-fold increased risk of death (95% confidence interval: 1.31–1.17), respectively. Being male, being elderly, having a higher CCI level, and being treated in a hospital with a low service volume were factors associated with a poorer prognosis. Conclusion Overall, this study utilized a national cohort to conclude that for early-stage liver cancer patients, a longer the time interval from diagnosis to treatment results in a lower survival rate."
https://openalex.org/W2809580702,"The study reports the response to herbicide of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degrading fungal strain Umbelopsis isabellina. A comparative analysis covered 41 free amino acids as well as 140 lipid species of fatty acids, phospholipids, acylglycerols, sphingolipids, and sterols. 2,4-D presence led to a decrease in fungal catalase activity, associated with a higher amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Damage to cells treated with the herbicide resulted in increased membrane permeability and decreased membrane fluidity. Detailed lipidomic profiling showed changes in the fatty acids composition such as an increase in the level of linoleic acid (C18:2). Moreover, an increase in the phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine ratio was observed. Analysis of fungal lipid profiles revealed that the presence of 2,4-D was accompanied by the accumulation of triacylglycerols, a decrease in ergosterol content, and a considerable rise in the level of sphingolipid ceramides. In the exponential phase of growth, increased levels of leucine, glycine, serine, asparagine, and hydroxyproline were found. The results obtained in our study confirmed that in the cultures of U. isabellina oxidative stress was caused by 2,4-D. The herbicide itself forced changes not only to membrane lipids but also to neutral lipids and amino acids, as the difference of tested compounds profiles between 2,4-D-containing and control samples was consequently lower as the pesticide degradation progressed. The presented findings may have a significant impact on the basic understanding of 2,4-D biodegradation and may be applied for process optimization on metabolomic and lipidomic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2809679258,"Cancer cells secrete many exosomes, which facilitate metastasis and the later growth of cancer. For early cancer diagnosis, the detection of exosomes is a crucial step. Exosomes exist in biological fluid, such as blood, which contains various proteins. It is necessary to remove the proteins in the biological fluid to avoid test interference. This paper presented a novel method for exosome isolation using Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which were synthesized using the chemical co-precipitation method and then coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The experimental results showed that the diameter of the PEG-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles was about 20 nm, while an agglomerate of MNPs reached hundreds of nanometers in size. In the protein removal experiments, fetal bovine serum (FBS) was adopted as the analyte for bioassays of exosome purification. PEG-coated Fe3O4 MNPs reduced the protein concentration in FBS to 39.89% of the original solution. By observing a particle size distribution of 30~200 nm (the size range of various exosomes), the exosome concentrations were kept the same before and after purification. In the gel electrophoresis experiments, the bands of CD63 (~53 kDa) and CD9 (~22 kDa) revealed that exosomes existed in FBS as well as in the purified solution. However, the bands of the serum albumins (~66 kDa) and the various immunoglobulins (around 160 ~ 188 kDa) in the purified solution’s lane explained that most proteins in FBS were removed by PEG-coated Fe3O4 MNPs. When purifying exosomes from serum, protein removal is critical for further exosome investigation. The proposed technique provides a simple and effective method to remove proteins in the serum using the PEG-coated Fe3O4 MNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2809154781,"The antestia bug, Antestiopsis thunbergii (Gmelin 1790) is a major pest of Arabica coffee in Africa. The bug prefers coffee at the highest elevations, contrary to other major pests. The objectives of this study were to describe the relationship between A. thunbergii populations and elevation, to elucidate this relationship using our knowledge of the pest thermal biology and to predict the pest distribution under climate warming. Antestiopsis thunbergii population density was assessed in 24 coffee farms located along a transect delimited across an elevation gradient in the range 1000–1700 m asl, on Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Density was assessed for three different climatic seasons, the cool dry season in June 2014 and 2015, the short rainy season in October 2014 and the warm dry season in January 2015. The pest distribution was predicted over the same transect using three risk indices: the establishment risk index (ERI), the generation index (GI) and the activity index (AI). These indices were computed using simulated life table parameters obtained from temperature-dependent development models and temperature data from 1) field records using data loggers deployed over the transect and 2) predictions for year 2055 extracted from AFRICLIM database. The observed population density was the highest during the cool dry season and increased significantly with increasing elevation. For current temperature, the ERI increased with an increase in elevation and was therefore distributed similarly to observed populations, contrary to the other indices. This result suggests that immature stage susceptibility to extreme temperatures was a key factor of population distribution as impacted by elevation. In the future, distribution of the risk indices globally indicated a decrease of the risk at low elevation and an increase of the risk at the highest elevations. Based on these results, we concluded with recommendations to mitigate the risk of A. thunbergii infestation."
https://openalex.org/W2809569193,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid-targeting reactive oxygen species that kill cells by damaging their plasma membrane. The lipid repair enzyme GSH peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protects against this oxidative damage and enables cells to resist ferroptosis. Recent work has revealed that matrix-detached carcinoma cells can be susceptible to ferroptosis and that they can evade this fate through the signaling properties of the α6β4 integrin, which sustains GPX4 expression. Although these findings on ferroptosis are provocative, they differ from those in previous studies indicating that matrix-detached cells are prone to apoptosis via a process referred to as anoikis. In an effort to reconcile these discrepant findings, here we observed that matrix-detached epithelial and carcinoma cells cluster spontaneously via a mechanism that involves the cell adhesion protein PVRL4 (also known as Nectin-4). We found that this clustering process allows these cells to survive by stimulating a PVRL4/α6β4/Src signaling axis that sustains GPX4 expression and buffers against lipid peroxidation. In the absence of α6β4, PVRL4-mediated clustering induced an increase in lipid peroxidation that was sufficient for triggering ferroptosis. When the clustering was inhibited, single cells did not exhibit a significant increase in lipid peroxidation in the absence of α6β4, and they were more susceptible to apoptosis than to ferroptosis. These results indicate that ferroptosis induction depends on cell clustering in matrix-detached cells that lack α6β4 and imply that the fate of matrix-detached cells can be determined by the state of their cell–cell interactions."

Histologically-confirmed incident aggressive prostate cancer or any prostate cancer were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.Of the 147,593 men included, 58,617 were treated with testosterone. 313 aggressive CaPs were diagnosed, 190 among untreated men (incidence rate (IR) 0.57 per 1000 person years, 95% CI 0.49-0.65) and 123 among treated men (IR 0.58 per 1000 person years; 95% CI 0.48-0.69). After adjusting for age, race, hospitalization during year prior to cohort entry, geography, BMI, medical comorbidities, repeated testosterone and PSA testing, testosterone treatment was not associated with incident aggressive CaP (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.70-1.13) or any CaP (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-1.01). No association between cumulative testosterone dose or formulation and CaP was observed.Among men with low testosterone levels and normal PSA, testosterone treatment was not associated with an increased risk of aggressive or any CaP.

https://openalex.org/W2808794533,"Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors. FXR plays critical roles in maintaining many metabolic pathways, including bile acid regulation and glucose and lipid homeostasis, and forms a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Despite the important roles of the FXR/RXR heterodimerization in human physiology, the molecular basis underlying the FXR/RXR interaction is still uncertain in the absence of a complex structure. Here, we report the heterodimeric structure of FXR and RXR in the presence of an FXR agonist (WAY-362450), RXR agonist (9-cis-retinoic acid), and a peptide derived from a steroid receptor coactivator (SRC2), revealing both unique and conserved modes for FXR heterodimerization. We found that the dimerization with RXR induced allosteric conformational changes on the coactivator-binding site of FXR. These changes enhanced the transcriptional activity of FXR by promoting the coactivator binding, thus suggesting a structural basis for the functional permissiveness of the FXR/RXR heterodimer complex. Furthermore, sequence analyses together with functional mutagenesis studies indicated that the helix H10 largely responsible for the dimerization is highly conserved and also critical for the FXR transcriptional activity. Our findings highlight the important roles of RXR heterodimerization in the nuclear receptor signaling, providing a potential framework to develop pharmaceutical agents in treating FXR/RXR–related diseases."

They are released by a variety of cell types; however, their presence in the inner ear has not been described in the literature. The aims of this study were to determine if exosomes are present in the inner ear and, if present, characterize the changes in their protein content in response to ototoxic stress. In this laboratory investigation, inner ear explants of 5-day-old Wistar rats were cultured and treated with either cisplatin or gentamicin. Hair cell damage was assessed by confocal microscopy. Exosomes were isolated using ExoQuick, serial centrifugation, and mini-column methods. Confirmation and characterization of exosomes was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ZetaView, BCA protein analysis, and proteomics. Vesicles with a typical size distribution for exosomes were observed using TEM and ZetaView. Proteomic analysis detected typical exosome markers and markers for the organ of Corti. There was a statistically significant reduction in the exosome protein level and number of particles per cubic centimeter when the samples were exposed to ototoxic stress. Proteomic analysis also detected clear differences in protein expression when ototoxic medications were introduced. Significant changes in the proteomes of the exosomes were previously described in the context of hearing loss and ototoxic treatment. This is the first report describing exosomes derived from the inner ear. These findings may present an opportunity to conduct further studies with the hope of using exosomes as a biomarker to monitor inner ear function in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2809334386,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated cation (HCN) channels play a critical role in the control of pacemaking in the heart and repetitive firing in neurons. In HCN channels, the intracellular cyclic nucleotide–binding domain (CNBD) is connected to the transmembrane portion of the channel (TMPC) through a helical domain, the C-linker. Although this domain is critical for mechanical signal transduction, the conformational dynamics in the C-linker that transmit the nucleotide-binding signal to the HCN channel pore are unknown. Here, we use linear response theory to analyze conformational changes in the C-linker of the human HCN1 protein, which couple cAMP binding in the CNBD with gating in the TMPC. By applying a force to the tip of the so-called “elbow” of the C-linker, the coarse-grained calculations recapitulate the same conformational changes triggered by cAMP binding in experimental studies. Furthermore, in our simulations, a displacement of the C-linker parallel to the membrane plane (i.e. horizontally) induced a rotational movement resulting in a distinct tilting of the transmembrane helices. This movement, in turn, increased the distance between the voltage-sensing S4 domain and the surrounding transmembrane domains and led to a widening of the intracellular channel gate. In conclusion, our computational approach, combined with experimental data, thus provides a more detailed understanding of how cAMP binding is mechanically coupled over long distances to promote voltage-dependent opening of HCN channels. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated cation (HCN) channels play a critical role in the control of pacemaking in the heart and repetitive firing in neurons. In HCN channels, the intracellular cyclic nucleotide–binding domain (CNBD) is connected to the transmembrane portion of the channel (TMPC) through a helical domain, the C-linker. Although this domain is critical for mechanical signal transduction, the conformational dynamics in the C-linker that transmit the nucleotide-binding signal to the HCN channel pore are unknown. Here, we use linear response theory to analyze conformational changes in the C-linker of the human HCN1 protein, which couple cAMP binding in the CNBD with gating in the TMPC.

HCN channels are also the only voltage-gated channels regulated by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides. By virtue of these properties, HCN channels play unique and essential roles in a variety of physiological processes, the most important being the generation of spontaneous electrical activity in the heart and the regulation of synaptic transmission in the brain (1.Robinson R.B.

These channels, which are present in humans in the four isoforms HCN1–4, share the general architecture of voltage-gated K+ channels (3.Postea O. Biel M.

Their monomers are built of six transmembrane domains (TMDs) of which the 4th TMD (S4) comprises the voltage sensor, and the last two TMDs (S5–S6) contribute to the ion-conducting pore (4.Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. The HCN gene family: moelcular basis of the hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker channels.Ann. N.Y. Acad.

A specific feature of HCN channels is the presence of a cyclic nucleotide–binding domain (CNBD) at their cytosolic C termini. HCN channels are activated by membrane hyperpolarization, and this voltage-dependent activation is further modulated in an allosteric manner by binding of cyclic nucleotides to the CNBD (5.DiFrancesco D. Tortora P. Direct activation of cardiac pacemaker channels by intracellular cyclic AMP.Nature. 1991; 351 (1709448): 145-14710.1038/351145a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). As a result of cAMP binding, the voltage dependence of channel opening is shifted to lower (less hyperpolarized) potentials. Thus, an intracellular increase in the cytosolic concentration of cAMP causes an earlier membrane depolarization and hence an acceleration of pacemaking (5.DiFrancesco D. Tortora P.

A full understanding of the allosteric nature of HCN channel regulation by voltage and ligands requires insights into the mechanism responsible for processing both regulatory signals in the context of the whole protein. One component in this scenario, the CNBD, has been well studied. Its structure was solved at atomic resolution for most HCN isoforms in the presence of cAMP and for HCN2 also in the absence of cAMP (6.Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R.

These data show that this domain is built from an eight-stranded β-roll, which is connected to one α-helix on the N-terminal side (A-helix) and two additional α-helices on the C-terminal side (B- and C-helices). The cAMP-binding site is composed by two elements within the CNBD: the distal C-helix and the phosphate binding cassette; the latter is embedded within the β-roll and contains the short P-helix. The CNBD is connected to the channel pore via a helical domain, the C-linker, which in turn is composed of six α-helices (A′–F′). The C-linker is critical for the transmission of conformational information between the CNBD and the transmembrane portion of the channel (TMPC) and is thus responsible for the communication between the two domains in channel regulation. Recently, Lee and MacKinnon (9.Lee C.H. MacKinnon R. Structures of the human HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated channel.Cell. 2017; 168 (28086084): 111-120.e1110.1016/j.cell.2016.12.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) obtained the first high-resolution structure of the full-length HCN1 channel in the cAMP-free and cAMP-bound state using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The voltage-sensitive domain (VSD) of HCN1 is positioned next to the pore domain of the same subunit (nonswapped), an arrangement similar to that of the closely related Eag1 (Kv10.1) and CNG channels (10.Whicher J.R. MacKinnon R. Structure of the voltage-gated K+ channel Eag1 reveals an alternative voltage sensing mechanism.Science. 2016; 353 (27516594): 664-66910.1126/science.aaf8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11.Li M.

This latter arrangement of the VSD correlates with a much shorter S4–S5 linker, which in HCN1 is significantly shorter than the stretch of ∼15 amino acids (AA) typical of Kv channels. Despite providing significant advances in our understanding of HCN channel structure–function relations, the seminal study by Lee and MacKinnon (9.Lee C.H. MacKinnon R. Structures of the human HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated channel.Cell. 2017; 168 (28086084): 111-120.e1110.1016/j.cell.2016.12.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) left the question of how conformational information is transmitted between the CNBD and the transmembrane portion of the channel largely unanswered. Purification of the HCN1 protein in 0 mV conditions resulted in a channel locked in a closed conformation, independent of the cAMP-free or cAMP-bound configuration of the CNBD, preventing the required analysis of protein movements within the TMPC. To address open questions on the conformational dynamics in HCN channels, here and elsewhere, we use linear response theory (LRT). This mechanical model, which was introduced by Ikeguchi et al. (12.Ikeguchi M. Ueno J. Sato M. Kidera A. Protein structural change upon ligand binding: linear response theory.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2005; 94 (15783858 078102)10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.078102Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), can help to calculate the direction of conformational changes in a protein upon external perturbation, e.g. by ligand binding. LRT is a coarse-grained modeling technique (13.Atilgan A.R. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Demirel M.C. Keskin O. Bahar I. Anisotropy of fluctuation dynamics of proteins with an elastic network model.Biophys.

Despite the simplicity, this approach still generates results that match very well with experimental data (14.Hamacher K. Trylska J. McCammon J.A.

This also holds true for the analysis of membrane proteins in models where the membrane is neglected, in order to further simplify the mechanical model (18.Das A. Gur M. Cheng M.H. Jo S. Bahar I. Roux B. Exploring the conformational transitions of biomolecular systems unsing a simple two-state anisotropic network model.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 (24699246): e100352110.1371/journal.pcbi.1003521Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanical connections between the HCN channel CNBD and the TMPC (i.e. the six transmembrane domains and the connecting linkers), in a previous study we employed LRT to model a synthetic channel in which the HCN channel C-linker/CNBD was connected to the available structure of the TMPC of the Kv2.1 channel (19.Weissgraeber S. Saponaro A. Thiel G. Hamacher K. A reduced mechanical model for cAMP-modulated gating in HCN channels.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28074902): 4016810.1038/srep40168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This is because, at the time of the study, there was no structural information available yet on the HCN channel TMPC. The simulation predicted that release of cAMP from its binding site triggers a quaternary twist in the cytosolic portions of the four subunits in the channel tetramer (19.Weissgraeber S. Saponaro A. Thiel G. Hamacher K. A reduced mechanical model for cAMP-modulated gating in HCN channels.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28074902): 4016810.1038/srep40168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This prediction turned out to be in good agreement with the cryo-EM structures of HCN1, which similarly suggest the predicted quaternary twist in the cytosolic parts in response to cAMP binding/release (9.Lee C.H. MacKinnon R. Structures of the human HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated channel.Cell. 2017; 168 (28086084): 111-120.e1110.1016/j.cell.2016.12.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). With the new structural information available on the entire HCN1 channel, we now revisit the open questions on the gating mechanism of HCN channels. In particular, we want to understand how the information from cAMP binding is transmitted to the TMPC and how conformational changes in the cytosolic domain are related to gating movements. For example, what is the movement of the S4 domain in response to cAMP binding? What is the movement of the S6 domain in response to cAMP binding? How may cAMP binding favor opening of the channel gate? Because the mechanical connections and the directions of conformational changes are not known for most proteins, including HCN channels, we recently developed a reference model for LRT (LRT null model) for a monomeric protein (17.Gross C. Hamacher K. Schmitz K. Jager S. Cleavage product accumulation decreases the activity of cutinase during PET hydrolysis.J. Chem. Inf. Mod. 2017; 57: 243-25510.1021/acs.jcim.6b00556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This method provides a way to uncover the mechanical response in proteins in an unbiased and efficient manner. Thus, instead of using information derived from a “typical” interaction, a functionally relevant residue in a protein is subjected to a set of random perturbations from any possible direction. The resulting responses, in the form of residue displacements, can then be clustered according to the general directions of displacement they impose on the protein structure. In the following step, perturbations from different clusters can be evaluated with respect to the plausibility of the direction of perturbation, which can be judged by comparing the computational data with experimental results obtained with the same protein. In this study, the LRT null model was adjusted to work for the homotetrameric HCN1 channel. To identify the most plausible perturbation direction, we relied on previous experimental studies in which conformational changes in the cytosolic domains of HCN channels were monitored after binding of cAMP to the CNBD (8.Saponaro A.

Based on these studies, we decided to apply an external force at a single position located in the bend between the A′- and B′-helices of the C-linker. As stated above, the C-linker is in a strategic position (Fig. 1) as it connects the CNBD to the S6-helix of the pore, and thus, it is thought to transmit the conformational changes in the CNBD after cAMP binding/release to the pore (6.Zagotta W.N.

We first show that all our modeling results are in good agreement with experimental data and thus confirm the assumption that the tip of the C-linker “elbow” (6.Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Structural basis for modulation and agonist specificity of HCN pacemaker channels.Nature. 2003; 425 (12968185): 200-20510.1038/nature01922Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) is an important position for the mechanical transduction of information from the CNBD to the HCN channel pore and vice versa. Next, we employ LRT analysis to predict the conformational changes in the orientation of the transmembrane helices, as well as the movement of the inner gate of HCN1, in response to cAMP binding. More specifically, we show how tilting movements in the transmembrane helices, predicted by the LRT model, generate two important outcomes implied by prior experimental studies: 1) an increase in the distance between the voltage sensor (S4) and the surrounding transmembrane domains; and 2) a widening of the intracellular channel gate. Altogether, the combination of a high-resolution structure and LRT analysis provides a valuable tool for uncovering the short- and long-range mechanical connections in HCN channels, which are relevant for their gating by ligands. The C-linker is an important structure in HCN channels for the coupling of conformational changes in the CNBD, which are generated by cAMP binding, with the channel pore (23.Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

In all HCN structures available, the C-linkers are found tightly packed in the tetramer in the so-called “elbow on the shoulder” conformation in which the A′- and B′-helices (elbow) of one subunit interact with the C′- and D′-helices (shoulder) of the adjacent subunit (6.Zagotta W.N.

Zagotta W.N. Structural insights into the mechanisms of CNBD channel function.J. Gen. Physiol. 2018; 150 (29233886): 225-24410.1085/jgp.201711898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To simulate the proposed C-linker movement, we perturbed the anisotropic network model (ANM) of cAMP-free HCN1 structure at the tip of the elbow (Ala-425 in the bend between the A′- and B′-helices) with forces from different directions. The elbow was chosen to perturb the protein because it seems to undergo a large conformational change during cAMP binding (27.James Z.M. Zagotta W.N. Structural insights into the mechanisms of CNBD channel function.J. Gen. Physiol. 2018; 150 (29233886): 225-24410.1085/jgp.201711898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate which of these perturbation directions causes conformational changes that best match the experimentally observed C-linker movement, the force directions were first clustered into groups of similar displacement effects. Clustering, which is described in detail under “Experimental procedures,” was based on the effect of the elbow movement on the underlying shoulder, represented by residues 446–465 on the C′- and D′-helices. The shoulder domain was chosen for clustering because it is directly coupled to the elbow and hence responds in a direct manner to perturbations at the elbow (27.James Z.M. Zagotta W.N. Structural insights into the mechanisms of CNBD channel function.J. Gen. Physiol. 2018; 150 (29233886): 225-24410.1085/jgp.201711898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Clustering based on movements of all residues would be less meaningful as unstructured loop regions can move very randomly. The clustering of perturbation directions at the tip of the elbow, which induces different movements of the shoulder, is illustrated in Fig. 1. The displacements observed in response to one representative force direction for each of the four different clusters are shown in Fig. 2, where the coloring of the displacement vectors corresponds to the coloring of clusters in Fig. 1 (and in all following figures), and the length of the arrows is proportional to the size of the LRT displacements (rendered in arbitrary units). The data show in a side view perspective that horizontal (in the plane of the membrane) and vertical (perpendicular to the plane of the membrane) perturbations cause distinct displacements in the C-linker/CNBD domain as well as in the TMPC. Notably, the strongest displacements (longer arrows) throughout the protein are elicited by perturbations applied in a horizontal direction parallel to the plane of the membrane (Fig. 2, a and b). These perturbations (Fig. 2, a and b, red and yellow arrows) show the best match with the previously proposed model for C-linker movements in response to cAMP binding (20.Craven K.B. Olivier N.B. Zagotta W.N. C-terminal movement during gating in cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels.J. Biol.

The predicted iris-like movement of the C-linker of HCN1 can indeed be seen in the simulations. A top view of the C-linker shows an iris-like motion as a result of the horizontal displacements of the elbow (Fig. 3, a and b). Vertical perturbations, as represented by the force direction vectors in the other two clusters, do not induce such movements (Fig. 3, c and d). To further validate the conformational changes, which are predicted in our computational results, we used the high-resolution structures of HCN1 in the cAMP-free and cAMP-bound conformation for comparison (super-position, Fig. 3f) (9.Lee C.H.

Structures of the human HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated channel.Cell. 2017; 168 (28086084): 111-120.e1110.1016/j.cell.2016.12.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fig. 3e shows the position of the elbow and shoulder in the cAMP-free form. The arrows in Fig. 3e represent the movements in the protein, which are required for the transition from the experimentally determined cAMP-free into the cAMP-bound structure (9.Lee C.H. MacKinnon R. Structures of the human HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated channel.Cell. 2017; 168 (28086084): 111-120.e1110.1016/j.cell.2016.12.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A comparison between the simulated and experimental data shows that the displacement in Fig. 3b (yellow arrows) in which a force on the tip of the elbow is applied pushing toward the central axis of the protein (inward) reveals a very good match with the direction of the conformational changes of the C-linker observed after cAMP binding. As the tip of the elbow is pushed toward the central axis of the protein, the helices of the elbow and the underlying shoulder respond by all moving in the overall same direction away from the center in a centrifugal motion, but at different angles. This indeed generates an iris-like rotational movement, seen in the top view perspective of Fig. 3, b and e, as a counter-clockwise rotation. Whereas the horizontal movement of the elbow in Figs. 2b and 3b recapitulates the experimentally determined iris-like transition of the C-linker in response to cAMP binding, it is important to note that in all HCN structures resolved thus far the C-linker is found in the resting (nonactive) position. Thus, in the full-length HCN1 structure (obtained at 0 mV), the depolarized position of VSD always locks the channel in a closed state, whether cAMP is present or not. This is likely to impose a severe limitation on the range of movement the C-linker is able to undergo (see Fig. 3, legend). Similarly, it has been suggested that in all available crystal structures for the cAMP-bound C-linker/CNBD fragment, the C-linker is found in a resting state, as inferred by the presence of a set of sal"

In addition to the classical paradigm in which AR exerts its biological effects in the nucleus by orchestrating the expression of the androgen-regulated transcriptome, there is considerable evidence supporting a rapid, nongenomic activity mediated by membrane-associated AR. Although the genomic action of AR has been studied in depth, the molecular events governing AR transport to the plasma membrane and the downstream AR signaling cascades remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that AR membrane transport is microtubule-dependent. Disruption of the function of kinesin 5B (KIF5B), but not of kinesin C3 (KIFC3), interfered with AR membrane association and signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays revealed that AR physically interacts with KIF5B and that androgen enhances this interaction. Furthermore, we show that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is activated by membrane-associated AR and that HSP27 plays an important role in mediating AR-mediated membrane-to-nuclear signal transduction. Together, these results indicate that AR membrane translocation is mediated by the microtubule cytoskeleton and the motor protein KIF5B. By activating HSP27, membrane-associated AR potentiates the transcriptional activity of nuclear AR.

While it seems clear that the remote ancestors of Austronesian speakers originated in Southern China, and migrated to Taiwan with the development of rice farming by c. 5500 BP and onto the northern Philippines by c. 4000 BP (the Austronesian Dispersal Hypothesis or ADH), we know very little about the origins and emergence of Austronesian speakers in the Indonesian Archipelago. Using a combination of cranial morphometric and ancient mtDNA analyses on a new dataset from Gua Hairmau, that spans the pre-Neolithic through to Metal Period (5712—5591cal BP to 1864—1719 cal BP), we rigorously test the validity of the ADH in ISEA. A morphometric analysis of 23 adult male crania, using 16 of Martin’s standard measurements, was carried out with results compared to an East and Southeast Asian dataset of 30 sample populations spanning the Late Pleistocene through to Metal Period, in addition to 39 modern samples from East and Southeast Asia, near Oceania and Australia. Further, 20 samples were analyzed for ancient mtDNA and assigned to identified haplogroups. We demonstrate that the archaeological human remains from Gua Harimau cave, Sumatra, Indonesia provide clear evidence for at least two (cranio-morphometrically defined) and perhaps even three (in the context of the ancient mtDNA results) distinct populations from two separate time periods. The results of these analyses provide substantive support for the ADH model in explaining the origins and population history of ISEA peoples."

We therefore sought to identify lactobacilli naturally occurring in postnatal rats and examine their ability to colonize the neonatal intestine and protect from NEC. L. murinus, L. acidophilus, and L. johnsonii were found in 42, 20, and 1 out of 51 4-day old rats, respectively. Higher proportion of L. murinus in microbiota correlated with lower NEC scores. Inoculation with each of the three species during first feeding significantly augmented intestinal populations of lactobacilli four days later, indicating successful colonization. L. murinus, but not L. acidophilus or L. johnsonii, significantly protected against NEC. Thus, lactobacilli protect rats from NEC in a species- or strain-specific manner. Our results may help rationalizing probiotic therapy in NEC."

KLK-related peptidase 6 (KLK6), specifically, is highly up-regulated in several types of cancer, where its increased activity promotes cancer invasion and metastasis. This characteristic suggests KLK6 as an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. However, inhibitors that specifically target KLK6 have not yet been reported, possibly because KLK6 shares a high sequence homology and structural similarity with other serine proteases and resists inhibition by many polypeptide inhibitors. Here, we present an innovative combinatorial approach to engineering KLK6 inhibitors via flow cytometry–based screening of a yeast-displayed mutant library of the human amyloid precursor protein Kunitz protease inhibitor domain (APPI), an inhibitor of other serine proteases, such as anionic and cationic trypsins. On the basis of this screening, we generated APPIM17L,I18F,S19F,F34V (APPI-4M), an APPI variant with a KLK6 inhibition constant (Ki) of 160 pm and a turnover time of 10 days. To the best of our knowledge, APPI-4M is the most potent KLK6 inhibitor reported to date, displaying 146-fold improved affinity and 13-fold improved proteolytic stability compared with WT APPI (APPIWT). We further demonstrate that APPI-4M acts as a functional inhibitor in a cell-based model of KLK6-dependent breast cancer invasion. Finally, the crystal structures of the APPIWT/KLK6 and APPI-4M/KLK6 complexes revealed the structural and mechanistic bases for the improved KLK6 binding and proteolytic resistance of APPI-4M.

https://openalex.org/W2808941721,"China is the world’s biggest livestock producer, and has a rapidly expanding intensive livestock production in response to growing demand. The large size of the country and geographical dispersion of the livestock production systems means that animals are often transported long distances to slaughter. This study investigated perceptions of animal welfare issues by stakeholders in the Chinese transport and slaughter industry using utility scores and adaptive conjoint analysis. An initial workshop for experts in this field identified key concerns; these were then included in a questionnaire, which was distributed electronically to stakeholders. Stakeholders, particularly those with higher levels of education, were most concerned about the absence of pre-slaughter stunning and failure to maintain unconsciousness throughout the slaughter process. For all livestock species electrical stunning was considered the best method of stunning and blunt trauma the worst; for cattle and sheep stunning using a penetrating captive bolt was considered preferable to the use a percussive captive bolt. Other concerns considered very important were journey quality and livestock workers’ experience and attitudes. Heat stress and closed-sided vehicles were of greater concern than cold stress. Loading facilities and journey length were considered of intermediate importance, while lairage and methods for catching chickens were of least concern. The importance of some welfare concerns, e.g. livestock having to remain standing during a journey, was more commonly recognised by stakeholders who reported a high level of knowledge and experience. Therefore, these welfare issues could be a focus for future training activities. Compared to respondents directly involved in livestock transport, respondents involved in teaching and researching within livestock production rated the presented animal welfare issues as more important. These results can be used to guide development of training programmes, animal welfare research, and certification and regulatory control to target challenges to animal welfare in livestock transport and slaughter in China."
https://openalex.org/W2809398132,"Tcf4 is a transcription factor which regulates neurogenesis and neuronal migration in the brain. In humans, loss of function of Tcf4 leads to the rare neurodevelopmental disorder Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay and autistic behavior. We analyzed the consequences of functional loss of Tcf4 on dendritic spines in mature principal neurons. To this end, we crossed mice in which the DNA-binding domain of the Tcf4 gene is flanked by LoxP sites to mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase in a sparse subset of fluorescently labelled neurons (SlickV line). This resulted in a mouse model with an inducible functional knockout of Tcf4 in a subset of cortical and hippocampal neurons, in which we analyzed dendritic spines, which are the morphological correlate of excitatory postsynapses. Heterozygous as well as homozygous loss of Tcf4 led to a reduction in the number of dendritic spines in the cortex as well as in the hippocampus. This was accompanied by morphological changes of dendritic spines. These results suggest that Tcf4 is involved in synaptic plasticity in mature neurons, and functional loss of Tcf4 may contribute to the neurological symptoms in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2809453339,"Objectives Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be an important component of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). We compared performance of DWI for detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) of prostate. Materials and methods We reviewed data of 460 subjects who underwent preoperative 3.0-Tesla mpMRI and subsequently radical prostatectomy. Level of suspicion for PCa was graded using 5-grade Likert-scale from DWI. Topographic analyses were performed for location of tumor foci at each surgical specimen. Among those with DWI grade ≥ III, we analyzed concordance rate on the location of radiologic and pathologic index lesions between DWI and surgical specimens. Results Among 460 patients, 351 (76.3%) patients showed suspicious DWI lesions (57.5% in PZ, 42.5% in TZ). Multivariates regression analyses revealed significant associations between high DWI grade and adverse pathologic outcomes including pathologic stage, Gleason score, tumor volume and extracapsular extension (all p < 0.05). Overall concordance rates between DWI and surgical specimen were 75.8%, significantly higher in PZ than TZ (82.2% vs. 67.1% p = 0.002). Such concordance rate showed a positive linear association with increase in DWI grading (p < 0.001). Among 109 patients with DWI grade I-II, 28 (25.7%) harbored high grade disease (pathologic Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3). Conclusions DWI detects tumors in PZ of prostate more accurately than those in TZ. Such accuracy of DWI was shown to be more evident with higher DWI grade. Meanwhile, a negative DWI did not guarantee absence of high grade PCa."

Participants completed the instruments Body Shape Questionnaire (reduced version, BSQ-8B), Male Body Dissatisfaction Scale (reduced version, MBDS-R), Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (reduced version, TFEQ-18), Perceived Health Competence Scale (bifactorial version, PHCS-B), World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Short Form (WHOQoL-bref) and a questionnaire for characterization of sample. Psychometric properties of instruments were previously evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis. A hypothetical model for each sex was developed and tested. In both model surveys the aspects of the body image (BSQ-8B: body shape concern; MBDS-R: musculature and general body appearance), of eating behavior (TFEQ-18: cognitive restriction, emotional eating, and uncontrolled eating) and of the perceived health competence (PHCS-B: expectations of achieving the desired health results and competence in health behaviors) were used as direct predictors on quality of life (WHOQoL-bref). The variables age, medication use for body change, food supplement use for body change, and body mass index (BMI) were inserted in the aspects of the body image. The variables course shift, initial expectation regarding the course, self-reported performance in the course, concomitant work activities to studies, and economic class were inserted into the quality of life. The model surveys were evaluated using structural equation modeling. A level of significance of 5% was used. A total of 2,198 university students (female = 63.5%), including 1,151 Brazilians and 1,047 Portuguese, participated of study (locally representative samples). The average age of women was 20.8 ± 2.4 years and of men was 21.3 ± 3.3 years. The psychometric properties of the instruments were adequate, except for the PHCS, which was adjusted for each sex. The models presented variance explained of 54% and 49% for women and men, respectively. In both sexes, the students' perceived health competence and academic variables contributed significantly to their quality of life, and age, BMI, and medication and supplement use were significant factors relating to how a student views his or her body image. Women's quality of life was associated with body shape concern and emotional eating aspects. Men's quality of life was associated with general body appearance and cognitive restriction aspects. These results can be used to create and implement educational programs to improve quality of life of university students."

Reversal of phospholamban (PLB)-mediated SERCA inhibition by saturating Ca2+ conditions operates as a physiological rheostat to reactivate SERCA function in the absence of PLB phosphorylation. Here, we performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the structural mechanism of this process. Simulation of the inhibitory complex at superphysiological Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] = 10 mm) revealed that Ca2+ ions interact primarily with SERCA and the lipid headgroups, but not with PLB's cytosolic domain or the cytosolic side of the SERCA–PLB interface. At this [Ca2+], a single Ca2+ ion was translocated from the cytosol to the transmembrane transport sites. We used this Ca2+-bound complex as an initial structure to simulate the effects of saturating Ca2+ at physiological conditions ([Ca2+]total ≈ 400 μm). At these conditions, ∼30% of the Ca2+-bound complexes exhibited structural features consistent with an inhibited state. However, in ∼70% of the Ca2+-bound complexes, Ca2+ moved to transport site I, recruited Glu771 and Asp800, and disrupted key inhibitory contacts involving the conserved PLB residue Asn34. Structural analysis showed that Ca2+ induces only local changes in interresidue inhibitory interactions, but does not induce repositioning or changes in PLB structural dynamics. Upon relief of SERCA inhibition, Ca2+ binding produced a site I configuration sufficient for subsequent SERCA activation. We propose that at saturating [Ca2+] and in the absence of PLB phosphorylation, binding of a single Ca2+ ion in the transport sites rapidly shifts the equilibrium toward a noninhibited SERCA–PLB complex.

Two mechanisms have been proposed for the relief of SERCA inhibition at saturating Ca2+ conditions: the dissociation model and the subunit model. The dissociation model proposes that PLB must physically separate from SERCA to relieve inhibition, whereas the subunit model hypothesizes that PLB acts as a functional subunit of SERCA, and inhibition is relieved by local structural rearrangements within the SERCA–PLB complex. Whereas cross-linking experiments have suggested that saturation Ca2+ conditions induce PLB dissociation from SERCA, the findings from these studies are actually consistent with a structural rearrangement, and not dissociation, of the inhibitory complex (7.Toyoshima C.

Furthermore, extensive spectroscopic experiments in live cells, ER membranes, and reconstituted vesicles unequivocally support the subunit model, as they provide direct detection of the SERCA–PLB interaction at high Ca2+ concentrations (11.Dong X.

These studies have shown that saturating Ca2+ conditions do not induce dissociation of the SERCA–PLB complex, but the spatial and temporal mechanisms by which Ca2+ reverses SERCA remain unknown. In this study, we designed a series of atomistic molecular simulations to determine the mechanisms for Ca2+-dependent relief of inhibitory interactions in the SERCA–PLB complex. First, we used a full-length structure of SERCA bound to the inhibitory structure of unphosphorylated PLB as a starting structure to obtain a structure of the SERCA–PLB complex at saturating Ca2+ conditions. We then used the Ca2+-bound SERCA–PLB structural model generated through this computational approach to perform six independent 1-μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complex at physiologically relevant conditions. This set of independent simulations was used to systematically identify the effects of saturating Ca2+ conditions on the inhibitory contacts between SERCA and PLB in the absence of PLB phosphorylation. Physiologically relevant saturating free Ca2+ concentrations are in the low micromolar range (23.Kirschenlohr H.L. Grace A.A. Vandenberg J.I. Metcalfe J.C. Smith G.A. Estimation of systolic and diastolic free intracellular Ca2+ by titration of Ca2+ buffering in the ferret heart.Biochem.

To overcome this limitation, we first performed a 0.5-μs MD simulation of the SERCA–PLB complex at 10 mm CaCl2 to mimic saturating Ca2+ concentrations and to match the experimental conditions used previously in X-ray crystallography studies (24.Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Crystal structure of the calcium pump with a bound ATP analogue.Nature. 2004; 430 (15229613): 529-53510.1038/nature02680Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 25.Toyoshima C.

At this Ca2+ concentration, Ca2+ ions interact with several acidic residues of SERCA exposed on both sides of the lipid bilayer, as well as with the lipid headgroups (Fig. 1). However, we found no indication that Ca2+ interacts with the cytosolic domain of PLB or near the cytosolic side of the SERCA–PLB interface (Fig. 1). Mapping of Ca2+-SERCA interactions revealed that Ca2+ ions do not form interactions with functionally important regions of the pump, such as the phosphorylation site (Asp351) or the K+-binding site involved in SERCA dephosphorylation (Ala711, Ala714, Lys712, and Glu732) (26.Sørensen T.L.

In other cases, Ca2+ ions interact, albeit nonspecifically, with other functional sites in the cytosolic headpiece, such as the Nβ5-β6 loop (Asp426–Lys436) (27.Smolin N. Robia S.L. A structural mechanism for calcium transporter headpiece closure.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2015; 119 (25531267): 1407-141510.1021/jp511433vCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We found that Ca2+ ions bind to SERCA near the cytosolic gate that leads to the transport sites (Fig. 1). This site is located ∼20 Å away from the SERCA–PLB interface and is not physically altered by PLB, and SERCA–metal ion interactions in this site are completely independent from PLB binding (15.Akin B.L. Hurley T.D. Chen Z. Jones L.R. The structural basis for phospholamban inhibition of the calcium pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol.

On average, 2–3 Ca2+ ions occupy this region of the protein, but only a single Ca2+ ion binds to residues Asp59 and Glu309 at the entrance of the cytosolic pathway (Fig. 2A). We found that in the submicrosecond timescale (t = 0.34 μs), Glu309 translocates a single Ca2+ ion from Asp59 to Asp800 (Fig. 2B). Ca2+ translocation is facilitated by a change in the dihedral angle N-Cα-Cβ-Cγ (χ1) of Glu309 from values of +165° and −165° to a χ1 = −65°. Upon translocation, Ca2+ is stabilized in the transport sites by electrostatic interactions with residues Asp800 and Glu309 (Fig. 2C). This Ca2+-bound configuration of the complex is stable for the remainder of the simulation time, so we used it as starting structure for six independent MD simulations, identified as CAL1–CAL6. These MD simulations were used to determine the effects of saturating Ca2+ conditions at physiologically relevant conditions (e.g. ∼400 μm total Ca2+ and 100 mm K+). This set of MD simulations revealed that Ca2+ remains bound to the transport sites of SERCA and does not dissociate back to the cytosol at physiological conditions. We calculated the coordination number and coordination shell of Ca2+ to characterize the interactions that stabilize a single Ca2+ ion in the transport sites of SERCA. We define the coordination number of Ca2+ as the number of oxygen atoms within 3.5 Å of the calcium ion. This distance is normally considered to be the maximum possible distance between ligand oxygen atoms and the calcium ion (28.Deng H. Chen G. Yang W. Yang J.J.

We found that in all trajectories, Ca2+ interacts with the transport sites predominantly with a coordination number of 7, although Ca2+ also exhibits a coordination number of 8 in a small percentage of the simulation time (<10%). These coordination numbers fall within the typical values estimated from Ca2+–protein (31.Carugo O. Djinovic K. Rizzi M.

In two trajectories, CAL1 and CAL3, the Ca2+ ion interacts predominantly with seven coordinating oxygen atoms primarily in a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry, in agreement with previous crystallographic studies of Ca2+–bound SERCA (25.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 Å resolution.Nature. 2000; 405 (10864315): 647-65510.1038/35015017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The seven coordinating ligands for Ca2+ are the carboxylic oxygen atoms from residues Glu309 and Asp800, the carbonyl moiety from residue Asn796, and between two and four water molecules (Fig. 3A). We found that in trajectories CAL2 and CAL4–CAL6, Ca2+ also coordinates to oxygen atoms within the transport site predominantly in a heptavalent pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. However, Glu771 rapidly (t = 25–250 ns) replaces Glu309 in the first coordination shell of Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). In this binding mode, Ca2+ interacts with the oxygen atoms from transport site residues Glu771 and Asp800, the carbonyl group from residue Asn796, and 2–3 water molecules (Fig. 3B). Recent studies have shown that PLB residue Asn34, which is absolutely required for SERCA inhibition (34.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H.

The SERCA-Ca2+ interactions shown in Fig. 3 suggest that saturating Ca2+ concentrations alter SERCA–PLB inhibitory contacts at physiological conditions. Therefore, we measured intermolecular residue pair distances between Gly801 and Asn34 and between Thr805 and Asn34. SERCA residues Glu771 and Asp800 play a key role in Ca2+ occlusion in the transport sites (35.Strock C. Cavagna M. Peiffer W.E. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Inesi G. Direct demonstration of Ca2+ binding defects in sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase mutants overexpressed in COS-1 cells transfected with adenovirus vectors.J. Biol.

In the trajectories where Ca2+ primarily binds to SERCA residues Glu309 and Asp800 (trajectories CAL1 and CAL3), PLB residue Asn34 interacts directly with the backbone oxygen of Gly801 and the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr805 (Fig. 4). In both cases, the intermolecular interactions Asn34–Gly801 and Asn34–Thr805 are present for most of the simulation time. Furthermore, we found that the carboxyl groups of transport site residues Glu771 and Asp800 in these trajectories are separated by a distance of at least 9 Å (Fig. 4). This spatial separation is characteristic of the inhibited SERCA–PLB complex in the absence of Ca2+ (15.Akin B.L. Hurley T.D. Chen Z. Jones L.R. The structural basis for phospholamban inhibition of the calcium pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol.

Therefore, the stability of the inhibitory interactions and the large spatial separation between Glu771 and Asp800 indicate that the structures populated in the trajectories CAL1 and CAL3 correspond to those of an inhibited Ca2+-bound state of the SERCA–PLB complex (15.Akin B.L.

In four MD trajectories, CAL2, CAL4, CAL5, and CAL6, we found substantial changes in the distances between intermolecular residue pairs Asn34–Gly801 and Asn34–Thr805. Here, the distance Asn34–Thr805 increases by 1–2 Å (Fig. 4); however, the most significant change is the 3-Å increase in the distance between the side chain of Asn34 and the backbone oxygen of Gly801 (Fig. 4). Most importantly, we found that the spatial separation Asn34 of PLB and Gly801 of SERCA in these trajectories occurs concomitantly with a 3–4-Å decrease in the distance between transport site residues Glu771 and Asp800 (Fig. 4). These changes in interresidue distances are also accompanied by a shift in the dihedral angle Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Nδ (χ2) of Asn34 from two narrow distributions at χ2 = +180° and χ2 = −180° to a single broad distribution with a mean around −20° (Fig. 5). This structural change is mostly characterized by a transition from an extended side-chain conformation to a self-contact (36.Pal T.K. Sankararamakrishnan R.

How Leishmania modify macrophage phenotype is a focus of intense interest, and one possibility to consider is by targeting host miRNAs. 2The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAHMDMhuman monocyte-derived macrophageqPCRquantitative PCRGOGene OntologyKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesEUethynyl uridineHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionGM–CSFgranulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factorDAPI4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindoleANOVAanalysis of variance. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that play ubiquitous and important roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Thus, targeting of the host miRNA machinery by Leishmania could constitute a powerful mechanism for modifying host-cell phenotype. By disrupting miRNA expression, Leishmania could act on many target genes simultaneously. In the present study, we used miRNA expression profiling to define the effects of L. donovani on the expression of human macrophage miRNAs and to identify the underlying mechanisms involved. microRNA human monocyte-derived macrophage quantitative PCR Gene Ontology Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ethynyl uridine Hanks' balanced salt solution granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole analysis of variance. Here, we show that infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) with L. donovani brought about the down-regulation of a group of 19 host miRNAs whose genes are widely distributed throughout the genome. Repression of miRNA expression took place at the level of gene transcription as the synthesis rates of primary miRNAs were down-regulated in infected cells. This repression was host transcription factor c-Myc–dependent because the expression of c-Myc itself was markedly up-regulated by infection, and miRNA repression was reversed by c-Myc silencing. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify a mechanism of how the miRNA machinery is targeted during Leishmania infection. Moreover, and of special interest, c-Myc silencing also brought about a dramatic reduction in the intracellular survival of Leishmania. Taken together, these findings identify c-Myc as not only acting to bring about genome-wide repression of host miRNAs, but also playing an essential role in promoting Leishmania survival. These findings identify c-Myc as a novel virulence factor by proxy contributing to Leishmania pathogenesis. To profile the expression of miRNAs in the context of Leishmania infection, we used the Nanostring nCounter human v2 miRNA expression assay. HMDMs were infected or not with L. donovani for 24, 48, and 72 h. 800 miRNAs are available for detection in this assay. After background subtraction and normalization of the data, 46 miRNAs (hereafter called the “group of 46”) were reproducibly detected (average > 50 counts) in all samples from all three donors (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, a large majority of these miRNAs (35 of 46) appeared to be down-regulated in infected cells (log2 ratio < 0). The remaining 11 miRNAs did not display a consistent expression in the three donors. Statistical analysis revealed that the expression of 19 miRNAs (hereafter called the “group of 19”) from the group of 46 were significantly down-regulated at one or more of the infection time points (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, no miRNAs were observed to be up-regulated in infected cells. The group of 19 miRNAs is shown in Table 1. Further inspection revealed that the repressed miRNAs came from genes on 11 different chromosomes and 17 different loci (miR-23 and miR-93 are from the same cluster, cluster 9; let-7a-3 and let-7b are from cluster 3). Moreover, all types of miRNA were represented: there were 36% intergenic miRNAs, 52% intronic and 10 exonic, which resembles the general distribution of all miRNAs (∼40% intergenic, 40% introns, 10% exons, and 10% “mixed” miRNAs (1.Kim V.N.

The results from qPCR analysis (Fig. 1D) confirmed the down-regulation of miRNAs observed previously, and the Nanostring results and RT–qPCR data were clearly tightly correlated (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the extracted RNA was also analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. This showed that despite some differences in the distributions of RNA sizes after infection, there was no detectable down-regulation of all small RNAs (Fig. S1). This eliminated the concern that what we observed in infected cells might be nonspecific. To explore how the observed down-regulation in miRNA expression could affect host macrophage phenotype in the context of infection, we searched for predicted target mRNAs of the group of 19 miRNAs, using TargetScan (2.Agarwal V. Bell G.W. Nam J.-W. Bartel D.P. Predicting effective microRNA target sites in mammalian mRNAs.eLife. 2015; 4 (26267216): e0500510.7554/eLife.05005Crossref PubMed Scopus (4379) Google Scholar). The 2950 predicted targets were then analyzed for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways (Fig. S2). In the GO term enrichment analysis, the most enriched biological processes were “biological regulation,” “metabolic process,” and “response to stimulus,” closely followed by “cell communication,” which make intuitive sense when considered in the context of a response to an infection (Fig. S2A). With regard to cellular compartments, interestingly “membrane” was the most enriched, consistent with the role of membrane proteins in uptake of Leishmania and also in the initiation of cell signaling responses (Fig. S2B). Among the significantly enriched KEGG pathways (Fig. S2D), a number of cellular pathways previously implicated in Leishmania pathogenesis were identified, such as the “MAPK signaling pathway,” “regulation of actin cytoskeleton,” and “endocytosis.” Based upon this analysis, it became clear that miRNA repression by Leishmania has the potential to profoundly affect macrophage cell regulation and host defense and that understanding the mechanisms involved is an important objective. Based on these striking results, we aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanism taking place in infected cells and leading to this genome-wide repression of miRNAs. To the best of our knowledge, such genome-wide repression of host miRNAs as we observed here has not previously been reported in the context of infection by any other nonviral intracellular pathogens, be they protozoan or bacterial. It is noteworthy that in a model of human cytomegalovirus infection, the stability of miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs was reduced by a viral noncoding RNA, accounting for their reduced abundance (3.Lee S. Song J. Kim S. Kim J. Hong Y. Kim Y. Kim D. Baek D. Ahn K.

Otherwise, global decreases in miRNA expression have been associated with several types of cancers. In these studies, the down-regulation was attributed variably to mutations or deletions in the miRNA processing proteins Dicer and Drosha (4.Wu D. Hu Y. Tong S. Williams B.R. Smyth G.K. Gantier M.P.

The findings that the down-regulated miRNAs were very diverse in terms of the chromosome localization of their genes and loci and their type, suggested to us that it was worthwhile to look for a regulatory mechanism that might be common to all of these miRNAs. One potential explanation for the observed genome-wide down-regulation of miRNAs could be that one or more of the proteins involved in miRNA processing (Fig. S3A) was affected by infection: down-regulated, inhibited, or sequestered in a compartment other than where it acts. First, we investigated the abundance of the major regulatory proteins involved in the biosynthesis of miRNAs. The expression of the proteins DGCR8, Dicer, TRBP, and Ago2 in fact were all unchanged by infection, both at 24 and 48 h (Fig. S3, B and C). Surprisingly, Drosha was unchanged at 24 h but was strongly up-regulated at 48 h postinfection. Drosha and DGCR8 need to be present in the nucleus to process primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs); therefore, we examined whether Leishmania infection might block the nuclear localization of these proteins. Using confocal microscopy, the nuclear versus cytosolic localization of the proteins was measured in infected and noninfected cells, and no differences were observed (Fig. S3, D and E). Taken together, these findings indicate that broad-based down-regulation of miRNAs by Leishmania infection cannot be explained either by decreased expression of miRNA-processing proteins or by restricted cytosolic localization of Drosha and DGCR8, such that they are not available for nuclear processing of pri-miRNAs. An alternative mechanism to explain down-regulation of mature miRNAs in infected cells could be faster rates of miRNA decay. To examine whether the stabilities of miRNAs were reduced in the context of infection, actinomycin D was used to inhibit transcription. RNA from both control and infected cells (24 h of infection) was then collected at 0, 6, and 24 h postaddition of actinomycin D, and RT–qPCR was done to measure the decay rates of the six representative miRNAs. Fig. 2A shows the amount of each miRNA at each time point in control and infected cells ± actinomycin. The slope for each curve was then calculated, and these slope values are shown in Fig. 2B. Inspection of these results led to several conclusions. First of all, as expected, the slopes of actinomycin D–treated control cells were lower (more negative) than those in DMSO-treated control cells, showing the decay of miRNAs when their synthesis is blocked and validating this model. Second, when comparing actinomycin D–treated samples, thereby looking only at decay, the slopes were similar between control and infected cells, indicating that miRNAs did not have faster decay rates in infected cells. Finally, when control and infected cells were treated only with DMSO, therefore, taking into account both synthesis and decay, the slopes were lower in infected cells as compared with control cells. By default, this pointed toward a de facto defect in miRNA synthesis in infected cells, because as discussed above, decay rates per se were not changed by infection. Taken together, these results showed no differences in the stabilities of mature miRNAs in the context of infection but rather identified a defect in synthesis of miRNAs in infected cells. To examine further whether the synthesis of miRNAs was down-regulated in infected cells, the levels of five pri-miRNAs and five precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) from the group of 19 were assessed by RT–qPCR. The results indeed showed that pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNA levels were down-regulated in infected cells (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively), as was earlier shown be the case for the levels of their cognate mature miRNAs (Fig. 1D). This observation was found to be the case for all pri- and pre-miRNAs examined at 24 h and a majority of them at 48 h postinfection. These findings indicated a defect in transcription rates of pri-miRNAs as contributing to the genome-wide down-regulation of mature miRNAs in infected cells. To examine directly the transcription rates of pri-miRNAs, RNA in infected and control cells was metabolically labeled using ethynyl uridine (EU) and then collected after 15, 30, and 60 min of EU treatment. The newly synthesized RNA (labeled with EU) was pulled down using Click-iT technology and analyzed by RT–qPCR. This allowed us to look in real time at the synthesis rates of four pri-miRNAs (pri-miR-98 was not detected in nascent RNA) and three control RNAs (Fig. 3, C and D). The slopes of these curves were measured for each gene and each donor, in infected and control cells, and are presented normalized to control cells (Fig. 3, E and F). The miRNAs selected for this experiment were of different transcriptional types: miR-15a and miR-15b are intronic miRNAs (their transcription depends on their cognate host gene), let-7a is an exonic miRNA, and miR-34a is intergenic, in which case miRNAs are transcribed on their own. Despite the variability between donors, the transcription rates were reduced by half in infected cells for all four pri-miRNAs without regard to their transcriptional type (Fig. 3E). This experiment shows that the transcription rates of pri-miRNAs were significantly lower in infected cells as compared with control cells. The main factors that could explain decreased transcription rates are either epigenetic control or transcription factors being differentially expressed. In some cancer cells, miRNAs have been shown to be repressed by CpG island hypermethylation (12.Weber B. Stresemann C. Brueckner B. Lyko F. Methylation of human microRNA genes in normal and neoplastic cells.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6 (17457051): 1001-100510.4161/cc.6.9.4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13.Suzuki H. Maruyama R.

In analyzing the data from an article that looked at DNA methylation changes in Leishmania-infected macrophages (14.Marr A.K. MacIsaac J.L. Jiang R. Airo A.M. Kobor M.S. McMaster W.R. Leishmania donovani infection causes distinct epigenetic DNA methylation changes in host macrophages.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (25299267): e100441910.1371/journal.ppat.1004419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we found that the 125 sites linked to the group of 19 miRNAs identified in our study did not change in their methylation status in response to infection (confirmed by A. Marr et al.) 3A. K. Marr and W. R. McMaster, personal communication. (Fig. S4). This suggests that the transcription of pri-miRNA in infected cells was not inhibited by any changes in DNA methylation. Reduced transcription rates of pri-miRNAs in Leishmania-infected cells could have been due to aberrant activity of a transcription factor, and c-Myc was of particular interest. C-Myc has pleiotropic effects on cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, mediated by its ability to regulate—either positively or negatively—the expression of thousands of genes including many miRNAs (15.Tao J. Zhao X. Tao J. c-MYC–miRNA circuitry.Cell Cycle. 2014; 13 (24394940): 191-19810.4161/cc.27646Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Myc was shown to participate in the global down-regulation of miRNAs observed in lymphoma cells (11.Chang T.-C. Yu D. Lee Y.-S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Widespread microRNA repression by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis.Nat.

In regard to the miRNAs that have been shown to be repressed by c-Myc, 11 of them (highlighted in bold in Fig. 4A) belong to the group of 19 miRNAs that were down-regulated by Leishmania infection: let-7g, let-7d, let-7i, let-7a, let-7b, miR-223, miR-23a, miR-15a, miR-181a, miR-34a, and miR-98 (11.Chang T.-C.

Moreover, c-Myc is known to induce Drosha (17.Wang X. Zhao X. Gao P. Wu M. c-Myc modulates microRNA processing via the transcriptional regulation of Drosha.Sci. Rep. 2013; (23735886)10.1038/srep0194210.1038/srep01942Google Scholar), the expression of which was markedly up-regulated at 48 h postinfection (Fig. S3C). Finally, c-Myc plays a role in alternative activation of macrophages (18.Pello O.M. De Pizzol M. Mirolo M. Soucek L. Zammataro L. Amabile A. Doni A. Nebuloni M. Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. Mantovani A. Locati M.

Microbiol. 2012; 2 (22919674): 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Based upon these considerations, we investigated whether c-Myc might be responsible for the down-regulation of miRNAs observed in infected cells. Using Western blotting, we found that c-Myc was strongly up-regulated in infected cells, both at 24 and 48 h postinfection (Fig. 4B). c-Myc is a highly unstable protein and is regulated mostly through alterations of its stability (20.Sears R.C. The life cycle of c-myc: from synthesis to degradation.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3 (15467447): 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Using cycloheximide to block translation, we established that the stability of c-Myc is increased in infected cells, accounting at least in part for its increased abundance (Fig. 4C). To examine the possibility that c-Myc induction in infected cells could result in the repression of transcription, the levels of classical targets of c-Myc repression were assessed by RT–qPCR. c-Myc is known to repress transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A (p21CIP1/WAF1), CDKN1B (p27KIP1), and CDKN2B (p15INK4B) (21.Wu S.

Indeed, all three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were down-regulated in infected cells, consistent with c-Myc induction bringing about the down-regulation of c-Myc–repressed targets (Fig. S5, C–E).

https://openalex.org/W2808770954,"Slow motion scenes are ubiquitous in screen-based audiovisual media and are typically accompanied by emotional music. The strong effects of slow motion on observers are hypothetically related to heightened emotional states in which time seems to pass more slowly. These states are simulated in films and video clips, and seem to resemble such experiences in daily life. The current study investigated time perception and emotional response to media clips containing decelerated human motion, with or without music using psychometric and psychophysiological testing methods. Participants were presented with slow-motion scenes taken from commercial films, ballet and sports footage, as well as the same scenes converted to real-time. Results reveal that slow-motion scenes, compared to adapted real-time scenes, led to systematic underestimations of duration, lower perceived arousal but higher valence, lower respiration rates and smaller pupillary diameters. The presence of music compared to visual-only presentations strongly affected results in terms of higher accuracy in duration estimates, higher perceived arousal and valence, higher physiological activation and larger pupillary diameters, indicating higher arousal. Video genre affected responses in addition.

Music influences these experiences profoundly, thus strengthening the impact of stretched time in audiovisual media."
https://openalex.org/W2809587004,"Background This study analyzes the trajectories of antibiotic consumption using different indicators of patients’ socioeconomic status, category and age-group of physicians. Methods This study uses a pooled, cross-sectional, time series analysis. The data focus on 22 European countries from 2000 to 2014 and were obtained from the European Center for Disease and Control, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Eurostat and Global Economic Monitor. Results There are large variations in community and hospital use of antibiotics in European countries, and the consumption of antibiotics has remained stable over the years. This applies to the community (b = 0.07, p = 0.267, 95% -0.06, 0.19, b-squared <0.01, p = 0.813, 95% = -0.01, 0.02) as well as the hospital sector (b = -0.02; p = 0.450; CI 95% = -0.06, 0.03; b-squared <0.01; p = 0.396; CI95% = > -0.01, <0.01). Some socioeconomic variables, such as level of education, income, Gini index and unemployment, are not related to the rate of antibiotic use. The age-group of physicians and general practitioners is associated with the use of antibiotics in the hospital. An increase in the proportion of young doctors (<45 years old) leads to a significant increase in antibiotics consumption, and as the percentage of generalist practitioners increases, there use of antibiotics in hospitals decreases by 0.04 DDD/1000 inhabitants. Conclusions Understanding that age-groups and categories (general/specialist practitioners) of physicians may predict antibiotic consumption is potentially useful in defining more effective health care policies to reduce the inappropriate antibiotic use while promoting rational use."
https://openalex.org/W2809012466,"Background Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterized by overt inflammation of the intestine and is typically accompanied by symptoms of bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping. The Colonic Migrating Motor Complex (CMMC) directs the movement of colonic luminal contents over long distances. The tri-nitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) model of colitis causes inflammatory damage to enteric nerves, however it remains to be determined whether these changes translate to functional outcomes in CMMC activity. We aimed to visualize innate immune cell infiltration into the colon using two-photon laser scanning intra-vital microscopy, and to determine whether CMMC activity is altered in the tri-nitro benzene sulphonic (TNBS) model of colitis. Methods Epithelial barrier permeability was compared between TNBS treated and healthy control mice in-vitro and in-vivo. Innate immune activation was determined by ELISA, flow cytometry and by 2-photon intravital microscopy. The effects of TNBS treatment and IL-1β on CMMC function were determined using a specialized organ bath. Results TNBS colitis increased epithelial barrier permeability in-vitro and in-vivo. Colonic IL-1β concentrations, colonic and systemic CD11b+ cell infiltration, and the number of migrating CD11b+ cells on colonic blood vessels were all increased in TNBS treated mice relative to controls. CMMC frequency and amplitude were inhibited in the distal and mid colon of TNBS treated mice. CMMC activity was not altered by superfusion with IL-1β. Conclusions TNBS colitis damages the epithelial barrier and increases innate immune cell activation in the colon and systemically. Innate cell migration into the colon is readily identifiable by two-photon intra-vital microscopy. CMMC are inhibited by inflammation, but this is not due to direct effects of IL-1β."
https://openalex.org/W2809236358,"Immunization of pregnant women against seasonal influenza remains limited in low- and lower-middle-income countries despite being recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO/PATH Maternal Influenza Immunization Project was created to identify and address obstacles to delivering influenza vaccines to pregnant women in low resource setting. To gain a better understanding of potential demand from this target group, we developed a model simulating pregnant women populations eligible for vaccination during antenatal care (ANC) services in all low- and lower-middle-income countries. We assessed potential vaccine demand in the context of both seasonal and year-round vaccination strategies and identified the ways that immunization programs may be affected by availability gaps in supply linked to current vaccine production cycles and shelf life duration. Results of our analysis, which includes 54 eligible countries in 2015 for New Vaccine Support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, suggest the demand for influenza vaccines could be 7.7 to 16.0 million doses in 2020, and 27.0 to 61.7 million doses by 2029. If current trends in production capacity and actual production of seasonal influenza vaccines were to continue, global vaccine supply would be sufficient to meet this additional demand-although a majority of countries would face implementation issues linked to timing of supply."

We devised a three-phase program that ranged from providing students with a broad introduction to multiple career opportunities to immersive experiential learning in a specific career sector. Importantly, program content was developed and delivered by alumni and industry experts in five employment sectors-business/industry, communication, government, law/regulatory affairs, and undergraduate/PUI teaching-in partnership with WSU faculty. This article provides data on two notable outcomes: doctoral students participate equally in BEST activities regardless of gender, race, and citizenship status, and student participation in BEST activities did not correlate with lower GRE ratings, lower GPA, or increased time-to-degree. Further, a ""halo"" effect of the program is evidenced by participation of students from all disciplines, not just the biomedical sciences. Centralizing BEST activities within the Graduate School will allow faculty and individual programs to save resources and time."
https://openalex.org/W2809664446,"A common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia can influence glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. In diabetic patients, anemia occurs earlier and with higher severity over the course of CKD stages. To elucidate the effect of hemoglobin (Hb) on the predictive value of HbA1c, we enrolled 1558 diabetic patients with stages 3-4 CKD, categorized according to baseline Hb and HbA1c quartiles. Linear regression revealed that higher HbA1c correlated significantly with higher Hb in the Hb < 10 g/dL group (β = 0.146, P = 0.004). A fully-adjusted Cox regression model revealed worse clinical outcomes in patients with higher HbA1c quartiles in the Hb ≥ 10 g/dL group. Hazard ratios for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), all-cause mortality, and composite endpoint (cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality) in patients with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and the highest HbA1c quartile were 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.15), 1.76 (95% CI, 1.02-3.03), and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.03-2.31), respectively. By contrast, HbA1c was not associated with clinical outcomes in the Hb < 10 g/dL group. In conclusion, in stages 3-4 diabetic CKD, higher HbA1c is associated with a higher risk of poor clinical outcomes in patients with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL."
https://openalex.org/W2809059601,"Background Given the great efforts put into the strategic objective of reducing the proportion of HIV-infected patients that are undiagnosed, the aim of the present study was to review the temporal trends between 1997 and 2016 for median estimates of infection duration and median CD4 count at diagnosis for the main patient origins in French Guiana. Methods CD4 cell count at HIV sero-conversion and square root of CD4 cell decline were obtained using the CD4 decline in a cohort of HIV-infected persons in the UK, fitting random effect (slope and intercept) multilevel linear regression models. Multivariate analysis used robust regression for modeling the delay between estimated HIV seroconversion and diagnosis and quantile regression for CD4 at HIV diagnosis. Results The median interval between the estimated HIV seroconversion and HIV diagnosis was 8 years for patients fromBrazil, 4.5 years for those from Haiti, 6.6 years for those from Suriname, 3.3 years for patients from Guyana, and 3.1 years for French patients. A simple robust regression model with French patients as reference group adjusting for sex and age at the time of diagnosis showed that the interval was significantly longer for Brazilian (β = +3.7 years, P = 0.001), Surinamese (β = +4.2 years, P<0.0001), Haitian origins (β = +1.5 years, P = 0.049) but not for those originating from Guyana (β = -0.03 years, P = 0.9); Men independently had a longer interval than women (β = +3.5 years, P<0.0001). Conclusions Despite great efforts in French Guiana regarding HIV testing both in terms of diversification and intensification we still need to tailor the offer to better reach the communities in need. These results should help authorities scale up and optimize initiatives to reduce the proportion of patients who are unaware of their infection. They also raise the question of the role of stigma and discrimination as a barrier to HIV testing in small communities, and further emphasize the importance of reducing it."
https://openalex.org/W2809409350,"Regulators are now more often distinguishing between perceived good citizens and “bad actors” in stem cell and regenerative medicine clinical research, resulting in relatively more polar, carrot-and-stick oversight approaches. Here, I discuss why there may be too much carrot and not enough stick by regulators for effective enforcement. Regulators are now more often distinguishing between perceived good citizens and “bad actors” in stem cell and regenerative medicine clinical research, resulting in relatively more polar, carrot-and-stick oversight approaches. Here, I discuss why there may be too much carrot and not enough stick by regulators for effective enforcement. Regulatory oversight of clinical stem cell research critically impacts research progress as well as prospective patients, but for years regulators across the globe have struggled to find a “sweet spot” for oversight. Potentially too little oversight could result in harm to patients who might go to unproven stem cell clinics (Lau et al., 2008Lau D. Ogbogu U. Taylor B. Stafinski T. Menon D. Caulfield T. Stem cell clinics online: the direct-to-consumer portrayal of stem cell medicine.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) or participate in clinical trials that regulators should not have permitted, while too much oversight could impede promising clinical research. More recently, regulators have been utilizing a binary approach to more actively facilitate the path forward for perceived good citizens pursuing promising clinical research, and on the other end of the spectrum, to take strong regulatory action against marketing of risky, unapproved stem cell interventions such as those sold by many for-profit clinics. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the new administration has recently taken this carrot-and-stick kind of approach. Despite taking some action on unproven clinics in 2017–2018, the FDA is simultaneously moving in a markedly different direction on stem cells. In an unprecedented step, the FDA is accelerating a relatively large number of investigational stem cell and regenerative medicine therapies through the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation in response to the 21st Century Cures Act or “Cures.” Although not an FDA-initiated program, the agency is enthusiastic about the RMAT effort. As of June 2018, the FDA had already granted approximately 20 RMAT designations to a range of stem cell and regenerative medicine sponsors (as detailed in a June 13, 2018 resource page on The Niche site), an unusually rapid implementation of a new program. The firms that have received RMATs are mostly small-to-medium-sized biotechs with FDA-compliant, investigational new drug (IND)-based pipelines. The agency has widened the scope for products that can receive an RMAT designation to also include combined cell-gene therapy products even if they do not involve stem cells. The speedy RMAT implementation and its wider-than-expected inclusiveness starkly contrast with the past time-consuming oversight process. In its history, the FDA only rarely granted speedier review mechanisms such as Breakthrough Therapy designation or Fast Track review to a stem cell product. The reasons why the new RMAT designations have been so rapidly and broadly awarded are not entirely clear. The eligibility criteria for accelerating review for the older programs can be extensive. For example, to receive a Fast Track review there are sizable requirements for sponsors including submission of initial data demonstrating concrete signs of efficacy and safety (FDA announcement ucm405399). In contrast, the criteria are more limited for RMATs, making the rationales for decisions on specific RMAT applications somewhat nebulous (FDA announcement ucm537670). Even so, since the FDA has reported that approximately two-thirds of RMAT applications have been rejected so far, the agency must be utilizing some evaluation criteria even if mostly internally. Furthermore, despite the unprecedented speed and size of the new RMAT program, the agency has notably not granted an RMAT to a known for-profit, unproven clinic firm. Overall, the striking speed and scope of granted RMAT designations likely reflects a change in agency philosophy to provide more carrots to what it perceives as good citizens with adequate preliminary data. Although the agency was in a general sense required by Cures to adopt some kind of RMAT-like program, it is possible that its surprisingly enthusiastic approach to compliance with this law has overly lowered the bar, overshooting from too little acceleration of investigational stem cell therapies in the past to too much now. As much as accelerated oversight is generally positively characterized, the RMAT “carrot” could lead to problems. For example, via RMATs, the FDA may be advancing weaker IND-based stem cell-related trials with less data behind them overall, creating new risks. In turn, such a situation could eat up limited FDA resources as well as raise risks for patients. Since the RMAT program is a regulatory experiment, the final verdict on its utility will have to await data on its trial outcomes. If a significant number of RMAT trials lead to stem cell-based drugs ultimately proven safe and effective, then we can view the overall program as a success, but another possibility is that RMATs will be no more successful than stem cell-related trials more generally, and RMAT trials could even have higher rates of adverse events given their accelerated path. The Cures law and RMAT program were somewhat inspired by the already existing, relatively permissive Japanese oversight system specifically for regenerative medicine product development. While the Japanese approach to stem cell oversight is still evolving and regulators there appear to be fine-tuning their system (Sipp and Okano, 2018Sipp D. Okano H. Japan Strengthens Regenerative Medicine Oversight.Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), there is concern that the top priorities are the speed of bench-to-beside translation and commercialization, potentially at the expense of rigorous oversight. Recently, the manner in which a new induced pluripotent stem cell-based trial for heart disease was accelerated raised fresh concerns about this Japanese carrot for stem cells (Editorial, 2018Editorial Stem-cell tests must show success.Nature. 2018; 557: 611-612Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As regulators seek to advance promising stem cell therapies being developed and tested in a compliant manner, they also must deal with the for-profit, unproven stem cell clinic arena. In past years, there has been relatively little oversight action on clinics. Part of the challenge may have been the rapid emergence of the clinic industry, both in the U.S and more globally (Berger et al., 2016Berger I. Ahmad A. Bansal A. Kapoor T. Sipp D. Rasko J.E.J. Global Distribution of Businesses Marketing Stem Cell-Based Interventions.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 158-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Turner and Knoepfler, 2016Turner L. Knoepfler P. Selling Stem Cells in the USA: Assessing the Direct-to-Consumer Industry.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 154-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The rapid change was not accompanied contemporaneously by proportionate FDA or other regulatory body action. More recently, concrete evidence of adverse events has emerged including the reported blinding of a number of clinic customers (Rong et al., 2018Rong A.J. Lam B.L. Ansari Z.A. Albini T.A. Vision Loss Secondary to Autologous Adipose Stem Cell Injections: A Rising Problem.JAMA Ophthalmol. 2018; 136: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), increasing pressure on the FDA to take action. The FDA under new Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has addressed this growing threat with a series of bold public statements. Remarkably, in 2017 Gottlieb went so far as to vaguely but publicly refer to some clinics as “bad actors” (FDA press announcement ucm573443). This unprecedented outspokenness early in Gottlieb’s tenure greatly raised expectations for what some have characterized as an impending “crackdown” on non-compliant clinics. The FDA has also recently taken some notable actions, most prominently filing suit in May 2018 against two clinic firms—California Stem Cell Treatment Center (CSCTC) and U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. (USRM)–seeking permanent injunctions on their use of unapproved stem cell therapies (FDA press announcement ucm607257). In addition to the lawsuits, during Gottlieb’s tenure the agency has issued two warning letters to clinic-related firms including USRM. The FDA also stated that it had U.S. Marshals seize smallpox vaccine from CSCTC and another firm, which were reportedly mixing it with stem cells for unauthorized, experimental clinical use. Another important factor is that CSCTC appears to effectively be the flagship for the clinic chain Cell Surgical Network (CSN), which has around 100 affiliated stem cell clinics and was also named as a defendant in the FDA lawsuit seeking injunction on CSCTC, greatly increasing the potential impact of the single FDA legal action in this case. The FDA has also indicated that CSCTC, CSN, and USRM clinics have been marketing unapproved drugs based on adipose stem cells. In a finalized guidance in late 2017, the FDA indicated that adipose stem cells will likely be considered biological drugs requiring full premarket drug approval since they are inherently more than minimally manipulated. Furthermore, the agency has said that clinical use of adipose stem cells for a wide range of health conditions, including many that are in no concrete way related specifically to diseased fat tissue (a marketing practice of both USRM and CSCTC/CSN), invokes a second trigger of drug classification called non-homologous use, which is yet another potential impetus for the federal suits since these firms lack needed FDA approvals. Finally, USRM and CSN have reportedly had patients experience severe adverse events in the form of eye damage and vision loss following administration of unapproved adipose stem cells, adding to potential health risks of the practices in question. As much as these agency actions in 2017–2018 collectively represent somewhat greater FDA activity than in past years and could be just the beginning of a phase of sustained higher activity, we are far from witnessing a crackdown so far given that there are as many as 700 unproven, for-profit stem cell clinics in the U.S. today. Furthermore, due to what it calls a lack of “bandwidth,” the FDA has stated its intention to generally not pursue many potential instances of non-compliance such as marketing of adipose stem cells for certain orthopedic uses (See New York Times article “F.D.A. Moves to Stop Rogue Clinics From Using Unapproved Stem Cell Therapies” published on May 9, 2018). Too little “stick” in the form of this kind of agency tolerance of non-compliance both raises risks for patients and could weaken the FDA’s effective authority more broadly. The FDA seemingly could have the ability to take much larger-scale actions on stem cell clinics if it had the will to do so since it has taken such actions on other fronts. For example, in 2018, it reportedly issued 40 warning letters largely at once to e-cigarette makers. A key point to watch will be how the suit against CSN proceeds and whether it widely impacts that network’s approximately 100 member clinics or just mainly CSCTC. A number of other factors are coming into play that may substantially affect oversight of stem cells. In May 2018, the U.S. Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) issued a final policy report on stem cell therapies with a major emphasis on stem cell clinic practices (see the FSMB’s Regenerative and Stem Cell Therapy Practices, adopted as policy by the FSMB in April 2018). The FSMB report includes a number of recommendations for both individual state medical boards and physicians specifically related to marketing of non-FDA-approved stem cell therapies. Given the very low level of medical board activity in the past on stem cell clinics, it is possible that the report will generate little substantive change moving forward, but alternatively it may spark increased activity. In part because unlike the FDA, state medical boards directly regulate physicians and have the power to rapidly suspend or even revoke licensure, physicians may take medical board recommendations more seriously. Recent rapid action by the North Dakota Attorney General on patient complaints about a stem cell clinic is a clear example of how boards can have a striking impact (see the West Fargo Pioneer article “ND stem cell clinic to halt injections, repay patients” published on May 2, 2018). At the state level, there are also trends toward increased legislative activity related to stem cell clinics. As of 2018, a new California law requires clinics to post patient notices informing them of important information including the non-FDA-approved status of their offerings. Legislators in both Washington state and Florida proposed similar bills. While the former became state law as of March 2018, the Florida bill died before a vote but could be revived. In contrast to these bills, a new Texas law seems more focused on creating a friendly environment for clinic firms in that state. There also have been an increasing number of patient lawsuits against stem cell clinics. The impacts of these lawsuits on the clinic industry and the regulatory sphere remain to be seen but could be substantial (Horner et al., 2018Horner C. Tenenbaum E. Sipp D. Master Z. Can civil lawsuits stem the tide of direct-to-consumer marketing of unproven stem cell interventions.NPJ Regen Med. 2018; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The FDA suits for injunctions against clinics may catalyze additional lawsuits by patients against clinic firms, increasing impact. Clinics have also become more aggressive in how they market their offerings including via supposed educational seminars that actually function as customer recruitment events (Knoepfler, 2017Knoepfler P.S. The Stem Cell Hard Sell: Report from a Clinic’s Patient Recruitment Seminar.Stem Cells Transl. Med. 2017; 6: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and via mainstream media. In addition, clinics are still using Clinicaltrials.gov as a marketing tool given the lack of effective screening of candidate listings (Turner, 2017Turner L. ClinicalTrials.gov, stem cells and ‘pay-to-participate’ clinical studies.Regen. Med. 2017; 12: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the site has implemented a disclaimer statement on all listings, this is not enough. Stem cell scientists should continue to lobby the NIH to have Clinicaltrials.gov more strictly oversee candidate listings and remove potential predatory clinic listings. Beyond the U.S. and Japan, there are indications of potentially similar trends in other countries. In Canada, there are signs of an expanding direct-to-consumer stem cell clinic industry taking hold (Ogbogu et al., 2018Ogbogu U. Du J. Koukio Y. The involvement of Canadian physicians in promoting and providing unproven and unapproved stem cell interventions.BMC Med. Ethics. 2018; 19: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that regulators will need to address. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), largely similar to the FDA, has new rules that will take effect in July 2018 including a definition of adipose stem cells as drugs requiring premarket approval. In India, authorities have new draft rules for cell and tissue therapies in 2018, and there has been discussion of a crackdown on clinics. There are a number of emerging challenges and potential hurdles to oversight of both traditional clinical-trial-based stem cell research and the activities of for-profit clinics. As to the latter, firms that are defendants in the FDA suits appear to be prepared for potentially lengthy legal battles and in theory they could prevail, although past precedent makes that relatively unlikely. It is also doubtful that the clinic firms will voluntarily shut down their practices while the case is pending. Rapid marketing expansion of dubious amniotic stem cell offerings and for-profit, non-homologous use of bone marrow stem cells for unrelated health issues represent emerging challenges for the agency as well. Additional kinds of carrots and sticks could prove useful for the FDA and other regulators, but they each come with their own risks. For example, as to carrots, the FDA could go even further than RMATs to a conditional approval system akin to the Japanese approach, but this would increase risks. As to sticks, the FDA has the authority to pursue criminal charges against parties including potentially specific for-profit clinics that allegedly violate the law such as by introducing unapproved drugs into interstate commerce. However, whether for civil or criminal cases, should the FDA not prevail in court there is the potential for harmful precedents. Another potential wildcard is the new national Right-To-Try law in the U.S., which weakens FDA authority in some ways. As regulatory experiments on stem cell oversight continue globally in various forms, we can look to specific outcomes as measures of what can be viewed as generally successful oversight. Such indicators include, on the one hand, examples of newly approved stem cell therapies demonstrated to be safe and effective, although admittedly this is very dependent on the quality of the clinical science and that is mostly out of regulatory control, and on the other, data documenting reductions in the numbers of for-profit clinics, comparing new data to the recently published data on clinics. Successful oversight systems for stem cells will ideally achieve both kinds of outcomes to some degree. It is unclear at this time whether carrot, stick, or combined carrot-and-stick oversight approaches will most effectively yield optimal outcomes. However, at present there is too much carrot, particularly with RMATs in the U.S. as well as conditional approval in Japan, and too little stick in the way of enforcement action for the clinic industry that likely exceeds 1,000 clinics globally selling unproven stem cell-related interventions. Biomedical data from trials and more data from studies of for-profit clinics together will help point the way forward and be instructive for course corrections along the way toward a future “sweet spot” of oversight.

https://openalex.org/W2808731754,"Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. It is also a dynamic contributor to poverty through its effects on children’s cognitive development. This paper examines the degree to which malaria in early childhood impacts on educational achievement in later childhood. The substantial decline in malaria in the region over recent years allows an assessment of its impact to be made. Focusing on Tanzania, we combine data from the Malaria Atlas Project and the 2010–2014 Uwezo household surveys (N = 246,325). We relate the district-level risk of malaria in a child’s year of birth to his/her performance in tests of acquired cognitive skills (literacy and numeracy). For causal identification, we rely on differences across districts in the pace of decline in malaria prevalence occurring over the last 15 years. We control for time-invariant district level, age, birth cohort and survey year effects, as well as district-level trends and individual and household-specific factors. In addition, we use sibling variation in birth-year exposure to malaria to strengthen our identification. A ten percentage-point decrease in malaria prevalence in birth year is associated with a 0.06 standard deviation (p = 0.000) increase in English literacy achievement. This estimate is comparable in magnitude to education intervention programs with very large effects. Our results are robust to a large number of sensitivity analyses. We find no statistically significant effects of birth-year malaria exposure on attainments in numeracy and Kiswahili, and we argue that this is probably attributable to strong ceiling effects in these test scores. We conclude that in Tanzania malaria is an important factor in geographical variation in English literacy. This indicates that malaria is a significant public health challenge to educational achievement in this country, and probably in other regions with malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2809248872,"NK-4 is the main component of the antiallergic drug Lumin, which has been in popular usage since the early 1950s. In this study, we examined whether NK-4 exerts a regulatory effect on the activation and effector function of Th2 cells. NK-4 inhibited IL-4 production by anti-CD3ε mAb-stimulated BALB/c mouse spleen cells, whereas NK-4 had little effect on IFN-γ production. IL-4 and IL-5 secretion by anti-CD3ε mAb- or antigen-stimulated Th2 cells (D10.G4.1) was abrogated by NK-4 without affecting cell numbers, whereas IFN-γ secretion by activated Th1 cells was unchanged. Mechanistic analysis revealed that NK-4 inhibited mRNA expression of the Th2-associated transcription factors GATA-3 and NFATc1 in anti-CD3ε mAb-stimulated D10.G4.1 cells. Regarding the regulation of Th2 cell effector functions, NK-4 inhibited the secretion of eotaxin and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) by normal human dermal fibroblasts in response to IL-4 and/or TNF-α. NK-4 achieved TARC attenuation comparable to what is observed with suplatast tosilate, an antiallergic drug that selectively inhibits Th2 cytokine production, at 14-fold lower concentrations of suplatast tosilate. Dexamethasone increased TARC production by 2.2- to 2.6-fold of control cultures. NK-4 successfully inhibited the STAT6 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential mechanism for down-regulating chemokines expression. In addition, NK-4 abrogated IL-4-driven modulation of cytokine production profile in human monocytic THP-1 cells from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory response, as seen in the inverted ratio of TNF-α to IL-10 produced in response to LPS. These results suggest that NK-4 could prevent IL-4-driven polarization to alternatively activated macrophages, which are proposed to have pathogenic roles in allergic asthma. The importance of Th2 cytokines and chemokines in the development and progression of type 2 inflammatory disorders has been highlighted by recent advance in our understanding the immunological mechanism underlying allergic disease. Our results support the use of NK-4 as a reasonable therapeutic option to alleviate Th2-mediated allergic inflammation."

We measure minimal detectable signal power, sensitivity to noise power changes and computational complexity using an experimental setup that covers typical capabilities from low-cost embedded to high-end software defined radio devices. Presented results validate our premise that a unified methodology is valuable in obtaining reliable and reproducible comparisons of signal detection methods."
https://openalex.org/W2809465997,"A required step for presenting results of clinical studies is the declaration of participants demographic and baseline characteristics as claimed by the FDAAA 801. The common workflow to accomplish this task is to export the clinical data from the used electronic data capture system and import it into statistical software like SAS software or IBM SPSS. This software requires trained users, who have to implement the analysis individually for each item. These expenditures may become an obstacle for small studies. Objective of this work is to design, implement and evaluate an open source application, called ODM Data Analysis, for the semi-automatic analysis of clinical study data.The system requires clinical data in the CDISC Operational Data Model format. After uploading the file, its syntax and data type conformity of the collected data is validated. The completeness of the study data is determined and basic statistics, including illustrative charts for each item, are generated. Datasets from four clinical studies have been used to evaluate the application's performance and functionality.The system is implemented as an open source web application (available at https://odmanalysis.uni-muenster.de) and also provided as Docker image which enables an easy distribution and installation on local systems. Study data is only stored in the application as long as the calculations are performed which is compliant with data protection endeavors. Analysis times are below half an hour, even for larger studies with over 6000 subjects.Medical experts have ensured the usefulness of this application to grant an overview of their collected study data for monitoring purposes and to generate descriptive statistics without further user interaction. The semi-automatic analysis has its limitations and cannot replace the complex analysis of statisticians, but it can be used as a starting point for their examination and reporting."
https://openalex.org/W2809396952,"Hypotension or low blood pressure (BP) is a common problem in preterm neonates and has been associated with adverse short and long-term neurological outcomes. Deciding when and whether to treat hypotension relies on an understanding of the relationship between BP and brain functioning. This study aims to investigate the interaction (coupling) between BP and continuous multichannel unedited EEG recordings in preterm infants less than 32 weeks of gestational age. The EEG was represented by spectral power in four frequency sub-bands: 0.3–3 Hz, 3–8 Hz, 8–15 Hz and 15–30 Hz. BP was represented as mean arterial pressure (MAP). The level of coupling between the two physiological systems was estimated using linear and nonlinear methods such as correlation, coherence and mutual information. Causality of interaction was measured using transfer entropy. The illness severity was represented by the clinical risk index for babies (CRIB II score) and contrasted to the computed level of interaction. It is shown here that correlation and coherence, which are linear measures of the coupling between EEG and MAP, do not correlate with CRIB values, whereas adjusted mutual information, a nonlinear measure, is associated with CRIB scores (r = -0.57, p = 0.003). Mutual information is independent of the absolute values of MAP and EEG powers and quantifies the level of coupling between the short-term dynamics in both signals. The analysis indicated that the dominant causality is from changes in EEG producing changes in MAP. Transfer entropy (EEG to MAP) is associated with the CRIB score (0.3–3 Hz: r = 0.428, p = 0.033, 3–8 Hz: r = 0.44, p = 0.028, 8–15 Hz: r = 0.416, p = 0.038) and indicates that a higher level of directed coupling from brain activity to blood pressure is associated with increased illness in preterm infants. This is the first study to present the nonlinear measure of interaction between brain activity and blood pressure and to demonstrate its relation to the initial illness severity in the preterm infant. The obtained results allow us to hypothesise that the normal wellbeing of a preterm neonate can be characterised by a nonlinear coupling between brain activity and MAP, whereas the presence of weak coupling with distinctive directionality of information flow is associated with an increased mortality rate in preterms."
https://openalex.org/W2809582142,"There are many heavy oil reservoirs in offshore oilfields in China. Steam and multiple thermal fluid stimulation technologies are of increasing interest and have been applied to an increasing number of projects. During the stimulation or displacement of heavy oil reservoirs during thermal recovery, several factors, such as reservoir heterogeneity, are prone to cause channeling phenomena and affect the thermal recovery effect of steam stimulation. According to the unique requirements for the stimulation of multiple thermal fluids for offshore heavy oil, this study used transmission, blocking and relieving, heat resistance and a comprehensive evaluation of parallel sand tube experiments to conduct a screening evaluation of plugging systems for the stimulation of multiple thermal fluids, screen out a commonly used plugging agent in the current stage and propose corresponding guidance for the selection basis. The results show that foam, gel, foam gel and temperature-sensitive gel systems have a good transmission performance, whereas the oil sludge exhibits a poorer performance. The phenolic resin system exhibits great plugging properties, followed by oily sludge, temperature-sensitive gel, gel, foam gel and foam. Considering about washing resistance properties, phenolic resin system shows the best quality, followed by oily sludge and temperature-sensitive gel. The oily sludge system brings the best performance in plugging a high-permeability channel than phenolic resin gel and temperature-sensitive gel."
https://openalex.org/W2809670439,"During visual exploration or free-view, gaze positioning is largely determined by the tendency to maximize visual saliency: more salient locations are more likely to be fixated. However, when visual input is completely irrelevant for performance, such as with non-visual tasks, this saliency maximization strategy may be less advantageous and potentially even disruptive for task-performance. Here, we examined whether visual saliency remains a strong driving force in determining gaze positions even in non-visual tasks. We tested three alternative hypotheses: a) That saliency is disadvantageous for non-visual tasks and therefore gaze would tend to shift away from it and towards non-salient locations; b) That saliency is irrelevant during non-visual tasks and therefore gaze would not be directed towards it but also not away-from it; c) That saliency maximization is a strong behavioral drive that would prevail even during non-visual tasks.Gaze position was monitored as participants performed visual or non-visual tasks while they were presented with complex or simple images. The effect of attentional demands was examined by comparing an easy non-visual task with a more difficult one.Exploratory behavior was evident, regardless of task difficulty, even when the task was non-visual and the visual input was entirely irrelevant. The observed exploratory behaviors included a strong tendency to fixate salient locations, central fixation bias and a gradual reduction in saliency for later fixations. These exploratory behaviors were spatially similar to those of an explicit visual exploration task but they were, nevertheless, attenuated. Temporal differences were also found: in the non-visual task there were longer fixations and later first fixations than in the visual task, reflecting slower visual sampling in this task.We conclude that in the presence of a rich visual environment, visual exploration is evident even when there is no explicit instruction to explore. Compared to visually motivated tasks, exploration in non-visual tasks follows similar selection mechanisms, but occurs at a lower rate. This is consistent with the view that the non-visual task is the equivalent of a dual-task: it combines the instructed task with an uninstructed, perhaps even mandatory, exploratory behavior."

In this study, we report that ARL11 is endogenously expressed in mouse and human macrophages and regulates their activation in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Accordingly, depletion of ARL11 impaired both LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages and their ability to control intracellular replication of Salmonella. LPS-stimulated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was substantially compromised in Arl11-silenced macrophages. Full-Text PDF Open Access Although sequencing of the human genome provided a comprehensive map of human biology, it also uncovered the existence of vast uncharted genetic regions within our chromosomes. Further exploration of an uncharted region on chromosome 13 led to the discovery of ARL11, a small GTPase encoded by ARLTS1 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like tumor suppressor gene 1). In recent years, accumulating evidence implicates ARL11 as a tumor suppressor gene due to its ability to promote caspase-dependent apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines and solid tumors (1Yendamuri S.

Furthermore, it is well-established that genetic deletions and/or mutations in ARLTS1 are associated with increased familial cancer risk, and down-regulation via promoter hypermethylation is commonly observed in cancer types including breast, lung, colorectal, liver, and prostate, to name a few (2Calin G.A.

Despite its well-established role in cancer, ARL11 is also expressed in a variety of tissues for which its role is not yet understood. Homologues of ARL11 are highly conserved across species, such as zebrafish, mouse, rat, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis, suggesting that it has important cellular functions (3Yendamuri S. Trapasso F.

Given the prevalence of ARL11 expression in tissues known to play a role in the immune system, Arya et al. (5Arya S.B. Kumar G. Kaur H. Kaur A. Tuli A.

Indeed, the authors observed that ARL11 mRNA levels were expressed in several immune cell types, predominantly in macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils.

To test whether ARL11 expression is altered by TLR4-mediated pathogen detection, Arya et al. (5Arya S.B. Kumar G. Kaur H. Kaur A. Tuli A. ARL11 regulates lipopolysacchride-stimulated macrophage activation by promoting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.J. Biol.

To confirm the importance of this gene in macrophage activation, the authors used siRNA and short hairpin RNA to knock down ARL11 in a second mouse macrophage cell line. This led to changes in several known markers of activation, including a reduction in morphological changes, a lower capacity for Escherichia coli phagocytosis, and decreased production of pro-inflammatory markers, including the cytokines TNFα and IL-6 as well as nitric oxide.

The authors observed that knockdown of ARL11 in two macrophage cell lines led to a significant reduction in LPS-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinases, but not JNK1/2. Infection with Salmonella bacteria showed a similar effect: The abundance of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 were increased to a significantly greater extent in controls than in cells depleted of ARL11. Furthermore, the ability to block Salmonella replication was significantly greater in control cells. In contrast, ARL11 overexpression led to the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 in an LPS-independent manner, a result that was also observed in HeLa cells despite the absence of endogenous ARL11 expression in this cell line. As a key control, the authors also observed that this result was not recapitulated with other members of the Arl family. Finally, Arya et al. (5Arya S.B. Kumar G. Kaur H. Kaur A. Tuli A. ARL11 regulates lipopolysacchride-stimulated macrophage activation by promoting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.J. Biol.

Several key observations make the new results from Arya et al. (5Arya S.B. Kumar G. Kaur H. Kaur A. Tuli A.

Given that most studies utilize ARL11 ectopic/overexpression models, this report is among the first to study the function of endogenous ARL11. Indeed, it is known that prolonged ERK1/2 activation, as observed in the authors' overexpression experiments, leads to apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Thus, this study issues a call to scientists in the field to study ARL11 at endogenous concentrations to truly understand its physiological role. The study also defines new directions for future work on this intriguing protein. For example, although ARL11 and ERK1/2 could be co-immunoprecipitated, the authors indicate that a yeast two-hybrid screen did not support a direct interaction. What other factors might be involved in this complex, and how do phosphorylation and actin influence their interaction? And how does ARL11 promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation? Does ARL11 play a direct role in the p38 cascade? Additionally, this work defines a novel role of a putative tumor suppressor gene in immunological function and suggests that inhibition thereof may be used as a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Finally, the identification of a novel modulator of the most well-studied macrophage-activating intracellular kinases, MAPKs, demonstrates that well-established cellular pathways still harbor unexplored frontiers."
