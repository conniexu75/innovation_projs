https://openalex.org/W2136687007,"Abstract A method has been developed which separates nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of spheroplasts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this method it has been shown that newly formed ribosomal RNA is found in native cytoplasmic subunits before passing to the polysomes. Furthermore, the final cleavage step which converts 20 S ribosomal precursor RNA to the mature 18 S ribosomal RNA takes place in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1571211852,Polyadenylate sequences are found covalently linked to yeast mRNA molecules. The poly(A) sequences are relatively homogeneous in size and have an average chain length of about 50 residues. They are located at the 3′ end of the mRNA molecule. Our data suggest that some mRNA molecules may not contain poly(A) sequences and that no poly(A) sequences are present in rRNA. The occurrence of poly(A) sequences in the mRNA molecules of mammals and yeast suggests that this may be a general feature of eucaryotic organisms.

https://openalex.org/W1545118930,"The modification methylase of Escherichia coli B has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme can exist in several forms, each possessing two nonidentical polypeptides, β and γ, of molecular weights of 60,000 and 55,000, respectively. Freshly isolated enzyme has the structure β1γ1, but upon storage at neutral pH and low salt, it disproportionates, producing another form, β3γ1. Treatment at pH 5 converts the mixture of β3γ1 and β1γ1 to a mixture of β1γ1 and another form β2γ1, whereas exposure to high salt breaks down the β3γ1 structure. The enzyme is inhibited by S-adenosylethionine and 5′-methylthioadenosine, but not by S-adenosylhomocysteine. None of these compounds can replace the required cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine. The enzyme can methylate a wide variety of DNAs, but not DNA produced by E. coli B."

https://openalex.org/W1568352573,"Abstract CDP-diglyceride synthesized by chemical procedures is an efficient donor of phosphatidyl residues for the enzymatic synthesis of phospholipids in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli. However, prior to the present work, CDP-diglyceride had never been isolated from living cells of E. coli or any other organism. We have, therefore, isolated and characterized the cytosine-containing liponucleotide fraction of E. coli and find it to be a mixture of almost equal amounts of CDP-diglyceride and dCDP-diglyceride. In these experiments, cells growing in the log phase were simultaneously labeled with tritiated cytosine and sn-glycero-3-[32P]phosphate. Under the conditions employed sn-glycero-3-[32P]phosphate was taken up without prior hydrolysis and was rapidly converted to labeled lipids. Since the intracellular pools of phosphatidic acid and of cytosine liponucleotides are very small and turn over very rapidly, the amounts of 32P in these fractions may be assumed to reflect their relative intracellular concentrations. The 32P radioactivity of the phosphatidic acid fraction was about 20 times higher than that of the cytosine liponucleotide fraction. Since phosphatidic acid is itself less than 1% of the lipids of E. coli, the steady state levels of the cytosine liponucleotides must be exceedingly low, supporting the hypothesis that the conversion of phosphatidic acid to cytosine liponucleotides may be rate-making for the biosynthesis of the membrane phospholipids in this organism. The relative activity of CDP-diglyceride and of dCDP-diglyceride for the enzymatic synthesis of phosphatidylserine and of phosphatidylglycerophosphate was found to vary considerably with the concentration of liponucleotide used in the assay system. At concentrations greater than 0.1 mm, dCDP-diglyceride is relatively much more active in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerophosphate than in the synthesis of phosphatidylserine. Below this concentration, however, dCDP-diglyceride is a more effective substrate in both reactions. The specificity of these enzymes for other nucleotides was studied with synthetic UDP-diglyceride, ADP-diglyceride, and GDP-diglyceride. The non-cytosine derivatives were found to have low, but measurable, activity as phosphatidyl donors for the enzymatic synthesis of phospholipids in extracts of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1531684441,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of the center of the argininelysine-rich histone (residues 30 to 81) from calf thymus has been determined. This sequence completes the structure of the whole histone by overlapping the 29-residue amino-terminal fragment (Olson, M. O. J., Sugano, N., Yeoman, L. C., Johnson, B. R., Jordan, J., Starbuck, W. C., and Busch, H. (1972) Physiol. Chem. Phys., 4, 10–16) and the 48-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment (Sugano, N., Olson, M. O. J., Yeoman, L. C., Johnson, B. R., Taylor, C. W., Starbuck, W. C., and Busch, H. (1972) J. Biol. Chem., 247, 3589–3591). The complete sequence of the arginine-lysine-rich histone is: [see PDF for equation] Clusters of basic, acidic, and hydrophobic residues were found in this sequence. The basic clusters are underlined. An acidic cluster was observed in the carboxyl-terminal fragment (residues 90 to 93). A very hydrophobic region was present in the sequence from residue 49 to 55. No modified amino acids were found with the exception of the acetylated amino terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1598024248,"Abstract A temperature-sensitive unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph was used to demonstrate that the fabA gene of Escherichia coli is the structual gene for the β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase studied by Bloch and co-workers. This mutant, which requires an exogenous source of unsaturated fatty acid for growth at temperatures above 36°, possesses a dehydrase activity of greatly increased thermolability. Analysis of fab+ and fab- transductants and of fab+ revertants indicate that the temperature-sensitive dehydrase activity is responsible for the growth phenotype of this strain. This mutant was then used for an estimation of the minimum amount of unsaturated fatty acid needed for growth. Due to its temperature-sensitive phenotype, at semipermissive temperatures the strain grows at a subnormal rate due to a reduced rate of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Under such conditions, a minimum amount of unsaturated fatty acid is reached which is 15 to 20% of the total phospholipid fatty acid. No marked accumulation of short chain saturated fatty acids is seen during growth at semipermissive temperatures. A similar study with another strain showed that the minimum content of unsaturated fatty acid needed for growth is largely independent of the ratio of palmitoleate to cis-vaccenate in the phospholipids. These results are discussed in terms of the role of unsaturated fatty acids in membrane structure and function and also in terms of the control of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1523972178,"Abstract The ribosome inhibitor chloramphenicol brings about a rapid disappearance of ppGpp in both RC+ and RC- cells, suggesting that the antibiotic inhibits the synthesis of ppGpp. The kinetics of ppGpp decay in the presence of chloramphenicol agrees well with the kinetics of ppGpp accumulation, in the antibiotic's absence, both in RC+ cells subjected to amino acid starvation and in RC- cells subjected to carbon source downshift. In the latter case, a reduction in the rate of ppGpp degradation accounts for the accumulation of ppGpp. Thus, although RC- mutants cannot adjust the rate of ppGpp synthesis in response to amino acid starvation, they retain the ability to adjust the rate of ppGpp degradation in response to carbon source downshift. The latter control mechanism may account for the fact that the ppGpp level during balanced growth varies, in both RC+ and RC- cells, from one growth medium to another in relation to the growth rate which the medium will support. The fact that chloramphenicol inhibits ppGpp formation in RC- as well as RC+ cells suggests, for reasons discussed, that the antibiotic inhibits ppGpp synthesis directly."
https://openalex.org/W1518848487,"Abstract Carbamyl phosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli, which is composed of a light and a heavy subunit, is inhibited with respect to its glutamine-dependent reactions by treatment with l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloro[5-14C]pentanoic acid. This glutamine analog reacts with a glutamine- or albizziinprotectable site on the light subunit to yield an enzyme covalently linked to a 4-oxo[14C]norvaline moiety. The molar ratio of bound 14C to the light subunit is close to unity; some binding also occurs on the heavy subunit, but this is noninhibitory. The chloroketone-treated enzyme exhibits increased ATPase activity and a decreased apparent Km value for NH4Cl. Mg++ATP protects the enzyme significantly against chloroketone; allosteric effectors (ornithine, IMP, UMP) offer little or no protection. After reaction of the enzyme with the chloroketone, the enzyme was treated with performic acid and then subjected to acid hydrolysis; S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteine was isolated from such hydrolysates of the labeled enzyme and the isolated labeled light subunit. This evidence indicates that the chloroketone reacts with a sulfhydryl group at the glutamine site of the light subunit. This sulfhydryl group does not react with N-ethylmaleimide at neutral pH which suggests that it is buried. The protective effect of Mg++ATP against chloroketone, the increase in ATPase activity on treatment with chloroketone, and the decreased apparent Km for NH4Cl may reflect functional intersubunit interactions associated with the binding of glutamine and ATP to the light and heavy subunits, respectively, in the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2019332941,"The effects of cannabis and alcohol on simulated car driving were studied. Cannabis resin containing 4 percent Delta(1)-tetrahydrocannabinol was administered orally in three doses equivalent to 8, 12, and 16 milligrams of that component. Alcohol was given orally in one standard dose of 70 grams. Both cannabis and alcohol increased the time required to brake and start, whereas alcohol increased while cannabis decreased the number of gear changes. An effect of dosage on response was observed with cannabis."
https://openalex.org/W2112984699,"Abstract Treatment of Escherichia coli formylmethionine tRNA with sodium bisulfite at 25° results in the conversion of 6 cytidine (C) residues to uridine (U) residues and loss of amino acid acceptor activity. Separation of active and inactive molecules following modification to the extent of 57% loss of activity has shown that C → U base changes in the dihydrouridine loop and at the 5' terminus have no effect on aminoacylation or formylation of tRNAfmet. Conversion of the cytidine residue in the anticodon to a uridine residue causes complete loss of methionine acceptor activity. In addition, deamination of the cytidine residue closest to the 3' terminus inactivates tRNAfmet while modification of the adjacent cytidine residue in the 3'-terminal C-C-A sequence has no effect on methionine or formate acceptance."

https://openalex.org/W1517155566,"Abstract The incorporation of ribonucleotides into DNA catalyzed by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of Mn++ has been studied with two synthetic DNA's of defined sequence. In general agreement with the findings of Berg et al. ((1963) in Symposium on Informational Macromolecules, p. 467, Academic Press, New York), CMP and GMP could be incorporated at rates comparable to their deoxy analogs. AMP was incorporated only slowly and UMP was not incorporated at all. In studies of the fidelity of incorporation, misincorporation was observed at 37° in the presence of both GTP and CTP. The misincorporation was also observed at 10° in the presence of GTP but not in the presence of CTP. The sequence G-G was found to slow down subsequent nucleotide incorporation in the presence of GTP. The DNA's containing CMP or GMP were selectively cleaved by alkali or specific ribonucleases and expected products were thus obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1609582576,"Abstract The T4 bacteriophage DNA polymerase mutant ts L88 has an unusually high mutation rate and is temperature-sensitive for DNA synthesis. The ts L88 DNA polymerase has been purified to homogeneity and has been compared to the wild type T4 DNA polymerase with respect to in vitro polymerase and 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, and also with respect to frequency of utilizing deoxynucleoside triphosphates that are not complementary to homopolymer templates. For the latter, the assay used measures not only stable misincorporation, but also detects any of the noncomplementary nucleotide incorporated and subsequently hydrolyzed by the polymerase-associated exonuclease, resulting in the formation of deoxynucleoside monophosphate derived from the deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrate. A specific defect was found in the ability of the ts L88 enzyme to discriminate against utilization of dGTP and dCTP when poly(dA)·poly(dT) was used as template. These substrates were utilized at 6 times the rate of the wild type enzyme by an amount of the mutant enzyme that utilized the complementary substrates dATP and dTTP at nearly the same rate as the wild type. The two enzymes were equally efficient in excising the noncomplementary residues incorporated during the reaction. On the other hand, when a template was used to which the four substrates were complementary, no difference in recognition of specific bases by the two enzymes was detectable. Thus, with T7 DNA as template both enzymes incorporated dTMP, dGMP, and dCMP at about the same rate as dAMP. During this reaction both enzymes hydrolyzed newly added dAMP residues 2 to 4 times as frequently as dTMP and dGMP, and more than 10 times as often as newly incorporated dCMP residues. Another difference in the ability of the two enzymes to discriminate against noncomplementary, but not complementary, substrates was seen when the rates of utilization of dGTP and dATP with poly(dA)·poly(dT) by the two enzymes were compared as a function of temperature. There was a marked increase in utilization of the noncomplementary substrate between 25 and 30° by ts L88 but not by the wild type enzyme. Neither enzyme showed such a stimulation over this temperature range with the complementary nucleotide. The polymerase activity of the ts L88 enzyme was much more unstable when assayed at high temperature than was its exonuclease activity. It is concluded that both the temperature-sensitive and mutator characteristics of the ts L88 mutation result from a greater defect in polymerase than exonuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513555550,"Abstract Yeast vacuoles were obtained in good yield and practically free from other organelles by submitting Saccharomyces cerevisiae protoplasts to metabolic lysis, followed by fractionation in a discontinuous Ficoll gradient. The vacuole preparation was greatly enriched in the chitin synthetase activating factor and essentially devoid of chitin synthetase zymogen. The latter was found in another membrane-rich fraction which was further purified by gradient centrifugation but was still heterogeneous. The hypothesis formulated previously, that activating factor and zymogen reside in different organelles, has thus been substantiated."
https://openalex.org/W1495686318,"Abstract The product of in vitro replication of the ΦX174 or M13 viral strand is known to be a circular duplex with a discontinuity in the synthetic strand (RF II). This replication intermediate has now been converted to an alkali-stable covalent duplex (RF I) through the joint action of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and E. coli ligase. Failure of T4 DNA polymerase to substitute for the E. coli enzyme implied the presence of an RNA priming segment at the 5' end which the unique 5' → 3' exonuclease function of the E. coli enzyme can excise. This suggestion was confirmed by conversion of the RF II product to an alkali-labile RF I through the joint action of T4 DNA polymerase and T4 ligase, an enzyme which can join RNA ends, and by location of the alkali-labile linkage of the RF I in the complementary (synthetic) strand. These results extend earlier evidence for RNA priming of DNA replication. They also call attention to a possible physiological role of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the excision of such RNA primers during DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W13213655,"Abstract Membrane vesicles prepared from a strain of Escherichia coli which lacks membrane-bound succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase activity are capable of accumulating succinate in the presence of d(-)lactate or reduced phenazine methosulfate as electron donors. The steady state, intramembranal concentration of succinate reaches 30- to 50-fold of the external concentration. Both the initial and the steady state rates are higher with ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate than with d(-)lactate. ATP, ADP, and various other metabolic intermediates do not stimulate succinate transport. Magnesium ions are required for maximum uptake. Monovalent cations, such as Na+, K+, or Li+ also stimulate transport to varying degrees. With ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate as electron donor the Michaelis constant for succinate is about 10 µm, and the inhibition constants for fumarate and l-malate are 12 µm and 22 µm, respectively. Both the ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate-dependent and d(-)lactate-dependent uptake of succinate are inhibited by energy poisons, uncouplers, and various other respiratory chain inhibitors. Compounds known to interfere with phosphorolytic and transphosphorylation reactions are without significant effect on transport. Amongst the thiol reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and showdomycin do not inhibit succinate uptake even at very high concentrations, but p-chloromercuribenzoate, Hg++ and Ag++ are very potent inhibitors. Both N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoate, however, strongly inhibit d-lactate oxidation. From these observations, and from oxamate inhibition data, it is concluded that electrons are coupled to succinate transport directly at the initial step of lactate dehydrogenation. It is proposed that succinate uptake is mediated by alternate reduction and oxidation of a succinate carrier in membranes. Membranes prepared from strains carrying genes dct A or dct B are defective in the uptake of succinate. It thus appears that at least two genetic loci are involved in the formation of the succinate transport system in the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1494168299,"Abstract Conditional mutants of Salmonella typhimurium carrying mutations in the structural gene encoding UMP kinase (pyrH) have been isolated. At 20° the mutants are unable to grow even in enriched medium, while they grow, although with somewhat reduced rates, in minimal medium at 37°. CMP kinase activity is not affected by the mutations indicating that the phosphorylation of CMP and UMP is carried out by different enzymes. When growing exponentially at 37° the mutants contain subnormal UTP pools and, as a consequence, derepressed levels of CMP kinase and aspartate carbamyltransferase. That the entire de novo biosynthetic pathway for UMP is derepressed is further indicated by the ability of the pyrH mutants to feed pyrimidine auxotrophs. Interrupted matings place pyrH at about 10 min on the S. typhimurium map. It cotransduces with the gene, pan, at a frequency of about 30% using the Escherichia coli phage Plkc. No cotransduction between pyrH and pan was found with the smaller Salmonella phage P22. The suggestion is made that the sole function of CMP kinase is to recycle products of turnover of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1585454356,"Abstract A phosphotransferase system was isolated from Staphylococcus aureus. The system catalyzed the transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate to β-galactosides to yield the corresponding galactoside 6-phosphate esters. This transfer required the participation of four protein components: Enzyme I; two phosphocarrier proteins, HPr and Factor IIIlac; and Enzyme IIlac. These components have been separated from one another and subjected to purification procedures. The partial purification and characterization of Enzyme I and membrane-bound Enzyme II are described. The purification of HPr to homogeneity, its characterization, and a comparison of its properties to those of the analogous HPr of Escherichia coli are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1505535972,"Abstract Replicative DNA synthesis in toluene-treated Escherichia coli cells occurs in the presence of Triton X-100, a nonionic detergent. DNA replication in the detergent requires four deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates, Mg++, K+, and ATP, and is sensitive to sulfhydryl-blocking agents. Replicative synthesis occurs in polA1 mutants, and is temperature-sensitive in dnats mutants in Triton X-100. DNA synthesis is unaffected by the concentration of Triton X-100 present. In 1% detergent at 37° DNA polymerase I and lactate dehydrogenase are free to diffuse from the cells. Repair synthesis is inhibited by antibody to DNA polymerase I under these conditions, but ATP-dependent synthesis is not altered by such antibody. Toluene-treated cells retain their gross morphology in 1% Triton X-100. Stationary phase cells show diminished ATP-stimulated DNA synthesis compared with log stage cells after toluene treatment. In reaction mixtures containing Triton X-100, toluene-treated plateau stage cells are capable of undiminished levels of replicative synthesis. This effect does not appear to be due to increased permeability to small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1499239536,"Abstract The effects of several antibiotics on C-A-C-C-A([14C]Phe) binding to ribosomes was studied, and an equation describing the equilibrium between ribosomes, C-A-C-C-A(Phe), and antibiotic was derived. Use of the equation permitted an estimation of the association constant for binding of antibiotics to ribosomes. In addition, the number of antibiotic molecules involved in inhibiting C-A-C-C-A(Phe) binding to ribosomes was determined with use of the equation. A single molecule of amicetin, celesticetin, gougerotin, lincomycin, puromycin, and possibly carbomycin and PA114A was involved. Sparsomycin and possibly blasticidin S at low concentrations inhibit binding of C-A-C-C-A(Phe) to one site of ribosomes, whereas high concentrations stimulate C-A-C-C-A(Phe) binding. Partial inhibition of C-A-C-C-A(Phe) binding by tylosin and spiramycin III is perhaps suggestive of functional heterogeneity of the ribosome population."
https://openalex.org/W1545293319,"Abstract Chain initiation factor 2 was resolved into two proteins, designated IF-2-α and IF-2-β, by ion exchange chromatography in 6 m urea. The molecular weight of IF-2-α was 98,000 and that of IF-2-β was 83,000. In the presence of IF-1 and IF-3, both IF-2-α and IF-2-β promoted the binding of fMet-tRNA to ribosomes with either ApUpG, GpUpG, or R17 RNA as messenger. The activities of IF-2-α and IF-2-β were additive. Neither protein was protected by GTP against heat inactivation, nor could a stable complex of GTP, IF-2 and fMet-tRNAf be isolated by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. The binding of pure fMet-tRNAf to ribosomes was stimulated by both species of IF-2."
https://openalex.org/W114620653,"Abstract Addition of d-lactate to Escherichia coli membrane vesicles results in a rapid decrease in the fluorescence of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; the decreased level of fluorescence is maintained until the reaction mixture becomes anaerobic, at which time there is a large increase in fluorescence. The rate of the initial fluorescence decrease is most marked with d-lactate; it is much slower with l-lactate, dl-α-hydroxybutyrate, succinate, and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. ATP has no effect. Potassium cyanide and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which inhibit electron transfer after the site of energy coupling, reverse the initial decrease in fluorescence. Oxamic acid, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and N-ethylmaleimide, which inhibit before or at the site of energy coupling, cause a further decrease in fluorescence. Dithiothreitol reverses the effect of p-chloromercuribenzoate. Each of these reagents, as well as the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, markedly inhibit the rate of the initial fluorescence decrease induced by d-lactate. These effects correlate nearly perfectly with the behavior of the d-lactic dehydrogenase-coupled transport systems described previously. Membrane vesicles treated with mouse duodenal phospholipase or extracted with acetone exhibit similar fluorescence changes on addition of d-lactate. Moreover, each of the fluorescence changes described appears to be identical, whether the dye is excited directly or by energy transfer from the membrane proteins. These results indicate that the fluorescence changes observed reflect structural transitions in components of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1558011666,"Abstract Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (inosine + Pi ⇌ hypoxanthine + α-d-ribose 1-phosphate, EC 2.4.2.1) from Salmonella typhimurium LT-2 has been purified 230-fold. High speed sedimentation equilibrium studies showed that the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 141,000. A molecular weight of 130,000 ± 10% was determined by Sephadex G-150 filtration. Disc gel electrophoresis of the enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed a subunit molecular weight of 23,500, indicating that the enzyme is composed of six subunits. The purified enzyme was found to be specific for the purine ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, inosine, deoxyinosine, guanosine, deoxyguanosine, adenosine, and deoxyadenosine. The Michaelis constants for inosine, deoxyinosine, and phosphate ion were 50 µm, 47 µm, and 0.37 mm, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1575605093,"Abstract The biosynthesis of pentaglycine, the cross-linking peptide in the cell wall peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus, requires glycyl-tRNA as a donor of glycine. The pentaglycine is introduced by sequential addition of glycine from glycyltRNA to the e-amino group of the l-lysine residue of the pentapeptide in the lipid-linked precursor. The direction of elongation of the pentaglycine chain is from the NH2 terminus, in contrast to that found in protein synthesis. The enzyme catalyzing the formation of pentaglycine has been purified 100-fold and the RNA content of the partially purified enzyme was 1%. The tentative molecular weight was 2 x 105, determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. These results suggest that ribosomes do not take part in the synthesis of pentaglycine. No evidence for a multicomponent activity for the synthesis of pentaglycine was found at this step of the purification."
https://openalex.org/W1499790908,"Abstract The anthranilate aggregate, which catalyzes the first two reactions of tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, consists of two anthranilate synthetase subunits and two phosphoribosyltransferase subunits. The aggregate remains associated under physiological conditions. Three lines of evidence indicate that regulation in the aggregate involves conformational changes associated with the binding of the substrates, chorismate and glutamine, and the feedback inhibitor, tryptophan. First, either chorismate or glutamine, the anthranilate synthetase substrates, can pseudocompetitively reactivate tryptophan-inhibited phosphoribosyltransferase. Second, the regulatory ligands alter the susceptibility of the aggregate to inactivation by metal ions and by the glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine. Third, direct physical evidence for conformational changes was obtained using the fluorescent probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate. The activities of the aggregate are regulated through alterations in the equilibrium between activated and inhibited conformational states associated with ligand binding. Regulation is competitive because the binding of chorismate and tryptophan or glutamine and tryptophan is mutually exclusive for allosteric reasons. Several independent kinetic and inactivation experiments indicate that glutamine binds to the enzyme in the absence of chorismate. However, glutamine hydrolysis does require that chorismate be present. The binding of chorismate is presumably associated with a conformational change required for the hydrolysis of glutamine. Anthranilate synthetase thus has an ordered reaction mechanism, but random substrate binding. Several mutationally altered anthranilate aggregates, either resistant to feedback inhibition, or supersensitive to feedback inhibition, were examined. A double mutant containing both resistant and the supersensitive alleles was very similar in kinetic properties to wild type. Revertants of the supersensitive strain were isolated, and their anthranilate aggregates were analyzed. In one revertant, the cooperative, competitive pattern of inhibition found in wild type was altered to a noncooperative, noncompetitive pattern. In another, tryptophan inhibition was completely eliminated, but the catalytic functions were unimpaired. Therefore, the chorismate and tryptophan binding sites, though competitive, are separate. All the mutations had parallel effects on both anthranilate synthetase and phosphoribosyltransferase, indicating that both activities of the aggregate are regulated by a common mechanism. It is clear that the equilibrium between active and inhibited conformational states of the aggregate is susceptible to mutational alteration. A mechanical model for the operation of the regulatory mechanism in the anthraniate aggregate is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2432508983,"Abstract The nucleoside triphosphate specificity of Escherichia coli succinic thiokinase (succinate:coenzyme A ligase (ADP), EC 6.2.1.5) was studied. The results showed that ATP, GTP and ITP (in decreasing order of effectiveness) were good substrates, while UTP and CTP were relatively ineffective. A nucleoside triphosphate ⇄ Pi exchange reaction stimulated by succinate and CoA was observed with each nucleoside triphosphate tested. A nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity of the enzyme was observed and found to be different from the ubiquitous nucleoside diphosphate kinase (ATP:nucleoside diphosphate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.6) in its substrate specificity and its marked tendency to be stimulated by succinyl-CoA. Thus, with ATP as the phosphoryl group donor, GDP and IDP were good acceptors, UDP was a relatively poor acceptor, and CDP exhibited almost negligible activity in this respect. The nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity of succinic thiokinase was inhibited at ATP concentrations in excess of 0.5 mm. A comparison of the NDP-kinase to thiokinase activity ratio has revealed that the NDP-kinase activity does not represent a minor catalytic capability of the enzyme."

The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 120,000 and contains two identical subunits that upon dissociation display very low aminoacylation activity. From the molecular weight and the sedimentation coefficient of the native enzyme (s20,w0 = 6.05 x 10-13) a value of 5.18 x 10-7 was calculated for d20,w0, which leads to a Stokes radius of 40.7 A. For a spherical molecule this radius corresponds to a volume of 282,000 A3. The kinetic parameters for the enzyme with its substrates are typical for this class of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1643634670,"The single-stranded 29 nucleotide unit long deoxyribopolynucleotide served as a template for the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli. RNA synthesis did not begin at the 3′ end of the template and initiation began with both ATP and GTP. Thus the RNA product was heterogeneous. Fractionation of the product by gel filtration at elevated temperature followed by nearest neighbor analysis showed that RNA chains started at the 5th, 7th, or 9th nucleotide units of the template. The amount of the RNA product did not exceed the amount of the template and the product was present as a hybrid duplex with the template. In order to control the point of initiation, a short ribo-oligonucleotide complementary to a region near the 3′-hydroxyl end of the template was used as a primer. Addition of the primer accelerated the reaction, abolished the de novo chain initiation, and the primer was shown to be incorporated into the RNA chains. The RNA formed was again present as a hybrid with the template and attempts to obtain extensive synthesis failed. Rifampicin, while completely inhibiting transcription of the deoxyribopolynucleotide in the absence of the primer, permitted the primer-dependent RNA synthesis to proceed. Products of the primer reaction were separated and subjected to complete nucleotide sequence analysis. A number of products were characterized. The multiplicity of products arose (a) from the fact that the primer could hybridize to the template molecules at two different sites and (b) because termination occurred at more than one point prior to the end of the template chain."
https://openalex.org/W1530084658,"Highly purified preparations of Escherichia coli RNase II are not inhibited by ATP alone. The reported inhibition of RNase II by ATP has been shown to require a soluble protein from E. coli. This putative ATP-dependent inhibitor of RNase II has been purified approximately 400-fold and identified as adenylate kinase (ATP:AMP phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3). A trivial explanation for the apparent inhibition of RNase II by ATP is thus provided. The 5′-mononucleotide products released from RNA by RNase II are routinely detected by their solubility in alcohol. In the presence of ATP and appropriate nucleoside monophosphate kinases, the 5′-mononucleotides are converted to nucleoside diphosphates which are precipitated to a significant extent in alcohol. These observations contradict both the hypothesis that ATP is an important physiological regulator of RNase II activity in E. coli and the assumption that ATP can function as a specific inhibitor of RNase II in routine RNase V assays performed with crude extracts of E. coli. Our data support the suggestion that the putative RNase V activity in crude extracts of E. coli is a manifestation of previously characterized ribonucleases. Purified adenylate kinase from E. coli appears to be a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 27,000. The enzyme can utilize both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates. E. coli adenylate kinase is highly specific for AMP and dAMP, but detectable activity is observed when ATP or dATP is replaced by the variety of ribonucleoside triphosphates tested."

No gross differences were found between the structures of the three mannan samples, although the mannan isolated enzymatically from the walls had a much higher molecular weight than that isolated chemically. It is therefore suggested that, apart from the presence of chitin, the bud scar has a similar composition to the rest of the cell wall."

https://openalex.org/W1964284589,"Weiskrantz and Warrington1–5 have reported that, in patients with organic amnesia, considerable retention of new information may be demonstrated provided memory is prompted by “partial information” such as a fragmented form of a test picture or the first two letters of a test word. They contrast this evidence with the patients' very poor memory when recall or recognition is tested and propose that amnesia is a condition in which memories fail to undergo normal processes of decay or inhibition. According to this disinhibition hypothesis, testing with partial information constrains the number of alternatives between which the amnesic patient must choose and so evades the abnormal interference from irrelevant memories."
https://openalex.org/W1660420107,"The transcription of three short synthetic bihelical DNA's of defined sequence was studied with RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli. DNA-I is a completely base-paired duplex, DNA-II contains a single-stranded portion with a 3′-hydroxyl end group while DNA-III contains a protruding single-stranded region with a 5′-hydroxyl end group. All the three DNA's were transcribed by the polymerase but the RNA formed was heterogeneous. Initiation occurred at multiple sites with purine nucleoside triphosphates and there was evidence that both strands were transcribed. A part of the RNA formed had higher molecular weight than the template strands. Attempts to control initiation by using a complementary ribo-oligonucleotide primer and also rifampicin were only partially successful."
https://openalex.org/W1494315871,"Abstract Reaction of Escherichia coli succinic thiokinase [succinate:coenzyme A ligase (adenosine diphosphate) (EC 6.2.1.5)] with antiserum to the enzyme was monitored by microcomplement fixation analysis. Changes in the enzyme induced by heating, exposure to extremes of pH, treatment with urea, and incubation with p-mercuribenzoate (p-MB), 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and iodoacetamide were assayed by this technique. Horizontal shifts in the complement fixation curves obtained as a result of most of these treatments have been shown to be related quantitatively to the loss of enzymatic activity, except at low residual succinic thiokinase activities. Although enzymatic activity was almost completely lost in the case of the iodoacetamide-treated enzyme, the quaternary structure of the protein appeared to be maintained for a significant period of time. Vertical decreases in the complement fixation curves were interpreted to indicate dissociation into subunits. DTNB and p-MB titration of the enzyme have resulted in different vertical shifts of the complement fixation curves, and the plots of enzyme inactivation versus number of sulfhydryl groups titrated are different for these reagents. Titration of succinic thiokinase with DTNB in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate yielded 16 to 18 moles of sulfhydryl groups per 140,000 g of protein, in contradiction to previously published data."

https://openalex.org/W1512779105,"Phosphoglucomutases from rabbit muscle and Escherichia coli are inhibited by several nucleotides, the more potent of which are GDP, GTP, dTDP, Coenzyme A, and several CoA derivatives. Phosphoglucomutase from E. coli is somewhat more sensitive to the inhibitors than is the rabbit muscle enzyme. All of the inhibitors are noncompetitive with glucose 1,6-diphosphate and almost uncompetitive with glucose 1-phosphate as the varied substrates. Measurements of the relaxation rate of the solvent water protons in the presence of manganese complex of phosphoglucomutase from rabbit muscle and various combinations of substrates and inhibitors confirm observations in the literature that the relaxation enhancement due to the manganese-enzyme complex is greatly decreased when saturating amounts of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate are added. When either ATP or acetyl-CoA is also present with the substrates, the decrease in relaxation enhancement is not as marked as in the presence of substrates alone. It is concluded from these studies and from titrations of the enzyme-manganese-substrate complexes with acetyl-CoA or GTP measuring the water proton relaxation rate that the inhibitors probably bind at a site on the enzyme surface which is distinct from the substrate binding site(s)."
