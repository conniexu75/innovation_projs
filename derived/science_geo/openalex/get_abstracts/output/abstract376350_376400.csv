https://openalex.org/W2004295816,"Tumours with mutant BRAF are dependent on the RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway for their growth. We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signalling in cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF. Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We used chemical genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signalling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the drug-free protomer. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signalling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicate that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumours in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore, because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in other cells, the model predicts that they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumour activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have been borne out in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (refs 4, 5). The model indicates that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumours. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS."
https://openalex.org/W2109095833,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a nonsteroidal estrogen that is ubiquitous in the environment. The homeobox gene Hoxa10 controls uterine organogenesis, and its expression is affected by in utero BPA exposure. We hypothesized that an epigenetic mechanism underlies BPA-mediated alterations in Hoxa10 expression. We analyzed the expression pattern and methylation profile of Hoxa10 after in utero BPA exposure. Pregnant CD-1 mice were treated with BPA (5 mg/kg IP) or vehicle control on d 9–16 of pregnancy. Hoxa10 mRNA and protein expression were increased by 25% in the reproductive tract of mice exposed in utero. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that cytosine-guanine dinucleotide methylation was decreased from 67 to 14% in the promoter and from 71 to 3% in the intron of Hoxa10 after in utero BPA exposure. Decreased DNA methylation led to an increase in binding of ER-α to the Hoxa10 ERE both in vitro as and in vivo as determined by EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. Diminished methylation of the ERE-containing promoter sequence resulted in an increase in ERE-driven gene expression in reporter assays. We identify altered methylation as a novel mechanism of BPA-induced altered developmental programming. Permanent epigenetic alteration of ERE sensitivity to estrogen may be a general mechanism through which endocrine disruptors exert their action.—Bromer, J. G., Zhou, Y., Taylor, M. B., Doherty, L., Taylor, H. S.. Bisphenol-A exposure in utero leads to epigenetic alterations in the developmental programming of uterine estrogen response.

https://openalex.org/W2164353743,"The aim of the study was to assess whether benefits associated with the traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) and virgin olive oil (VOO) consumption could be mediated through changes in the expression of atherosclerosis-related genes. A randomized, parallel, controlled clinical trial in healthy volunteers (n=90) aged 20 to 50 yr was performed. Threemonth intervention groups were as follows: 1) TMD with VOO (TMD+VOO), 2) TMD with washed virgin olive oil (TMD+WOO), and 3) control with participants’ habitual diet. WOO was similar to VOO, but with a lower polyphenol content (55 vs. 328 mg/kg, respectively). TMD consumption decreased plasma oxidative and inflammatory status and the gene expression related with both inflammation [INF-γ (INFy), Rho GTPase-activating protein15 (ARHGAP15), and interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R)] and oxidative stress [adrenergic ß2-receptor (ADRB2) and polymerase (DNA-directed) κ (POLK)] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All effects, with the exception of the decrease in POLK expression, were particularly observed when VOO, rich in polyphenols, was present in the TMD dietary pattern. Our results indicate a significant role of olive oil polyphenols in the down-regulation of proatherogenic genes in the context of a TMD. In addition, the benefits associated with a TMD and olive oil polyphenol consumption on cardiovascular risk can be mediated through nutrigenomic effects.—Konstantinidou, V., Covas, M.-I., Mun˜oz-Aguayo, D., Khymenets, O., de la Torre, R., Saez, G., del Carmen Tormos, M., Toledo, E., Marti, A., Ruiz-Gutiérrez, V., Ruiz Mendez, M.

https://openalex.org/W2027440025,"Intra- and intermolecular covalent cross-linking between collagen fibrils, catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (LOX), determines the mechanical properties of connective tissues; however, mechanisms that regulate the collagen cross-linking according to tissue specificity are not well understood. Here we show that periostin, a secretory protein in the dense connective tissues, promotes the activation of LOX. Previous studies showed that periostin null mice exhibit reduced collagen cross-linking in their femurs, periosteum, infarcted myocardium, and tendons. Presently, we showed that active LOX protein, formed by cleavage of its propeptide by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1), was decreased in calvarial osteoblast cells derived from periostin null mice. Overexpression of periostin promoted the proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide, which increased the amount of active LOX protein. The results of co-immunoprecipitation and solid phase binding assays revealed that periostin interacted with BMP-1. Furthermore, this interaction probably resulted in enhanced deposition of BMP-1 on the extracellular matrix, suggesting that this enhanced deposition would lead to cleavage of the propeptide of LOX. Thus, we demonstrated that periostin supported BMP-1-mediated proteolytic activation of LOX on the extracellular matrix, which promoted collagen cross-linking.

Collagen fibrils underlie the mechanical strength of connective tissues, such as bone, tendon, and skin. Post-translational modifications of collagen fibrils are important for both structural and mechanical properties. Collagen fibrillogenesis consists of multiple processes (1Canty E.G. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Synthesized pro-collagen chains in the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the triple helix structure and transported into the Golgi. In the Golgi, pro-collagens are processed by ADAMTS (pro-collagen N-proteinase) and tolloid (pro-collagen C-proteinase) family enzymes and secreted into the extracellular milieu. Collagen assembles into fibrils, which are then stabilized by the formation of intra- and intermolecular cross-linking that is catalyzed by the enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). 2The abbreviations used are: LOXlysyl oxidaseBMPbone morphogenetic proteinHAhemagglutininEGFepidermal growth factorCOBcalvarial osteoblastsRTreverse transcriptionWTwild typePBSphosphate-buffered salineTBSTris-buffered salineCTRC-terminal region. The strength of connective tissues is determined by the amount of total collagen cross-linking, as well as by the total collagen content (2Banse X. Sims T.J. Bailey A.J. J. Bone Miner.

The crucial role of collagen cross-linking in connective tissues has been demonstrated in terms of some genetically inherited diseases: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, Menkes disease, and occipital horn syndrome. These diseases are attributed to reduced LOX activity, followed by diminished collagen cross-linking, resulting in connective tissue dysfunctions (5Açil Y. Vetter U. Brenner R. Müller P.K.

LOX catalyzes the oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine residues in collagen molecules to α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde. Spontaneous condensation reactions of the resultant aldehydes lead to the formation of covalent cross-linking in fibrillar collagens (8Lucero H.A. Kagan H.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2304-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This amine oxidase activity of LOX is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the LOX propeptide. LOX is synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-LOX, and then activated by pro-collagen C-proteinase (bone morphogenetic protein-1; BMP-1)-mediated processing of the N-terminal propeptide (9Uzel M.I. Scott I.C. Babakhanlou-Chase H. Palamakumbura A.H. Pappano W.N. Hong H.H. Greenspan D.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol.

Although the activation mechanism of LOX has been demonstrated partly as described above, the mechanism that regulates the activity of LOX according to tissue specificity is not well understood. To investigate this regulatory mechanism, we focused on periostin. Periostin is a secretory protein expressed in collagen-rich fibrous connective tissues, such as periosteum, periodontal ligament, aorta, and heart valve (10Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S.

Overexpression of periostin by adenoviral infection in cardiac valvulogenic tissue increases the overall viscosity, which is a measure of collagen cross-linking (13Norris R.A. Damon B. Mironov V. Kasyanov V. Ramamurthi A. Moreno-Rodriguez R. Trusk T. Potts J.D. Goodwin R.L. Davis J. Hoffman S. Wen X. Sugi Y. Kern C.B. Mjaatvedt C.H. Turner D.K. Oka T. Conway S.J. Molkentin J.D. Forgacs G. Markwald R.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that periostin plays a role in the formation of collagen cross-links. However, the mechanism by which periostin promotes collagen cross-linking remains to be addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that periostin supported BMP-1-mediated LOX activation. Overexpression of periostin enhanced proteolytic cleavage of pro-LOX in C3H10T1/2 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and solid phase binding assays revealed that periostin directly bound to BMP-1. LOX has been reported to interact with an extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin (15Fogelgren B. Polgár N. Szauter K.M. Ujfaludi Z. Laczkó R. Fong K.S. Csiszar K. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-mouse periostin antibodies (anti-RD1) were described previously (14Shimazaki M. Nakamura K. Kii I. Kashima T. Amizuka N. Li M. Saito M. Fukuda K. Nishiyama T. Kitajima S. Saga Y.

Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies, and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-goat antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor 647-labeled mouse anti-GM130 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), and Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The care and experiments with animals were in accordance with the guidelines of the animal care and use committees at Tokyo Institute of Technology. The generation of periostin−/− mice was described previously (14Shimazaki M. Nakamura K. Kii I. Kashima T. Amizuka N. Li M. Saito M. Fukuda K. Nishiyama T. Kitajima S. Saga Y. Fukayama M. Sata M. Kudo A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for periostin, its deletion forms, and the W65A mutant form were described previously (12Kii I.

To generate the EMI domain conjugated with an HA tag at its C-terminal end, we first phosphorylated the 5′ end of the following oligonucleotide: 5′-ATGGCACGCTGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTTGAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACAGCGTGCCATAAAC-3′. To replace the RD1–4-CTR coding region with the HA tag, we annealed the phosphorylated oligonucleotides in the thermal cycler and then inserted them into the BstXI/NotI site of pCAGIPuro-periostin-HA vector (12Kii I. Nishiyama T. Li M. Matsumoto K. Saito M. Amizuka N. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2028-2039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), because the BstXI and NotI sites are located just after the EMI domain coding region and the stop codon, respectively. To generate the expression vector for BMP-1-FLAG, we subcloned a KpnI and XhoI fragment of BMP-1-FLAG from pCEP4-BMP-1-FLAG (kindly provided by Drs. Canty and Kadler) into the KpnI/XhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For generation of the ΔCUBΔEGF-FLAG deletion form, the coding region including the signal peptide, prodomain, and metalloproteinase domain was obtained from pCEP4-BMP-1-FLAG as a template by PCR amplification (13 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 68 °C) using KOD FX DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The following primer set was used: 5′-ACCGGTACCGTCGACATGCCCGGCGTGGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGCTGGGCACTTGTAAAGC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI and then subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene Corporation, Jolla, CA). The PCR product was sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit and an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The KpnI and XhoI fragment of the ΔCUBΔEGF-FLAG was subcloned into pcDNA3. To generate the ΔC3-FLAG deletion form, we obtained the coding region including CUB1, CUB2, and EGF-like domains from pCEP4-BMP-1-FLAG as a template by PCR amplification as described above. The primer set used was 5′-ACCGAATTCCGCAGCAGCAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGCAGCCTCACAGCG-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and then inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pBluescript II SK(+). After confirmation of the sequence, the EcoRI and XhoI fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA3-BMP-1-FLAG. To generate PD1-FLAG and PD2-FLAG, we obtained the coding region including signal peptide and prodomain from pCEP4-BMP-1-FLAG as a template by PCR amplification as described above. The primer sets used were the following: 5′-ACCGGTACCGTCGACATGCCCGGCGTGGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTCTCCATCTCCCACAGG-3′ (reverse) for PD1-FLAG or 5′-ACCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCACACGCTCTGGTCG-3′ (reverse) for PD2-FLAG. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and XhoI and then inserted into the KpnI/XhoI site of pBluescript II SK(+). After confirming the sequences, we subcloned the KpnI and XhoI fragments into the KpnI/XhoI site of pcDNA3. Primary cultures of mouse calvarial osteoblasts (COBs) were prepared according to the standard collagenase method. COB cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium (Nacalai Tesque), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Inc., Lenexa, KS), 100 unit/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Mouse embryonic C3H10T1/2 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and 293T cells were routinely maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs by using polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich). Stably transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 4 or 8 μg/ml of puromycin (Nacalai Tesque). The periosteum of tibia and femur was prepared from 12-week-old WT and periostin−/− mice. WT and periostin−/− COB cells and 10T1/2 stable transfectants were grown to 2 days' post-confluence. Total mRNA was extracted by using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of total mRNA was used for reverse transcription, and the cDNA was synthesized by using a cDNA synthesis kit first strand with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio Inc., Siga, Japan). Specific primer sets for each LOX family gene, periostin, BMP-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were designed, and the primer sequences used were the following: LOX, 5′-GTTCCAAGCTGGTTTCTCGC-3′ (sense) and antisense 5′-CTGGATGTAGTAGGGGTCGG-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 63 °C; number of cycles: 29 for periosteum, 26 for COB cells, and 27 for 10T1/2 transfectants); lysyl oxidase-like 1 protein (LOXL1), 5′-GCATCCACATACGTGCAGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTCGTAGTGGCTGAACTCG-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 63 °C; number of cycles, 29); lysyl oxidase-like 2 protein (LOXL2), 5′-ACCTGACCTGGTGCTTAATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGAAGACTTCCATGCTGTG-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 63 °C; number of cycles, 29); lysyl oxidase-like 3 protein (LOXL3), 5′-AGAACATCACAGCTGAGGAC-3′ (sense) and antisense 5′-GCTCATCACCACCTCAGTTAC-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 65 °C; number of cycles, 29); lysyl oxidase-like 4 protein (LOXL4), 5′-CAGAATGGTTGTCAACATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCTTTGGCCTCTGGTGTC-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 65 °C; number of cycles, 29); periostin, 5′-GGAATTCGGCATTGTGGGAGCCACTACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTCGACTCAAATTTGTGTCAGGACACGGTC-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 58 °C; number of cycles, 24 for periosteum, 25 for COB cells, and 24 for 10T1/2 transfectants); BMP-1, 5′-CGCCTGTGCTGGTATGACTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTGGAAACCCTCAGACAC-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 62 °C; number of cycles, 35 for periosteum, 30 for COB cells, and 28 for 10T1/2 transfectants); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCAGCGAACTTTATTGATG-3′ (antisense) (annealing temperature, 60 °C; number of cycles, 19 for periosteum, 22 for COB cells, and 22 for 10T1/2 transfectants). The amplification profile was 95 °C for 1 min for hot start, followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at the temperature indicated, extension at 72 °C for 30 s for the indicated number of cycles, with a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. The cells were grown to 2 days' post-confluence, washed with PBS, and scraped into SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. For cell culture supernatants, the cells were grown to 2 days' post-confluence, washed with PBS, and incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After an additional 48 h, the cell culture supernatants were collected. After concentration of total proteins using a Microcon Ultracel YM-10 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), the cell culture supernatants were added with SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were separated on 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST, and then blotted overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in 1% skim milk in TBST. After having been washed three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature; after which they were washed three times with TBST, incubated with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore), and exposed to Fuji medical x-ray film (Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Cellular extracts were prepared with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. Clarified lysates were incubated for 1 h with anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Purification of recombinant periostin proteins was described previously (17Takayama I. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biochem. 2009; 146: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 293T transfectants stably expressing BMP-1-FLAG were grown to confluence, washed with PBS, and scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. The clarified lysate was loaded onto an anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose chromatography column (Sigma-Aldrich). The column was washed twice with PBS, and the protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 3.0. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, which had been previously added to the collection tubes. NaCl (final concentration, 200 mm) was added to the solutions. The eluate was dialyzed with PBS and then concentrated by using an Amicon Ultra 4 30K (Millipore). The purity and concentration of the recombinant BMP-1-FLAG proteins were determined by using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml of purified BMP-1-FLAG diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Next, the plates were incubated with various concentrations (0–100 nm) of purified ΔEMIΔCTR-HA in PBS overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS. Bound ΔEMIΔCTR-HA was detected by using anti-HA antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase substrate O-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.6, containing 0.003% H2O2 for 30 min. Absorbance was read at 495 nm. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After a wash with PBS, they were made permeable by treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After blocking with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (preheated at 56 °C for 30 min) for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS overnight at 4 °C. Further incubation with an optimal dilution of fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies was performed for 1 h, followed by washing twice with TBS. The nuclei were stained with TOPRO3 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The fluorescent images were collected by using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FV1000-BX61; Olympus, Japan) with 40× UPlanApo NA 0.85 objective lenses and imaging software (FLUOVIEW Ver. 1.6a; Olympus). The images were imported into Photoshop (Ver. CS2; Adobe) for cropping and linear contrast adjustment. C3H10T1/2 stable transfectants were grown to 2 days' post-confluence. The pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline contents were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography method (18Saito M. Marumo K. Fujii K. Ishioka N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The data were summarized as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by use of the unpaired t test (p values < 0.05 were considered significant). To examine whether the reduced cross-linking of collagens in the periostin−/− femur and periosteum is due to a reduced level of LOX mRNA expression, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We prepared total RNAs from the periosteum of WT and periostin−/− tibia and femur that were then subjected to reverse transcription. To detect the expression of LOX family genes, we generated specific primer sets for each gene (details under “Experimental Procedures”). RT-PCR analysis showed no significant difference in the expression of LOX family genes between the WT and periostin−/− periosteum (Fig. 1A), indicating that the reduced cross-linking of collagens in the periostin−/− mice might possibly be caused by decreased activity of LOX proteins. LOX activity is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the LOX propeptide. To examine an active LOX protein in periostin−/− osteoblasts, we prepared total cell lysates from WT and periostin−/− COB cells grown to 2 days' post-confluence, subjected the lysates to SDS-PAGE, and then blotted the separated proteins with anti-LOX antibody. The sizes of N-glycosylated pro-LOX and active LOX have been regarded as ∼50 (19Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 32 kDa (20Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson 3rd, T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amount of active LOX protein (32 kDa) was less in cell lysates from periostin−/− COB cells than in those from WT COB cells (Fig. 1B, arrow). Moreover, the amount of N-glycosylated pro-LOX protein (50 kDa) was also decreased in cell lysates from the periostin−/− COB cells (Fig. 1B, arrowhead). In addition, we observed a 35-kDa band (Fig. 1B, asterisk). This 35-kDa band, which was reported to correspond to an intermediate processed form of LOX (21Atsawasuwan P. Mochida Y. Katafuchi M. Kaku M. Fong K.S. Csiszar K. Yamauchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34229-34240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was slightly weaker in the case of the periostin−/− COB cells. Quantification of the total and active LOX proteins using WT and periostin−/− COB cells is shown in Fig. 1C, indicating a significant difference in the total and active LOX proteins between the WT and periostin−/− COB cells. To examine LOX mRNA expression levels in WT and periostin−/− COB cells, we prepared total RNAs from WT and periostin−/− COB cells that were then subjected to reverse transcription. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed no significant difference in the expression of the LOX gene between WT and periostin−/− COB cells (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the result of RT-PCR analysis of the WT and periostin−/− periosteum (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the amount of active LOX protein was decreased in the periostin−/− COB cells, suggesting that the LOX activity would be attenuated in periostin−/− osteoblasts. We examined whether overexpression of periostin would increase the amount of active LOX protein. We established fibroblastic C3H10T1/2 stable transfectants with an expression vector for periostin that had been conjugated with an HA tag at the C-terminal end (10T1/2-periostin-HA) or with the empty vector (10T1/2-control). We prepared cell lysates from the 10T1/2-control and -periostin-HA stable transfectants grown to 2 days' post-confluence that were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. To confirm the overexpression of periostin, we performed Western blot analysis with anti-periostin or anti-HA antibodies. 10T1/2-periostin-HA expressed higher levels of periostin than the 10T1/2-control, which slightly expressed endogenous periostin (Fig. 2A). To determine whether overexpression of periostin would increase the amount of active LOX protein, we performed Western blot analysis with the anti-LOX antibody. The amount of active LOX protein (32 kDa) was increased in cell lysates from 10T1/2-periostin-HA compared with that of the 10T1/2-control (Fig. 2B, arrow). The ratio of the active LOX protein in the total one was significantly increased in the 10T1/2-periostin-HA, compared with that in the 10T1/2-control (Fig. 2C). However, the total amount of detected LOX protein, i.e. N-glycosylated pro-LOX (50 kDa, arrowhead), the intermediate processed form of LOX (35 kDa, asterisk), and active LOX (32 kDa, arrow), was approximately equal between 10T1/2-control and 10T1/2-periostin-HA (Fig. 2C). To examine LOX mRNA expression levels in 10T1/2-control and 10T1/2-periostin-HA, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis and found no significant difference in the expression of LOX gene between 10T1/2-control and 10T1/2-periostin-HA (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that overexpression of periostin increased the proteolytically cleaved form of pro-LOX. To study the mechanism by which periostin enhanced the proteolytic cleavage of pro-LOX, we focused on BMP-1. We first examined BMP-1 mRNA expression levels in periosteum and COB cells from WT and periostin−/− mice. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed no significant difference in the expression of the BMP-1 gene between WT and periostin−/− periosteum or COB cells (Fig. 3A). We also observed no significant difference in the expression of the BMP-1 gene between 10T1/2-control and 10T1/2-periostin-HA (Fig. 3B). Previous studies demonstrated that periostin is localized in the Golgi (22Kim B.Y. Olzmann J.A. Choi S.I. Ahn S.Y. Kim T.I. Cho H.S. Suh H. Kim E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19580-19591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that BMP-1 is localized in the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane (23Leighton M. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To examine the co-localization of periostin and BMP-1 in the Golgi, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis using 293 cells that had been stably transfected with the expression vector for BMP-1 that had been conjugated with a FLAG-tag at its C-terminal end (BMP-1-FLAG). The stable transfectant was then transiently transfected with the expression vector for periostin-HA and then fluorescently stained with anti-HA antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, and antibody against GM130, which is a Golgi marker. Fluorescent signals for both periostin-HA and BMP-1-FLAG were detected in the Golgi, indicating that periostin-HA was co-localized with BMP-1-FLAG in the Golgi (Fig. 3C). The co-localization of periostin and BMP-1 possibly indicates that periostin interacted with BMP-1. To assess this interaction, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. We established 293 cells stably transfected with the expression vector for periostin-HA (Fig. 4A). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed with cell lysates from the above 293 cell stable transfectants that had also been transiently transfected with the expression vector for BMP-1-FLAG. Periostin-HA interacted with BMP-1-FLAG in cell lysates (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that periostin bound to BMP-1. Periostin consists of six domains: the N-terminal EMI domain, four tandem repeats of the fas1 domain, and a C-terminal region (CTR) (10Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M.

https://openalex.org/W2023044811,"Background C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) have been shown to be useful for diagnosis of prosthetic hip and knee infection. Little information is available on CRP and ESR in patients undergoing revision or resection of shoulder arthroplasties or spine implants. Methods/Results We analyzed preoperative CRP and ESR in 636 subjects who underwent knee (n = 297), hip (n = 221) or shoulder (n = 64) arthroplasty, or spine implant (n = 54) removal. A standardized definition of orthopedic implant-associated infection was applied. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to determine ideal cutoff values for differentiating infected from non-infected cases. ESR was significantly different in subjects with aseptic failure infection of knee (median 11 and 53.5 mm/h, respectively, p = <0.0001) and hip (median 11 and 30 mm/h, respectively, p = <0.0001) arthroplasties and spine implants (median 10 and 48.5 mm/h, respectively, p = 0.0033), but not shoulder arthroplasties (median 10 and 9 mm/h, respectively, p = 0.9883). Optimized ESR cutoffs for knee, hip and shoulder arthroplasties and spine implants were 19, 13, 26, and 45 mm/h, respectively. Using these cutoffs, sensitivity and specificity to detect infection were 89 and 74% for knee, 82 and 60% for hip, and 32 and 93% for shoulder arthroplasties, and 57 and 90% for spine implants. CRP was significantly different in subjects with aseptic failure and infection of knee (median 4 and 51 mg/l, respectively, p<0.0001), hip (median 3 and 18 mg/l, respectively, p<0.0001), and shoulder (median 3 and 10 mg/l, respectively, p = 0.01) arthroplasties, and spine implants (median 3 and 20 mg/l, respectively, p = 0.0011). Optimized CRP cutoffs for knee, hip, and shoulder arthroplasties, and spine implants were 14.5, 10.3, 7, and 4.6 mg/l, respectively. Using these cutoffs, sensitivity and specificity to detect infection were 79 and 88% for knee, 74 and 79% for hip, and 63 and 73% for shoulder arthroplasties, and 79 and 68% for spine implants. Conclusion CRP and ESR have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of shoulder implant infection. A CRP of 4.6 mg/l had a sensitivity of 79 and a specificity of 68% to detect infection of spine implants."

In addition, vinculin modulates the dynamics of cell adhesions and is associated with decreased cell motility on two-dimensional ECM substrates. The effect of vinculin on cell invasion through dense three-dimensional ECM gels is unknown. Here, we report how vinculin expression affects cell invasion into three-dimensional collagen matrices. Cell motility was investigated in vinculin knockout and vinculin expressing wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Vinculin knockout cells were 2-fold more motile on two-dimensional collagen-coated substrates compared with wild-type cells, but 3-fold less invasive in 2.4 mg/ml three-dimensional collagen matrices. Vinculin knockout cells were softer and remodeled their cytoskeleton more dynamically, which is consistent with their enhanced two-dimensional motility but does not explain their reduced three-dimensional invasiveness. Importantly, vinculin-expressing cells adhered more strongly to collagen and generated 3-fold higher traction forces compared with vinculin knockout cells. Moreover, vinculin-expressing cells were able to migrate into dense (5.8 mg/ml) three-dimensional collagen matrices that were impenetrable for vinculin knockout cells. These findings suggest that vinculin facilitates three-dimensional matrix invasion through up-regulation or enhanced transmission of traction forces that are needed to overcome the steric hindrance of ECMs."

Cells with strong in vitro myogenic potential effectively were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the anti-satellite cell antibody SM/C-2.6.

https://openalex.org/W2043580251,"The rapid emergence and subsequent spread of the novel 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) has prompted the World Health Organization to declare the first pandemic of the 21st century, highlighting the threat of influenza to public health and healthcare systems. Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P<0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1. The TCAD regimen overcomes baseline drug resistance to both classes of approved influenza antivirals, and thus may represent a highly active antiviral therapy for seasonal and pandemic influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2040850920,"Background Försters resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy is widely used for the analysis of protein interactions in intact cells. However, FRET microscopy is technically challenging and does not allow assessing interactions in large cell numbers. To overcome these limitations we developed a flow cytometry-based FRET assay and analysed interactions of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) Nef and Vpu proteins with cellular factors, as well as HIV Rev multimer-formation. Results Amongst others, we characterize the interaction of Vpu with CD317 (also termed Bst-2 or tetherin), a host restriction factor that inhibits HIV release from infected cells and demonstrate that the direct binding of both is mediated by the Vpu membrane-spanning region. Furthermore, we adapted our assay to allow the identification of novel protein interaction partners in a high-throughput format. Conclusion The presented combination of FRET and FACS offers the precious possibility to discover and define protein interactions in living cells and is expected to contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treatment of human diseases."

Mutations causing inactivation of one of three genes, ccm1, -2, or -3, are sufficient to induce vascular endothelial cell defects resulting in CCM. Herein, we show that loss of expression of the CCM1, -2, or -3 proteins causes a marked increase in expression of the GTPase RhoA. Live cell imaging with a RhoA-specific biosensor demonstrates increased RhoA activity with loss of CCM1, -2, or -3, with an especially pronounced RhoA activation in both the cytosol and the nucleus with loss of CCM1 expression. Increased RhoA activation was associated with Rho kinase-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2. Functionally, loss of CCM1, -2, or -3 inhibited endothelial cell vessel-like tube formation and extracellular matrix invasion, each of which is rescued by chemical inhibition or short hairpin RNA knockdown of Rho kinase. The findings, for the first time, define a signaling network for CCM1, -2, and -3 in CCM pathology, whereby loss of CCM1, -2, or -3 protein expression results in increased RhoA activity, with the activation of Rho kinase responsible for endothelial cell dysregulation.

https://openalex.org/W2066680666,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a human premature aging disorder associated with severe developmental deficiencies and neurodegeneration, and phenotypically it resembles some mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases. Most patients belong to complementation group B, and the CS group B (CSB) protein plays a role in genomic maintenance and transcriptome regulation. By immunocytochemistry, mitochondrial fractionation, and Western blotting, we demonstrate that CSB localizes to mitochondria in different types of cells, with increased mitochondrial distribution following menadione-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, our results suggest that CSB plays a significant role in mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) regulation. In particular, we find reduced 8-oxo-guanine, uracil, and 5-hydroxy-uracil BER incision activities in CSBdeficient cells compared to wild-type cells. This deficiency correlates with deficient association of the BER activities with the mitochondrial inner membrane, suggesting that CSB may participate in the anchoring of the DNA repair complex. Increased mutation frequency in mtDNA of CSB-deficient cells demonstrates functional significance of the presence of CSB in the mitochondria. The results in total suggest that CSB plays a direct role in mitochondrial BER by helping recruit, stabilize, and/or retain BER proteins in repair complexes associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, perhaps providing a novel basis for understanding the complex phenotype of this debilitating disorder.—Aamann, M.

https://openalex.org/W2112513114,"MicroRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression appears to be involved in a variety of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Mir-146a is thought to be involved in the regulation of the innate immune response, and its expression is increased in tissues associated with chronic inflammation. Among the predicted gene targets for mir-146a, the chemokine CCL8/MCP-2 is a ligand for the CCR5 chemokine receptor and a potent inhibitor of CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 entry and replication. In the present study, we have analyzed changes in the expression of mir-146a in primary human fetal microglial cells upon infection with HIV-1 and found increased expression of mir-146a. We further show that CCL8/MCP-2 is a target for mir-146a in HIV-1 infected microglia, as overexpression of mir-146a prevented HIV-induced secretion of MCP-2 chemokine. The clinical relevance of our findings was evaluated in HIV-encephalitis (HIVE) brain samples in which decreased levels of MCP-2 and increased levels of mir-146a were observed, suggesting a role for mir-146a in the maintenance of HIV-mediated chronic inflammation of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2009564945,"Polyamines are essential cell constituents whose depletion results in growth cessation. Here we have investigated potential mechanisms of action of polyamines in supporting mammalian cell proliferation. We demonstrate that polyamines regulate translation both at the initiation and at the elongation steps. L-alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment resulting in polyamine depletion reduces protein synthesis via inhibition of translation initiation. N1-guanyl-diaminoheptane (GC7), a spermidine analogue that inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) hypusination, also caused inhibition of translation initiation. In contrast, depletion of eIF5A by short hairpin RNA inhibits translation elongation as was recently demonstrated in yeast and Drosophila. These results suggest that in addition to competing with spermidine in the hypusination reaction, GC7 also competes with spermidine at yet undefined sites required for translation initiation. Finally, we show that either polyamine depletion or GC7 treatment induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation and reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP, thus setting the molecular basis for the observed inhibition of translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1968536820,"The ability of some bird species to pull up meat hung on a string is a famous example of spontaneous animal problem solving. The ""insight"" hypothesis claims that this complex behaviour is based on cognitive abilities such as mental scenario building and imagination. An operant conditioning account, in contrast, would claim that this spontaneity is due to each action in string pulling being reinforced by the meat moving closer and remaining closer to the bird on the perch. We presented experienced and naïve New Caledonian crows with a novel, visually restricted string-pulling problem that reduced the quality of visual feedback during string pulling. Experienced crows solved this problem with reduced efficiency and increased errors compared to their performance in standard string pulling. Naïve crows either failed or solved the problem by trial and error learning. However, when visual feedback was available via a mirror mounted next to the apparatus, two naïve crows were able to perform at the same level as the experienced group. Our results raise the possibility that spontaneous string pulling in New Caledonian crows may not be based on insight but on operant conditioning mediated by a perceptual-motor feedback cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2072331982,"Elevated blood and tissue CO(2), or hypercapnia, is common in severe lung disease. Patients with hypercapnia often develop lung infections and have an increased risk of death following pneumonia. To explore whether hypercapnia interferes with host defense, we studied the effects of elevated P(CO2) on macrophage innate immune responses. In differentiated human THP-1 macrophages and human and mouse alveolar macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor ligands, hypercapnia inhibited expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent cytokines critical for antimicrobial host defense. Inhibition of IL-6 expression by hypercapnia was concentration dependent, rapid, reversible, and independent of extracellular and intracellular acidosis. In contrast, hypercapnia did not down-regulate IL-10 or interferon-beta, which do not require NF-kappaB. Notably, hypercapnia did not affect LPS-induced degradation of IkappaB alpha, nuclear translocation of RelA/p65, or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, but it did block IL-6 promoter-driven luciferase activity in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages. Elevated P(CO2) also decreased phagocytosis of opsonized polystyrene beads and heat-killed bacteria in THP-1 and human alveolar macrophages. By interfering with essential innate immune functions in the macrophage, hypercapnia may cause a previously unrecognized defect in resistance to pulmonary infection in patients with advanced lung disease."

Epithelial ovarian cancer comprises several histological subtypes, each with distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. The natural history of this heterogeneous disease, including the cell types of origin, is poorly understood. This study applied recently developed methods for high-throughput DNA methylation profiling to characterize ovarian cancer cell lines and tumors, including representatives of three major histologies.We obtained DNA methylation profiles of 1,505 CpG sites (808 genes) in 27 primary epithelial ovarian tumors and 15 ovarian cancer cell lines. We found that the DNA methylation profiles of ovarian cancer cell lines were markedly different from those of primary ovarian tumors. Aggregate DNA methylation levels of the assayed CpG sites tended to be higher in ovarian cancer cell lines relative to ovarian tumors. Within the primary tumors, those of the same histological type were more alike in their methylation profiles than those of different subtypes. Supervised analyses identified 90 CpG sites (68 genes) that exhibited 'subtype-specific' DNA methylation patterns (FDR<1%) among the tumors. In ovarian cancer cell lines, we estimated that for at least 27% of analyzed autosomal CpG sites, increases in methylation were accompanied by decreases in transcription of the associated gene.The significant difference in DNA methylation profiles between ovarian cancer cell lines and tumors underscores the need to be cautious in using cell lines as tumor models for molecular studies of ovarian cancer and other cancers. Similarly, the distinct methylation profiles of the different histological types of ovarian tumors reinforces the need to treat the different histologies of ovarian cancer as different diseases, both clinically and in biomarker studies. These data provide a useful resource for future studies, including those of potential tumor progenitor cells, which may help illuminate the etiology and natural history of these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2009479700,"Variation of the gene coding for D2 receptors (DRD2) has been associated with risk for schizophrenia and with working memory deficits. A functional intronic SNP (rs1076560) predicts relative expression of the two D2 receptors isoforms, D2S (mainly pre-synaptic) and D2L (mainly post-synaptic). However, the effect of functional genetic variation of DRD2 on striatal dopamine D2 signaling and on its correlation with prefrontal activity during working memory in humans is not known.Thirty-seven healthy subjects were genotyped for rs1076560 (G>T) and underwent SPECT with [123I]IBZM (which binds primarily to post-synaptic D2 receptors) and with [123I]FP-CIT (which binds to pre-synaptic dopamine transporters, whose activity and density is also regulated by pre-synaptic D2 receptors), as well as BOLD fMRI during N-Back working memory.Subjects carrying the T allele (previously associated with reduced D2S expression) had striatal reductions of [123I]IBZM and of [123I]FP-CIT binding. DRD2 genotype also differentially predicted the correlation between striatal dopamine D2 signaling (as identified with factor analysis of the two radiotracers) and activity of the prefrontal cortex during working memory as measured with BOLD fMRI, which was positive in GG subjects and negative in GT.Our results demonstrate that this functional SNP within DRD2 predicts striatal binding of the two radiotracers to dopamine transporters and D2 receptors as well as the correlation between striatal D2 signaling with prefrontal cortex activity during performance of a working memory task. These data are consistent with the possibility that the balance of excitatory/inhibitory modulation of striatal neurons may also affect striatal outputs in relationship with prefrontal activity during working memory performance within the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1602141137,"One of the biggest challenges in biology is to understand how activity at the cellular level of neurons, as a result of their mutual interactions, leads to the observed behavior of an organism responding to a variety of environmental stimuli. Investigating the intermediate or mesoscopic level of organization in the nervous system is a vital step towards understanding how the integration of micro-level dynamics results in macro-level functioning. In this paper, we have considered the somatic nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, for which the entire neuronal connectivity diagram is known. We focus on the organization of the system into modules, i.e., neuronal groups having relatively higher connection density compared to that of the overall network. We show that this mesoscopic feature cannot be explained exclusively in terms of considerations, such as optimizing for resource constraints (viz., total wiring cost) and communication efficiency (i.e., network path length). Comparison with other complex networks designed for efficient transport (of signals or resources) implies that neuronal networks form a distinct class. This suggests that the principal function of the network, viz., processing of sensory information resulting in appropriate motor response, may be playing a vital role in determining the connection topology. Using modular spectral analysis, we make explicit the intimate relation between function and structure in the nervous system. This is further brought out by identifying functionally critical neurons purely on the basis of patterns of intra- and inter-modular connections. Our study reveals how the design of the nervous system reflects several constraints, including its key functional role as a processor of information."

Results We implanted hMSCs into the striatum of transgenic mice (N171-82Q) that are a model for HD. The implanted hMSCs rapidly disappeared over 3 to 15 days.

They also increased neurotrophic signaling and decreased atrophy of the striatum in 3-month old HD mice implanted with hMSCs one month earlier. Conclusions The results therefore suggested that neural implantation of hMSCs may be of benefit in HD but a number of parameters of dose, treatment schedule, and route of administration need to be optimized."
https://openalex.org/W1993074379,"Schwanniomyces occidentalis invertase is an extracellular enzyme that hydrolyzes sucrose and releases beta-fructose from various oligosaccharides and essential storage fructan polymers such as inulin. We report here the three-dimensional structure of Sw. occidentalis invertase at 2.9 A resolution and its complex with fructose at 1.9 A resolution. The monomer presents a bimodular arrangement common to other GH32 enzymes, with an N-terminal 5-fold beta-propeller catalytic domain and a C-terminal beta-sandwich domain for which the function has been unknown until now. However, the dimeric nature of Sw. occidentalis invertase reveals a unique active site cleft shaped by both subunits that may be representative of other yeast enzymes reported to be multimeric. Binding of the tetrasaccharide nystose and the polymer inulin was explored by docking analysis, which suggested that medium size and long substrates are recognized by residues from both subunits. The identified residues were mutated, and the enzymatic activity of the mutants against sucrose, nystose, and inulin were investigated by kinetic analysis. The replacements that showed the largest effect on catalytic efficiency were Q228V, a residue putatively involved in nystose and inulin binding, and S281I, involved in a polar link at the dimer interface. Moreover, a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency against inulin was observed in the mutants Q435A and Y462A, both located in the beta-sandwich domain of the second monomer. This highlights the essential function that oligomerization plays in substrate specificity and assigns, for the first time, a direct catalytic role to the supplementary domain of a GH32 enzyme."

Because A1R occupancy promotes fusion of human monocytes to form giant cells in vitro, we determined whether A1R occupancy similarly promotes osteoclast function and formation. Bone marrow cells (BMCs) were harvested from C57Bl/6 female mice or A1R-knockout mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates and differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of colony stimulating factor-1 and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand in the presence or absence of the A1R antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentyl xanthine (DPCPX). Osteoclast morphology was analyzed in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase or F-actin-stained samples, and bone resorption was evaluated by toluidine blue staining of dentin. BMCs from A1R-knockout mice form fewer osteoclasts than BMCs from WT mice, and the A1R antagonist DPCPX inhibits osteoclast formation (IC50=1 nM), with altered morphology and reduced ability to resorb bone. A1R blockade increased ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6 in RAW264.7 cells induced to differentiate into osteoclasts. These studies suggest a critical role for adenosine in bone homeostasis via interaction with adenosine A1R and further suggest that A1R may be a novel pharmacologic target to prevent the bone loss associated with inflammatory diseases and menopause.—Kara, F.

https://openalex.org/W2073968538,"Heparanase is a promising anticancer target because of its involvement in cancer invasion and metastasis. Heparanase cleaves heparan sulfate (HS), a sulfated polysaccharide, and activates a series of HS-mediated cell proliferation and angiogenesis processes. Understanding the substrate specificity of heparanase will aid the discovery of heparanase inhibitors. Here, we sought to determine the specificity of heparanase using synthetic polysaccharide substrates. The substrates were prepared using purified HS biosynthetic enzymes. Using these substrates, we were able to dissect the structural moieties required for heparanase. Our data suggest that heparanase cleaves the linkage between a GlcA unit and an N-sulfo glucosamine unit carrying either a 3-O-sulfo or a 6-O-sulfo group. In addition, heparanase cleaves the linkage of a GlcA unit and N-sulfo glucosamine unit with a 2-O-sulfated GlcA residue, not a 2-O-sulfated IdoA residue, in proximity. We also discovered that the polysaccharide with repeating disaccharide units of IdoA2S-GlcNS inhibits the activity of heparanase. Our findings advance the understanding of the substrate specificity of heparanase and identify a lead compound for developing polysaccharide-based heparanase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2088026447,"The process of adipocyte differentiation is driven by a highly coordinated cascade of transcriptional events that results in the development of the mature adipocyte and in lipid accumulation. One of the early events of differentiation is the up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) expression. C/EBPbeta then acts to up-regulate the expression of adipogenic factors such as C/EBPalpha, which control the late stage of adipogenesis. Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis, and its action appears to block C/EBPbeta transcriptional potential early during differentiation. Using preadipocytes and mesenchymal stem cell models, we show that RA specifically blocks the occupancy of C/EBPbeta of the Cebpa promoter, thereby abrogating the differentiation process. RA does not act directly on C/EBPbeta but rather stimulates the expression of the transforming growth factor beta-effector protein Smad3, which can interact with C/EBPbeta via its Mad homology 1 domain and can interfere with C/EBPbeta DNA binding. The RA-induced increase in Smad3 expression results in increased cytoplasmic and nuclear Smad3, an important event as ectopic expression of Smad3 in preadipocytes in the absence of RA treatment only modestly inhibits adipogenesis and C/EBPbeta DNA binding, suggesting that Smad3 alone is not sufficient to completely recapitulate the effects of retinoic acid treatment during differentiation. However, in the absence of Smad3, RA is not able to inhibit adipocyte differentiation or to elicit a decrease in C/EBPbeta DNA occupancy suggesting that Smad3 is necessary to convey the inhibitory effects of retinoic acid during adipogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2048732928,"The alpha6beta4 integrin is a laminin 332 (LN332) receptor central to the formation of hemidesmosomes in epithelial layers. However, the integrin becomes phosphorylated by keratinocytes responding to epidermal growth factor in skin wounds or by squamous cell carcinomas that overexpress/hyperactivate the tyrosine kinase ErbB2, epidermal growth factor receptor, or c-Met. We show here that the beta4-dependent signaling in A431 human squamous carcinoma cells is dependent on the syndecan family of matrix receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis identifies an interaction within the distal third (amino acids 1473-1752) of the beta4 cytoplasmic domain and the conserved C2 region of the syndecan cytoplasmic domain. Via its C2 region, Sdc1 forms a complex with the alpha6beta4 integrin along with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 and the cytoplasmic kinase Fyn in A431 cells. Engagement of LN332 or clustering of the alpha6beta4 integrin with integrin-specific antibodies causes phosphorylation of ErbB2, Fyn, and the beta4 subunit as well as activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt and their assimilation into this complex. This leads to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cell spreading and Akt-dependent protection from apoptosis. This is disrupted by RNA interference silencing of Sdc1 but can be rescued by mouse Sdc1 or Sdc4 but not by syndecan mutants lacking their C-terminal C2 region. This disruption does not prevent the phosphorylation of ErbB2 or Fyn but blocks the Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of the beta4 tail. We propose that syndecans engage the distal region of the beta4 cytoplasmic domain and bring it to the plasma membrane, where it can be acted upon by Src family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2144147050,"Background Bluetongue (BT) is a viral disease of ruminants transmitted by Culicoides biting midges and has the ability to spread rapidly over large distances. In the summer of 2006, BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) emerged for the first time in northern Europe, resulting in over 2000 infected farms by the end of the year. The virus subsequently overwintered and has since spread across much of Europe, causing tens of thousands of livestock deaths. In August 2007, BTV-8 reached Great Britain (GB), threatening the large and valuable livestock industry. A voluntary vaccination scheme was launched in GB in May 2008 and, in contrast with elsewhere in Europe, there were no reported cases in GB during 2008. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we use carefully parameterised mathematical models to investigate the spread of BTV in GB and its control by vaccination. In the absence of vaccination, the model predicted severe outbreaks of BTV, particularly for warmer temperatures. Vaccination was predicted to reduce the severity of epidemics, with the greatest reduction achieved for high levels (95%) of vaccine uptake. However, even at this level of uptake the model predicted some spread of BTV. The sensitivity of the predictions to vaccination parameters (time to full protection in cattle, vaccine efficacy), the shape of the transmission kernel and temperature dependence in the transmission of BTV between farms was assessed. Conclusions/Significance A combination of lower temperatures and high levels of vaccine uptake (>80%) in the previously-affected areas are likely to be the major contributing factors in the control achieved in England in 2008. However, low levels of vaccination against BTV-8 or the introduction of other serotypes could result in further, potentially severe outbreaks in future."
https://openalex.org/W2030535198,"Quantitative analysis of animal behaviour is a requirement to understand the task solving strategies of animals and the underlying control mechanisms. The identification of repeatedly occurring behavioural components is thereby a key element of a structured quantitative description. However, the complexity of most behaviours makes the identification of such behavioural components a challenging problem. We propose an automatic and objective approach for determining and evaluating prototypical behavioural components. Behavioural prototypes are identified using clustering algorithms and finally evaluated with respect to their ability to represent the whole behavioural data set. The prototypes allow for a meaningful segmentation of behavioural sequences. We applied our clustering approach to identify prototypical movements of the head of blowflies during cruising flight. The results confirm the previously established saccadic gaze strategy by the set of prototypes being divided into either predominantly translational or rotational movements, respectively. The prototypes reveal additional details about the saccadic and intersaccadic flight sections that could not be unravelled so far. Successful application of the proposed approach to behavioural data shows its ability to automatically identify prototypical behavioural components within a large and noisy database and to evaluate these with respect to their quality and stability. Hence, this approach might be applied to a broad range of behavioural and neural data obtained from different animals and in different contexts."

A major hurdle is the complexity of herbal preparations, many of which combine multiple herbs, particularly when the combination is assumed to be vitally important to the effectiveness of the herbal therapy. This issue may be addressed through the use of contemporary methodology and validated animal models.In this study, two commonly used traditional herbal formulas, Shi Quan Da Bu Tang (SQDB) and Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXL) were evaluated using a survival assay and oxidative stress biomarkers in a well-established C. elegans model of aging. HLXL is an eleven herb formula modified from a top-selling traditional herbal formula for the treatment of arthritic joint pain. SQDB consists of ten herbs often used for fatigue and energy, particularly in the aged. We demonstrate here that SQDB significantly extend life span in a C. elegans model of aging. Among all individual herbs tested, two herbs Cinnamomum cassia bark (Chinese pharmaceutical name: Cinnamomi Cortex, CIN) and Panax ginseng root (Chinese pharmaceutical name: Ginseng Radix, GS) significantly extended life span in C. elegans. CIN in both SQDB and HLXL formula extended life span via modulation of multiple longevity assurance genes, including genes involved in insulin signaling and stress response pathways. All the life-span-extending herbs (SQDB, CIN and GS) also attenuated levels of H2O2 and enhanced small heat shock protein expression. Furthermore, the life span-extending herbs significantly delayed human amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced toxicity in transgenic C. elegans expressing human Abeta.These results validate an invertebrate model for rapid, systematic evaluation of commonly used Chinese herbal formulations and may provide insight for designing future evidence-based herbal therapy(s)."

Our data have established two empirical findings. The first is a protective main effect in the DAT1 gene against risky behaviors. The second finding is that the protective effect varies over age, with the effect prominent at ages when a behavior is illegal and the effect largely vanished at ages when the behavior becomes legal or more socially tolerated. Both the protective main effect and the gene-lifecourse interaction effect are replicated across a spectrum of most common risky behaviors: delinquency, variety of sexual partners, binge drinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity, smoking frequency, marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug use, and seatbelt non-wearing. We also compared individuals with the protective genotype and individuals without it in terms of age, physical maturity, verbal IQ, GPA, received popularity, sent popularity, church attendance, two biological parents, and parental education. These comparisons indicate that the protective effect of DAT1*9R/9R cannot be explained away by these background characteristics.

The DXMS data support the view that high affinity binding to mispair-containing DNA and low affinity binding to fully base-paired DNA both involve forming rings by MutS protein family dimers around the DNA; however, mispair binding protects additional regions from deuterium exchange. DXMS also reveals two distinct conformations upon binding one or two ATP molecules and that binding of two ATP molecules propagates conformational changes to other regions of the protein complexes. The regions showing major changes in deuterium exchange upon ATP binding tend to occur in regions distinct from those involved in DNA binding, suggesting that although communication occurs between DNA and nucleotide binding, sliding clamps formed by binding both ATP and mispairs could result from the simultaneous action of two independent conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W2076890769,"Background The pro-apoptotic effector Bid induces mitochondrial apoptosis in synergy with Bax and Bak. In response to death receptors activation, Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 into its active form, tBid (truncated Bid), which then translocates to the mitochondria to trigger cytochrome c release and subsequent apoptosis. Accumulating evidence now indicate that the binding of tBid initiates an ordered sequences of events that prime mitochondria from the action of Bax and Bak: (1) tBid interacts with mitochondria via a specific binding to cardiolipin (CL) and immediately disturbs mitochondrial structure and function idependently of its BH3 domain; (2) Then, tBid activates through its BH3 domain Bax and/or Bak and induces their subsequent oligomerization in mitochondrial membranes. To date, the underlying mechanism responsible for targeting tBid to mitochondria and disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetics has yet be elucidated. Principal Findings The present study investigates the mechanism by which tBid interacts with mitochondria issued from mouse hepatocytes and perturbs mitochondrial function. We show here that the helix αH6 is responsible for targeting tBid to mitochondrial CL and disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetics. In particular, αH6 interacts with mitochondria through electrostatic interactions involving the lysines 157 and 158 and induces an inhibition of state-3 respiration and an uncoupling of state-4 respiration. These changes may represent a key event that primes mitochondria for the action of Bax and Bak. In addition, we also demonstrate that tBid required its helix αH6 to efficiently induce cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Conclusions Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of tBid, and particularly emphasize the importance of the interaction of the helix αH6 with CL for both mitochondrial targeting and pro-apoptotic activity of tBid. These support the notion that tBid acts as a bifunctional molecule: first, it binds to mitochondrial CL via its helix αH6 and destabilizes mitochondrial structure and function, and then it promotes through its BH3 domain the activation and oligomerization of Bax and/or Bak, leading to cytochrome c release and execution of apoptosis. Our findings also imply an active role of the membrane in modulating the interactions between Bcl-2 proteins that has so far been underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W1964963261,"Background PI3Kγ functions in the immune compartment to promote inflammation in response to G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and PI3Kγ also acts within the heart itself both as a negative regulator of cardiac contractility and as a pro-survival factor. Thus, PI3Kγ has the potential to both promote and limit M I/R injury. Methodology/Principal Findings Complete PI3Kγ−/− mutant mice, catalytically inactive PI3KγKD/KD (KD) knock-in mice, and control wild type (WT) mice were subjected to in vivo myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (M I/R) injury. Additionally, bone-marrow chimeric mice were constructed to elucidate the contribution of the inflammatory response to cardiac damage. PI3Kγ−/− mice exhibited a significantly increased infarction size following reperfusion. Mechanistically, PI3Kγ is required for activation of the Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway (AKT/ERK1/2) and regulates phospholamban phosphorylation in the acute injury response. Using bone marrow chimeras, the cardioprotective role of PI3Kγ was mapped to non-haematopoietic cells. Importantly, this massive increase in M I/R injury in PI3Kγ−/− mice was rescued in PI3Kγ kinase-dead (PI3KγKD/KD) knock-in mice. However, PI3KγKD/KD mice exhibited a cardiac injury similar to wild type animals, suggesting that specific blockade of PI3Kγ catalytic activity has no beneficial effects. Conclusions/Significance Our data show that PI3Kγ is cardioprotective during M I/R injury independent of its catalytic kinase activity and that loss of PI3Kγ function in the hematopoietic compartment does not affect disease outcome. Thus, clinical development of specific PI3Kγ blockers should proceed with caution."

Although the term replicative senescence indicates the widely accepted model of a terminal growth arrest because of telomere attrition, an apparently identical process called premature senescence can be acutely produced in response to activated oncogenes, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and suboptimal cell culture conditions (4Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). These observations imply that senescence is a cellular response to stress that limits the proliferation of damaged cells. Based on such antiproliferative effects, cellular senescence was proposed to be a tumor-suppressive, fail-safe mechanism that shares conceptual and possibly therapeutic similarities with the apoptosis machinery (5Campisi J.

There is now substantial evidence that cellular senescence is a bona fide barrier to tumorigenesis and cells must overcome it to progress to full-blown malignancy. For example, recent studies suggest that oncogene-induced senescence occurs and suppresses tumorigenesis in vivo.

Significantly, the role of p16INK4a/pRB in the senescence of primary cells can be recapitulated in tumor cells.

Intriguingly, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like p14ARF, p21CIP1, and p27KIP1, which are required for senescence, can induce markers of senescence on their own. However, they cannot mediate the senescent shape change, demonstrating that these two processes in senescence are separable (33Alexander K. Hinds P.W. Mol.

Using several model systems of senescence, including long-term passage and acute expression of Ras or pRB, work in our laboratory has shown that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a serine/threonine kinase that displays kinase activity predominantly in postmitotic neurons, plays a central role in the morphology change of senescent cells (36Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol.

Expression of pRB in pRB-deficient SAOS-2 cells activates CDK5 during the course of senescence. Induction of CDK5 activity leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the ERM family member, Ezrin, as well as the repression of Rac GTPase activation, which are coincident with acquisition of the pRB-induced senescent phenotypes. However, little is known about how CDK5 is activated in senescent cells induced by pRB. In this study, we show that p35, one of the known activators of CDK5 in neurons, is required for CDK5 activation and the cell morphology change in pRB-induced SAOS-2 senescence. An increase of p35 at the mRNA level was also detected upon pRB expression in SAOS-2 cells, as well as in senescing IMR90 human diploid fibroblasts after long-term passage. These results further support a role for the CDK5/p35 pathway in regulating cellular senescence, which may provide insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying the induction of the senescent phenotype and its impact on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The human osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 subclone 2.4 (39Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A.

Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells and IMR90 HDFs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The pSVE and pSVE-Rb expression plasmids have been previously described (39Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 40Mittnacht S. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The lentivirus expression plasmids pZsG and pZsG-Rb were constructed in our laboratory. The pLKO-p35shRNA-17, -18, and -20 constructs were purchased from Open Biosystems (Clone IDs: TRCN0000006217, TRCN0000006218, TRCN0000006220). SAOS-2 cells were transfected at 80% confluency with the indicated plasmids by using Fugene6 (Roche). SAOS-2 transfectants were selected with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) 24-h post-transfection or infection and maintained under selection for the duration of the experiment. Cells were lysed in 100–200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) plus protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mg of aprotinin/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, 100 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium PPi) per 10-cm plate. Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, 30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in a trans-blotting buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (36Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunoblotting include: anti-Cdk5 monoclonal J-3, polyclonal C-8, and anti-p35 polyclonal C-19 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pRB monoclonal 245 (Pharmingen), anti-Ezrin monoclonal 3C12 (NeoMarkers), anti-GAPDH monoclonal MAB374 (Chemicon), anti-actin monoclonal C-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal DM1A (Calbiochem). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunosciences) were used, and signal was detected by ECL (PerkinElmer). An in vitro CDK5-associated histone H1 kinase activity (CDK5 kinase activity) assay was carried out as described by Zheng et al., with slight modifications (37Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1163-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Zheng M. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 141-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation for CDK5 was performed by incubating 100 μg of cell lysate with 1 μg of anti-Cdk5 C-8 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the immunocomplexes were used to determine the kinase activity at 37 °C for 30 min, using 1 μg of histone H1 as a substrate. SAOS-2 cells seeded on coverslips were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Fugene6 (Roche). Cells fixed with 4% formaldehyde were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, followed by primary antibody or rhodamine phalloidin (Cytoskeleton) incubation overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. After staining, coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount G and visualized using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope. Total RNA was extracted from cells transfected with pRB using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 100 ng of DNase I-treated RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was carried out by employing the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and using 1 μl of the cDNA per reaction. The primer sequences are as follows: p35: 5′-AAGAACGCCAAGGACAAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCATTGTTGAGGTGCGTGAT-3′; GAPDH: 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GTGCGGCTGCTTCCATAA-3′; IL-6: 5′-AACCTGAACCTTCCAAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGGCTTGTTCCTCACTACT-3′; IL-8: 5′-ACTGAGAGTGATTGAGAGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-AACCCTCTGCACCCAGTTTTC-3′; MMP2: 5′-CCGTCGCCCATCATCAAGTT-3′ and 5′-CTGTCTGGGGCAGTCCAAAG-3′; MMP3: 5′-ATGGACAAAGGATACAACAGGGA-3′ and 5′-TGTGAGTGAGTGATAGAGTGGG-3′; PAI-1: 5′-GCTTGTCCAAGAGTGCATGGT-3′ and 5′-AGGGCTGGTTCTCGATGGT-3′. Relative quantification of gene expression was carried out by the comparative C(T) method (42Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). SAOS-2 cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids. Transfectants were selected with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) 24-h post-transfection for the duration of the experiment. The staining for perinuclear SA-β-gal activity was performed as described (2Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde. Cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °C overnight with fresh senescence-associated-β-galactosidase staining solution (1 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside per ml, 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate (pH 6), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide). By using several model systems of senescence, we previously showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation is up-regulated in senescing cells (36Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CDK5 kinase activity is stimulated by either one of two non-cyclin regulatory proteins, p35 and p39. Although CDK5 expression is ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, the expression of its activators is largely restricted to post-mitotic neurons (43Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). No other activators are known. Thus, we asked if p35 and p39 are also expressed in the osteosarcoma cell lines used as senescence models in our study. The expression of mRNA encoding p35 and p39 in SAOS-2 (pRB-deficient) and U2OS (wtpRB) cells was detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting for p35 was then performed with α-p35 (C19) polyclonal antibody. Because of a short half-life of less than 30 min (44Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), p35 only became detectable when U2OS and SAOS-2 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) for 16 h (Fig. 1B). These experiments indicate that both p35 and p39 are candidates for CDK5 activation in senescing cells. Because of a lack of appropriate reagents for analyzing p39, the following experiments focused on p35. Both the protein levels and activity of CDK5 were shown to be up-regulated in pRB-transfected SAOS-2 cells (36Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the involvement of p35 in CDK5 activation. Using both retrovirus (data not shown) and lentivirus-based p35 shRNA constructs (Fig. 2A), the ectopically expressed p35 was shown to be efficiently knocked-down in SAOS-2 cells. SAOS-2 cells were then cotransfected with a pRB expression vector and a p35 shRNA construct or control empty vectors. Cells were harvested for cell lysates 5 days after pRB reintroduction. Performance of a CDK5 immunoprecipitation and a subsequent in vitro kinase assay using histone H1 as a substrate showed that the activity of CDK5 decreased upon knocking down p35, despite the continued presence of pRB (Fig. 2B). The data suggest that p35 is an activator of CDK5 in pRB-induced senescence in SAOS-2 cells. Ectopic expression of pRB in the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line produces a response that displays many characteristics of senescence in primary diploid cells, including the distinct morphological change termed flat cell formation, typified by an increased cell area and a flattened appearance. This phenotype appears identical to that observed during classical senescence and is taken as an indicator of the senescent state (31Xu H.J. Zhou Y. Ji W. Perng G.S. Kruzelock R. Kong C.T. Bast R.C. Mills G.B. Li J. Hu S.X. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Alexander K. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3616-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Because we previously found that CDK5 was required for this aspect of senescent cell morphology (36Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we next investigated the role of p35 in the senescence phenotype. SAOS-2 cells cotransfected with a pRB expression vector and p35 shRNA constructs were examined for senescence by SA-β-gal assay 10 days post-transfection. Cells transfected with empty vectors were used as a control (Fig. 3A). Knockdown of p35 antagonized the formation of pRB-induced senescent flat cells, and cells in the knockdown groups were generally smaller. To better analyze the shape change, cell area was measured in each group and subjected to statistical analysis (Fig. 3B). The result showed that by knocking down p35, the average area of pRB-induced senescent cells was reduced, and this difference was statistically significant, supporting a role for p35 as a regulator of the senescent phenotype. To further confirm the specificity of the p35 knockdowns, shape changes were analyzed in pRB-transfected cells in which CDK5, p35, or both were subjected to knockdown (Fig. 3C). By measuring cell area, cells in each knockdown group were shown to have significantly reduced flat cell formation compared with pRB control cells, but there were no significant differences among all knockdown groups. In the absence of CDK5, changes in p35 levels did not confer further reduction in cell area, suggesting that the effects of p35 on senescence are mediated through CDK5. To demonstrate that similar results can be observed in other cells that lack a functional pRB pathway, we used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, which is p16-deficient. By reintroducing p16 into these cells, a premature senescence response can also be induced as in SAOS-2 (32Dai C.Y. Enders G.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Firstly, U2OS cells cotransfected with a p16 expression vector and p35 shRNA constructs were examined for senescence by SA-β-gal assay 10 days post-transfection, using cells transfected with empty vectors as a control (Fig. 4A). Secondly, shape changes were quantified by measuring cell area in each group (Fig. 4B). The results showed that knockdown of p35 in U2OS significantly suppressed the senescent morphology change induced by p16 overexpression. CDK5-dependent flattening of senescent cells suggests that extensive changes must occur to the cellular cytoskeletons as cells undergo senescence. CDK5 has known roles in regulating cell shape through actin reorganization. With this in mind, we investigated the effect of p35 on the changes in cytoskeleton structure as cells underwent senescence. SAOS-2 cells cotransfected with a pRB expression vector and a p35 shRNA construct or control vectors were fixed with 4% formaldehyde 10 days post-transfection and immunofluorescence staining for cytoskeleton organization in the samples was performed by using rhodamine phalloidin or α-tubulin antibody. No significant change in microtubule arrangement was observed (Fig. 5A, upper panels), whereas knockdown of p35 interfered with actin polymerization. In the knockdown group, cells exhibited less intense F-actin fiber staining, along with a reduction in size (Fig. 5A, lower panels). Further, immunoblotting showed that the level of actin was reduced by p35 knockdown (Fig. 5C). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the expression of the ERM family member, Ezrin, an actin-binding protein involved in membrane-cytoskeletal signaling, is increased upon pRB-induced senescence. The activation of Ezrin appears to be the consequence of direct phosphorylation of Thr-235 of the protein by CDK5, which is activated in response to pRB expression (37Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1163-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We thus also checked the status of Ezrin in SAOS-2 cells transfected with pRB and p35 shRNA constructs or control vectors. p35 knockdown cells showed reduced immunofluorescence staining for both F-actin and Ezrin (Fig. 5B), compared with control senescent cells induced by pRB, that was accompanied by an overall decrease in Ezrin levels (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, similar results were observed in U2OS cells (Fig. 5D). p35 knockdown cells showed less intense staining for both F-actin and Ezrin when compared with p16-induced senescent cells. The localization of Ezrin in p35 knockdown cells also remained mostly cytosolic as in control cells, whereas in senescent cells Ezrin was relocated to the membrane periphery. Taken together, these data suggest that p35 is required for the acquisition of the senescent morphology in pRB-induced senescence, which is consistent with our previous finding that CDK5 activity is required in such changes. To understand if the regulation of p35 mRNA or protein levels is a significant determinant of CDK5 activity during pRB-induced senescence, SAOS-2 cells infected with pRB lentivirus or control GFP virus were collected at 2, 5, and 10 days post-infection. Both semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to examine p35 mRNA levels in these samples. Compared with control, pRB infectants showed an approximate 2-fold increase in p35 levels at day 5 and a slight increase at day 10 (Fig. 6A). Concomitantly, both endogenous p35 protein levels and CDK5 activity increased 5 days after pRB infection (Fig. 6B). We have also shown that CDK5 is activated in different model systems of senescence, including long-term passage and acute expression of Ras or pRB (36Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To see if the increase of p35 expression is a general phenomenon in cells undergoing senescence, we induced senescence in IMR90 HDFs by long-term passage. The p35 mRNA levels were examined by real-time PCR in early and mid passages of IMR90 human diploid fibroblasts (Fig. 6C, left panel). This showed that expression of p35 mRNA was also up-regulated in senescing IMR90 HDFs. Concomitantly, SA-β-gal staining showed more senescent cells at later passage (Fig. 6C, right panel). These findings strongly suggest that p35 regulates CDK5 activity during the process of senescence. Our previous work and that shown above clearly implicate p35/cdk5 in the senescent cell shape change. However, the physiological significance of this shape change and its impact on the microenvironment of the senescent cell is unclear. To determine if p35/cdk5 could mediate senescent cell processes that may directly affect tissue homeostasis and/or tumor formation, we chose to analyze the impact of p35 knockdown on the expression of genes encoding secreted factors. This analysis was based on increasing evidence that senescent cells show altered expression of many secreted gene products that regulate proliferation (i.e. increased production of PAI-1), impact the immune response (i.e. increased amounts of IL-6, IL-8), and influence remodeling of the extracellular stroma or matrix (ECM), (i.e. increased production of matrix metalloproteinase 1(MMP1) and MMP3) (45Adams P.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 2-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To understand if the regulation of p35 mRNA affects the senescence secretome in pRB-induced senescent SAOS-2 cells, cells cotransfected with a pRB expression vector and a p35 shRNA construct or control vectors were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR for examining changes in a variety of secreted factors in these samples (Fig. 7). Compared with control, pRB transfectants showed a significant increase in all the factors analyzed except MMP3, whereas upon p35 knockdown, the production of these factors were suppressed. This suggests that p35 not only participates in the regulation of cytoskeletal structures but affects other aspects of senescence as well. We have previously reported the activation of CDK5 in human primary and tumor cells induced to senesce by a variety of stimuli, and the activity of CDK5 is necessary for proper acquisition of the cytoskeletal changes accompanying senescence. Discovery of this role for CDK5 was unexpected, because its activity has primarily been associated with post-mitotic neurons. However, given that CDK5 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, an increasing body of evidence has established CDK5 kinase activity and functions in non-neuronal cells. In this report we show the presence of the CDK5 activators, p35 and p39, in our model systems of senescence. Up-regulation of the expression of p35 is concomitant with CDK5 activation in senescing SAOS2 and IMR90 cells. Knockdown of p35 by shRNA markedly suppresses the morphologic changes of senescent SAOS-2 cells induced by pRB, which coincides with a decrease in CDK5 activity. The polymerization of actin filaments is inhibited in the p35 knockdown cells, and the levels of actin and the F-actin-associated Ezrin are reduced as well. These findings underscore a role for CDK5/p35 activity in mediating the cytoskeletal reorganization in the non-neuronal senescent cells. Furthermore, the use of model systems in which senescence is induced by pRB reintroduction in p16Ink4a/pRB-deficient tumor cells strongly implicates the pRB pathway in CDK5/p35 up-regulation at least in part through transcriptional up-regulation of p35. Although the pRB pathway is essential for the transcriptional repression of loci in senescent cells (46Narita M. Nũnez S. Heard E. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar), its role in the induction of gene expression in senescence is poorly understood. Because pRB/E2F complexes are usually repressive, they most likely do not directly regulate the genes that are highly expressed by senescent cells, although they could indirectly control such genes, for example, by silencing a repressor. At present, we have been unable to test for a direct role for pRB in regulating p35 mRNA production, as reporter constructs containing the p35 promoter do not respond to pRB (data not shown). It is possible that pRB effects on the p35 promoter, whether direct or indirect, require an appropriate chromatin context as observed for differentiation-specific promoters (47Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 303-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Senescent cells show striking changes in gene expression. Interestingly, many changes in gene expression appear not to be directly related to growth arrest. Despite the universality of morphological changes observed in a wide variety of senescent cells, little is known about the potential contribution of this phenotype to the establishment or maintenance of the irreversible growth arrest that accompanies senescence. Significant additional studies of the role of cytoskeletal rearrangement in the biochemical and proliferative aspects typical of senescence are needed to fully appreciate the role of CDK5/p35 in this process. The role of CDK5/p35 activity in regulating the differentiation of monocytes might provide some clues. In promyelocytic HL60 cells, treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) results in the up-regulation of the Egr1 gene, which in turn activates p35 transcription and expression, and subsequently enhances CDK5 activity. p35-associated CDK5 phosphorylates MEK1 on Thr-286, preventing MAPK/ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. However, MEK1 phosphorylation at Thr-286 requires prior Ser-218 and Ser-222 phosphorylation and activation by Raf1 induced by growth factors or cytokines. These events are suggested to result in the up-regulation of p27 and eventually, monocytic differentiation (48Chen F. Wang Q. Wang X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5425-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49Rosales J.L. Lee K.Y. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Given the established role of pRB in osteoblast differentiation (47Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 303-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it is possible that complex mechanisms such as these are stimulated by pRB in senescing mesenchymal cells that are unable to properly differentiate. There is now substantial evidence that induction of senescence constitutes an important block to tumor progression. It has also become clear that senescent cells have characteristic alterations in secreted growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, extracellular-matrix components, and matrix-degrading enzymes, which could influence the growth of adjacent neighboring tumor cells by altering the tissue microenvironment (4Campisi J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 45Adams P.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 2-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We find that p35/cdk5 can influence this senescence secretome, implicating cdk5 in the physiological response to this aspect of senescence. Further, recent studies suggest that, as with CDK5 in neurons, the CDK5 activity in non-neuronal cells may influence phenotypic changes mostly through its direct or indirect effect on the organization of cytoskeletal structures. CDK5 regulates cellular processes such as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, cell migration and wound healing in a variety of tissues (49Rosales J.L. Lee K.Y. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus the induction of senescent shape change may also impact the neighboring tumor cells and their microenvironment. Tumor cells are exposed to many sources of stress, especially those derived from the aberrant proliferative signals of oncogenes. As one of the cellular responses to these stresses, senescence has emerged as a compelling target for future cancer therapeutics and may determine the response of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Because senescence effector mechanisms are still largely unknown, understanding the molecular mechanisms through which CDK5 affects cellular senescence may give clues to potential therapeutic approaches for cancer and age-related diseases. Finally, the intriguing relationship of this aspect of senescence to neuronal and non-neuronal differentiation (48Chen F. Wang Q. Wang X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5425-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 50Lazaro J.B. Kitzmann M. Poul M.A. Vandromme M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2035330670,"A major innate immune function of microglia in the central nervous system is receptor-mediated phagocytosis of tissue debris and pathogens. We studied how phagocytosis of degenerated myelin (i.e., tissue debris) and zymosan (i.e., yeast pathogen) is regulated by the cytoskeleton through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and the small GTPase Rho and its effector Rho-kinase (ROCK) in primary mouse microglia. Our observations suggest a dual role of activation and inhibition of phagocytosis by MLCK and Rho/ ROCK signaling. MLCK activated, whereas Rho/ROCK down-regulated complement receptor-3 (CR3) mediated, phagocytosis of C3bi-opsonized and nonopsonized myelin. These opposing roles of MLCK and Rho/ROCK depended on the preferential spatial localization of their distinctive functions. MLCK further activated, and Rho/ROCK down-regulated, phagocytosis of nonopsonized zymosan by nonopsonic receptors (e.g., Dectin-1). In contrast, MLCK down-regulated, but Rho/ROCK activated, CR3-mediated phagocytosis of C3bi-opsonized zymosan. Thus MLCK and Rho/ROCK can each activate or inhibit phagocytosis but always act in opposition. Whether activation or inhibition occurs depends on the nature of the phagocytosed particle (C3bi-opsonized or nonopsonized myelin or zymosan) and the receptors mediating each phagocytosis.—Gitik, M., Reichert, F., Rotshenker, S.

The mechanism of the Pdr.Pdx redox couple has been investigated by a variety of techniques. One of the exceptions is x-ray crystallography as the native partners associate weakly and resist co-crystallization. Here, we present the 2.6-A x-ray structure of a catalytically active complex between Pdr and Pdx C73S/C85S chemically cross-linked via the Lys(409Pdr)-Glu(72Pdx) pair. The 365 A(2) Pdr-Pdx interface is predominantly hydrophobic with one central Arg(310Pdr)-Asp(38Pdx) salt bridge, likely assisting docking and orienting the partners optimally for electron transfer, and a few peripheral hydrogen bonds. A predicted 12-A-long electron transfer route between FAD and [2Fe-2S] includes flavin flanking Trp(330Pdr) and the iron ligand Cys(39Pdx). The x-ray model agrees well with the experimental and theoretical results and suggests that the linked Pdx must undergo complex movements during turnover to accommodate P450(cam), which could limit the Pdx-to-P450(cam) electron transfer reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1993802235,"Polymorphism in the neuropeptide S receptor gene NPSR1 is associated with asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. NPSR1 is expressed in the brain, where it modulates anxiety and responses to stress, but also in other tissues and cell types including lymphocytes, the lungs, and the intestine, where it appears to be up-regulated in inflammation. We sought to determine whether genetic variability at the NPSR1 locus influences the susceptibility and clinical manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).From the Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EIRA) case-control study, 1,888 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 888 controls were genotyped for 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire NPSR1 gene and 220 KB of DNA on chromosome 7p14. The association between individual genetic markers and their haplotypic combinations, respectively, and diagnosis of RA, presence of autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins (ACPA), and disease activity score based on 28 joints (DAS28) was tested. There was no association between diagnosis of RA and NPSR1 variants. However, several associations of nominal significance were detected concerning susceptibility to ACPA-negative RA and disease activity measures (DAS28). Among these, the association of SNP rs324987 with ACPA-negative RA [(p=0.004, OR=0.674 (95% CI 0.512-0.888)] and that of SNP rs10263447 with DAS28 [p=0.0002, OR=0.380 (95% CI 0.227-0.635)] remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons.NPSR1 polymorphism may be relevant to RA susceptibility and its clinical manifestation. Specific alleles at the NPSR1 locus may represent common risk factors for chronic inflammatory diseases, including RA."
https://openalex.org/W2021069929,"Allergic asthma is characterized by airway eosinophilia, increased mucin production and allergen-specific IgE. Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIb), an inhibitory IgG receptor, has recently emerged as a negative regulator of allergic diseases like anaphylaxis and allergic rhinitis. However, no studies to date have evaluated its role in allergic asthma. Our main objective was to study the role of FcγRIIb in allergic lung inflammation. We used a murine model of allergic airway inflammation. Inflammation was quantified by BAL inflammatory cells and airway mucin production. FcγRIIb expression was measured by qPCR and flow cytometry and the cytokines were quantified by ELISA. Compared to wild type animals, FcγRIIb deficient mice mount a vigorous allergic lung inflammation characterized by increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity, eosinophilia and mucin content upon ragweed extract (RWE) challenge. RWE challenge in sensitized mice upregulated FcγRIIb in the lungs. Disruption of IFN-γ gene abrogated this upregulation. Treatment of naïve mice with the Th1-inducing agent CpG DNA increased FcγRIIb expression in the lungs. Furthermore, treatment of sensitized mice with CpG DNA prior to RWE challenge induced greater upregulation of FcγRIIb than RWE challenge alone. These observations indicated that RWE challenge upregulated FcγRIIb in the lungs by IFN-γ- and Th1-dependent mechanisms. RWE challenge upregulated FcγRIIb on pulmonary CD14+/MHC II+ mononuclear cells and CD11c+ cells. FcγRIIb deficient mice also exhibited an exaggerated RWE-specific IgE response upon sensitization when compared to wild type mice. We propose that FcγRIIb physiologically regulates allergic airway inflammation by two mechanisms: 1) allergen challenge mediates upregulation of FcγRIIb on pulmonary CD14+/MHC II+ mononuclear cells and CD11c+ cells by an IFN-γ dependent mechanism; and 2) by attenuating the allergen specific IgE response during sensitization. Thus, stimulating FcγRIIb may be a therapeutic strategy in allergic airway disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2148440243,"Accurate response to external directional signals is essential for many physiological functions such as chemotaxis or axonal guidance. It relies on the detection and amplification of gradients of chemical cues, which, in eukaryotic cells, involves the asymmetric relocalization of signaling molecules. How molecular events coordinate to induce a polarity at the cell level remains however poorly understood, particularly for nerve chemotaxis. Here, we propose a model, inspired by single-molecule experiments, for the membrane dynamics of GABA chemoreceptors in nerve growth cones (GCs) during directional sensing. In our model, transient interactions between the receptors and the microtubules, coupled to GABA-induced signaling, provide a positive-feedback loop that leads to redistribution of the receptors towards the gradient source. Using numerical simulations with parameters derived from experiments, we find that the kinetics of polarization and the steady-state polarized distribution of GABA receptors are in remarkable agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, we make predictions on the properties of the GC seen as a sensing, amplification and filtering module. In particular, the growth cone acts as a low-pass filter with a time constant approximately 10 minutes determined by the Brownian diffusion of chemoreceptors in the membrane. This filtering makes the gradient amplification resistant to rapid fluctuations of the external signals, a beneficial feature to enhance the accuracy of neuronal wiring. Since the model is based on minimal assumptions on the receptor/cytoskeleton interactions, its validity extends to polarity formation beyond the case of GABA gradient sensing. Altogether, it constitutes an original positive-feedback mechanism by which cells can dynamically adapt their internal organization to external signals."
https://openalex.org/W2043632371,"The replication terminator protein Fob1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is multifunctional, and it not only promotes polar replication fork arrest at the tandem Ter sites located in the intergenic spacer region of rDNA but also loads the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 at Ter sites via a protein complex called RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit). Sir2 is a component of the RENT complex, and its loading not only silences intrachromatid recombination in rDNA but also RNA polymerase II-catalyzed transcription. Here, we present three lines of evidence showing that the two aforementioned activities of Fob1 are independent of each other as well as functionally separable. First, a Fob1 ortholog of Saccharomyces bayanus expressed in a fob1Delta strain of S. cerevisiae restored polar fork arrest at Ter but not rDNA silencing. Second, a mutant form (I407T) of S. cerevisiae Fob1 retained normal fork arresting activity but was partially defective in rDNA silencing. We further show that the silencing defect of S. bayanus Fob1 and the Iota407Tau mutant of S. cerevisiae Fob1 were caused by the failure of the proteins to interact with two members of the S. cerevisiae RENT complex, namely S. cerevisiae Sir2 and S. cerevisiae Net1. Third, deletions of the intra-S phase checkpoint proteins Tof1 and Csm3 abolished fork arrest by Fob1 at Ter without causing loss of silencing. Taken together, the data support the conclusion that unlike some other functions of Fob1, rDNA silencing at Ter is independent of fork arrest."

The focus on olfactory perception is based on the overlap of brain areas often proposed to be affected in CM patients and the projection areas of the olfactory system, including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula and hippocampus.Twelve women with CM and 10 controls participated in the study. All participants were, or have been, patients in a psychosomatic clinic. Participants underwent a fMRI investigation during olfactory stimulation with a neutral (coffee) and a pleasant (peach) odor. Furthermore, odor threshold and odor identification (Sniffin' Sticks) were tested.Both groups showed normal activation in the olfactory projection areas. However, in the CM-group we found additionally enhanced activation in multiple, mainly neocortical, areas that are part of those involved in associative networks. These include the precentral frontal lobe, inferior and middle frontal structures, posterior parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and the posterior cingulate cortex.The results indicate that in this group of patients, CM was associated with an altered processing of olfactory stimuli, but not development of a functional olfactory deficit. This complements other studies on CM insofar as we found the observed pattern of enhanced activation in associative and emotional regions even following non-traumatic olfactory cues."

Prior studies, focusing on persons with advanced HIV, have shown no decline in markers of cellular activation in response to TB therapy alone. Methodology This prospective cohort study, composed of participants within a larger phase 3 open-label randomized controlled clinical trial, measured the impact of TB treatment on immune activation in persons with non-advanced HIV infection (CD4>350 cells/mm3) and pulmonary TB. HIV load, CD4 count, and markers of immune activation (CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4 and CD8 T cells) were measured prior to starting, during, and for 6 months after completion of standard 6 month anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy in 38 HIV infected Ugandans with smear and culture confirmed pulmonary TB. Results Expression of CD38, and co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, on CD8 cells declined significantly within 3 months of starting standard TB therapy in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy, and remained suppressed for 6 months after completion of therapy. In contrast, HIV load and CD4 count remained unchanged throughout the study period. Conclusion TB therapy leads to measurable decreases in immune activation in persons with HIV/TB co-infection and CD4 counts >350 cells/mm3."

Deletion of this gene causes lethality in mice, and DNA sequence variation in this gene is associated with alcoholism and Parkinson's disease, among other disorders. The Caucasian SLC18A2 promoter has at least 20 haplotypes (A–T), with A representing two-thirds of 1460 chromosomes. It is not known why A is selected in the human lineage. To understand the selection, here we took a functional approach by investigating the regulations of 4 representative haplotypes (A, C, G, and T) by 17 agents. We show that 76.5% of the agents were able to regulate A but only 11.8–23.5% of them regulated the 3 other infrequent ones, observing a positive correlation between haplotype frequency and regulatability. Pathway and molecular analyses revealed five signaling hubs that regulate the four haplotypes differentially, probably through targeting the polymorphic core promoter region. These findings suggest that greater diversity of transcriptional regulations is the driving force for the haplotype selection in SLC18A2.—Lin, Z., Zhao, Y., Chung, C.

https://openalex.org/W2024857381,"Long-range oscillations of the mammalian cell proliferation rate are commonly observed both in vivo and in vitro. Such complicated dynamics are generally the result of a combination of stochastic events and deterministic regulation. Assessing the role, if any, of chaotic regulation is difficult. However, unmasking chaotic dynamics is essential for analysis of cellular processes related to proliferation rate, including metabolic activity, telomere homeostasis, gene expression, and tumor growth.Using a simple, original, nonlinear method based on return maps, we previously found a geometrical deterministic structure coordinating such fluctuations in populations of various cell types. However, nonlinearity and determinism are only necessary conditions for chaos; they do not by themselves constitute a proof of chaotic dynamics. Therefore, we used the same analytical method to analyze the oscillations of four well-known, low-dimensional, chaotic oscillators, originally designed in diverse settings and all possibly well-adapted to model the fluctuations of cell populations: the Lorenz, Rössler, Verhulst and Duffing oscillators. All four systems also display this geometrical structure, coordinating the oscillations of one or two variables of the oscillator. No such structure could be observed in periodic or stochastic fluctuations.Theoretical models predict various cell population dynamics, from stable through periodically oscillating to a chaotic regime. Periodic and stochastic fluctuations were first described long ago in various mammalian cells, but by contrast, chaotic regulation had not previously been evidenced. The findings with our nonlinear geometrical approach are entirely consistent with the notion that fluctuations of cell populations can be chaotically controlled."

Peptides have potential as therapeutic molecules because they can be designed to engage a larger portion of the target protein with higher specificity. In the present study, we selected 16-mer peptides that interact with Bcl-XL from random and degenerate peptide libraries using mRNA display. The selected peptides have sequence similarity with the Bcl-2 family BH3 domains, and one of them has higher affinity (IC50=0.9 µM) than Bak BH3 (IC50=11.8 µM) for Bcl-XL in vitro. We also found that GFP fusions of the selected peptides specifically interact with Bcl-XL, localize in mitochondria, and induce cell death. Further, a chimeric molecule, in which the BH3 domain of Bak protein was replaced with a selected peptide, retained the ability to bind specifically to Bcl-XL. These results demonstrate that this selected peptide specifically antagonizes the function of Bcl-XL and overcomes the effects of Bcl-XL in intact cells.

In addition, the thermodynamic analysis showed that the formation of the trimer led to an apparent 100-fold affinity increase, which most likely is due to the avidity effect caused by the three-fold clustering of CTLD domains in the complete protein. Comparison of ensembles of natural CTLD domains for which the known structure and ligand specificity are known shows that the ligand-binding site can accommodate a diverse range of ligands. We therefore concluded that the tetranectin CTLD might be a useful scaffold for designing novel protein therapeutics. We could change the sequence of loops within the CTLD scaffold in the monomeric version without perturbing the overall structure. Thus, CTLD serves as an efficient starting point for the in vitro selection of a high affinity antagonist with a low immunogenicity. In this procedure, we use the monomeric CTLD domain during the in vitro selection procedure but use the naturally occurring trimeric version in downstream applications.

Borean Pharma established an extended and coherent technology platform to use C-type lectins as a vehicle for the creation of novel trimeric therapeutic proteins with increased avidity and unique properties as compared with current protein therapeutics, such as antibodies and small protein scaffolds. Human tetranectin may be readily tailored to meet specific therapeutic needs by “reprogramming” CTLD. Each CTLD has five loop regions, each 6–9 amino acids in length, which determine the binding specificities. Reprogramming is performed by creating phage libraries displaying CTLD, where specific loops are randomized, followed by selection. Randomization can be repeated either sequentially or iteratively. Furthermore, the use of the CTLD platform ensures selected protein candidates, which are highly homologous to a native human secreted protein and thus of low immunogenicity. Initial validation of this novel scaffold technology was achieved by selecting an antagonist of hTNFα, as described herein. Subsequently, the platform has been effectively used on a number of diverse and therapeutically relevant targets. Current potency of the tetranectin-derived hTNFα antagonist was obtained through carefully managed in vitro evolution steps (Fig. 1). After each step, the binding kinetics were measured, as well as the ability of the trimeric version to inhibit hTNFα-induced apoptosis in L929 cells (see Table 1).TABLE 1Binding kinetics of monomeric CTLD toward hTNFα and inhibitory constant of the trimeric CTLDMaturation roundCloneKDaPrimary, first, and second clones were analyzed with ∼500 RU ligand immobilized, and the third clone was analyzed with ∼50 RU.

A construct expressing the full-length protein of TN-2-B-1-C31 was created by cloning the coding region of TN-2-B-1-C31 into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector pT7CIIH6-AmpR (8Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Clemmensen I. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli (strain BL21 DE3) cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 100 ml of lysis buffer by sonication followed by the addition of detergent buffer and inclusion body recovery for refolding in the present first generation procedure. Inclusion bodies were washed with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, and resuspended in 6 m guanidine, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. After inclusion body solubilization, the buffer was changed to 8 m urea, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the fusion CTLD was captured on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). After elution with 8 m urea, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, the fusion CTLD was refolded by dilution with 3 m urea, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 9.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5/0.3 mm GSH/GSSG overnight at a rate of 0.15 ml/min to a final dilution of 10× sample volume at +7 °C with mixing. After refolding, the CTLD was purified further on SP-Sepharose FF in 8 m urea, 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fusion tag was cleaved by recombinant human granzyme B in 1 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2 overnight before a final purification on a SOURCE 15S column in 8 m urea, 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, 0–1 m NaCl gradient and finally buffer-exchanged into 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.0, buffer. E. coli strain BL-21 (Invitrogen) was transformed with a pT7-CIIH6-TNFα expression vector encoding human TNFα and grown to an A600 of 0.5 in standard tryptone-yeast extract medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 mm MgSO4 before induction with λCE46 phage and rifampicin addition to 200 μg/ml. Cells from 6 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation, washed (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 m NaCl), sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and the fusion TNFα was captured, eluted, and further purified on an SP-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). Digestion with factor Xa at +5 °C overnight was applied afterward. The protease and cleaved fusion tag were captured on soybean trypsin inhibitor and nickel-nitrilotriacetic columns, respectively. A final Q-Sepharose FF step yielded a pure hTNFα batch. Surface plasmon resonance binding analysis was performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument. The hTNFα capture antibody (AHC3712) to be immobilized was dissolved in 10 mm NaAc, pH 5.0, and then immobilized on a CM5 Biacore sensor chip using the amine coupling kit (Biacore). Binding analysis was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Before loading of the protein sample, the chip was equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20. Recombinant human TNFα was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 at 10 μg/ml, and 10 μl was injected. Aliquots (20 μl) of CTLD C31 were injected using the KINJECT option. 5 minutes of dissociation were allowed before the chip was regenerated with sequential injection of 0.05% SDS and 10 mm glycine, pH 2.5. Binding of CTLD C31 was analyzed at six different protein concentrations, ranging from 1.5 to 50 nm. Binding data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation program version 3.2 (Biacore). The effect of inhibition of hTNFα by trimeric TN-2-B1-C31 was analyzed in a standard cell assay for the antagonistic effect of hTNFα binders on the cytotoxic effect of hTNFα on the murine L929 cell line as described in Ref. 9Hogan, M. M., Vogel, S. N., (2001) in Current Protocols in Immunology (Coligan, J. E., ed) p. 183, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar. The complex was formed by mixing hTNFα with CTLD at a 1:1 molar ratio. Initial crystallization screening was performed with the Crystal ScreenTM system (Hampton Research). Optimal crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of protein solution with reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.35 m MgAc, and 20% 2-propanol. The crystals were frozen directly in the crystallization solution at the I911-3 beam line at the National Laboratory for Synchrotron Radiation in Lund, Sweden, MAX-lab (10Ursby, T., C. B. M., Cerenius, Y., Svensson, C., Sommarin, B., Fodje, M. N., Kvick, Å., Logan, D. T., Als-Nielsen, J., Thunnissen, M. M. G.

The crystals belonged to the P6322 space group with cell dimensions of a = b = 84 Å, c = 150 Å. The structure of the CTLD-hTNFα complex was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (11McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14792) Google Scholar). We used a search model composed of one wild type hTNFα monomer (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1TNF) (12Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the wild type CTLD (6Kastrup J.S. Nielsen B.B. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1TN3), excluding the loops, which were changed during the in vitro evolution procedure. The resulting model was used as a starting point for wARP/ARP (13Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which did build 98% of the complex (including the maturation loops). The model was finalized with Coot (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23672) Google Scholar) and refined in REFMAC5 (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13920) Google Scholar). The final model consists of residues 9–157 for hTNFα, residues 46–180 for CTLD excluding the loop region 52–56, for which no electron density was seen, 244 water molecules, and one magnesium ion. 99.1% of the residues are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with 0.4% (1 residue) in the generously allowed region and Arg-120 from CTLD in the disallowed region. Figures were made using the program PyMOL (19DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). A primary phage display library was generated by randomizing loops 1 and 4 in the CTLD domain of tetranectin, and selection for binding to hTNFα was performed by panning. This resulted in a candidate molecule of high specificity but suboptimal affinity (Clone TN-2). This clone was then subjected to three consecutive steps of affinity maturation. First, loops 1 and 4 were randomized individually to provide full sequence coverage of each loop, and phage display selection was performed to select for higher affinity. This did not result in any changes in loop 1 (the loop 1 sequence was reselected), but 3 out of 4 amino acids were changed in loop 4 (only the 1st proline was conserved and would remain conserved throughout the maturation). An additional unexpected change occurred outside the randomized area, where DCTLD157 was changed to Gly. The significance of this change, although not fully clear, may have helped stabilize the CTLD structure and resulted in substantially improved affinity (Table 1). However, the TN-2-B clone was incapable of inhibiting hTNFα-induced apoptosis. In the second maturation step, loop 1 was randomized in increments of 3 amino acids, and the selection procedure was changed to favor clones with low off-rates. This was done by including prolonged washing steps and competition by free hTNFα. The resulting TN-B-1 clone showed a 300-fold reduction in off-rate and improved bioactivity. During the third and final stage of maturation, loop 3 was randomized together with two positions in loop 4. This only led to a marginal improvement in the binding kinetics (35-fold in affinity and 6-fold in off-rate for the monomeric CTLD). However, the bioactivity improved by almost 200-fold for the trimeric tetranectin derivative. The improved bioactivity of clones obtained by applying selective pressure for “better” dissociation kinetics demonstrated the potential of this strategy to improve the efficacy of tetranectin-based therapeutics. It should be noted that the selection as well as the binding data originate from the monomeric version of CTLD, whereas the trimeric version was used for measuring the biological activity. As compared with the moderate improvement in binding of the monomeric CTLD after the third round of maturation, the 200-fold improvement in biological activity of the trimeric tetranectin derivative might well be explained by a large increase in avidity of the trimeric tetranectin derivative. To further understand the three-dimensional interactions responsible for the high affinity binding and to assure that the overall structure of tetranectin was maintained, we determined the crystal structure of the CTLD-hTNFα complex by molecular replacement at 2.1 Å resolution (Fig. 2A). The final model consists of residues 9–157 for hTNFα and residues 46–180 for CTLD, excluding residues 52–56, for which no electron density was observed (Table 2). The secondary structure of hTNFα bound to CTLD closely resembles that of free hTNFα, with a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å for Cα atoms (12Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Eck M.J. Beutler B. Kuo G. Merryweather J.P. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12816-12819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the non-randomized part of the CTLD scaffold exhibited little change in structure (root mean square deviation for Cα atoms with free native CTLD is less than 1 Å), which validates the use of human tetranectin as a scaffold or platform for engineering new biologics. As for the CTLD loops, the structure has changed substantially in the randomized loop 3 and loop 4 (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, the randomized loop 1 backbone resembles that of native CTLD despite a complete change of sequence. The side chains of the randomized maturation loops display a systematic directionality toward hTNFα, creating a visibly depressed surface in the previously rather flat hTNFα area. The buried, accessible surface area at the interface between hTNFα and the CTLD is 865 Å2, and the interaction surface features a mixture of polar, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic interactions are often the driving force in tight protein-protein interactions. However, we observed a more diverse set of interactions, which in this case is most likely found because the CTLD must adapt to the hTNFα surface, including neutralizing the charge present.TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statisticsTN-2B-1-C31:hTNFαData collectionSpace groupP6322Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)84, 84, 149α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 120Resolution (Å)74-2.1 (2.15-2.1)Rsym or Rmerge0.08 (0.48)I/σI55.1 (9.0)Completeness (%)99.9 (99.8)Redundancy33 (26.1)RefinementResolution (Å)2.1No. of reflections17855Rwork/Rfree0.17/0.22No. of atomsProtein2209Ligand/ion1Water244B-factorsProtein28.2Ligand/ion46.4Water39.185r.m.s.ar.m.s., root mean square. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.016Bond angles (°)1.16a r.m.s., root mean square. Open table in a new tab Residues KCTLD116 and SRYFCTLD-(119–122) in loop 1 are conserved throughout the maturation procedure. We were unable to select new loop 1 sequences in the first maturation round by complete randomization of loop 1. In the second round of maturation, where we performed partial randomization of loop 1, KCTLD116 and SRYFCTLD-(119–122) were reselected, and only VRCTLD-(117–118) was changed to RW. This suggests that these residues play an essential role in the binding of CTLD to hTNFα. The structure shows that they interact with a well organized loop structure in hTNFα consisting of residues 138–141 (Fig. 2B). This loop in hTNFα has multiple internal contacts; RTNF138 hydrogen-bonds with DTNF140 and is further prevented from lateral flexibility by close van der Waals packing with YTNF141, thus providing a stable binding epitope for the CTLD. RCTLD120 and YCTLD121 form hydrogen bonds with DTNF140 and RTNF138 of hTNFα, respectively. Considerable strain is put on RCTLD120, making it fit into the tight space at the complex interface, which results in ϕ/ψ angles outside the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The hydroxyl group of SCTLD119 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the backbone of KCTLD116 and FCTLD122 and thus locks the conformation of the randomized loop 1. Furthermore, SCTLD119 is situated at the center of the CTLD-TNFα interaction surface pointing into the core of the CTLD, and thus there is substantial steric restriction on this residue. KCTLD116 is also conserved in the selection procedure but does not contact hTNFα. However, KCTLD116 forms several contacts with both the backbone and the side chain of QCTLD148 and the side chain of QCTLD151. Thus, the length and charge of lysine are favorable at position 116, stabilizing the structure of the randomized loops. The selection scheme not only produces strong interactions with hTNFα but also ensures the stability of the interacting framework. Both TCTLD121 and FCTLD122 participate in close van der Waals packing with hTNFα. FCTLD122 also stacks closely with RCTLD130 and redirects the side chain of this residue toward hTNFα. RCTLD130 is found well outside the randomized part, but the side chain has adopted a completely different conformation from that found in free CTLD. The guanidine group of RCTLD130 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of ETNF104 and the backbone of TTNF105 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the backbone of RCTLD130 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of GTNF108 and ATNF109 of hTNFα. Salt bridges between flexible residues, such as glutamic acid and arginine, are usually rather unstable, but here FCTLD122 restricts the flexibility of RCTLD130, and RCTLD130 is caught in a pocket between FCTLD122 and hTNFα. Thus, not only do the randomized residues contact hTNFα themselves, but they also reprogram part of the non-randomized part of the structure to interact with hTNFα. RCTLD117 and WCTLD118 appear during the second round of maturation, where there is a selection for low off-rate of the antagonist. WCTLD118 increases the buried hydrophobic surface substantially, and it also stacks with the guanidine group of RCTLD117 and stabilizes RCTLD117 hydrogen binding with hTNFα. Loop 4 has changed conformation considerably as compared with the native tetranectin CTLD structure. However, the loop makes relatively few contacts with hTNFα that are predominantly made by WCTLD149. PCTLD146 appears in the first round of selection and is maintained throughout the maturation. We believe that PCTLD146 dictates a change in the conformation of loop 4, which is required to avoid sterical conflict with hTNFα. Thus, in the first round of selection, loop 1 provides the major part of the binding affinity, and loop 4 changes position to allow this interaction. In the later maturation stages, WCTLD149 appears and provides additional hydrophobic interaction with hTNFα and probably contributes to the lower off-rate. Loop 3 was randomized during the third and final round of selection. Loop 3 does not make any direct contact with hTNFα. However, the position of the loop has shifted substantially relative to the native CTLD structure. It is likely that the changes in loop 3 help to stabilize the conformation of both loop 3 and loop 4 and provide a more rigid interaction platform. Loop 3 is normally involved in binding of Ca2+, but Mg2+ is found bound in the former Ca2+-binding site, and crystallization is performed in the presence of Mg2+. However, none of the ions are needed for binding to hTNFα, and selections have been performed in the absence of both ions (data not shown). Several anti-TNFα drugs have been marketed, based either upon antibody technology or upon modified soluble TNFα receptor (17Maini R. St Clair E.W. Breedveld F. Furst D. Kalden J. Weisman M. Smolen J.

We compared the CTLD clone selected here with the available drugs. In our in vitro bioassays, the TN2-B1-C31 clone compared favorably to these drugs, both in terms of binding affinity and when comparing the ability to inhibit hTNFα-induced apoptosis (data not shown). In summary, the data show that the CTLD scaffold can be “reprogrammed” for binding to novel targets through a short series of directed evolutionary steps while maintaining its core scaffold structure. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the CTLD-TNFα complex provided a unique insight into the workings of directed evolution. Initial binding affinity is provided by loop 1, which is accompanied by a change in the structure of loop 4 removing steric hindrance. During later steps of selection, in which a low off-rate was favored, additional buried hydrophobic contacts appeared, represented by WCTLD118 and WCTLD149. The selection also seems to favor additional rigidity of the antagonist, as exemplified by the changes of structure in loops 3 and 4. The successful selection for low off-rates is of particular importance for development of therapeutically useful antagonists. In subsequent selections for candidates against a number of targets, low nm affinity candidates were selected in the first round and then further affinity-matured for low off-rates as described here, thereby rendering solid therapeutic drug candidates with favorable pharmacodynamic profiles.

https://openalex.org/W2094997688,"We and others have clearly demonstrated that a topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitor, such as camptothecin (CPT), coupled to a triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) through a suitable linker can be used to cause site-specific cleavage of the targeted DNA sequence in in vitro models. Here we evaluated whether these molecular tools induce sequence-specific DNA damage in a genome context. We targeted the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I axis and in particular promoter 1 of IGF-I and intron 2 of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in cancer cells. The IGF axis molecules represent important targets for anticancer strategies, because of their central role in oncogenic maintenance and metastasis processes. We chemically attached 2 CPT derivatives to 2 TFOs. Both conjugates efficiently blocked gene expression in cells, reducing the quantity of mRNA transcribed by 70-80%, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. We confirmed that the inhibitory mechanism of these TFO conjugates was mediated by Top1-induced cleavage through the use of RNA interference experiments and a camptothecin-resistant cell line. In addition, induction of phospho-H2AX foci supports the DNA-damaging activity of TFO-CPT conjugates at specific sites. The evaluated conjugates induce a specific DNA damage at the target gene mediated by Top1."
