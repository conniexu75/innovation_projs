https://openalex.org/W2159474015,"Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species."

https://openalex.org/W2092295090,"To address the question of whether established or experimental anticancer chemotherapeutics can exert their cytotoxic effects by autophagy, we performed a high-content screen on a set of cytotoxic agents. We simultaneously determined parameters of autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis on cells exposed to ∼1400 compounds. Many agents induced a ‘pure’ autophagic, apoptotic or necrotic phenotype, whereas less than 100 simultaneously induced autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis. A systematic analysis of the autophagic flux induced by the most potent 80 inducers of GFP-LC3 puncta among the NCI panel agents showed that 59 among them truly induced autophagy. The remaining 21 compounds were potent inducers of apoptosis or necrosis, yet failed to stimulate an autophagic flux, which were characterized as microtubule inhibitors. Knockdown of ATG7 was efficient in preventing GFP-LC3 puncta, yet failed to attenuate cell death by the agents that induce GFP-LC3 puncta. Thus there is not a single compound that would induce cell death by autophagy in our screening, underscoring the idea that cell death is rarely, if ever, executed by autophagy in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001893139,"Human neutrophil proteinases (elastase, proteinase-3, and cathepsin-G) are released at sites of acute inflammation. We hypothesized that these inflammation-associated proteinases can affect cell signaling by targeting proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2). The PAR family of G protein-coupled receptors is triggered by a unique mechanism involving the proteolytic unmasking of an N-terminal self-activating tethered ligand (TL). Proteinases can either activate PAR signaling by unmasking the TL sequence or disarm the receptor for subsequent enzyme activation by cleaving downstream from the TL sequence. We found that none of neutrophil elastase, cathepsin-G, and proteinase-3 can activate Gq-coupled PAR2 calcium signaling; but all of these proteinases can disarm PAR2, releasing the N-terminal TL sequence, thereby preventing Gq-coupled PAR2 signaling by trypsin. Interestingly, elastase (but neither cathepsin-G nor proteinase-3) causes a TL-independent PAR2-mediated activation of MAPK that, unlike the canonical trypsin activation, does not involve either receptor internalization or recruitment of β-arrestin. Cleavage of synthetic peptides derived from the extracellular N terminus of PAR2, downstream of the TL sequence, demonstrated distinct proteolytic sites for all three neutrophil-derived enzymes. We conclude that in inflammation, neutrophil proteinases can modulate PAR2 signaling by preventing/disarming the Gq/calcium signal pathway and, via elastase, can selectively activate the p44/42 MAPK pathway. Our data illustrate a new mode of PAR regulation that involves biased PAR2 signaling by neutrophil elastase and a disarming/silencing effect of cathepsin-G and proteinase-3.

Neutrophil infiltration represents a rapid innate immune defense mechanism that accompanies acute inflammation. Although one main neutrophil function is to target invading microorganisms and to respond to damaged tissue, there are many host cell responses triggered by the released neutrophil serine proteinases. In inflammation, apart from their bactericidal actions, the serine proteinases trigger a variety of effects ranging from cytokine, kinin, and growth factor generation to the clustering of integrins (1Meyer-Hoffert U.

Of note, many proteinases can silence/disarm PARs by cleaving downstream of the TL sequence, so as to prevent further activation by proteinases, but not by synthetic PAR-activating peptides with sequences derived from the TL (2Ramachandran R.

Rev. 2002; 54: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In previous work, we found that neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin-G (CG) can block Gq-mediated calcium signaling by trypsin-activated proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), presumably by removing the enzyme-targeted tethered ligand sequence (6Dulon S.

PAR2 activation by serine proteinases is widely considered to cause a proinflammatory response in various pathological conditions, in part via a neurogenic mechanism, and thus its disarming by neutrophil proteinases could be considered as an anti-inflammatory effect. There are also intriguing data that assign a protective function to PAR2 activation in certain inflammatory conditions (8Laukkarinen J.M. Weiss E.R. van Acker G.J. Steer M.L. Perides G. J. Biol.

The mechanism(s) for this potentially biphasic action of PAR2 is not known, but it may relate to the ability of PAR2 to exhibit biased signaling either via a Gq-coupled calcium signal or via Gi/G12/13-coupled p44/42 MAPK signals (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our recent report showed that proteolytically revealed mutated rat TL sequences and one of the PAR2-activating peptides we tested were able to trigger such biased agonism, activating MAPK but not calcium signaling pathways, without either receptor internalization or the recruitment of arrestins (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Evidence for biased signaling by PAR2 also comes from the observation that a novel peptidomimetic PAR2 antagonist could inhibit intracellular calcium release induced by a PAR2 agonist but failed to inhibit ERK signaling (13Goh F.G. Ng P.Y. Nilsson M. Kanke T. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 158: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is, however, not known if endogenous agonists can trigger biased signaling through PAR2. In trying to uncover if such biased signaling might occur in vivo, we hypothesized that neutrophil proteinases that can cleave the PAR2 N terminus but do not trigger PAR2 calcium signaling might nonetheless activate MAPK to act as endogenous biased agonists for PAR2. We show here that neutrophil proteinases (NE, CG, and proteinase-3 (PR3)) can all disarm PAR2-dependent calcium responses to trypsin, whereas NE (but neither CG nor PR3) concomitantly activates MAPK signaling. We show further that all three neutrophil proteinases can target the PAR2 N terminus to remove the TL but via cleavage at distinct cleavage sites. We propose that under inflammatory conditions, this novel TL-independent signaling via PAR2, biased toward the MAPK pathway, may underlie differential PAR2-dependent responses in inflammation. proteinase-activated receptor tethered ligand neutrophil elastase cathepsin-G proteinase-3 human proximal tubular mouse embryo fibroblast bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biarsenical fluorochrome binding domain 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. Culture medium (DMEM and DMEM/F-12) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Invitrogen. Fluo-4/AM no wash calcium indicator dye and the ReASH fluorescent probe were from Invitrogen. Fugene-6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Calcium ionophore A23187, porcine trypsin (catalogue no. T-7418; ∼14,900 units/mg), collagen type IV from human placenta, insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite, hydrocortisone, 5-triiodo-l-thyronine sodium salt, PGE-1, and EGF were from Sigma. A maximum specific activity of 20,000 units/mg was used to calculate the approximate molar concentration of trypsin in the incubation medium (1 unit/ml, ∼2 nm). The neutrophil enzymes, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin-G, and proteinase 3, purified from human sputum, were obtained from Elastin Products (Owensville, MO) with specific activities of 875, 3.1, and 95 units/mg, respectively. No trace trypsin-like activity was detectable in the enzymes as confirmed by us with a 96-well plate-based enzyme activity assay using the fluorogenic substrate, t-butoxycarbonyl-QAR-AMC (Bachem, Torrence, CA). The maximum concentrations of enzymes in our experiments were 1 μm at 3 units/ml for NE and PR3 and 4 μm at 300 milliunits/ml for CG. The NE inhibitor, fragment of elafin, was from Anaspec (Fremont, CA). NE activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate methyl-O-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC (elastase substrate V, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). The PAR-activating peptide, SLIGRL-NH2, and the rat PAR2-derived sequence ITGKGAPVEPGFSVDEFSASVLTGKLT (D27) as well as the TL-containing sequences (TL sequence underlined) for human PAR1 (NATLDPRSFLLRNPNDKYE), PAR2 (GTNRSSKGKSLIGKVDGTSHV), and PAR4 (GDDSTPSILPAPRGYPGQV) used as enzyme substrates were synthesized by the Faculty of Medicine Peptide Synthesis facility at the University of Calgary with purity verified by amino acid analysis and mass spectral analysis. KNRK and HEK cells were cultured as described previously (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells that were transfected with either the rat PAR2-encoding pCDNA3.1 vector or the empty pCDNA3.1 vector were grown in DMEM supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418. Confluent cultures were dissociated in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and subcultured as appropriate. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild type (MEFwt) and β-arrestin-1/2 double knock-out animals (MEFβarrDKO) were a gift from Dr. Robert Lefkowitz and have been described previously (14Kumar P.

Briefly, normal renal cortical tissue obtained from an adult kidney undergoing nephrectomy was dissected, minced, digested with collagenase IV, and passed through a 75-μm mesh. Filtered cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in hormonally defined medium and plated in a Petri dish. After 30 min, the non-adherent HPT cells were transferred to a collagen-coated plate and cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 125 ng/ml prostaglandin E1, 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1.8 μg/ml l-thyroxine, 3.38 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 2.5 mg/ml insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite supplement. Experiments involving the use of human tissue were approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Committee at the University of Calgary. The plasmid encoding the rat PAR2 receptor (wt-rPAR2) was constructed as described previously (17Al-Ani B. Hansen K.K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Permanent KNRK cell lines expressing PAR2 and pCDNA3.1 have been described previously (17Al-Ani B. Hansen K.K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells, used for the PAR2-biarsenical fluorochrome binding domain (BAB) construct cleavage experiments and the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments, were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1+ vector encoding the human PAR2 receptor with the N-terminal BAB tag or the pcDNA3.1 vector encoding the human PAR2 gene with a c-terminal YFP tag, using the Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were assayed 48 h post-transfection. NE activity was measured using the substrate methyl-O-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC (elastase substrate V, EMD Chemicals). 50 μl of 200 milliunits/ml elastase in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 was incubated with 50 μl of 200 μm elastase-specific substrate methyl-O-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC (elastase substrate V, EMD Chemicals). The fluorescence from the free AMC as an index of proteolytic activity was measured every 10 min for 60 min using a Victor X4 fluorescent plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In order to confirm inhibition of NE by elafin, NE and elafin were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature prior to measuring NE activity as described above. Trypsin activity was measured using the substrate t-butoxycarbonyl-QAR-AMC with similar conditions as for NE. The effect of neutrophil elastase on trypsin activity was measured by preincubating the two enzymes for 5 min at 37 °C prior to measuring trypsin activity. KNRK cells or HPT cells were incubated for 30 min with Fluo-4/AM no wash calcium indicator and assayed for calcium signaling responses as described previously (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) on a victor X4 fluorescent plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or an Aminco Bowman fluorescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Life Science). Receptor disarming was monitored essentially as described previously (18Kawabata A. Saifeddine M. Al-Ani B. Leblond L. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 358-370PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, PAR2-expressing KNRK cells or HPT cells were first exposed or not to 0.3–3 units/ml of the three neutrophil proteinases for 20 min before assaying responses to increasing concentrations of trypsin or SLIGRL-NH2. Western blot detection of p44/42 MAPK was performed essentially as described (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In brief, KNRK cells that had been transfected with a PAR2-expressing construct (PAR2-KNRK) or empty vector (pcDNA3-KNRK) were placed in DMEM with no serum for 12 h and stimulated with either trypsin, SLIGRL-NH2, NE, CG, or PR3 for 10 min. Cells were then placed on ice, and agonists were removed prior to lysis with cold lysis buffer. Protein samples were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli buffer and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Activation of p44/42 MAPK was monitored by immunoblotting with phospho-p44/42 MAPK-specific antibodies and visualizing on an Eastman Kodak Co. Imagestation, and the increases in p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation were quantified relative to the total p44/42 MAPK or β-actin signal detected in the same samples. Densitometry analysis of multiple Western blot images was done to quantify the percentage increase over base line of p44/42 MAPK activation by the different proteinases. MAPK signaling in HPT cells was assessed as described above for KNRK cells. For p44/42 MAPK studies in MEFs, cells were treated as described for KNRK cells except that after incubation with agonists, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed directly in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Phospho-p44/42 MAPK and total p44/42 MAPK antibodies were visualized on Western blots with Alexa 680 and IR800-coupled secondary antibodies using the LICOR Odyssey Imaging system. The BAB, containing a tetracysteine motif (19Martin B.R. Giepmans B.N. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), AFLNCCPGCCMEP, was inserted by introducing corresponding oligonucleotides just downstream of the signal peptide of human PAR2 (Gln27). The PAR2 DNA constructs containing the N-terminal BAB domain and a C-terminal YFP fluorochrome tag were cloned in pCDNA3.1+ at the restriction enzyme sites between EcoRI and XbaI (PAR2-BAB-YFP). HEK-293 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were transfected with the PAR2-BAB-YFP construct with the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Bioscience). The expression level of the expressed receptor was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (Victor 4X, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and confocal microscopy was used to monitor the receptor location by visualizing the receptor YFP tag. To detect proteolytic release of the N-terminal PAR2 domain, PAR2-BAB-YFP cells were labeled with a 0.2 μm concentration of the biarsenical fluorochrome ReAsH (using the TC-TC-ReAsH II in-cell tetracysteine tag detection kit (Invitrogen)) for 30 min followed by washing with the included BAL buffer. Labeled cells were then incubated with proteinases for 30 min in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1.5 mm CaCl2. Supernatants were removed from the cells and briefly centrifuged, and fluorescence measurements were done using a Victor X4 fluorescent plate reader, with an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength monitored at 615 nm to detect release of the peptide containing the receptor BAB tetracysteine motif. Fluorescence readings were also obtained from the cell monolayer to detect loss or not of the BAB tetracysteine motif from the cell surface. Cleavage of the PAR2-derived synthetic peptides spanning the TL regions (human PAR sequences; NATLDPRSFLLRNPNDKYE (PAR1), GTNRSSKGKSLIGKVDGTSHV (PAR2), and GDDSTPSILPAPRGYPGQV (PAR4)) or encompassing the region downstream of the PAR2 TL region (rat PAR2 sequence ITGKGAPVEPGFSVDEFSASVLTGKLT, highly homologous with the comparable human sequence, VTGKGVTVETVFSVDEFSASVLTGKLT) was done as described previously for trypsin IV and tissue kallikreins (20Knecht W.

Peptides (100 μm in a total volume of 150 μl) were incubated with neutrophil proteinases (0.7 unit/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 150 μl of ice-cold 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water. Samples were fractionated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (5–40% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% TFA over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min), and eluted peptides were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Neutrophil proteinase cleavage of peptides spanning the TL regions of PAR1 (NATLDPRSFLLRNPNDKYE) and PAR4 (GDDSTPSILPAPRGYPGQV) were also assessed as described above for the PAR2 peptides. PAR2 was conjugated with YFP at the C terminus (PAR2-YFP), and BRET to Renilla luciferase-tagged β-arrestin-1 (Rluc-β-arr1) was determined essentially as described previously (22Hamdan F.F. Rochdi M.D. Breton B. Fessart D. Michaud D.E. Charest P.G. Laporte S.A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29089-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were used instead of the KNRK cell line, because the HEK cells provide for a much greater transfection efficiency that is required for the BRET studies. In brief, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of PAR2-YFP construct along with 0.1 μg of the Rluc-β-arr1 construct. Cells were plated in white 96-well culture plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and interactions between the receptors and β-arrestin-1 were detected by measuring BRET at timed intervals over 60 min following the addition of 5 μm coelenterazine (Nanolight Technology, Pinetop, AZ) on a Mithras fluorescence plate reader (Berthold, Mandel Scientific (Guelph, Canada)) in luminescence mode using the appropriate filters. Using the approach described in more detail elsewhere (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K. Hollenberg M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), HEK cells were plated on glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and transiently transfected with 1 μg of PAR2-YFP construct. After 48 h, the medium in the Petri dish was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were treated with trypsin (10 nm), SLIGRL-NH2 (10 μm), or NE (3 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After fixing cells with 4% formaldehyde, the cellular localization of the receptor tag YFP signal was detected using an Olympus FV1000 confocal system on an Olympus IX70 microscope with the Fluoview system software. Internalization of cell surface receptor was quantified morphometrically by counting the number of intracellular fluorescent speckles per cell in the images, indicative of receptor internalization to endocytic vesicles. Speckles in all cells were counted in a randomly selected representative ×40 image. The average number of speckles per cell was calculated, and the observation was repeated for comparable fields for cells observed in three independently conducted experiments. As we anticipated from our previous work (6Dulon S. Candé C. Bunnett N.W. Hollenberg M.D. Chignard M. Pidard D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The abrogation of the ability of trypsin to activate PAR2 was not due to neutrophil proteinase digestion of trypsin itself as confirmed by experiments where preincubating trypsin with NE (as opposed to its target cells) did not affect either its ability to cause calcium signaling or to cleave a fluorogenic substrate (supplemental Fig. S2). This loss of PAR2 sensitivity to trypsin activation upon pretreating cells with the neutrophil proteinases can be explained by the ability of all three enzymes to cleave and release the N-terminal domain of PAR2 from the cell surface (Fig. 2), making the TL unavailable for trypsin-mediated unmasking. This N-terminal cleavage was verified by detection of the fluorescently labeled receptor N-terminal fragment containing a biarsenical fluorochrome binding motif in the cell supernatant after enzyme treatment. To assess similarities or differences in the cleavage of the PAR2 N-terminal extracellular sequence by the three neutrophil proteinases, we used a synthetic 27-mer peptide substrate representing the rat PAR2 sequence downstream of the TL and just C-terminal to a series of three prolines that would segregate this sequence from the upstream TL moiety (Fig. 3). HPLC separation and mass spectral identification of the cleavage products showed that each of the enzymes cleaved at a distinct site in this peptide with predominant cleavage observed: at Ser68-Val69 for NE, at Phe65-Ser66 for CG, and at Val62-Asp63 for PR3 (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Neutrophil derived proteinases cleave the PAR2 N terminus. Assessment by measuring release of an engineered tetracysteine arsenite binding motif. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the PAR2 DNA constructs containing the N-terminal BAB domain and a C-terminal YFP fluorochrome tag (PAR2-BAB-YFP). To detect proteolytic release of the N-terminal PAR2 domain, cells were labeled with a 0.2 μm concentration of the biarsenical fluorochrome ReAsH for 30 min followed by washing with BAL buffer. Labeled cells were then incubated with proteinases for 30 min in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1.5 mm CaCl2. Supernatants were removed from the cells and briefly centrifuged, and fluorescence was measured using a Victor X4 fluorescent plate reader, with an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength monitored at 615 nm. Fluorescence readings were obtained from the culture supernatants to detect release of the peptide containing the receptor BAB tetracysteine motif and from the cell monolayer to detect loss or not of the BAB tetracysteine motif from the cell surface (mean ± S.E.

These studies indicated that the neutrophil-derived proteinases are unable to reveal the PAR2-activating TL and agree completely with previous proteomic work demonstrating the inability of neutrophil proteinases to cleave sequences representing the TL of PAR2 (23Loew D. Perrault C. Morales M. Moog S. Ravanat C. Schuhler S. Arcone R. Pietropaolo C. Cazenave J.P. van Dorsselaer A. Lanza F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10812-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, neutrophil enzymes disarm PAR2 by removing the N-terminal TL receptor-activating sequence, whereas the retention of calcium signaling in response to SLIGRL-NH2 after treatment with neutrophil proteinases showed that the extracellular receptor loops involved in signaling remained functional. Because we previously observed that PAR2 can selectively couple to the p44/42 MAPK pathway without triggering calcium release (12Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Mathur M. Rochdi M.D. Bouvier M. Defea K.

https://openalex.org/W1975447383,"Cyclotides, a large family of cyclic peptides from plants, have a broad range of biological activities, including insecticidal, cytotoxic, and anti-HIV activities. In all of these activities, cell membranes seem likely to be the primary target for cyclotides. However, the mechanistic role of lipid membranes in the activity of cyclotides remains unclear. To determine the role of lipid organization in the activity of the prototypic cyclotide, kalata B1 (kB1), and synthetic analogs, their bioactivities and affinities for model membranes were evaluated. We found that the bioactivity of kB1 is dependent on the lipid composition of target cell membranes. In particular, the activity of kB1 requires specific interactions with phospholipids containing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) headgroups but is further modulated by nonspecific peptide-lipid hydrophobic interactions, which are favored in raft-like membranes. Negatively charged phospholipids do not favor high kB1 affinity. This lipid selectivity explains trends in antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of kB1; it does not target bacterial cell walls, which are negatively charged and lacking PE-phospholipids but can insert in the membranes of red blood cells, which have a low PE content and raft domains in their outer layer. We further show that the anti-HIV activity of kB1 is the result of its ability to target and disrupt the membranes of HIV particles, which are raft-like membranes very rich in PE-phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2088643139,"Steroid receptor co-activator-3 (SRC-3/AIB1) is an oncogene that is amplified and overexpressed in many human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate ‘activated SRC-3 oncoprotein’ turnover during tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), a cullin 3 (CUL3)-based ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for SRC-3 ubiquitination and proteolysis. SPOP interacts directly with an SRC-3 phospho-degron in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Casein kinase Iɛ phosphorylates the S102 in this degron and promotes SPOP-dependent turnover of SRC-3. Short hairpin RNA knockdown and overexpression experiments substantiated that the SPOP/CUL3/Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase complex promotes SRC-3 turnover. A systematic analysis of the SPOP genomic locus revealed that a high percentage of genomic loss or loss of heterozygosity occurs at this locus in breast cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoration of SPOP expression inhibited SRC-3-mediated oncogenic signaling and tumorigenesis, thus positioning SPOP as a tumor suppressor."

https://openalex.org/W2035854437,"Cell-type-specific signalling determines cell fate under physiological conditions, but it is increasingly apparent that also in cancer development the impact of any given oncogenic pathway on the individual cancer pathology is dependent on cell-lineage-specific molecular traits. For instance in colon and liver cancer canonical Wnt signalling produces increased cytoplasmic and nuclear localised beta-catenin, which correlates with invasion and poor prognosis. In contrast, in melanoma increased cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin is currently emerging as a marker for good prognosis, and thus seems to have a different function compared with other cancer types; however, this function is unknown. We discovered that in contrast to its function in other cancers, in melanoma, beta-catenin blocks invasion. We demonstrate that this opposing role of nuclear beta-catenin in melanoma is mediated through MITF, a melanoma-specific protein that defines the lineage background of this cancer type. Downstream of beta-catenin MITF not only suppresses the Rho-GTPase-regulated cell morphology of invading melanoma cells, but also interferes with beta-catenin-induced expression of the essential collagenase MT1-MMP, thus affecting all aspects of an invasive phenotype. Importantly, overexpression of MITF in invasive colon cancer cells modifies beta-catenin-directed signalling and induces a 'melanoma phenotype'. In summary, the cell-type-specific presence of MITF in melanoma affects beta-catenin's pro-invasive properties otherwise active in colon or liver cancer. Thus our study reveals the general importance of considering cell-type-specific signalling for the accurate interpretation of tumour markers and ultimately for the design of rational therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2022732592,"Peptidoglycan (PG) N-acetyl muramic acid (MurNAc) O-acetylation is widely spread in gram-positive bacteria and is generally associated with resistance against lysozyme and endogenous autolysins. We report here the presence of O-acetylation on N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in Lactobacillus plantarum PG. This modification of glycan strands was never described in bacteria. Fine structural characterization of acetylated muropeptides released from L. plantarum PG demonstrated that both MurNAc and GlcNAc are O-acetylated in this species. These two PG post-modifications rely on two dedicated O-acetyltransferase encoding genes, named oatA and oatB, respectively. By analyzing the resistance to cell wall hydrolysis of mutant strains, we showed that GlcNAc O-acetylation inhibits N-acetylglucosaminidase Acm2, the major L. plantarum autolysin. In this bacterial species, inactivation of oatA, encoding MurNAc O-acetyltransferase, resulted in marked sensitivity to lysozyme. Moreover, MurNAc over-O-acetylation was shown to activate autolysis through the putative N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase LytH enzyme. Our data indicate that in L. plantarum, two different O-acetyltransferases play original and antagonistic roles in the modulation of the activity of endogenous autolysins."
https://openalex.org/W2085494041,"Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is encoded by a single gene and exists in naturally secreted and transmembrane isoforms. Nrg1 exerts its signaling activity through interaction with its cognate ErbB receptors. Multiple membrane-anchored Nrg1 isoforms, present in six different membrane topologies, must be processed by a protease to initiate a signaling cascade. Here, we demonstrate that BACE1 and ADAM10 can process type I and III Nrg1 at two adjacent sites. Our cleavage site mapping experiments showed that the BACE1 cleavage site is located eight amino acids downstream of the ADAM10 cleavage site, and this order of cleavage is the opposite of amyloid precursor protein cleavage by these two enzymes. Cleavages were further confirmed via optimized electrophoresis. Cleavage of type I or III Nrg1 by ADAM10 and BACE1 released a signaling-capable N-terminal fragment (ntf), either Nrg1-ntfα or Nrg1-ntfβ, which could similarly activate an ErbB receptor as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, two downstream signaling molecules. Although both Nrg1-ntfα and Nrg1-ntfβ could initiate a common signaling cascade, inhibition or down-regulation of ADAM10 alone in a co-culture system did not affect normal myelination, whereas specific inhibition of BACE1 impaired normal myelination. Thus, processing of Nrg1 by BACE1 appears to be more critical for regulating myelination. Our results imply that a significant inhibition of BACE1 could potentially impair Nrg1 signaling activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2006128086,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, especially in the context of cancers. This study revealed that KLF4 activates glycolytic metabolism in breast cancer cells by up-regulating the platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFKP). KLF4 activated the transcription of the PFKP gene by directly binding to the PFKP promoter. Whereas glucose uptake and lactate production were inhibited by the knockdown of KLF4, they were activated by the overexpression of KLF4. Unlike PFKP, the expressions of the other isoforms of phosphofructokinase and glycolytic genes were unaffected by KLF4. The human breast cancer tissues showed a close correlation between KLF4 and PFKP expression. This study also showed that PFKP plays a critical role in cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, it is suggested that KLF4 plays a role in maintenance of high glycolytic metabolism by transcriptional activation of the PFKP gene in breast cancer cells."

Our study reveals the possible involvement of RNAi defect in pathologies involving mitochondrial deficiencies. P-bodies are ribonucleoprotein granules present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. They contain all proteins involved in the 5′ to 3′ mRNA degradation pathway, such as the decapping enzyme Dcp2, its enhancers Dcp1, Lsm1–7, Edc3, Hedls/Ge1, and the exonuclease Xrn1. This list extends to factors involved in specific degradation pathways, such as RNAi, NMD, and NGD (1Cole S.E. LaRiviere F.J. Merrikh C.N. Moore M.J. Mol.

They also contain proteins involved in translational repression, such as eIF4ET, Rck/p54/Dhh1, CPEB1, and the RISC complex. Some of the latter proteins also play a role in mRNA degradation, in particular Rck/p54/Dhh1, which is known as an enhancer of decapping, and the RISC complex when it is guided by a siRNA. Such catalogue of components indicates that P-bodies participate in these two aspects of mRNA metabolism. In addition, P-bodies increase in number and size when free untranslated mRNA accumulates. In mammals, this is observed when degradation is compromised by XrnI silencing (3Cougot N. Babajko S. Séraphin B. J.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support a role of P-bodies in mRNA degradation, mRNA storage, and RNA interference. Yet, their exact participation is unclear, as none of these functions is markedly affected in cells where P-bodies have been depleted (5Decker C.J. Teixeira D. Parker R. J.

Live cell observations show that the number of P-bodies is quite stable over hours, although occasional formation of new P-bodies or fusions of pre-existing ones are observed (10Yang Z. Jakymiw A.

Nevertheless, P-bodies are dynamic structures within the cytoplasm. Most of the time, they exhibit chaotic movements within a spatially confined area of the cytoplasm. Occasionally, they also perform sudden directional movements over a few micrometers, which, in human U2OS cells, take place along microtubule tracks, at a velocity of 0.5 to 1 μm/s (11Aizer A.

In addition, many P-body components actively traffic in and out of P-bodies. Photobleaching and photoactivation experiments show a continuous shuttling of Dcp1a, Dcp1b, Lsm6, eIF4E, eIF4ET, and TTP proteins between P-bodies and cytosol. This is not observed for other components such as Dcp2, GW182 (TNRC6A), and Ago2 (11Aizer A. Brody Y. Ler L.W. Sonenberg N. Singer R.H. Shav-Tal Y. Mol. Biol.

Moreover, P-bodies not only uptake mRNA for degradation or storage, but also release stored mRNA when translation resumes, as shown in yeast and mammalian cells (15Bhattacharyya S.N. Habermacher R.

Therefore, despite their apparent stability, P-bodies are dynamic granules that actively exchange molecules with their environment. P-bodies have been shown to interact with other cytoplasmic organelles. In stressed cells, we and others have shown that P-bodies establish contacts with another type of ribonucleoprotein granule, called stress granules (4Wilczynska A. Aigueperse C. Kress M. Dautry F.

Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). These granules form following stresses that strongly repress translation. They contain a fraction of the arrested mRNAs, associated with translation initiation factors, the small ribosomal subunit, and various RNA-binding proteins (17Kedersha N. Chen S. Gilks N. Li W.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the contacts between stress granules and P-bodies serve the transfer of mRNPs from stress granules to P-bodies for triggering their degradation (4Wilczynska A. Aigueperse C.

In fact, these contacts are close enough for such a transfer, as observed in electron microscopy (18Souquere S. Mollet S. Kress M. Dautry F. Pierron G. Weil D. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the pool of mRNA transiting through stress granules is not particularly unstable (19Mollet S. Cougot N. Wilczynska A. Dautry F. Kress M. Bertrand E. Weil D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4469-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore the nature of the exchange between the two types of granules, and its significance, are still unknown. In addition, interactions between P-bodies and late endosomes or multivesicular bodies have been reported in Drosophila and mammalian cells (20Gibbings D.J. Ciaudo C. Erhardt M. Voinnet O. Nat.

Mutations blocking multivesicular body formation or multivesicular body turnover inhibit or stimulate silencing, respectively. As GW182 is highly enriched at the membrane of these vesicles, the authors proposed that miRISC loading or recycling at these membranes could be required for efficient RNAi. Finally, it was recently reported that specific miRNAs 7The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAmRNPmessenger RiboNucleoProteinCCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazonemtGFPmitochrondrial GFPTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. were enriched along with the Ago2 protein in mitochondria purified from rat and mouse liver (22Bian Z.

Most of the potential targets of these miRNAs were encoding non-mitochondrial proteins, raising the possibility that the mitochondria are a reservoir for specific miRNAs involved in the regulation of general cellular functions. In fact, whereas the assembly of active RISC complexes has been followed in vitro, enabling the identification of a RISC loading complex (24MacRae I.J. Ma E. Zhou M. Robinson C.V. Doudna J.A. Proc.

Slides were mounted in Citifluor (Citifluor, UK). Rabbit polyclonal anti-p54 and mouse monoclonal anti-Ge1 antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories Inc. and Santa Cruz, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-Ago2 was a kind gift of Gunter Meister (MPIB, Germany) (30Rüdel S. Flatley A. Weinmann L. Kremmer E. Meister G. RNA. 2008; 14: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies conjugated to TRITC and Cy2 were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Standard microscopy was performed on a Leica DMR microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) using a ×63 1.32 oil immersion objective. Photographs were taken using a Micromax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) driven by Metamorph software. Confocal images were obtained on a Leica TCS-NT/SP1 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) using an Apochromat ×63 1.32 oil immersion objective. Fluorescence signals were acquired in 0.16-μm optical sections using Leica software. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. For signal quantification, fluorescence was measured simultaneously for Ago2 and Rck/p54, or Ge1 and Rck/p54, along lines drawn across individual P-bodies using Metamorph software. Their enrichment in the P-body was measured as the difference between the maximal fluorescence in the P-body and the fluorescence in the surrounding cytoplasm. For video microscopy, cells were grown on glass coverslips and mounted in a POC chamber system with 2 ml of culture medium maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were observed on a Zeiss inverted microscope Axiovert (Carl Zeiss SAS, France) equipped with a DG4 Lambda switcher (Sutter Instrument) and a CoolSNAP HQ camera (Roper Scientific), driven by Metamorph software. Timed series were acquired using a ×63 1.32 oil immersion objective. For electron microscopy, Epon and Lowicryl K4M (Chemische Werke Lowi, Waldkraiburg, Germany) embedding and immunolocalization of proteins were performed as described previously (18Souquere S. Mollet S. Kress M. Dautry F. Pierron G. Weil D. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were analyzed with a FEI Tecnai Spirit. Digital images were taken with a SIS Megaview III CCD camera. Transfected HEK 293 Tet-On Advanced cells were washed once with PBS and collected in 400 μl/well of PBS supplemented with 15% enzyme-free Cell Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen). Cytometry was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FL1 and Fl2 to measure EGFP and DsRed fluorescence, respectively. For each sample, 40,000 to 100,000 cells were analyzed. Data were analyzed with the Weasel software (version 2, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). Silencing values were defined by the change in the mean EGFP fluorescence with respect to the mock-transfected cells. For analysis of DNA fragmentation, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 75% ethanol. After one night at −20 °C, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma) and 20 μg/ml of RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then analyzed after gating on the R0 region to eliminate the cell aggregates but not cell debris, as indicated on the figure. Cells were scraped in Laemmli lysis buffer. After quantification by the Coomassie Blue protein assay (Pierce), 75 μg of proteins were separated on a 8.5% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After blocking in PBS-T (PBS, 0,1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed in PBS-T, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS-T, immune complexes were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Signal kit (Pierce) and visualized by exposure to CL-XPosure film (Pierce). The membrane was then dehybridized and rehybridized to a mouse monoclonal anti-S6K antibody (Santa Cruz). The secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. We have previously studied the dynamics of P-bodies in live cells using a specific component, the DEAD box helicase Rck/p54, fused to RFP (19Mollet S. Cougot N. Wilczynska A. Dautry F. Kress M. Bertrand E. Weil D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4469-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the course of this study, we noted that P-bodies were often located next to filamentous structures, which were reminiscent of mitochondria. For confirmation, RPE-1 epithelial cells were cotransfected with RFP-p54 and mtGFP, a GFP targeted to mitochondria (27Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and observed live in phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy after 36 h (Fig. 1A, left panel). The two regions enlarged in the right panels show the close proximity of P-bodies with mitochondria, which were filamentous in phase-contrast and contained the mtGFP. This observation was further extended to non-transfected HeLa cells. Mitochondria were labeled in vivo by culture in the presence of fluorescent MitoTracker for 30 min at 37 °C. After fixation, P-bodies were detected by immunostaining of Rck/p54. The association between P-bodies and mitochondria was visible in wide-field (Fig. 1B) and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C). It was also observed in HEK 293 epithelial cells (data not shown), as well as in primary cultures of endothelial cells such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 1D). When P-bodies were classified as “associated” or not with mitochondria, as defined in the right panels of Fig. 1, B and C, we found 50 to 70% of the P-bodies associated with mitochondria, depending on the experiment and cell line. To estimate the significance of this observation, we quantitatively analyzed experiments performed in HeLa cells. We measured in each cell the fraction of the P-bodies associated with mitochondria, and the fraction of the cytoplasm occupied by mitochondria. The results of such an analysis (25 cells, 373 P-bodies) are plotted in Fig. 1E. Despite important variations from cell to cell, the mean percentage of P-body associated with mitochondria (66%) was significantly higher than the mean area occupied by the mitochondria (58%, p = 0.006 in a paired t test). As a second assay, we analyzed the localization of these P-bodies after moving them 1 μm in the x and y axis (Fig. 1E). Their association with mitochondria decreased and became similar to the fraction of the cytoplasm occupied by the mitochondria (60%, p = 0.40). These two analyses establish that the frequent association between P-bodies and mitochondria does not simply result from a random localization of the P-bodies in the cytoplasm, but reflects a preferential association with mitochondria. To determine how close the association between P-bodies and mitochondria, and whether the association is direct or mediated by a third organelle, we analyzed HeLa cells by electron microscopy. Because P-bodies are most recognizable after immunogold detection of Rck/p54 (18Souquere S. Mollet S. Kress M. Dautry F. Pierron G. Weil D. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), cells fixed in paraformaldehyde were embedded in Lowicryl K4M, and thin sections were incubated with an anti-p54 antibody coupled to gold particles (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, immunostaining is optimal, but membranes are not stained, and mitochondria appear as large oval electron dense structures. Close contacts between P-bodies and mitochondria were readily observed at this high resolution. We also performed analysis in conventional electron microscopy. In the absence of labeling, low density of the P-bodies and their small number make it difficult to find them in thin sections. However, this can be circumvented by treatment of the cells with arsenite, which increases the size, density, and number of P-bodies (18Souquere S. Mollet S. Kress M. Dautry F. Pierron G. Weil D. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Arsenite-treated HeLa cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in Epon, prior to observation of ultrathin sections. Tight contacts between P-bodies and mitochondria were also observed (Fig. 2B). The distance between the two organelles in Fig. 2B is less than 25 nm, which, for comparison, is the size of a ribosome. With both protocols, no close association was observed between P-bodies and other organelles, such as the ER, endosomes, or vacuoles. We then investigated the dynamics of these contacts in live cells, using RPE-1 cells because their flat morphology facilitates time-lapse acquisition in microscopy. Cells were co-transfected with p54-RFP and mtGFP and individual cells were monitored for 3 min, with a stack of images captured in the two colors every 6 s. Images from two representative cells are presented in Fig. 3. The first cell contains 11 P-bodies, 7 of them being associated with a mitochondrion at time 0 (Fig. 3A). Three of these P-bodies (PB1, PB2, and PB3) were enlarged on the right panel to illustrate their dynamics. PB1 separates from a mitochondrion at the beginning of the time-lapse, stays apart for 1 min, contacts it again, and separates after 1 min (supplemental Video S1). PB2 is never free, associating back and forth with two different mitochondria (supplemental Video S2). Its localization at the extremity of a mitochondrion is a frequently observed pattern. PB3 remains attached to one mitochondrion, and slides along it over 90 s (supplemental Video S3). This is rare behavior. The second cell contains 12 P-bodies, 10 on them being distant of mitochondria at time 0 (Fig. 3B). Three of these were enlarged. Although PB4 does not move much, during 35 s, a distant mitochondrion extends twice in its direction up to establishing contact, slides along it, and retracts again (supplemental Video S4). PB5 is immobile, whereas a neighboring mitochondrion associates transiently with it during 30 s (supplemental Video S5). Finally, PB6 is joined by a short mitochondrion that then remains attached to it (supplemental Video S6). Such short mitochondria were often observed associated with P-bodies at the periphery of the cytoplasm. Overall, even when P-bodies and mitochondria are far apart at one time, they frequently establish contacts within a few minutes. These contacts result more often from movements of mitochondria than of P-bodies. We then analyzed the dynamics of the association between P-bodies and mitochondria. First, individual P-bodies (106 P-bodies in 10 cells) were followed frame by frame in the previous experiment. Although only 44% of the P-bodies were associated with mitochondria at time 0, 81% of the P-bodies contacted a mitochondrion at least once during the 3-min movie. The duration of each contact (a total of 200 contact events for 106 P-bodies) was estimated taking into account that frames were 6 s apart (Fig. 4A). The association of P-bodies with mitochondria lasted from 6 s or less (1 frame) to 3 min or more (30 consecutive frames), with a median duration of 18 s (3 consecutive frames). The significance of contacts observed on a single frame should not be underestimated, as they are frequent (30%). Instantaneous contacts occurring only during image acquisition (100 ms) would have a very low probability to be captured and can only represent a minor fraction of them. Overall, 54.5% of the contacts lasted more than 12 s, 26.5% more than 1 min, and 8.5% more than 3 min. In conclusion, the association with mitochondria concerns a large majority of the P-bodies and is long enough to enable molecular traffic between the two organelles. As both mitochondria and P-bodies can be actively transported along microtubules (11Aizer A. Brody Y. Ler L.W. Sonenberg N. Singer R.H. Shav-Tal Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4154-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Boldogh I.R. Pon L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 502-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we investigated if the microtubule network is required for the association between P-bodies and mitochondria. HeLa cells were treated with vinblastine for 1 h, which resulted in the full disruption of the microtubule network and the appearance of characteristic spiral aggregates of microtubules, as controlled by immunostaining of tubulin (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Mitochondria were then stained with fluorescent MitoTracker for 30 min in the presence of vinblastine, fixed, and immunostained with anti-p54 antibodies (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Vinblastine increased the number of P-bodies (from 13 to 20 P-bodies per cell in average), as previously reported (11Aizer A. Brody Y. Ler L.W. Sonenberg N. Singer R.H. Shav-Tal Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4154-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It also decreased the frequency of P-bodies associated with mitochondria from 57 to 46% (mean value of three experiments, p = 0.045, Fig. 4C). The significance of this decrease was evaluated by measuring in one experiment (31 vinblastine-treated cells, 661 P-bodies) the volume occupied by the mitochondria, the control cells being the one presented in Fig. 1E (see Fig. 4D). After vinblastine treatment, the mean percentage of P-bodies associated with mitochondria (58%) was similar to the mean area occupied by the mitochondria (60%), which indicated the loss of their preferential association with mitochondria. Therefore, the association between P-bodies and mitochondria in HeLa cells requires an intact microtubule network. We then sought to investigate"
https://openalex.org/W2023317697,"Temporins are a group of closely related short antimicrobial peptides from frog skin. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, plays important roles in the activity of temporins. Earlier studies have found that LPS induces oligomerization of temporin-1Tb (TB) thus preventing its translocation across the outer membrane and, as a result, reduces its activity on gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, temporin-1Tl (TL) exhibits higher activity, presumably because of lack of such oligomerization. A synergistic mechanism was proposed, involving TL and TB in overcoming the LPS-mediated barrier. Here, to gain insights into interactions of TL and TB within LPS, we investigated the structures and interactions of TL, TB, and TL+TB in LPS micelles, using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. In the context of LPS, TL assumes a novel antiparallel dimeric helical structure sustained by intimate packing between aromatic-aromatic and aromatic-aliphatic residues. By contrast, independent TB has populations of helical and aggregated conformations in LPS. The LPS-induced aggregated states of TB are largely destabilized in the presence of TL. Saturation transfer difference NMR studies have delineated residues of TL and TB in close contact with LPS and enhanced interactions of these two peptides with LPS, when combined together. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and (31)P NMR have pointed out the proximity of TL and TB in LPS and conformational changes of LPS, respectively. Importantly, these results provide the first structural insights into the mode of action and synergism of antimicrobial peptides at the level of the LPS-outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2135926645,"In Escherichia coli, a multicomponent BAM (β-barrel assembly machinery) complex is responsible for recognition and assembly of outer membrane β-barrel proteins. The functionality of BAM in protein biogenesis is mainly orchestrated through the presence of two essential components, BamA and BamD. Here, we present crystal structures of four lipoproteins (BamB-E). Monomeric BamB and BamD proteins display scaffold architectures typically implied in transient protein interactions. BamB is a β-propeller protein comprising eight WD40 repeats. BamD shows an elongated fold on the basis of five tetratricopeptide repeats, three of which form the scaffold for protein recognition. The rod-shaped BamC protein has evolved through the gene duplication of two conserved domains known to mediate protein interactions in structurally related complexes. By contrast, the dimeric BamE is formed through a domain swap and indicates fold similarity to the β-lactamase inhibitor protein family, possibly integrating cell wall stability in BAM function. Structural and biochemical data show evidence for the specific recognition of amphipathic sequences through the tetratricopeptide repeat architecture of BamD. Collectively, our data advance the understanding of the BAM complex and highlight the functional importance of BamD in amphipathic outer membrane β-barrel protein motif recognition and protein delivery."

They often possess divergent biological activities such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-oxidant activities and thus attract much attention in food, medicinal, and agricultural research fields.

However, so far only two genes have been isolated as prenyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of prenylated flavonoids, namely naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase from Sophora flavescens (SfN8DT-1) specific for some limited flavanones and glycinol 4-dimethylallyltransferase from Glycine max (G4DT), specific for pterocarpan substrate. We have in this study isolated two novel genes coding for membrane-bound flavonoid prenyltransferases from S. flavescens, an isoflavone-specific prenyltransferase (SfG6DT) responsible for the prenylation of the genistein at the 6-position and a chalcone-specific prenyltransferase designated as isoliquiritigenin dimethylallyltransferase (SfiLDT). These prenyltransferases were enzymatically characterized using a yeast expression system.

https://openalex.org/W2082982834,"The PFTK1 gene encodes a cdc2-related serine/threonine protein kinase that has been shown to confer cell migratory properties in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the prognostic value and biological mechanism by which PFTK1 promotes HCC motility remain largely unknown. Here, we showed from tissue microarray that common upregulations of PFTK1 in primary HCC tumors (n=133/180) correlated significantly with early age onset (40 years), advance tumor grading and presence of microvascular invasion (P0.05). To understand downstream phosphorylated substrate(s) of PFTK1, phospho-proteins in PFTK1 expressing and knockdown Hep3B cells were profiled by two-dimensional-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mass spectrometric analysis. Protein identification of differential spots revealed β-actin (ACTB) and transgelin2 (TAGLN2) as the two most profound phosphorylated changes affected by PFTK1. We verified the presence of TAGLN2 serine phosphorylation and ACTB tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, reduced TAGLN2 and ACTB phosphorylations in PFTK1-suppressed Hep3B corresponded to distinct actin depolymerizations and marked inhibition on cell invasion and motility. Given that TAGLN2 is a tumor suppressor whose function has been ascribed in cancer metastasis, we examined if TAGLN2 is an intermediate substrate in the biological path of PFTK1. We showed in PFTK1-suppressed cells that knockdown of TAGLN2 over-rode the inhibitory effect on cell invasion and motility, and a recovery on actin polymerization was evident. Interestingly, we also found that unphosphorylated TAGLN2 in PFTK1-suppressed cells elicited strong actin-binding ability, a mechanism that possibly halts the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Site-directed mutagenesis of TAGLN2 suggested that PFTK1 regulates the actin-binding affinity of TAGLN2 through the S83 and S163 residues, which if mutated can significantly affect HCC cell motility. Taken together, our data propose a novel, oncogene-tumor suppressor interplay, where oncogenic PFTK1 confers HCC cell motility through inactivating the actin-binding motile suppressing function of TAGLN2 via phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2123299920,"Highly charged compounds typically suffer from low membrane permeability and thus are generally regarded as sub-optimal drug candidates. Nonetheless, the highly charged drug fosmidomycin and its more active methyl-derivative FR900098 have proven parasiticidal activity against erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both compounds target the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway present in bacteria and plastid-bearing organisms, like apicomplexan parasites. Surprisingly, the compounds are inactive against a range of apicomplexans replicating in nucleated cells, including Toxoplasma gondii.Since non-infected erythrocytes are impermeable for FR90098, we hypothesized that these drugs are taken up only by erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium. We provide evidence that radiolabeled FR900098 accumulates in theses cells as a consequence of parasite-induced new properties of the host cell, which coincide with an increased permeability of the erythrocyte membrane. Babesia divergens, a related parasite that also infects human erythrocytes and is also known to induce an increase in membrane permeability, displays a similar susceptibility and uptake behavior with regard to the drug. In contrast, Toxoplasma gondii-infected cells do apparently not take up the compounds, and the drugs are inactive against the liver stages of Plasmodium berghei, a mouse malaria parasite.Our findings provide an explanation for the observed differences in activity of fosmidomycin and FR900098 against different Apicomplexa. These results have important implications for future screens aimed at finding new and safe molecular entities active against P. falciparum and related parasites. Our data provide further evidence that parasite-induced new permeability pathways may be exploited as routes for drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1987719144,"Climate changes will have an impact on food production and will require costly adaptive responses. Adapting to a changing environment will be particularly challenging in sub-Saharan Africa where climate change is expected to have a major impact. However, one important phenomenon that is often overlooked and is poorly documented is the ability of agro-systems to rapidly adapt to environmental variations. Such an adaptation could proceed by the adoption of new varieties or by the adaptation of varieties to a changing environment. In this study, we analyzed these two processes in one of the driest agro-ecosystems in Africa, the Sahel. We performed a detailed study in Niger where pearl millet is the main crop and covers 65% of the cultivated area. To assess how the agro-system is responding to recent recurrent drought, we analyzed samples of pearl millet landraces collected in the same villages in 1976 and 2003 throughout the entire cultivated area of Niger. We studied phenological and morphological differences in the 1976 and 2003 collections by comparing them over three cropping seasons in a common garden experiment. We found no major changes in the main cultivated varieties or in their genetic diversity. However, we observed a significant shift in adaptive traits. Compared to the 1976 samples, samples collected in 2003 displayed a shorter lifecycle, and a reduction in plant and spike size. We also found that an early flowering allele at the PHYC locus increased in frequency between 1976 and 2003. The increase exceeded the effect of drift and sampling, suggesting a direct effect of selection for earliness on this gene. We conclude that recurrent drought can lead to selection for earlier flowering in a major Sahelian crop. Surprisingly, these results suggest that diffusion of crop varieties is not the main driver of short term adaptation to climatic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2051557275,"In LPS-treated macrophages, activation of STAT3 is considered to be crucial for terminating the production of inflammatory cytokines. By analyzing the role of MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) 2 and MK3 for LPS-induced STAT3 activation in macrophages, the present study provides evidence that MK2 is crucial for STAT3 activation in response to LPS because it prevents MK3 from impeding IFNβ gene expression. Accordingly, LPS-induced IFNβ gene expression is down-regulated in MK2-deficient macrophages and can be reconstituted by additional ablation of the MK3 gene in MK2/3(-/-) macrophages. This is in contrast to LPS-induced IL-10 expression, which essentially requires the presence of MK2. Further analysis of downstream signaling events involved in the transcriptional regulation of IFNβ gene expression suggests that, in the absence of MK2, MK3 impairs interferon regulatory factor 3 protein expression and activation and inhibits nuclear translocation of p65. This inhibition of p65 nuclear translocation coincides with enhanced expression and delayed degradation of IκBβ, whereas expression of IκBα mRNA and protein is impaired in the absence of MK2. The observation that siRNA directed against IκBβ is able to reconstitute IκBα expression in MK2(-/-) macrophages suggests that enhanced expression and delayed degradation of IκBβ and impaired NFκB-dependent IκBα expression are functionally linked. In summary, evidence is provided that MK2 regulates LPS-induced IFNβ expression and downstream STAT3 activation as it restrains MK3 from mediating negative regulatory effects on NFκB- and interferon regulatory factor 3-dependent LPS signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2165186704,"The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is referred to as the minimal rate of metabolism required to support basic body functions. It is well known that individual BMR varies greatly, even when correcting for body weight, fat content, and thyroid hormone levels, but the mechanistic determinants of this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we show in humans that mass-related BMR correlates strongly to the mitochondrial oxygen affinity (p50mito; R2=0.66, P=0.0004) measured in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria. A similar relationship was found for oxygen affinity and efficiency during constant-load submaximal exercise (R2=0.46, P=0.007). In contrast, BMR did not correlate to overall mitochondrial density or to proton leak. Mechanistically, part of the p50mito seems to be controlled by the excess of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) protein and activity relative to other mitochondrial proteins. This is illustrated by the 5-fold increase in p50mito after partial cyanide inhibition of COX at doses that do not affect maximal mitochondrial electron flux through the ETS. These data suggest that the interindividual variation in BMR in humans is primarily explained by differences in mitochondrial oxygen affinity. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a trade-off between aerobic efficiency and power.—Larsen, F. J., Schiffer, T. A., Sahlin, K., Ekblom, B., Weitzberg, E., Lundberg, J. O.

Here we use basin-scale climate indices and regional surface temperatures to estimate loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Borrowing from fisheries research, our models investigate how oceanographic processes influence juvenile recruitment and regulate population dynamics. This novel approach finds local populations in the North Pacific and Northwest Atlantic are regionally synchronized and strongly correlated to ocean conditions—such that climate models alone explain up to 88% of the observed changes over the past several decades. In addition to its performance, climate-based modeling also provides mechanistic forecasts of historical and future population changes. Hindcasts in both regions indicate climatic conditions may have been a factor in recent declines, but future forecasts are mixed. Available climatic data suggests the Pacific population will be significantly reduced by 2040, but indicates the Atlantic population may increase substantially. These results do not exonerate anthropogenic impacts, but highlight the significance of bottom-up oceanographic processes to marine organisms. Future studies should consider environmental baselines in assessments of marine turtle population variability and persistence."

It has been previously shown that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) knockdown, but not PARP inhibition, downregulates the expression of Snail1. In this study we have characterized a novel regulatory mechanism controlling Snail1 protein expression through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The effect is not only limited to repression of Snail1 transcription but also to downregulated Snail1 protein stability. PARP-1 (but not PARP-2) poly(ADP) ribosylates Snail1, both in vivo and in vitro, and interacts with Snail1, an association that is sensitive to PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibition has also clear effects on EMT phenotype of different tumor cells, including Snail1 downregulation, E-cadherin upregulation, decreased cell elongation and invasiveness. Therefore, this study reveals a new regulatory mechanism of Snail1 activation through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation with consequences in malignant transformation through EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2006160956,"The small GTPase Rab5, which cycles between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms, plays essential roles in membrane budding and trafficking in the early endocytic pathway. Rab5 is activated by various vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9) domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Rab21, Rab22, and Rab31 (members of the Rab5 subfamily) are also involved in the trafficking of early endosomes. Mechanisms controlling the activation Rab5 subfamily members remain unclear. RIN (Ras and Rab interactor) represents a family of multifunctional proteins that have a VPS9 domain in addition to Src homology 2 (SH2) and Ras association domains. We investigated whether RIN family members act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rab5 subfamily on biochemical and cell morphological levels. RIN3 stimulated the formation of GTP-bound Rab31 in cell-free and in cell GEF activity assays. RIN3 also formed enlarged vesicles and tubular structures, where it colocalized with Rab31 in HeLa cells. In contrast, RIN3 did not exhibit any apparent effects on Rab21. We also found that serine to alanine substitutions in the sequences between SH2 and RIN family homology domain of RIN3 specifically abolished its GEF action on Rab31 but not Rab5. We examined whether RIN3 affects localization of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), which is transported between trans-Golgi network and endocytic compartments. We found that RIN3 partially translocates CD-MPR from the trans-Golgi network to peripheral vesicles and that this is dependent on its Rab31-GEF activity. These results indicate that RIN3 specifically acts as a GEF for Rab31."
https://openalex.org/W1987714872,"The chromosomal translocation (8;21) fuses the hematopoietic transcription factor AML1 (RUNX1) with ETO (RUNX1T1, MTG8), resulting in the leukemia-specific chimeric protein AML1/ETO. This fusion protein has been implicated in epigenetic silencing, recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases to target promoters. Previously, we have identified a novel in vivo AML1/ETO target gene, LAT2 (NTAL/LAB/WBSCR5), which is involved in FcɛR I, c-Kit, B-cell and T-cell receptor signalling. We have now addressed the molecular mechanisms of AML1/ETO-mediated LAT2 repression. In Kasumi-1 cells, where AML1/ETO bound to the LAT2 gene, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated AML1/ETO depletion caused upregulation of LAT2, suggesting a possible direct mechanism of repression. Expression of AML1/ETO was associated with a decrease in acetylation of histones H3, H3K9 and H4, and an increase in H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation. The class I-specific HDAC inhibitors entinostat (MS-275) and mocetinostat (MGCD0103) induced LAT2 expression specifically in AML1/ETO-expressing cells, resulting in induction of several activating histone marks on the LAT2 gene, including trimethylation of histone H3K4. The combination of entinostat and decitabine increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, as well as LAT2 mRNA expression, in an at least additive fashion. In conclusion, several repressive histone modifications mark the LAT2 gene in the presence of AML1/ETO, and LAT2 gene derepression is achieved by pharmacological inhibition of HDACs."

Recently, we characterized a novel nonproton ligand (2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline, GMQ), which activates the ASIC3 channel subtype at neutral pH. Using an interactive computational-experimental approach, here we extend our investigation to delineate the architecture of the GMQ-sensing domain in the ASIC3 channels. We first established a GMQ binding mode and revealed that residues Glu-423, Glu-79, Leu-77, Arg-376, Gln-271, and Gln-269 play key roles in forming the GMQ-sensing domain. We then verified the GMQ binding mode using ab initio calculation and mutagenesis and demonstrated the critical role of the above GMQ-binding residues in the interplay among GMQ, proton, and Ca(2+) in regulating the function of ASIC3. Additionally, we showed that the same residues involved in coordinating GMQ responses are also critical for activation of the ASIC3(E79C) mutant by thiol-reactive compound DTNB. Thus, a range of complementary techniques provide independent evidence for the structural details of the GMQ-sensing domain at atomic level, laying the foundation for further investigations of endogenous nonproton ligands and gating mechanisms of the ASIC3 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2038683056,"Activation of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) contributes to neuronal death during stroke, to axonal degeneration during neuroinflammation, and to pain during inflammation. Although understanding ASIC gating may help to modulate ASIC activity during these pathologic situations, at present it is poorly understood. The ligand, H+, probably binds to several sites, among them amino acids within the large extracellular domain. The extracellular domain is linked to the two transmembrane domains by the wrist region that is connected to two anti-parallel β-strands, β1 and β12. Thus, the wrist region together with those β-strands may have a crucial role in transmitting ligand binding to pore opening and closing. Here we show that amino acids in the β1-β2 linker determine constitutive opening of ASIC1b from shark. The most crucial residue within the β1-β2 linker (Asp110), when mutated from aspartate to cysteine, can be altered by cysteine-modifying reagents much more readily when channels are closed than when they are desensitized. Finally, engineering of a cysteine at position 110 and at an adjacent position in the β11-β12 linker leads to spontaneous formation of a disulfide bond that traps the channel in the desensitized conformation. Collectively, our results suggest that the β1-β2 and β11-β12 linkers are dynamic during gating and tightly appose to each other during desensitization gating. Hindrance of this tight apposition leads to reopening of the channel.

ASIC1a is the most abundant ASIC subunit in the mammalian CNS, and most ASICs in central neurons are homomeric ASIC1a or heteromeric ASIC1a/2a (2Baron A. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J.

During prolonged acidification they desensitize; the kinetics of desensitization varies over a 100-fold range from 10 ms (13Coric T. Zhang P. Todorovic N. Canessa C.M. J. Biol.

Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). For most ASICs, desensitization is complete, but some ASICs have small, sustained currents that do not desensitize in the continuous presence of protons (16Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 17Hesselager M. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K. J. Biol.

Such sustained currents could have a major contribution to the harmful effects of ASIC activity during prolonged acidosis. However, despite the importance of desensitization gating and sustained opening of ASICs, our molecular understanding of these processes is incomplete. Fig. 1 illustrates the gating kinetics of rat ASIC1a (rASIC1a) to mild and strong acidification (pH 6.4 and 5.0). Application of pH 6.4 or 5.0 elicits transient currents that completely desensitize with a time constant τ = ∼2 s. Recently we characterized ASIC1b from shark (sASIC1b) that shares 70% amino acid identity with rASIC1a but desensitizes strikingly differently (18Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, application of pH 6.4 elicits transient sASIC1b currents that decline at least 40-fold faster than that of rASIC1a (τ < 50 ms). More importantly, desensitization is incomplete, and a sustained current remains as along as pH is acidic. The level of the sustained current is ∼5% of the peak current amplitude (Fig. 1). pH 5.0 also elicits transient currents, and in addition, shortly after the initial peak, a second current component develops with variable amplitude ∼50% of the amplitude of the transient current (Fig. 1). This second current component desensitizes much more slowly than the initial transient current. We referred to the typical transient ASIC current as the “transient current” and to the second slow current component at pH 5.0 as the “slow current” (18Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, both the kinetics and the extent of desensitization are different between sASIC1b and rASIC1a. The sustained and slow sASIC1b currents are both unselective, whereas the transient current is Na+-selective (18Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, the slow current cross-desensitizes the sustained but not the transient current (18Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These characteristics suggest that the sustained and slow sASIC1b currents share a conformation that is different from the typical transient open conformation. Thus, there are clearly two different open states for sASIC1b that can be separated macroscopically. The slight delay of onset of the slow current at pH 5.0 suggests that the second unselective open state is reached from the desensitized state, which can be described by the following kinetic scheme. C+H+↔O1⋅H+↔D⋅H+↔O2⋅H+SCHEME 1 This scheme is solely intended to illustrate the basic idea of two macroscopically separable open states, O1 and O2, and for the sake of simplicity, it does not incorporate further closed and open states. Moreover, states could also be cyclically connected, with the unselective open state O2 directly connected to the closed state C but still connected to the desensitized state D, not affecting the major implications of this scheme. The scheme implies that sASIC1b opens to a Na+-selective open state O1 from which it quickly reaches the desensitized state D, from which it reopens to an unselective open state O2. It follows that the desensitized state of sASIC1b is energetically unstable, whereas for most other ASICs, including rASICa, it is stable in the continued presence of H+, and channels do not reopen. Because the sustained sASIC1b current is comparatively small, at equilibrium most (>90%) of the channels are probably in the desensitized state, and few channels (<10%) are in the open state O2. The crystal structure of chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) has been solved at acidic pH (19Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 20Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), probably representing the desensitized conformation of the channel. It provides a structural framework to understand ASIC gating (21Gründer S. Chen X. Int. J. Physiol. Pathophysiol. Pharmacol. 2010; 2: 73-94PubMed Google Scholar), in particular desensitization gating. The cASIC1 structure is characterized by the symmetric arrangement of three subunits. Each subunit has two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that are linked to the large extracellular domain (ECD) by an apparently flexible wrist. The ECD resembles a clenched hand and consists of five subdomains, namely the palm, thumb, finger, knuckle, and β-ball domains (19Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified amino acids in the β1-β2 and β11-β12 linkers of the palm domain that determine the presence of a sustained current in sASIC1b. Moreover, our results indicate that the β1-β2 and β11-β12 linkers are dynamic during gating and come in close apposition in the desensitized state. Hindrance of this tight apposition destabilizes the desensitized state, inducing sustained reopening of the channel. Covalently linking the two linkers traps the channel in the desensitized state. These linkers have a similar role in rASIC1a, suggesting that they have a conserved role for ASIC1 gating. The crucial role of these two linkers makes them interesting targets for drugs that modulate ASIC gating. Chimeras of rat ASIC1a and shark ASIC1b were obtained by recombinant PCR. Amino acids substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using standard protocols. KAPPA HiFi polymerase (peqlab; Erlangen) was used for all PCRs and PCR-derived fragments were controlled by sequencing. All of the constructs were cloned in the oocyte expression vector pRSSP, which is optimized for functional expression in Xenopus oocytes (12Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), capped cRNA was generated by SP6 RNA polymerase from linearized plasmids. Surgical removal of oocytes was done as described elsewhere (18Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Between 0.016 and 8 ng of cRNA were injected into stage V or VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis, and the oocytes were kept in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 5.0 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone) at 19 °C and studied 24–72 h after injection. Whole cell currents were recorded with a TurboTec 03X amplifier (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany) using an automated, pump-driven solution exchange system together with the oocyte testing carousel controlled by the interface OTC-20 (npi electronic) (22Madeja M. Musshoff U. Speckmann E.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1995; 63: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With this system, 80% of the bath solution (10–90%) is exchanged within 300 ms (23Chen X. Paukert M. Kadurin I. Pusch M. Gründer S. Neuropharmacology. 2006; 50: 964-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and solution exchange were managed using CellWorks version 5.1.1 (npi electronic). The data were filtered at 20 Hz and acquired at 1 kHz. Holding potential was −70 mV, except when otherwise indicated. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). The bath solution for two-electrode voltage clamp contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. For solutions with a pH ≤ 6.6, HEPES was replaced by MES. 2-Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Canada) was dissolved in bath solution and kept on ice when not in use. Fresh solutions were prepared every 20 min to ensure desired concentrations. Wild-type channels showed no detectable changes upon exposure to methanethiosulfonate compounds, DTT or H2O2. Before application, pH was adjusted for bath solutions containing MTS compounds, DTT or H2O2. Data were collected and pooled from at least two preparations of oocytes isolated on different days from different animals. The data were analyzed with the software IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Concentration response curves were fit to the Hill-Function, I=1/(1+(EC50/[H]n))Eq. 1 where EC50 is the pH at which half-maximal activation/desensitization of the transient current component was achieved, and n is the Hill coefficient. Time constants of desensitization were determined by fitting the decay phase of current traces to a mono-exponential function. The amplitude of the sustained current was determined when it had reached steady state and was normalized to the amplitude of the transient peak current. Reversal potential of the transient current of the rASIC1a-MDS mutant was determined by activation of the channel with pH 5.0 at different holding potentials between −70 and +50 mV. Reversal potential of the sustained current at pH 5.0 was determined by stepping voltage in 20 mV steps between −70 and +70 mV. Currents after identical voltage steps at pH 7.4 (before activation of channels) were subtracted from currents at pH 5.0 to yield reversal potentials of pH 5.0 induced currents. The results are reported as the means ± S.E. They represent the mean of n individual measurements on different oocytes. Statistical analysis was done with Student's unpaired t test. To identify the amino acids that determine sustained opening of sASIC1b, we generated a series of chimeras in which we exchanged different parts of the ECD of sASC1b by corresponding sequences from rASIC1a. For these chimeras, we then measured currents at pH 6.4 and 5, estimated the time constant of desensitization of the transient current, and determined the presence and amplitude of a sustained current; we did not investigate the desensitization of the second slow current, which will be briefly discussed at the end of this manuscript. First, we exchanged the whole ECD of sASIC1b. The resulting chimera (srs6) showed transient inward currents upon application of low pH (Fig. 2). At pH 5, currents desensitized completely with a time constant τ = 1.5 ± 0.2 s (n = 14), not significantly different from rASIC1a (p = 0.44). Moreover, the desensitization rate at pH 6.4 was similar to that at pH 5 (Fig. 2). Thus, desensitization of this chimera was indistinguishable from rASIC1a, showing that the ECD determines the kinetics of desensitization and the presence of a sustained current in ASIC1. Therefore, we substituted gradually smaller parts of the ECD of sASIC1b. Substitution of either the first two-thirds or the first one-third of the ECD of sASIC1b (chimeras srs5 and srs4) yielded channels that desensitized approximately three times more rapidly than rASIC1a currents (at pH 5: τ = 0.7 ± 0.1 s, n = 14, and τ = 0.5 ± 0.04 s, n = 29, respectively; p < 0.001) and more than ten times more slowly than sASIC1b currents (p < 0.001). For both chimeras, the desensitization rate at pH 6.4 was similar to that at pH 5 (Fig. 2). Most importantly, both chimeras desensitized completely to pH 6.4 and 5, and there was no sustained or slow current. Thus, the first one-third of the ECD of sASIC1b is necessary for the fast desensitization and the presence of the slow sustained current of this channel. Substitution of either the first 123 or the first 24 amino acids of the sASIC1b ECD (chimeras srs3 and srs2) had essentially the same effect: the kinetics of desensitization was intermediate to rASIC1a and sASIC1b (at pH 5: τ = 0.3 ± 0.02 s, n = 15, and τ = 0.2 ± 0.02 s, n = 13, respectively; p < 0.001) and similar at pH 6.4 and 5. Moreover, there was no sustained or slow current. When we substituted only the first 14 amino acids of the ECD, we obtained a chimera (srs1) with a very different desensitization kinetics: desensitization of the transient current was very fast (τ < 50 ms) and incomplete (amplitude of the sustained current was 11 ± 2% of the peak current at pH 6.4, n = 3, and 13 ± 2% at pH 5, n = 5). Thus, this chimera desensitized basically as sASIC1b wild type. In summary, the most striking difference in desensitization was observed between chimeras srs1 and srs2, which differ in only 7 amino acids. The results obtained with the chimeras between sASIC1b and rASIC1a revealed that a small region of the ECD (residues 109–115) shortly after TMD1 is necessary for the presence of a sustained current at pH 6.4 and a slow current at pH 5. Moreover, in agreement with a previous report (13Coric T. Zhang P. Todorovic N. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45240-45247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this same region largely determines the kinetics of desensitization of the transient current; other regions that determine the kinetics of desensitization to a lesser extent seem to be scattered over the ECD. As is shown in Fig. 3, the critical region lies in a linker that connects β-strand 1 of the palm domain to β-strand 2 of the β-ball. We next analyzed in more detail the effect on desensitization of these 7 amino acids, Met109–Tyr115, in the β1-β2 linker. A previous study identified an amino acid triplet in the proximal ECD as a determinant of the slow desensitization kinetics of rASIC1a (13Coric T. Zhang P. Todorovic N. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45240-45247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This triplet is 83SQL in rASIC1a and 112PFM in sASIC1b and falls into the critical region identified by our chimeras (Fig. 3). Therefore, we next substituted the PFM triplet of sASIC1b with the SQL triplet of rASIC1a. sASIC1b-SQL desensitized rapidly with a time constant τ < 50 ms (n = 10), and it still had a sustained current at pH 6.4 and a slow current at pH 5 (5 ± 2% of the peak current amplitude at pH 6.4 and 7 ± 1% at pH 5, n = 8; Fig. 4A), clearly showing that the PFM triplet is not necessary for sustained sASIC1b opening. Unexpectedly, although because of the fast desensitization we cannot exclude some slowing of the desensitization of sASIC1b by the SQL substitution, the SQL triplet did not determine slow desensitization kinetics of the transient sASIC1b current (Fig. 4A). We then substituted in sASIC1b the three amino acids just upstream of the PFM triplet, 109MDS, by those of rASIC1a, 80VAA. sASIC1b-VAA desensitized rapidly with a time constant τ < 100 ms (n = 16), but strikingly it no longer had a sustained current at pH 6.4 nor a slow current at pH 5 (Fig. 4A), clearly showing that the MDS triplet in sASIC1b is necessary for sustained sASIC1b opening. Combined substitution of both triplets, MDS and PFM, by VAASQL yielded a channel that had no sustained openings and desensitized with a time constant τ = 160 ± 11 ms (n = 23), similar to chimera srs2 (p = 0.13; Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that both triplets, MDS and PFM, contributed to the kinetics of desensitization of the sASIC1b current but that only the MDS triplet was necessary for sustained opening of sASIC1b. To further define the role of individual amino acids within the MDS triplet for sASIC1b desensitization, we substituted the three amino acids individually with those found in rASIC1a (V, A, A, respectively). sASIC1b with any of the three individual substitutions, M109V, D110A, and S111A, desensitized very rapidly (τ < 50 ms, n = 8; Fig. 4A). sASIC1b-M109V had no sustained currents at pH 6.4 but did at pH 5 (7 ± 4% of the peak current amplitude, n = 6). In contrast, sASIC1b-D110A had no sustained currents at pH 6.4 or 5 (n = 6; Fig. 4A), and not even at pH 4 (not shown). sASIC1b-S111A still had sustained openings at pH 6.4 and slow openings at pH 5 (2 ± 1% of the peak current amplitude at pH 6.4 and 8 ± 3% at pH 5, n = 11; Fig. 4A). Collectively, these results show that the MDS triplet in the proximal ECD is necessary for sustained sASIC1b opening and that Asp110 has an especially crucial role within the triplet. To further corroborate these findings, we did inverse substitutions in rASIC1a (Fig. 4B). rASIC1a-PFM desensitized with a time course similar to rASIC1a wild type (τ = 1.2 ± 0.14 s, n = 10, compared with τ = 1.8 ± 0.16 s, n = 13; p = 0.12) and had no sustained or slow current (Fig. 4B), showing that this triplet is not sufficient for sustained opening of rASIC1a. In sharp contrast, rASIC1a-MDS desensitized much faster than rASIC1a wild type (τ < 50 ms, n = 10; p < 0.001) and displayed robust sustained currents at pH 5 (13 ± 2% of the peak current amplitude, n = 8; Fig. 4B). Combined substitution of the two triplets, VAA and SQL, by MDSPFM had similar effects as substitution of VAA by MDS alone: fast desensitization of the transient current (τ < 50 ms, n = 7) and sustained openings at pH 6.4 and 5 (8 ± 2% of the peak current amplitude at pH 6.4 and 12 ± 2% at pH 5, n = 8; Fig. 4B). These findings clearly show that the MDS triplet is not only necessary for sustained opening of sASIC1b but also sufficient to introduce sustained opening into rASIC1a. Because Asp110 had an especially prominent role for sustained opening of sASIC1b, we substituted the corresponding amino acid in rASIC1a, Ala81, with an Asp. rASIC1a-A81D desensitized significantly faster (τ = 340 ± 50 ms, n = 11; p < 0.001) than rASIC1a wild-type and showed sustained opening with an amplitude of 2% of the transient current at pH 5 (n = 4; Fig. 4B), showing that am Asp at this position is a determinant of fast desensitization and is sufficient to introduce sustained opening in rASIC1a. Sustained sASIC1b currents are unselective, whereas transient currents are Na+-selective (18Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, reversal potentials of leak-subtracted sustained rASIC1a-MDS currents were also significantly shifted by 20 mV to the left compared with transient currents (1 ± 2 mV compared with 21 ± 3 mV; n = 10; p < 0.001; Fig. 4C), showing that the MDS triplet introduces unselective sustained currents into rASIC1a. Some sustained activity is even induced at pH 7.4, as revealed by amiloride block and sensitivity of the background current to exchange by the large cation NMDG+ (Fig. 4C). Constitutive ASIC1a activity will load the oocytes with Na+ and shift the Na+ equilibrium potential to the left, explaining the reversal potential of the transient current ∼20 mV (instead of the usual 50–60 mV; Fig. 4C). By which mechanism does an aspartate at position 110 (in sASIC1b) keep the ASIC1 pore constitutively open? One possibility is that this residue moves during the gating transitions of ASIC1 and that it sterically destabilizes the desensitized conformation. To get evidence for movement of this residue during gating of ASIC1, we assessed the accessibility of residue 110 of sASIC1b to modification by cysteine-reactive MTSEA, a positively charged MTS reagent. For wild-type sASIC1b, MTSEA had no effect on the peak amplitude or on the appearance of the sustained current, when applied at pH 7.4 and 5 (Fig. 5A). Introduction of a cysteine at position 110 resulted in channels that desensitized rapidly and did not have a sustained current (Fig. 5B), similar to the introduction of an alanine at the same position (Fig. 4A). Different reactivity of Cys110 with MTSEA in different states of the channel (closed versus desensitized) would detect a movement of this residue relative to surrounding residues. We first investigated MTS modification in the closed state (Fig. 5B). Application of a low concentration (0.5 μm) of MTSEA at pH 7.4 in the interval between applications of pH 6 dramatically altered the currents of sASIC1b-D110C: peak amplitude gradually increased 2.3-fold, and a robust sustained current appeared that had an amplitude of 28 ± 4% of the peak current (n = 6). After five applications of 10-s duration, the modification of the current was complete (Fig. 5B). Application of a 2,000-fold higher MTSEA concentration (1 mm) at pH 6.0 (instead of pH 7.4) similarly led to the slow appearance of a sustained current (18 ± 6% of the initial peak current amplitude, n = 11; Fig. 5C), suggesting that MTSEA also modified the channel when it was in the desensitized conformation, albeit with a dramatically smaller reaction rate (see below). After recovery at pH 7.4, the amplitude of the transient current also was increased, further suggesting MTSEA modification of sASIC1b-D110C at pH 6.0. Application of the reducing agent DTT (10 mm) reversed the increase in sustained current (Fig. 5C). Together these results suggest that MTSEA covalently modified Cys110 and that this modification strongly increased peak amplitude and enables sustained opening of sASIC1b. MTSEA modification was faster at pH 7.4 than at pH 6, although a 2,000-fold smaller concentration was used to modify the channel. Consequently, exponential fits of the fractional increase of the sustained current versus exposure time (in mm × seconds; Fig. 5D) yielded a reaction rate of 100,000 m−1 s−1 at pH 7.4 that was 22,000-fold higher than at pH 6 (4.6 m−1 s−1; p < 0.005). Thus, at pH 7.4, Cys110 was modified by MTSEA with a rate comparable with mercaptoethanol in solution (∼37,000 m−1 s−1) (24Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), suggesting unhindered access to this residue in the closed conformation. The increase of the peak current amplitude after MTSEA modification suggested an increased apparent H+ affinity. However, MTSEA modification (100 μm for 60 s) shifted the apparent H+ affinity of activation only slightly, showing that an increased apparent H+ affinity cannot explain the large increase in peak current amplitude. We speculate that MTSEA modification increased"

https://openalex.org/W2068685847,"Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein that protects cells against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress while also affecting the ER stress response. In this study, we examined BI-1-induced regulation of the ER stress response as well as the control of the protein over cell death under ER stress. In BI-1-overexpressing cells (BI-1 cells), proteasome activity was similar to that of control cells; however, the lysosomal fraction of BI-1 cells showed sensitivity to degradation of BSA. In addition, areas and polygonal lengths of lysosomes were greater in BI-1 cells than in control cells, as assessed by fluorescence and electron microscopy. In BI-1 cells, lysosomal pH was lower than in control cells and lysosomal vacuolar H(+)-ATPase(V-ATPase), a proton pump, was activated, suggesting high H(+) uptake into lysosomes. Even when exposed to ER stress, BI-1 cells maintained high levels of lysosomal activities, including V-ATPase activity. Bafilomycin, a V-ATPase inhibitor, leads to the reversal of BI-1-induced regulation of ER stress response and cell death due to ER stress. In BI-1 knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts, lysosomal activity and number per cell were relatively lower than in BI-1 wild-type cells. This study suggests that highly maintained lysosomal activity may be one of the mechanisms by which BI-1 exerts its regulatory effects on the ER stress response and cell death."

Activity of PDC is inhibited by phosphorylation via the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs). Here, we examined the regulation of Pdk4 gene expression by the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). C/EBPβ modulates the expression of multiple hepatic genes including those involved in metabolism, development, and inflammation. We found that C/EBPβ induced Pdk4 gene expression and decreased PDC activity. This transcriptional induction was mediated through two C/EBPβ binding sites in the Pdk4 promoter. C/EBPβ participates in the hormonal regulation of gluconeogenic genes. Previously, we reported that Pdk4 was induced by thyroid hormone (T(3)). Therefore, we investigated the role of C/EBPβ in the T(3) regulation of Pdk4. T(3) increased C/EBPβ abundance in primary rat hepatocytes. Knockdown of C/EBPβ with siRNA diminished the T(3) induction of the Pdk4 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt1a) genes. CPT1a is an initiating step in the mitochondrial oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Our results indicate that C/EBPβ stimulates Pdk4 expression and participates in the T(3) induction of the Cpt1a and Pdk4 genes."
https://openalex.org/W2051347366,"Transmembrane helices (TMHs) 5 and 6 are known to be important for signal transduction by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our aim was to characterize the interface between TMH5 and TMH6 of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) to gain molecular insights into aspects of signal transduction and regulation. A proline at TMH5 position 5.50 is highly conserved in family A GPCRs and causes a twist in the helix structure. Mutation of the TSHR-specific alanine (Ala-593⁵·⁵⁰) at this position to proline resulted in a 20-fold reduction of cell surface expression. This indicates that TMH5 in the TSHR might have a conformation different from most other family A GPCRs by forming a regular α-helix. Furthermore, linking our own and previous data from directed mutagenesis with structural information led to suggestions of distinct pairs of interacting residues between TMH5 and TMH6 that are responsible for stabilizing either the basal or the active state. Our insights suggest that the inactive state conformation is constrained by a core set of polar interactions among TMHs 2, 3, 6, and 7 and in contrast that the active state conformation is stabilized mainly by non-polar interactions between TMHs 5 and 6. Our findings might be relevant for all family A GPCRs as supported by a statistical analysis of residue properties between the TMHs of a vast number of GPCR sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1975982083,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a Zn(2+) metalloprotease with a characteristic inverted catalytic motif. IDE is ubiquitously expressed and degrades peptide substrates including insulin, endorphin, and the amyloid-β peptide. Although IDE is mainly expressed in the cytosol, it can also be found on the cell surface and in secreted form in extracellular fluids. As IDE lacks a characteristic signal sequence that targets the protein to the classical secretory pathway, release of the enzyme involves non-conventional mechanisms. However, functional domains of IDE involved in its secretion remain elusive. By bioinformatical, biochemical, and cell biological methods, we identified a novel amino acid motif ((853)EKPPHY(858)) close to the C terminus of IDE and characterized its function in the non-conventional secretion of the protein. Because of its close homology to an amino acid sequence found in bacterial proteins belonging to the SlyX family, we propose to call it the SlyX motif. Mutagenesis revealed that deletion of this motif strongly decreased the release of IDE, whereas deletion of a potential microbody-targeting signal at the extreme C terminus had little effect on secretion. The combined data indicate that the non-conventional secretion of IDE is regulated by the newly identified SlyX motif."
https://openalex.org/W2032362320,"UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucuronate. Glucuronate represents an integral component of the glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan, which accumulates in orbital Graves disease. Here we report that orbital fibroblasts express higher levels of UGDH than do those from skin. This is a consequence of greater UGDH gene promoter activity and more abundant steady-state UGDH mRNA. Six Sp1 sites located in the proximal 550 bp of the UGDH gene promoter appear to determine basal promoter activity, as does a previously unrecognized 49-bp sequence spanning -1436 nucleotides (nt) and -1388 nt that negatively affects activity. Nuclear Sp1 protein is more abundant in orbital fibroblasts, and its binding to specific sites on DNA is greater than that in dermal fibroblasts. Mutating each of these Sp1 sites in a UGDH gene promoter fragment, extending from -1387 to +71 nt and fused to a luciferase reporter, results in divergent activities when transfected in orbital and dermal fibroblasts. Reducing Sp1 attenuated UGDH gene promoter activity, lowered steady-state UGDH mRNA levels, and reduced UGDH enzyme activity. Targeting Sp1 and UGDH with specific siRNAs also lowered hyaluronan synthase-1 (HAS-1) and HAS-2 levels and reduced hyaluronan accumulation in orbital fibroblasts. These findings suggest that orbital fibroblasts express high levels of UGDH in an anatomic-specific manner, apparently the result of greater constitutive Sp1. These high UGDH levels may underlie susceptibility of the orbit to localized overproduction of hyaluronan in Graves disease."

Calella A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 1105-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The common central event in prion pathologies is the conversion of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a pathogenic, insoluble, and partially protease-resistant isoform (PrPsc) that aggregates and accumulates in specific brain areas, triggers neuronal degeneration, and ultimately leads to dementia and death (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar).Besides its implication in the development of TSE, it was postulated that PrPc could fulfill physiological functions. Indeed, it has been suggested that PrPc could participate in lymphocyte activation, cellular adhesion processes, neuronal growth, synaptogenesis, cellular signaling, and cell survival/apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 3Linden R. Martins V.R. Prado M.A. Cammarota M. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 673-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).The cellular prion protein is physiologically cleaved at the 111/112 peptidyl bond, thereby generating the so-called N1 amino-terminal fragment and its carboxyl-terminal membrane tethered counterpart named C1 (4Chen S.G.

This peptide has been shown to be neurotoxic in vitro (5Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying PrPc processing could provide a means to interfere with PrPc-dependent effects in both physiological and pathological conditions.We and others previously established that PrPc metabolism could be either constitutive or regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) (7Vincent B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that the disintegrins ADAM10 and ADAM17 were directly responsible for the constitutive and PKC-regulated processing of PrPc, respectively (8Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. J. Biol.

We very recently showed that stimulation of the M1/M3 muscarinic receptors with several classical or more receptor-specific agonists promotes isoform-specific PKC-dependent processing of the cellular prion protein via catalytic activation of ADAM17 upon phosphorylation on its threonine 735 (11Alfa Cissé M.

Moreover, we demonstrated that the conventional PKCα, the novel PKCδ and PKCϵ, but not the atypical PKCζ isoforms participate in the PDBu- or carbachol-stimulated N1 production (12Alfa Cissé M. Louis K. Braun U. Mari B. Leitges M. Slack B.E. Fisher A. Auberger P. Checler F. Vincent B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 39: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence encompassing the intracytoplasmic Thr-735 of ADAM17 indicated that this residue is not part of the canonical (K/R)R(K/R/Q)GT(F/L/V)X consensus sequence that is required for phosphorylation by PKCα, -δ, or -ϵ isoforms, suggesting that PKC indirectly mediated phosphorylation of ADAM17 and thus, that N1 production required an additional kinase. Cautious analysis of mouse and human ADAM17 sequences revealed that the Thr-735 of ADAM17 was located in an APQTPG sequence corresponding to a canonical ERK1-targeted motif (XPXTPX).We show here that ERK1 is absolutely required for PDBU- and carbachol-induced processing of PrPc and that the inhibition of the ERK1 pathway totally impairs phosphorylation of ADAM17 on its Thr-735 and thereby, N1 production. In addition, we establish that, besides its crucial involvement in PrPc-regulated processing, ERK1 modulates PrPc protein and mRNA levels by a mechanism implying AP-1-dependent transcriptional control.DISCUSSIONAlthough the importance of the cellular prion protein in the development of TSEs has been extensively documented (see Ref. 1Aguzzi A. Calella A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 1105-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar for review), less is known concerning the physiological roles fulfilled by this protein. Because PrPc knock-out mice are viable and fertile with no apparent dysfunction (32Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Lipp H.P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), it has long been thought that PrPc does not participate in any vital physiological process. However, subsequent studies showed that PrPc could contribute to various biological functions such as lymphocyte activation, cell adhesion, synaptic transmission, and apoptosis (see Ref. 3Linden R. Martins V.R. Prado M.A. Cammarota M. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 673-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar for review). Noteworthy, PrPc is subjected to a physiological proteolytic breakdown at its 111/112 peptide bond (4Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). There exist strong evidence that disintegrins ADAM10 and ADAM17 are responsible for the constitutive and PKC-regulated pathway (8Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B.

It should be noted, however, that a few studies failed to find evidence for an involvement of ADAM proteases on PrPc processing but this discrepancy may be likely explained by distinct experimental conditions in which recombinant soluble enzyme were used or because only constitutive processing was examined (33Taylor D.R. Parkin E.T. Cocklin S.L. Ault J.R. Ashcroft A.E. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22590-22600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Endres K.

Concerning the C1 fragment, we previously showed that its overexpression potentiates staurosporine-induced apoptosis in vitro (23Sunyach C. Cisse M.A. da Costa C.A. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol.

As far as the N1 fragment is concerned, the first indirect demonstration of an N1-related function was first brought by in vivo studies showing that transgenic mice expressing N-terminal-truncated PrPc constructs displayed exacerbated neurodegeneration and that this phenotype strictly requires the depletion of the 32-121 N-terminal sequence, thereby suggesting a putative N1-associated neuroprotective effect (38Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blättler T. Brandner S. Götz J. Rülicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C.

We brought the definitive and direct proof that N1 indeed conveys neuroprotection by showing that treatment with the recombinant N1 peptide or stimulation of N1 production by muscarinic agonists invariably protect cells from hypoxia-induced p53-dependent apoptosis and ischemia in vitro and in vivo (41Guillot-Sestier M.V. Sunyach C. Druon C. Scarzello S. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35973-35986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, it has been very recently established that ablation of neuronal PrPc triggers a chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy due to impaired peripheral myelin maintenance (42Bremer J. Baumann F. Tiberi C. Wessig C. Fischer H. Schwarz P. Steele A.D. Toyka K.V. Nave K.A. Weis J. Aguzzi A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This was an additional demonstration of a PrPc-associated pathology of the peripheral nervous system unrelated to TSEs. Interestingly, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy can be rescued by PrPc variants that undergo disintegrin-mediated proteolytic processing at the 111/112 site but not by cleavage-resistant variants. Therefore, the N1 and/or C1 fragments derived from the physiological processing of PrPc are essential for myelin maintenance (42Bremer J. Baumann F. Tiberi C. Wessig C. Fischer H. Schwarz P. Steele A.D. Toyka K.V. Nave K.A. Weis J. Aguzzi A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Altogether, and because we established that the N1-associated neuroprotective function was dominant over the C1-mediated toxic effect (41Guillot-Sestier M.V. Sunyach C. Druon C. Scarzello S. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35973-35986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), these data suggests that up-regulating α-secretase processing of PrPc could convey beneficial effects in normal conditions as well as in pathological conditions unrelated to prion diseases. Therefore, a possible track would be to activate the PKC-regulated α-secretase hydrolysis of PrPc at the 111/112 peptide bond. Phosphorylation of ADAM17 on its intracytoplasmic threonine residue at position 735 is necessary to activate this pathway (11Alfa Cissé M. Sunyach C. Slack B.E. Fisher A. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4083-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This amino acid is embedded in a consensus phosphorylation site targeted by ERK1/2. We therefore examined whether this kinase was directly responsible for ADAM17 activation through Thr-735 phosphorylation and, thereby, could act as a direct and functional activator of PKC-regulated α-secretase processing of PrPc. Four lines of data indicate that it is indeed the case. First, inhibition of MEK, a kinase occurring upstream in the MEK/ERK signaling cascade reduces α-secretase JMV2770-hydrolyzing activity and drastically impairs N1 secretion and ADAM17 phosphorylation. Second, transient overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active forms of these two kinases in both human cells and murine primary neurons activate PDBu- and carbachol-dependent N1 production, whereas dominant-negative kinases reduce the recovery of N1 in the conditioned medium. Third, ERK1 deletion impairs PKC-regulated α-secretase activity and abolishes PDBu- and carbachol-dependent N1 secretion. Fourth, ERK1 cDNA transfection in ERK1−/− cells rescues carbachol-dependent secretion of N1. Overall, we propose that the M1/M3 muscarinic receptors activation triggers ADAM17-dependent processing of PrPc at the 111/112 site after initiating the MEK/ERK pathway depicted in green in Fig. 11. ERK1-mediated control of PrPc processing is not the only example of such an ERK1-controlled proteolytic conversion. Thus, the neurotrophin receptor TrkA shedding is also stimulated through an ERK1-dependent phosphorylation of ADAM17 at its Thr-735 in both in vitro assay and cultured cells (43Díaz-Rodríguez E. Montero J.C. Esparís-Ogando A. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, this molecular event induces maturation and trafficking of ADAM17 to the plasma membrane thereby explaining the gain of activity of the ERK1-dependent threonine 735-phosphorylated ADAM17 form (44Soond S.M. Everson B. Riches D.W. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, this cascade is not ubiquitous because we recently demonstrated that α-secretase-regulated processing of β-amyloid precursor protein indeed involved ADAM17 and PKCs but in an ERK-1-independent manner (45Cissé M. Braun U. Leitges M. Fisher A. Pagès G. Checler F. Vincent B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2011; 47: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Interestingly, PrPc-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in ERK1−/− MEFs. This led us to examine the putative involvement of ERK1 in the regulation of PrPc expression. We established that the observed ERK1-dependent reduction in PrPc immunoreactivity results from a direct effect on PrPc transcription. First, ERK1 depletion lowers PrPc promoter transactivation and mRNA levels. Second, transient expression of dominant-negative forms of ERK1 or MEK1 significantly reduced PrPc promoter activation and mRNA levels in HEK293 cells. Third, constitutively active MEK1 triggers the opposite effect. How does ERK signaling modulate PrPc promoter transactivation? Several clues came from molecular cloning and characterization of the human, bovine, and mouse PRNP gene (25Funke-Kaiser H. Theis S. Behrouzi T. Thomas A. Scheuch K. Zollmann F.S. Paterka M. Paul M.

Sci. 1997; 59: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that revealed consensus binding sequences for several transcription factors, namely Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, c-Rel, Nkx2–5, Ets-1, and NF-AT. Several of these putative effectors proved to be functional for modulating PrPc transcription in pathophysiological situations such as Sp1-dependent control of copper homeostasis (48Bellingham S.A. Coleman L.A. Masters C.L. Camakaris J. Hill A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or presenilin-dependent p53-mediated PrPc apoptosis (49Vincent B. Sunyach C. Orzechowski H.D. St. Georges-Hyslop P. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).We clearly showed that transcription factor AP-1, but not Sp1, contributes, at least partly, to the ERK1-dependent control of PrPc. Thus, cDNA constructs harboring various 5′ deletions indicate that the ablation of the promoter region containing the AP-1 binding site, but not Sp1-related GC box elements, strongly impaired PrPc promoter transactivation. Accordingly, inactivating mutations of the AP-1 binding sequence in the full-length promoter significantly reduce its promoter transactivation in two different cell lines. However, the fact that the extent of inhibition triggered by the −284/−131 deletion was higher than that resulting from the AP-1 site mutation (55–70% compared with 30% inhibition, Fig. 10C), suggests that additional transcription factors, the binding sites of which would be located within position −284/−131, may also modulate PrPc expression. It is noteworthy that binding sites for Ets-1, NF-AT, AP-2, YY1, and E4BP4 have been delineated in such a region (25Funke-Kaiser H. Theis S. Behrouzi T. Thomas A. Scheuch K. Zollmann F.S. Paterka M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 6716-6724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data clearly established an important functional contribution of ERK1 and AP-1 in the positive control of PrPc transcription (Fig. 11, orange arrowheads).Because ERK increases both PrPc expression and the production of its α-secretase-derived catabolite N1, one can question whether the increase of N1 is just the consequence of an upstream elevation of its precursor PrPc or if ERK triggers dual and fully independent phenotypes. Close examination of some of the data indicates that the latter hypothesis is more likely. Thus, PDBu- and carbachol-stimulated N1 production is abolished in ERK-deficient cells, whereas PrPc expression remains similar in treated and untreated null fibroblasts. This shows that agonist-dependent phosphorylation of ADAM17 and subsequent N1 production is impaired by ERK1 ablation, whereas reduction of PrPc still stands. Second, ERK-1 rescues the carbachol-induced increase in N1 production without affecting PrPc expression levels. This set of data reflects a clear discrimination between the two events that could be likely accounted for by distinct time frames for the two processes, with an early phase involving ADAM17 phosphorylation and enhanced PrPc catabolism and a later phase needing a necessary delay to activate the transcriptional machinery.Another interesting aspect of this work concerns the putative functional cross-talk between PrPc and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Thus, PrPc cross-linking or overexpression triggers ERK phosphorylation in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (51Schneider B. Mutel V. Pietri M. Ermonval M. Mouillet-Richard S. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl.

Glia. 2009; 57: 1439-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MEK/ERK cascade could self-stimulate its own signaling via the increase of PrPc expression and thereby explain both ERK and PrPc-related protective phenotypes documented in certain cell systems (3Linden R. Martins V.R. Prado M.A. Cammarota M. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 673-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 60Han B.H. Holtzman D.M. J.

Along with this hypothesis, one could envision that part of an ERK1-dependent PrPc-associated antiapoptotic function could be mediated by an ERK-1-mediated increase in N1 because we recently characterized this catabolite as a neuroprotective factor both in vitro and in vivo (41Guillot-Sestier M.V.

Chem. 2009; 284: 35973-35986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).In other cases, PrPc has been shown to be toxic and trigger p53-dependent cell death (35Paitel E. Alves da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this case, the ERK-1-mediated production of N1 could be seen as a cellular response to counterbalance PrPc-mediated toxicity. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the observation that in cells overexpressing a PrPc construct lacking the 32–134 amino-terminal sequence (that encompasses most of the N1 domain), ERK phosphorylation is still stimulated but leads to cell death, oxidative injury, and neurodegeneration (62Gavín R.

This could be due to the fact that whereas N-terminal-truncated PrPc is increased, its neuroprotective counterpart N1 is lacking.Overall, our study suggests that under normal conditions, ERK1 contributes to cell survival and neuroprotection through the augmentation of N1 secretion (41Guillot-Sestier M.V.

Chem. 2009; 284: 35973-35986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) via an increase in ADAM17 activity and PrPc expression. It is likely that in pathological situations, N1 could temporarily compensate for the PrP scrapie-associated toxicity and cell death and thereby partly could explain the long asymptomatic time course of TSEs.Note Added in ProofWe want to make clear that in some of the gels appearing in the article, lanes have been reorganized for purposes of clarity.

IntroductionThe cellular prion protein is responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) 4The abbreviations used are: TSEtransmissible spongiform encephalopathiesPrPccellular prion proteinCAconstitutively activeMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastsDNdominant-negativePDBuphorbol ester 12,13-dibutyrateTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. that can affect several mammals including humans (1Aguzzi A. Calella A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 1105-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The common central event in prion pathologies is the conversion of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a pathogenic, insoluble, and partially protease-resistant isoform (PrPsc) that aggregates and accumulates in specific brain areas, triggers neuronal degeneration, and ultimately leads to dementia and death (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar).Besides its implication in the development of TSE, it was postulated that PrPc could fulfill physiological functions. Indeed, it has been suggested that PrPc could participate in lymphocyte activation, cellular adhesion processes, neuronal growth, synaptogenesis, cellular signaling, and cell survival/apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 3Linden R. Martins V.R. Prado M.A. Cammarota M. Izquierdo I. Brentani R.R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 673-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).The cellular prion protein is physiologically cleaved at the 111/112 peptidyl bond, thereby generating the so-called N1 amino-terminal fragment and its carboxyl-terminal membrane tethered counterpart named C1 (4Chen S.G.

Interestingly, an additional cleavage occurring at the 90/91 peptide bond in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-affected brains yielding fragments referred to as N2 and C2 (4Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P.

This peptide has been shown to be neurotoxic in vitro (5Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) and in vivo (6Ettaiche M. Pichot R. Vincent J.P. Chabry J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36487-36490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying PrPc processing could provide a means to interfere with PrPc-dependent effects in both physiological and pathological conditions.We and others previously established that PrPc metabolism could be either constitutive or regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) (7Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that the disintegrins ADAM10 and ADAM17 were directly responsible for the constitutive and PKC-regulated processing of PrPc, respectively (8Vincent B. Paitel E. Saftig P. Frobert Y. Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Grassi J. Lopez-Perez E. Checler F. J. Biol.

We very recently showed that stimulation of the M1/M3 muscarinic receptors with several classical or more receptor-specific agonists promotes isoform-specific PKC-dependent processing of the cellular prion protein via catalytic activation of ADAM17 upon phosphorylation on its threonine 735 (11Alfa Cissé M.

Fisher A. Auberger P. Checler F. Vincent B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 39: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that the conventional PKCα, the novel PKCδ and PKCϵ, but not the atypical PKCζ isoforms participate in the PDBu- or carbachol-stimulated N1 production (12Alfa Cissé M. Louis K. Braun U. Mari B. Leitges M. Slack B.E. Fisher A. Auberger P. Checler F. Vincent B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 39: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence encompassing the intracytoplasmic Thr-735 of ADAM17 indicated that this residue is not part of the canonical (K/R)R(K/R/Q)GT(F/L/V)X consensus sequence that is required for phosphorylation by PKCα, -δ, or -ϵ isoforms, suggesting that PKC indirectly mediated phosphorylation of ADAM17 and thus, that N1 production required an additional kinase. Cautious analysis of mouse and human ADAM17 sequences revealed that the Thr-735 of ADAM17 was located in an APQTPG sequence corresponding to a canonical ERK1-targeted motif (XPXTPX).We show here that ERK1 is absolutely required for PDBU- and carbachol-induced processing of PrPc and that the inhibition of the ERK1 pathway totally impairs phosphorylation of ADAM17 on its Thr-735 and thereby, N1 production. In addition, we establish that, besides its crucial involvement in PrPc-regulated processing, ERK1 modulates PrPc protein and mRNA levels by a mechanism implying AP-1-dependent transcriptional control."

https://openalex.org/W2166314533,"Background Many coastal species occupying the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest in North America comprise endemic populations genetically and ecologically distinct from interior continental conspecifics. Morphological variation previously identified among wolf populations resulted in recognition of multiple subspecies of wolves in the Pacific Northwest. Recently, separate genetic studies have identified diverged populations of wolves in coastal British Columbia and coastal Southeast Alaska, providing support for hypotheses of distinct coastal subspecies. These two regions are geographically and ecologically contiguous, however, there is no comprehensive analysis across all wolf populations in this coastal rainforest. Methodology/Principal Findings By combining mitochondrial DNA datasets from throughout the Pacific Northwest, we examined the genetic relationship between coastal British Columbia and Southeast Alaska wolf populations and compared them with adjacent continental populations. Phylogenetic analysis indicates complete overlap in the genetic diversity of coastal British Columbia and Southeast Alaska wolves, but these populations are distinct from interior continental wolves. Analyses of molecular variation support the separation of all coastal wolves in a group divergent from continental populations, as predicted based on hypothesized subspecies designations. Two novel haplotypes also were uncovered in a newly assayed continental population of interior Alaska wolves. Conclusions/Significance We found evidence that coastal wolves endemic to these temperate rainforests are diverged from neighbouring, interior continental wolves; a finding that necessitates new international strategies associated with the management of this species."

Palmer T. Plano G.V. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Among them, the type II secretion pathway is a two-step process in which exoproteins are initially exported through the cytoplasmic membrane by either the Sec or Tat translocons (2Voulhoux R. Ball G. Ize B. Vasil M.L. Lazdunski A. Wu L.F. Filloux A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6735-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Translocation across the outer membrane is then performed by the type II secretion system (T2SS), 5The abbreviations used are: T2SStype II secretion systemHPPhyper-pseudopilusIMFimmunofluorescenceMLmaximum likelihood. also called secreton. In our model organism, the gammaproteobacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the secreton is a multiprotein complex involving at least 12 different proteins called XcpA, XcpP–Z (3Michel G.P. Voulhoux R. Wooldridge K. Bacterial Secreted Proteins. Vol. 1. Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, UK2009: 67-92Google Scholar). In the current model of Xcp secreton assembly, three subcomplexes are defined: the inner membrane platform (XcpRSYZ), required to provide energy during the secretion process; the secretin XcpQ, forming a pore in the outer membrane through which the substrate is transported and further expelled by the third subcomplex of the system called pseudopilus in analogy with the type IV pilus assembly system (4Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Five Xcp components (XcpT–X) are, like the major type IV pilin, PilA, all substrates for the prepilin peptidase XcpA/PilD (5Bally M. Filloux A. Akrim M. Ball G. Lazdunski A. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Bleves S. Voulhoux R. Michel G. Lazdunski A. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). They have consequently been called pseudopilins. The three-dimensional structure of all pseudopilins characterized so far displays the typical αβ fold found in the pilin/pseudopilin family (7Alphonse S. Durand E. Douzi B. Waegele B. Darbon H. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. Bernard C. J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 169: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Korotkov K.V. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Mol.

XcpT, which is the most abundant pseudopilin (12Nunn D.N. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4375-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is the only pseudopilin able to assemble into a pilus-like structure. We called this structure hyper-pseudopilus (HPP) because it is only observable under conditions of XcpT overproduction (13Durand E. Bernadac A. Ball G. Lazdunski A. Sturgis J.N. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2749-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Hu N.T. Leu W.M. Lee M.S. Chen A. Chen S.C. Song Y.L. Chen L.Y. Biochem.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the Xcp secreton contains a pilus-like structure and that the main component of this so-called pseudopilus is XcpT. XcpT is then considered as the major pseudopilin, whereas the four other pseudopilins, XcpU–X are called minor pseudopilins.Due to their high specificity for a given organism and a set of substrates, components of the diverse T2SSs found in Gram-negative bacteria are hardly exchangeable (4Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the major pseudopilin, generally called GspG in Gram-negative bacteria, appears much less specific because homologs of GspG from six different T2SSs, including the P. aeruginosa Xcp system, are fully functional in the Klebsiella oxytoca Pul T2SS lacking its major pseudopilin PulG (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that in type II secretion, substrate- or species-specificity is not related to the major pseudopilin, which therefore probably assembles a pseudopilus exchangeable between most T2SSs.In addition to the typical Xcp T2SS, the PAO1 P. aeruginosa strain possesses a second T2SS, referred to as Hxc system (for homolog to Xcp) (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whereas more than a dozen exoproteins utilize the Xcp T2SS for their secretion, the Hxc T2SS is dedicated to the secretion of one single protein, the low molecular mass alkaline phosphatase LapA (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Viarre V. Cascales E. Ball G. Michel G.P. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33815-33823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have previously observed in complementation assays the nonredundancy of the two machineries and more particularly that HxcT, which is 60% identical to XcpT, is unable to compensate for the lack of XcpT for Xcp secretion in P. aeruginosa (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based on other studies (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), such incompatibility between two major pseudopilins is unexpected, especially between two T2SSs belonging to the same organism.We show with the present study that, in addition to its inability to compensate for the lack of XcpT, HxcT pseudopilins are also unable to assemble into an HPP even when overproduced. Interestingly, these two phenotypes are restored when using an HxcT variant in which 9 residues have been replaced with corresponding residues in XcpT and other compatible major pseudopilins. Because those key residues are different in HxcT, our data clearly indicate that the second Hxc T2SS of P. aeruginosa is unable to assemble a HPP, which suggests different pseudopilus architecture. We concluded that such differences in the Xcp and Hxc systems probably result in subtle modification of the type II secretion process and highlight the existence of two T2SS subtypes that we propose to name T2aSS and T2bSS for Xcp- and Hxc-type systems, respectively. Interestingly, such HxcT-specific amino acids are found in phylogenetically related GspG proteins, revealing a larger distribution of this alternative T2bSS.DISCUSSIONAmong the different protein secretion mechanisms found in Gram-negative bacteria, the type II secretion process remains one of the less understood. In analogy with the type IV piliation system, several reports are proposing the involvement of a pilus-like structure, called pseudopilus, in the type II secretion process. Since the discovery in P. aeruginosa of a second T2SS secreting its own substrate (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we wondered why the bacteria acquired a complete second system for the secretion of one more T2SS-dependent protein instead of adding LapA to the dozen of others exoproteins traveling through the Xcp system. Our phylogenetic analyses provide an explanation: HxcT and likely the whole Hxc system, including LapA, was acquired by P. aeruginosa PAO1 and a few other Pseudomonas species through horizontal gene transfers from a betaproteobacterium and is not the result of an evolutionary process that occurred after a duplication event in the Pseudomonas lineage. The conservation of both Hxc and Xcp systems in P. aeruginosa PAO1 suggests that they may represent two distinct subfamilies of T2SSs.We are proposing that the secretion process of the Hxc T2SS of P. aeruginosa is animated by a pseudopilus whose structure and stability may differ from the one commonly found in Xcp and other known T2SSs. Our study shows that modifying HxcT for nine selected residues conserved in XcpT-like protein is sufficient to convert HxcT into a classical compatible major pseudopilin. We gradually substituted the nine residues and observed after introducing the fifth mutation that we were able to restore HPP formation and Xcp-dependent secretion. In our view, the first five mutations are of the most importance because from the HxcTmut5 mutant the phenotypic conversion is obtained, and further substitutions in this mutant form only improved HPP formation and Xcp-dependent secretion. These five mutations are K23Q (n1), E84K (n2), S77K (n3), N123D (n4), and K48D (n5). We hypothesized that restoring those substitutions would restore favorable interactions that would allow the HPP formation. A recent report (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) presents a detailed assembly model of the K. oxytoca Pul-dependent type II secretion pilus. Because XcpT is able to substitute PulG for HPP formation in the Pul system (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the pseudopilus model proposed in this study could be applicable to the XcpT pseudopilus. Strikingly, our structure-based mutagenesis that turned HxcT into an XcpT-compatible pseudopilin indeed highlighted amino acids known to be essential for the PulG/XcpT type of pseudopilus (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By mapping our mutations onto the PulG pseudopilus model, we are able to describe the effect of each mutation and therefore their potential impact on pilus formation. Taken together, the mutations n2 and n5 reestablish an intermolecular salt bridge between Lys84 and Asp48. This salt bridge has been demonstrated to be essential for PulG/XcpT pseudopilus formation (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mutations n3 and n4 are also correlated because substituting these two residues (S77K and N123D) has two consequences. Indeed, the residue Lys77 in XcpT (Arg78 in PulG) is involved in (i) the establishment of a salt bridge with the residue Asp32 of another protomer and (ii) the restoration of a positive patch, composed of residues Arg51, Arg56, and Lys77, which interacts with a negative patch of another protomer composed of acidic residues Asp114 and Asp123. Interestingly Campos et al. (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) proceeded to the charge inversion of Arg87 and Asp48 into Glu87 and Lys48, which exactly correspond to the residues present in HxcT. These residues Lys48 (Asp48 of PulG) and Glu84 (Arg87 in PulG) are also able to form a salt bridge, but this potential salt bridge is not important for Hxc pseudopilus because the HxcTmut2 variant (Lys84/Lys48) cannot form a salt bridge but is still functional in Hxc-dependent secretion (Fig. 5). The mutation n2 disrupts this interaction by replacing Glu84 by Lys84 (the couple Lys48/Lys84 precludes the formation of a salt bridge). We confirm the absolute requirement of this Lys84/Asp48 salt bridge for Xcp secretion because its absence in the first six substitutions fully abolished the phenotypic restoration, as demonstrated by the mutant HxcTmut6Δn5 (Fig. 4).Interestingly, our study reveals a clear coupling between pseudopilus formation and protein secretion in classical T2SS. We indeed observed that during the process of the mutagenesis both protein secretion and HPP formation phenotypes were concomitantly reverted, thus suggesting that a high degree of major pseudopilin multimerization is not only required but essential for protein secretion in classical T2SSs such as Xcp. We are showing that HxcT is unable to reach such a level of multimerization, indicating that the multimerization capacity associated with the nine conserved XcpT residues is dispensable for Hxc secretion, strengthening our idea that different core assembly might exist between Hxc-like and Xcp-like pseudopili.Major pseudopilins are not directly involved in substrate recognition because various GspGs are able to replace PulG in Pullulanase secretion by the Pul secreton (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we do not think that XcpT and HxcT are involved in the direct recognition of the substrate. However, we do think that the degree of pseudopilus polymerization does indirectly matter in substrate recognition through another secreton component. The fact that Xcp-compatible HxcT variants are still able to support secretion of the Hxc substrate indicates that other motifs are involved in substrate recognition.In conclusion, we clearly established that two subfamilies of T2SS which differ by the assembly characteristic of their pseudopili could now be identified. We therefore propose to name them T2aSS and T2bSS for Xcp- and Hxc-type systems, respectively. The next challenge will be to understand why specific residues allowing HPP formation in T2aSS are not required in T2bSS secretion. Such evolution of a secretory machine was previously reported for type V secretion and revealed in one case the alternative widespread T5dSS (29Salacha R. Kovaciæ F. Brochier-Armanet C. Wilhelm S. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. Bleves S. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1498-1512PubMed Google Scholar) and in the other case the singular P-Usher transporter (30Ruer S. Ball G. Filloux A. de Bentzmann S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2669-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Those findings together with the present T2bSS demonstrate how similar bacterial machineries evolve toward distinct mechanisms that may contribute specific functions. IntroductionAt least six distinct pathways have been identified in Gram-negative bacteria for the secretion of a diverse pool of extracellular proteins (1Economou A. Christie P.J. Fernandez R.C.

Due to their high specificity for a given organism and a set of substrates, components of the diverse T2SSs found in Gram-negative bacteria are hardly exchangeable (4Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the major pseudopilin, generally called GspG in Gram-negative bacteria, appears much less specific because homologs of GspG from six different T2SSs, including the P. aeruginosa Xcp system, are fully functional in the Klebsiella oxytoca Pul T2SS lacking its major pseudopilin PulG (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that in type II secretion, substrate- or species-specificity is not related to the major pseudopilin, which therefore probably assembles a pseudopilus exchangeable between most T2SSs. In addition to the typical Xcp T2SS, the PAO1 P. aeruginosa strain possesses a second T2SS, referred to as Hxc system (for homolog to Xcp) (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whereas more than a dozen exoproteins utilize the Xcp T2SS for their secretion, the Hxc T2SS is dedicated to the secretion of one single protein, the low molecular mass alkaline phosphatase LapA (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Viarre V. Cascales E. Ball G. Michel G.P. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33815-33823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have previously observed in complementation assays the nonredundancy of the two machineries and more particularly that HxcT, which is 60% identical to XcpT, is unable to compensate for the lack of XcpT for Xcp secretion in P. aeruginosa (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based on other studies (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), such incompatibility between two major pseudopilins is unexpected, especially between two T2SSs belonging to the same organism. We show with the present study that, in addition to its inability to compensate for the lack of XcpT, HxcT pseudopilins are also unable to assemble into an HPP even when overproduced. Interestingly, these two phenotypes are restored when using an HxcT variant in which 9 residues have been replaced with corresponding residues in XcpT and other compatible major pseudopilins. Because those key residues are different in HxcT, our data clearly indicate that the second Hxc T2SS of P. aeruginosa is unable to assemble a HPP, which suggests different pseudopilus architecture. We concluded that such differences in the Xcp and Hxc systems probably result in subtle modification of the type II secretion process and highlight the existence of two T2SS subtypes that we propose to name T2aSS and T2bSS for Xcp- and Hxc-type systems, respectively. Interestingly, such HxcT-specific amino acids are found in phylogenetically related GspG proteins, revealing a larger distribution of this alternative T2bSS. DISCUSSIONAmong the different protein secretion mechanisms found in Gram-negative bacteria, the type II secretion process remains one of the less understood. In analogy with the type IV piliation system, several reports are proposing the involvement of a pilus-like structure, called pseudopilus, in the type II secretion process. Since the discovery in P. aeruginosa of a second T2SS secreting its own substrate (16Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we wondered why the bacteria acquired a complete second system for the secretion of one more T2SS-dependent protein instead of adding LapA to the dozen of others exoproteins traveling through the Xcp system. Our phylogenetic analyses provide an explanation: HxcT and likely the whole Hxc system, including LapA, was acquired by P. aeruginosa PAO1 and a few other Pseudomonas species through horizontal gene transfers from a betaproteobacterium and is not the result of an evolutionary process that occurred after a duplication event in the Pseudomonas lineage. The conservation of both Hxc and Xcp systems in P. aeruginosa PAO1 suggests that they may represent two distinct subfamilies of T2SSs.We are proposing that the secretion process of the Hxc T2SS of P. aeruginosa is animated by a pseudopilus whose structure and stability may differ from the one commonly found in Xcp and other known T2SSs. Our study shows that modifying HxcT for nine selected residues conserved in XcpT-like protein is sufficient to convert HxcT into a classical compatible major pseudopilin. We gradually substituted the nine residues and observed after introducing the fifth mutation that we were able to restore HPP formation and Xcp-dependent secretion. In our view, the first five mutations are of the most importance because from the HxcTmut5 mutant the phenotypic conversion is obtained, and further substitutions in this mutant form only improved HPP formation and Xcp-dependent secretion. These five mutations are K23Q (n1), E84K (n2), S77K (n3), N123D (n4), and K48D (n5). We hypothesized that restoring those substitutions would restore favorable interactions that would allow the HPP formation. A recent report (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) presents a detailed assembly model of the K. oxytoca Pul-dependent type II secretion pilus. Because XcpT is able to substitute PulG for HPP formation in the Pul system (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the pseudopilus model proposed in this study could be applicable to the XcpT pseudopilus. Strikingly, our structure-based mutagenesis that turned HxcT into an XcpT-compatible pseudopilin indeed highlighted amino acids known to be essential for the PulG/XcpT type of pseudopilus (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By mapping our mutations onto the PulG pseudopilus model, we are able to describe the effect of each mutation and therefore their potential impact on pilus formation. Taken together, the mutations n2 and n5 reestablish an intermolecular salt bridge between Lys84 and Asp48. This salt bridge has been demonstrated to be essential for PulG/XcpT pseudopilus formation (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mutations n3 and n4 are also correlated because substituting these two residues (S77K and N123D) has two consequences. Indeed, the residue Lys77 in XcpT (Arg78 in PulG) is involved in (i) the establishment of a salt bridge with the residue Asp32 of another protomer and (ii) the restoration of a positive patch, composed of residues Arg51, Arg56, and Lys77, which interacts with a negative patch of another protomer composed of acidic residues Asp114 and Asp123. Interestingly Campos et al. (28Campos M. Nilges M. Cisneros D.A. Francetic O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13081-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) proceeded to the charge inversion of Arg87 and Asp48 into Glu87 and Lys48, which exactly correspond to the residues present in HxcT. These residues Lys48 (Asp48 of PulG) and Glu84 (Arg87 in PulG) are also able to form a salt bridge, but this potential salt bridge is not important for Hxc pseudopilus because the HxcTmut2 variant (Lys84/Lys48) cannot form a salt bridge but is still functional in Hxc-dependent secretion (Fig. 5). The mutation n2 disrupts this interaction by replacing Glu84 by Lys84 (the couple Lys48/Lys84 precludes the formation of a salt bridge). We confirm the absolute requirement of this Lys84/Asp48 salt bridge for Xcp secretion because its absence in the first six substitutions fully abolished the phenotypic restoration, as demonstrated by the mutant HxcTmut6Δn5 (Fig. 4).Interestingly, our study reveals a clear coupling between pseudopilus formation and protein secretion in classical T2SS. We indeed observed that during the process of the mutagenesis both protein secretion and HPP formation phenotypes were concomitantly reverted, thus suggesting that a high degree of major pseudopilin multimerization is not only required but essential for protein secretion in classical T2SSs such as Xcp. We are showing that HxcT is unable to reach such a level of multimerization, indicating that the multimerization capacity associated with the nine conserved XcpT residues is dispensable for Hxc secretion, strengthening our idea that different core assembly might exist between Hxc-like and Xcp-like pseudopili.Major pseudopilins are not directly involved in substrate recognition because various GspGs are able to replace PulG in Pullulanase secretion by the Pul secreton (15Vignon G. Köhler R. Larquet E. Giroux S. Prévost M.C. Roux P. Pugsley A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we do not think that XcpT and HxcT are involved in the direct recognition of the substrate. However, we do think that the degree of pseudopilus polymerization does indirectly matter in substrate recognition through another secreton component. The fact that Xcp-compatible HxcT variants are still able to support secretion of the Hxc substrate indicates that other motifs are involved in substrate recognition.In conclusion, we clearly established that two subfamilies of T2SS which differ by the assembly characteristic of their pseudopili could now be identified. We therefore propose to name them T2aSS and T2bSS for Xcp- and Hxc-type systems, respectively. The next challenge will be to understand why specific residues allowing HPP formation in T2aSS are not required in T2bSS secretion. Such evolution of a secretory machine was previously reported for type V secretion and revealed in one case the alternative widespread T5dSS (29Salacha R. Kovaciæ F. Brochier-Armanet C. Wilhelm S. Tommassen J. Filloux A. Voulhoux R. Bleves S. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1498-1512PubMed Google Scholar) and in the other case the singular P-Usher transporter (30Ruer S. Ball G. Filloux A. de Bentzmann S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2669-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Those findings together with the present T2bSS demonstrate how similar bacterial machineries evolve toward distinct mechanisms that may contribute specific functions.

https://openalex.org/W1987445539,"Akt, also known as protein kinase B, has a central role in various signaling pathways that regulate cellular processes such as metabolism, proliferation and survival. On stimulation, phosphorylation of the activation loop (A-loop) and hydrophobic motif (HM) of Akt by the kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively, results in Akt activation. A well-conserved threonine in the turn motif (TM) is also constitutively phosphorylated by mTORC2 and contributes to the stability of Akt. The role of TM phosphorylation in HM and A-loop phosphorylation has not been sufficiently evaluated. Using starfish oocytes as a model system, this study provides the first evidence that TM phosphorylation has a negative role in A-loop phosphorylation. In this system, the maturation-inducing hormone, 1-methyladenine, stimulates Akt to reinitiate meiosis through activation of cyclin B-Cdc2. The phosphorylation status of Akt was monitored via introduction of exogenous human Akt (hAkt) in starfish oocytes. TM and HM phosphorylation was inhibited by microinjection of an anti-starfish TOR antibody, but not by rapamycin treatment, suggesting that both phosphorylation events depend on TORC2, as reported in mammalian cells. A single or double alanine substitution at each of three phosphorylation residues revealed that TM phosphorylation renders Akt susceptible to dephosphorylation on the A-loop. When A-loop phosphatase was inhibited by okadaic acid (OA), TM phosphorylation still reduced A-loop phosphorylation, suggesting that the effect is caused at least partially through reduction of sensitivity to PDK1. Negative regulation by TM phosphorylation was also observed in constitutively active Akt and was functionally reflected in meiosis resumption. By contrast, HM phosphorylation enhanced A-loop phosphorylation and achieved full activation of Akt via a mechanism at least partially independent of TM phosphorylation. These observations provide new insight into the mechanism controlling Akt phosphorylation in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2007399238,"Elevated levels of acute phase proteins (APP) are often found in patients with cardiovascular diseases. In a previous study, we demonstrated the importance of the IL-6-gp130 axis -as a key regulator of inflammatory acute phase signaling in hepatocytes-for the development of atherosclerosis.Gp130-dependent gene expression was analyzed in a previously established hepatocyte-specific gp130 knockout mouse model. We performed whole transcriptome analysis in isolated hepatocytes to measure tissue specific responses after proinflammatory stimulus with IL-6 across different time points. Our analyses revealed an unexpected small gene cluster that requires IL-6 stimulus for early activation. Several of the genes in this cluster are involved in different cell defense mechanisms. Thus, stressors that trigger both general stress and inflammatory responses lead to activation of a stereotypic innate cellular defense response. Furthermore, we identified a potential biomarker Lipocalin (LCN) 2 for the gp130 dependent early inflammatory response.Our findings suggest a complex network of tightly linked genes involved in the early activation of different parts of the innate immune response including acute phase proteins, complement and coagulation cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2010669481,"The human transcriptional positive coactivator 4 (PC4) activates several p53-dependent genes. It has been demonstrated that this is a consequence of direct interaction with p53. Previously, we have concluded that PC4 interacts mainly with the C-terminal negative regulatory domain of p53 through its DNA binding C-terminal half. NMR chemical shift perturbation studies with peptide fragments indicated that amino acids 380-386 of p53 are crucial for interaction with PC4. This was verified by fluorescence anisotropy and sedimentation velocity studies. A peptide consisting of p53-(380-386) sequence, when attached to a cell penetration tag and nuclear localization signal, localizes to the nucleus and inhibits luciferase gene expression from a transfected plasmid carrying a Luc gene under a p53-dependent promoter. Acetylation of lysine 382/381 enhanced the binding of this peptide to PC4 by about an order of magnitude. NMR and mutagenesis studies indicated that serine 73 of PC4 is an important residue for recognition of p53. Intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect placed aspartate 76 in the vicinity of lysine 381, indicating that the region around residues 73-76 of PC4 is important for p53 recognition. We conclude that the 380-386 region of p53 interacts with the region around residues 73-76 of PC4, and acetylation of lysine 382/381 of p53 may play an important role in modulating p53-PC4 interaction and as a consequence PC4 mediated activation of p53 target genes."

We have previously demonstrated that in vitro matured, nucleated erythroblast cells at the orthochromatic stage can be efficiently infected by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We now show that infection of orthochromatic cells induces change in 609 host genes. 592 of these transcripts are up-regulated and associated with metabolic and chaperone pathways unique to P. falciparum infection, as well as a wide range of signaling pathways that are also induced in related apicomplexan infections of mouse hepatocytes or human fibroblast cells. Our data additionally show that polychromatophilic cells, which precede the orthochromatic stage and are not infected when co-cultured with P. falciparum, up-regulate a small set of genes, at least two of which are associated with pathways of hematopoiesis and/or erythroid cell development. These data support the idea that P. falciparum affects erythropoiesis at multiple stages during erythroblast differentiation. Further P. falciparum may modulate gene expression in bystander erythroblasts and thus influence pathways of erythrocyte development. This study provides a benchmark of the host erythroblast cell response to infection by P. falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W2110304545,"The nonenzymatic cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (HK) is a precursor of bradykinin (BK). The production of BK from HK by plasma kallikrein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation and vascular injury. However, the functional role of HK in the absence of prekallikrein (PK), the proenzyme of plasma kallikrein, on vascular endothelial cells is not fully defined. In addition, no clinical abnormality is seen in PK-deficient patients. Therefore, an investigation into the effect of HK, in the absence of PK, on human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) function was performed. HK caused a marked and dose-dependent increase in the intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)](i) level in HPAEC. Gd(3+) and verapamil potentiated the HK-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i). HK-induced Ca(2+) increase stimulated endothelial nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI(2)) production. The inhibitors of B(2) receptor-dependent signaling pathway impaired HK-mediated signal transduction in HPAEC. HK had no effect on endothelial permeability at physiological concentration. This study demonstrated that HK regulates endothelial cell function. HK could play an important role in maintaining normal endothelial function and blood flow and serve as a cardioprotective peptide."

Catalytically active, mature CA consists of two subunits (α, 161 aa, and β, 522 aa), which are generated by proteolytic cleavage from a single, properly folded 720-aa precursor containing a 27-aa signal peptide (19Li Y. Jiang W. Yang Y. Zhao G. Wang E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The precursor CA (without signal peptide) is activated by two peptide bond cleavages, which excise an internal spacer (Fig. 1a). The first cleavage is known to be initiated by an intra-molecular nucleophilic attack by Oγ of Ser170 on the adjacent peptide bond between Gly169 and Ser170, via a triad catalytic mechanism assisted by His192 and Glu624. Hydrolytic peptide bond cleavage generates the α′-subunit, which still contains the spacer attached to the C terminus, and the mature β-subunit (16Williams K. Cullati S. Sand A. Biterova E.I.

The C-terminal spacer is released from the α′-subunit by a second cleavage reaction, which generates the mature α-subunit. The spacer is expelled from its position in the CA, and has no further use. The mature α- and β-subunits stay together and form the mature, active, heterodimeric CA (18Kim Y. Yoon K. Khang Y. Turley S. Hol W.G.

It has been debated for years whether the second cleavage is inter- or intra-molecular, which amino acid residue catalyzes the reaction, and what determines the site of cleavage (25Kim S. Kim Y. J.

GK16 was considered to be an (αβ)2 heterotetramer complex before releasing a 9-aa spacer (21Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Rhee S. Dauter Z. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. Kim K.H.

Mutant S170C kept its capability for the first cleavage, which releases the β-subunit, but completely lost the activities for both second cleavage to generate the mature α-subunit, and substrate (Gl-7-ACA) hydrolysis. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the second cleavage is carried out by inter-molecular interaction using the same active site for substrate hydrolysis and released a 9-aa spacer for CA from Pseudomonas sp. GK16 or an 11-aa spacer for CA from Pseudomonas diminuta (21Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Rhee S. Dauter Z. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kim S. Kim Y. J. Biol.

However, the second cleavage of S170C was not performed when incubated with the mature enzyme (28Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Shin H.J. Cho K.J. Ryu E.K. Kim S.H. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the lengths of spacers reported are different, Glu159 was reported to be crucial for the second cleavage of both CA precursors from Pseudomonas GK16 and P. diminuta (25Kim S. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48376-48381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Cho K.J. Kim J.K. Lee J.H. Shin H.J. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, mutants containing an integral α′-subunit were crystallized to deduce the intra-molecular mechanism for the second cleavage. In the putative mechanism, acid Glu159, together with a H2O in the crystal structure were suggested to form a local active center where Glu159 played a role as nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon of Gly160 and then released a 9-aa spacer (27Cho K.J. Kim J.K. Lee J.H. Shin H.J. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 390: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Shin H.J. Cho K.J. Ryu E.K. Kim S.H. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we precisely located the second cleavage site and detected the corresponding 10-aa spacer 160GDPPDLADQG169 of CA mutants (Fig. 1). We found that the second cleavage site cleaved between Glu159 and Gly160, even when the EG was moved into the spacer or when the spacer sequence was shortened. We also found that CA is an acylpeptide hydrolase, which exhibits only limited exopeptidase activity for N-glutamyl peptides only. These findings, together with the available crystal structure, that shows no general acid/base in the proximity of Glu159, suggested that the second cleavage is an intra-molecular reaction catalyzed by the same active site Ser170 that performs the substrate hydrolysis. For this to happen, the maturing CA must undergo a conformational change that cannot be observed by x-ray crystallography. Glutaric anhydride, succinate anhydride, glutaric acid, glutathione (GSH), 6-nitro-3-phenylacetamidobenzoic acid, and other reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai) and Aldrich. Cephalosporin C and 7-ACA were purchased from Zhejiang Haimen Pharmacy Co. Peptides and glutaryl peptides were synthesized by China Peptides (Shanghai). Gl-7-ACA was synthesized by acylation of 7-ACA with glutaric anhydride (32Shibuya Y. Matsumoto K. Fujii T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 1561-1567Google Scholar). The synthesized sample was identified as Gl-7-ACA by MS and NMR. Succinyl-7-ACA, adipyl-7-ACA, and other glutaryl compounds were synthesized similarly from the corresponding acid anhydrides and amino compounds. The CA gene was transferred from plasmid pKKCAI (19Li Y. Jiang W. Yang Y. Zhao G. Wang E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to pET28a (Novagen) (NcoI and HindIII cleavage), containing a C-terminal His6 tag. Escherichia coli DH10B was used for gene cloning and site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pDB3 carrying the gene coding for penicillin G acylase (PGA) and its mutant encoding S264C were used for protein expressions (33Dai M.H. Wang E.D. Xie Y. Jiang W.H. Zhao G.P. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 1999; 31: 558-562Google Scholar). E. coli BL21/DE3 (pLysE) (Novagen) was the host strain for protein expression. For mutagenesis of the CA spacer peptide region, a BsaI site was created upstream of the internal BamHI using PCR primers 5′-CAGCCATCATCATCATCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TTGGATCCTTGATCGGCCAGGTCCGGCGGGTCTC-3′, and a SmaI site was introduced downstream of the natural internal BamHI site using primers, 5′-AAGGATCCAACTCCTGGGCGGTGGCCCCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGT-3′. Introduction of these two restriction sites did not change the CA aa sequence. The BsaI-SmaI fragment encodes Gly160 to Ala176, including the spacer and 7 aa from the N terminus of the β-subunit. The mutations inside the spacer were constructed by replacing the BsaI-BamHI or BsaI-SmaI fragments with double-stranded oligos containing the desired base change(s). E159D and E159Q, which are outside the above BsaI-SmaI fragment, were constructed by PCR. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Overnight cultures expressing CA and its mutant derivatives were inoculated into 500 ml of LB medium containing 0.1% glucose and incubated at 37 °C and 220 rpm. At A600 = 0.6, 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. The temperature was lowered to 30 or 25 °C depending on protein stability of the mutants. Cells were harvested 8 h after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, and lysed by sonication. The C-terminal His6-tagged enzymes were recovered using the Novagen His-bind kit at 4 °C. The crude enzyme preparations of PGA and its mutant S264C were prepared as described (33Dai M.H. Wang E.D. Xie Y. Jiang W.H. Zhao G.P. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 1999; 31: 558-562Google Scholar). They were further purified by precipitation with 50% acetone on ice, and then applied to a Sepharose CM Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of sodium acetate ranging from 0 to 500 mm (pH 5.4). Freshly prepared proteins were put on ice for further SDS-PAGE analysis. The time courses of in vitro second cleavage processing of CA and mutants were carried out in 100 mm PBS buffer (pH 8.0) and samples were immediately denatured by adding SDS-loading buffer and boiling for 2 min. The CA α- and α′-subunits were then separated using 15% SDS-PAGE and imaged digitally using G:Box (Syngene) prior to densitometric analysis using GeneTools (Syngene). Enzyme activities of CA and PGA were determined colorimetrically by measuring the amount of product 7-ACA or 6-aminopenicillic acid, generated using p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (19Li Y. Jiang W. Yang Y. Zhao G. Wang E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Dai M.H. Wang E.D. Xie Y. Jiang W.H. Zhao G.P. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 1999; 31: 558-562Google Scholar). The peptide products and glutaric acid were quantified by Q-TOF LC-MS (Agilent 6530 Q-TOF LC-MS). The hydrolysis of 6-nitro-3-phenylacetamidobenzoic acid was followed by directly measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm. One unit of activity is that amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of the nucleic product. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by measuring initial velocities at different substrate concentrations. The kinetic constants Km and kcat were determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots. The inhibition kinetics of the hydrolysis of Gl-7-ACA employed the same procedures in the presence of 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 mm glutarate, giving the disassociation constant Ki for the competitive inhibition. The Q-TOF LC-MS equipped with an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C8 column (3.5 μm 2.1 × 150 mm) was used for oligopeptide separation, MS (4 GHz high resolution, 50–1700 m/z mass range mode, positive mode), and MS-MS analysis (30 eV for fragmentation). Agilent MassHunter software was used to identify and quantification of peptide products. To determine the C-terminal tryptic fragments (CTFs) of the α-subunits, the enzymes were denatured by incubating with 6 m urea at 65 °C for 30 min. The samples were digested by trypsin (Promega) according to the protocol of the supplier. The gradient was 5–95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 60 min, at a flow of 0.2 ml/min. To identify the spacer released from CA mutants (E159D, E159Q, S170C, and m15), the purified enzyme was incubated in PBS buffer (pH 8) for 10 h at 30 °C. The mature enzyme and the precursor with or without the first autocleavage were denatured by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min and precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant containing released spacer was analyzed by Q-TOF LC-MS. The mobile phase contained 0.1% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile for short peptides (up to 5 aa) separation. The gradient for long peptide separation was 5–95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 30 min. Previous investigations reported spacers of four different lengths (8–11 aa) in CA precursors from different species: 8 aa (PPDLADQG) from Pseudomonas C427 (34Ishii Y. Saito Y. Fujimura T. Isogai T. Kojo H. Yamashita M. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1994; 77: 591-597Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), 9 aa (DPPDLADQG) from Pseudomonas sp. GK16 (21Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Rhee S. Dauter Z. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Shin H.J. Cho K.J. Ryu E.K. Kim S.H. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), 10 aa (GDPPDLADQG) from Pseudomonas sp. 130 (6Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and 11 aa (EGDPPDLADQG) from P. diminuta (29Kim Y. Kim S. Earnest T.N. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2823-2829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This variation in the reported lengths of the spacer regions was surprising because these CA precursors have more than 98% aa identity (except for the CA from Pseudomonas C427, whose crystal structure is not available), and the available crystal structures are also very similar (supplemental Fig. S1, a and b). Thus, the different spacer lengths were difficult to explain, and we wanted to confirm the sequence of the spacer of CA from Pseudomonas sp. 130 using accurate mass Q-TOF LC-MS. The first proteolytic step cleaves the CA precursor between Gly169 and Ser170 to generate the mature β-subunit with the catalytic N-terminal Ser170 (or numbered Sβ1 in the mature enzyme), and the α′-subunit with the spacer still attached (21Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Rhee S. Dauter Z. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To identify the C terminus of the mature CA α-subunit (after the spacer has been removed), CA from Pseudomonas sp. 130 was digested by trypsin, and analyzed by Q-TOF LC-MS. Of interest were peptides originating from near the C terminus of the CA α-subunit that did not end in Arg or Tyr. Such peptides were not generated by tryptic cleavage at the C-terminal end, and thus represented the likely C terminus of the mature CA α-subunit from which the spacer has been removed. A fragment, TLGE159, gave a high-resolution signal at m/z 419.2144, and matching b and y ions from the MS-MS spectrum confirmed the aa sequence (Fig. 2a and c). Comparison with the CA precursor sequence predicted from the DNA sequence showed that TLGE159 was followed by 160GDPPDLADQG169, and then the sequence of the mature β-subunit starting with Ser170 (Fig. 1). Therefore, the 10-aa sequence from Gly160–Gly169 was the likely spacer, and the second activating cleavage hydrolyzed the bond between Glu159 and Gly160. These results agree with the data of Li et al. (6Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Mao X. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but differ from other research reported from almost identical CA orthologs. The second cleavage that generates the mature CA happens very quickly after the first cleavage, which made it impossible to study the kinetics of the reaction. From studies with the P. diminuta CA, it was known that Glu159 is important for hydrolysis of the spacer from the immature α′-subunit. Replacing Glu by Leu, Met, or Asn prevented the second cleavage reaction, without affecting the release of the β-subunit by the first autoproteolytic reaction (25Kim S. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48376-48381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We created the P. sp. 130 mutant CA E159D, which was still active, but significantly retarded in the second cleavage, allowing the slow release of the spacer to be monitored in vitro (Fig. 2b). The released spacer was detected by Q-TOF LC-MS, and tandem MS confirmed its 10-aa 160GDPPDLADQG169 sequence, which was in agreement with our above prediction from the analysis of the CA α-subunit (Fig. 2, b and d). Also the C terminus of the E159D α-subunit was confirmed to be TLGD159 (supplemental Fig. S2a). Although it was reported that either S170C and E159Q completely lost the ability for the second cleavage (28Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Shin H.J. Cho K.J. Ryu E.K. Kim S.H. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a small amount of released spacer was detected by Q-TOF LC-MS after a 10-h incubation at 30 °C, giving similar tandem MS spectra as the spacer from E159D (supplemental Fig. S2, c and e). However, the rate of the spacer hydrolysis could not be accelerated by incubating S170C with the wild-type CA, which is consistent with previous reports (28Kim J.K. Yang I.S. Shin H.J. Cho K.J. Ryu E.K. Kim S.H. Park S.S. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1732-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2c). Interestingly, a small amount of 8-aa spacer consisting of 162PPDLADQG169 was also detected from the preincubated mutant E159Q by LC-MS and MS-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S2d). This result indicated that the second cleavage site may be changeable when Glu159 was replaced with other aa residues, except for Asp, which structurally resembles Glu, and Asp161 may play a role as Glu in this cleavage. We thus concluded that the Pseudomonas sp. 130 CA spacer must be the 10-aa sequence 160GDPPDLADQG169. If the peptide bond between Glu159 and Gly160 was the main determinant for the second cleavage, then it should be possible to reposition the site for the second cleavage. The proposed second cleavage may be affected by the nature of the aa side group at position 160. This was indeed the case because mutant proteins G160A and G160L containing larger side groups performed the second cleavage more slowly. The inhibition of the reaction increased with increasing bulk of the aa side group (Gly < Ala < Leu; Fig. 3a). Mutants m15–m19 were constructed where EG was repositioned into the spacer (Table 1). These proteins performed the first cleavage completely, like the wild-type, but underwent the second cleavage at different rates (Fig. 3, b and c). Q-TOF LC-MS and MS-MS analyses of CTFs from the α-subunits of these mutants showed that in each case hydrolysis was between Glu and Gly (Fig. 3, c and d, and supplemental Fig. S3). From mutant m15 only, the main CTF was TLGDPDGE163G164LADQG, and the peptide TLGDPDGE163 was present at a much lower concentration. After a 10-h incubation at 30 °C, the expected 6-aa spacer, 164GLADQG, was detected and confirmed by tandem MS (Fig. 3d). The CTF analysis showed that only a part of m15 had performed the second cleavage after such a long time incubation (supplemental Fig. S3, a and b). This significantly retarded second cleavage suggested that repositioning of EG might have created a steric hindrance caused by the changed spacer composition, resulting in the inefficient cleavage. Incomplete cleavage of the mutants, m18 and m19, which also contain 6-aa spacers (164GDPPDG) but maintained the 5 original spacer residues (GDPPD) starting from the N terminus (Table 1), further supported this suggestion. Mutants m16 and m17, which contained a 4- and 2-aa spacer, respectively, performed the second cleavage as normal, suggesting that a shorter spacer may eliminate this composition effect. These findings provided strong evidence for the second cleavage occurring between Glu159 and Gly160, and it showed that the specific cleavage site is movable in the spacer range, depending on the position of EG.TABLE 1Autocleavage of mutant spacers* “↓”, tryptic cleavage site (generates the CTF of the α-subunit); “|”, first cleavage site; inverted color: spacer detected by MS; underlined: mutant residues.** and “+”, the rate of cleavage reaction was similar to the wild type; “−”, no detectable cleavage; “/”, no need for a second cleavage; “slow”, cleavage significantly retarded as observed by SDS/PAGE; “very slow”, small amount of cleavage detected by Q-TOF LC-MS but not on SDS-PAGE.

Six CA mutants (m24–m29) containing 5–10-aa deletions of the spacer region were created (Table 1). These mutants retained only 0–5 aa of the original 10-aa spacer residues. These mutant proteins underwent the first cleavage releasing the β-subunit more slowly than the wild-type (Fig. 4a). All six mutants also produced fully processed α-subunits, indicating that the second cleavage occurred efficiently at the carboxylic side of Glu159 as predicted. The CTF,"

However, the mechanisms behind the effects of heat shock on spermatogenesis are obscure.To identify the inhibitory factor of spermiogenesis, experimental cryptorchid (EC) mice were used in this study. Here we show that α-fetoprotein (AFP) is specifically expressed in the testes of EC mice by proteome analysis. AFP was also specifically localized spermatocytes by immunohistochemical analysis and was secreted into the circulation system of EC mice by immunoblot analysis. Since spermatogenesis of an advanced mammal cannot be reproduced with in vitro, we performed the microinjection of AFP into the seminiferous tubules of normal mice to determine whether AFP inhibits spermiogenesis in vivo. AFP was directly responsible for the block in spermiogenesis of normal mice. To investigate whether AFP inhibits cell differentiation in other models, using EC mice we performed a partial hepatectomy (PH) that triggers a rapid regenerative response in the remnant liver tissue. We also found that liver regeneration is inhibited in EC mice with PH. The result suggests that AFP released into the blood of EC mice regulates liver regeneration by inhibiting the cell division of hepatocytes.AFP is a well-known cancer-specific marker, but AFP has no known function in healthy human beings. Our findings indicate that AFP expressed under EC conditions plays a role as a regulatory factor in spermatogenesis and in hepatic generation."

They have a suite of physical and chemical defences, and are even able to take advantage of the enemies of their enemies. These strategies are often only deployed upon attack, so may lead to indirect interactions between herbivores and phytopathogens. In this study we test for induced responses in wild populations of an alpine plant (Adenostyles alliariae) that possesses constitutive chemical defence (pyrrolizidine alkaloids) and specialist natural enemies (two species of leaf beetle, Oreina elongata and Oreina cacaliae, and the phytopathogenic rust Uromyces cacaliae). Plants were induced in the field using chemical elicitors of the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways and monitored for one month under natural conditions. There was evidence for induced resistance, with lower probability and later incidence of attack by beetles in JA-induced plants and of rust infection in SA-induced plants. We also demonstrate ecological cross-effects, with reduced fungal attack following JA-induction, and a cost of SA-induction arising from increased beetle attack. As a result, there is the potential for negative indirect effects of the beetles on the rust, while in the field the positive indirect effect of the rust on the beetles appears to be over-ridden by direct effects on plant nutritional quality. Such interactions resulting from induced susceptibility and resistance must be considered if we are to exploit plant defences for crop protection using hormone elicitors or constitutive expression. More generally, the fact that induced defences are even found in species that possess constitutively-expressed chemical defence suggests that they may be ubiquitous in higher plants."
