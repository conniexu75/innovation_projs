https://openalex.org/W1969751124,"Pain information processing in the spinal cord has been postulated to rely on nociceptive transmission (T) neurons receiving inputs from nociceptors and Aβ mechanoreceptors, with Aβ inputs gated through feed-forward activation of spinal inhibitory neurons (INs). Here, we used intersectional genetic manipulations to identify these critical components of pain transduction. Marking and ablating six populations of spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled with behavioral and electrophysiological analysis, showed that excitatory neurons expressing somatostatin (SOM) include T-type cells, whose ablation causes loss of mechanical pain. Inhibitory neurons marked by the expression of dynorphin (Dyn) represent INs, which are necessary to gate Aβ fibers from activating SOM+ neurons to evoke pain. Therefore, peripheral mechanical nociceptors and Aβ mechanoreceptors, together with spinal SOM+ excitatory and Dyn+ inhibitory neurons, form a microcircuit that transmits and gates mechanical pain.PaperClip/cms/asset/2fba82cc-45dc-44d8-99bc-5db5826b42c4/mmc2.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.78 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2057055150,"Intraspecific genetic incompatibilities prevent the assembly of specific alleles into single genotypes and influence genome- and species-wide patterns of sequence variation. A common incompatibility in plants is hybrid necrosis, characterized by autoimmune responses due to epistatic interactions between natural genetic variants. By systematically testing thousands of F1 hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana strains, we identified a small number of incompatibility hot spots in the genome, often in regions densely populated by nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes. In several cases, these immune receptor loci interact with each other, suggestive of conflict within the immune system. A particularly dangerous locus is a highly variable cluster of NLR genes, DM2, which causes multiple independent incompatibilities with genes that encode a range of biochemical functions, including NLRs. Our findings suggest that deleterious interactions of immune receptors limit the combinations of favorable disease resistance alleles accessible to plant genomes."

Mechanotransduction channels in hair cells are gated by tip links. The molecules that connect tip links to transduction channels are not known. Here we show that the transmembrane protein TMIE forms a ternary complex with the tip-link component PCDH15 and its binding partner TMHS/LHFPL5. Alternative splicing of the PCDH15 cytoplasmic domain regulates formation of this ternary complex. Transducer currents are abolished by a homozygous Tmie-null mutation, and subtle Tmie mutations that disrupt interactions between TMIE and tip links affect transduction, suggesting that TMIE is an essential component of the hair cell’s mechanotransduction machinery that functionally couples the tip link to the transduction channel.

Mechanoelectrical transduction, the conversion of mechanical force into electrical signals, is critical for our senses of hearing, balance, proprioception, and touch. In the inner ear, mechanotransduction channels are localized in hair bundles that crown the apical surface of each hair cell. Hair bundles consist of stereocilia that are organized in rows of decreasing heights like the pipes of an organ (Richardson et al., 2011Richardson G.P. de Monvel J.B. Petit C.

Fine extracellular filaments, the tip links, connect the stereocilia in the direction of the mechanical sensitivity of the hair bundles and are thought to transmit force onto transduction channels (Figure 1A) (Assad et al., 1991Assad J.A.

Deflections of the hair bundle in the direction of the longest stereocilia lead to increases in the open probability of transduction channels, while deflections in the opposite direction decrease channel open probability (Gillespie and Müller, 2009Gillespie P.G.

Several components of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells have been identified. Genes that are linked to Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1; deaf-blindness) encode many of these components. Tip links are formed by the USH1 proteins CDH23 and PCDH15, which interact to form the upper and lower parts of tip links, respectively (Ahmed et al., 2006Ahmed Z.M. Goodyear R. Riazuddin S.

Myosin 7a might also be important for transduction, although this requires further study (Kros et al., 2002Kros C.J. Marcotti W. van Netten S.M. Self T.J. Libby R.T. Brown S.D. Richardson G.P.

Ca2+ enters stereocilia upon mechanical stimulation near the lower tip-link insertion site, indicating that transduction channels are present in proximity to PCDH15 (Beurg et al., 2009Beurg M.

It has therefore been proposed that TMC1/2 might be accessory subunits of the transduction channel that regulate channel localization to tip links and/or form an extracellular vestibule that controls ion flow toward the channel pore (Marzban et al., 2003Marzban H.

TMHS/LHFPL5 (referred to as LHFPL5 in the following) is an additional protein that is implicated in the regulation of mechanotransduction channels in hair cells. LHFPL5, a tetraspan protein that is linked to inherited forms of deafness (Longo-Guess et al., 2005Longo-Guess C.M. Gagnon L.H. Cook S.A. Wu J. Zheng Q.Y. Johnson K.R.

Genet. 2006; 43: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), binds to PCDH15 and is localized to the tip-link region (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong W. Grillet N. Elledge H.M. Wagner T.F. Zhao B.

Lhfpl5 mutations affect tip-link assembly and the conductance and adaptation properties of the transducer channel, suggesting that LHFPL5 is closely associated with the channel. Structurally and functionally, LHFPL5 resembles auxiliary subunits of other ion channels such as the TARP subunits of AMPA receptors (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A.

Tomita S. The regulation of glutamate receptor trafficking and function by TARPs and other transmembrane auxiliary subunits.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that LHFPL5 like TARPs is an allosteric regulator of transducer channel function (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong W. Grillet N. Elledge H.M. Wagner T.F. Zhao B. Johnson K.R. Kazmierczak P. Müller U.

To identify additional critical components of the mechanotransduction complex of hair cells, we have carried out yeast two-hybrid screens with newly generated cochlear libraries. Here we report that PCDH15 and LHFPL5 bind to TMIE, a protein with two transmembrane domains that has previously been linked to inherited forms of deafness (Mitchem et al., 2002Mitchem K.L. Hibbard E. Beyer L.A. Bosom K. Dootz G.A. Dolan D.F. Johnson K.R. Raphael Y. Kohrman D.C. Mutation of the novel gene Tmie results in sensory cell defects in the inner ear of spinner, a mouse model of human hearing loss DFNB6.Hum. Mol.

Genet. 2002; 71: 632-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that TMIE is an evolutionary conserved protein that is essential for mechanotransduction by hair cells. We also show that TMIE establishes a critical link between the PCDH15/LHFPL5 complex and the pore-forming subunits of the transduction channel. Significantly, mutations in TMIE that have been linked to inherited forms of deafness in humans perturb its interaction with tip links and affect transduction, suggesting that the disease is caused by defects in the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells. Our findings identify TMIE as an essential component of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells, provide insights into its mechanisms of action, and reveal an unanticipated complexity in the composition of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells that has important implications for the regulation of channel activity in different hair cells and along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea. In order to identify proteins that are constituents of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells, we thought to identify proteins that interact with PCDH15 and/or LHFPL5 at the lower end of tip links. We purified RNA from the organ of Corti and generated three yeast two-hybrid libraries, one for soluble proteins, one for type I transmembrane proteins, and one for type II transmembrane proteins. We then carried out yeast two-hybrid screens with a fragment of PCDH15 encompassing the two membrane-proximal cadherin repeats, the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain (Figure 1B). Alternative splicing generates different PCDH15 isoforms named CD1, CD2, and CD3 that differ in their cytoplasmic domains (Figure 1B). We used for our experiments the PCDH15-CD2 isoform, since we had determined that this isoform is sufficient to rescue mechanotransduction in hair cells lacking other PCDH15 isoforms (data not shown). We also screened our yeast two-hybrid libraries with full-length LHFPL5 (Figure 1B). Remarkably, we identified TMIE, a protein with two transmembrane domains (Figure 1B) that has previously been linked to deafness (Mitchem et al., 2002Mitchem K.L. Hibbard E. Beyer L.A. Bosom K. Dootz G.A. Dolan D.F. Johnson K.R. Raphael Y. Kohrman D.C. Mutation of the novel gene Tmie results in sensory cell defects in the inner ear of spinner, a mouse model of human hearing loss DFNB6.Hum.

Genet. 2002; 71: 632-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), as a putative interaction partner for both LHFPL5 and PCDH15 (data not shown). To verify that TMIE interacts with PCDH15 and LHFPL5, we carried out pull-down experiments with extracts from HEK293 cells that were transfected to express an HA-tagged version of TMIE together with PCDH15 or LHFPL5. TMIE interacted with PCDH15-CD2, but only weakly, with its close homologs PCDH15-CD1 and PCDH15-CD3 or with control CDH2-GFP (Figures 1C and 1D). Occasionally, TMIE protein was resolved on gels into two bands (Figure 1C), which could represent differentially glycosylated forms. Alternatively, a fraction of TMIE may be cleaved into two fragments (Gleason et al., 2009Gleason M.R. Nagiel A. Jamet S. Vologodskaia M. López-Schier H. Hudspeth A.J. The transmembrane inner ear (Tmie) protein is essential for normal hearing and balance in the zebrafish.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21347-21352Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interactions between PCDH15-CD2 and TMIE were disrupted when the cytoplasmic domain encoded by the CD2-specific exon was deleted from the PCDH15-CD2 full-length construct (Figure 1E). TMIE also interacted with LHFPL5 in pull-down assays (Figure 1F). We have previously shown that interactions between LHFPL5 and PCDH15 are mediated by the transmembrane domain of PCDH15 as well as by a short membrane-proximal fragment of PCDH15 on the cytoplasmic site that is common between PCDH15-CD1, -CD2, and -CD3 isoforms (Figure 1B) (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong W. Grillet N. Elledge H.M. Wagner T.F. Zhao B. Johnson K.R. Kazmierczak P. Müller U. TMHS is an integral component of the mechanotransduction machinery of cochlear hair cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 1283-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether LHFPL5 might facilitate interactions of TMIE even with PCDH15-CD1 and PCDH15-CD3 isoforms by formation of a ternary complex. We coexpressed TMIE together with LHFPL5 and each of the three PCDH15 isoforms in HEK293 cells. Remarkably, in the presence of LHFPL5, antibodies against TMIE-HA coprecipitated PCDH15-CD1, -CD2, and -CD3; LHFPL5 was present in all three protein complexes (Figure 1G; data not shown). We conclude that TMIE and LHFPL5 form a ternary complex with each of the three PCDH15 isoforms. TMIE binds to PCDH15-CD2 directly and via LHFPL5, but interactions between TMIE and PCDH15-CD1 and -CD3 depend on LHFPL5. Thus, the geometry of the PCDH15/LHFPL5/TMIE complex differs in the presence of distinct PCHD15 isoforms (Figure 1H). Previous studies have shown that mice with a point mutation in Tmie that leads to a truncation of its C terminus are deaf (Mitchem et al., 2002Mitchem K.L. Hibbard E. Beyer L.A. Bosom K. Dootz G.A. Dolan D.F. Johnson K.R. Raphael Y. Kohrman D.C. Mutation of the novel gene Tmie results in sensory cell defects in the inner ear of spinner, a mouse model of human hearing loss DFNB6.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1887-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend these findings, we generated mice with a predicted Tmie-null mutation caused by an in-frame insertion of a LacZ transgene into the Tmie gene (TmieLacZ mice) (Figure 2A). A second mouse line was generated that carries a floxed Tmie allele (Tmieflox) (Figure 2A). TmieLacZ/LacZ mice were deaf as determined by measuring the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to broadband click stimuli in 4-week-old animals (Figure 2C). Similarly, mice were deaf when we inactivated TMIE expression throughout inner ear development using Pax2-Cre mice (Ohyama and Groves, 2004Ohyama T. Groves A.K. Generation of Pax2-Cre mice by modification of a Pax2 bacterial artificial chromosome.Genesis. 2004; 38: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (Figures 2B and 2C). Next we crossed Tmieflox/flox mice with prestin-CreERT2 mice, which carry a tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgene that is specifically expressed in outer hair cells (OHCs) (Fang et al., 2012Fang J. Zhang W.C. Yamashita T. Gao J. Zhu M.S. Zuo J. Outer hair cell-specific prestin-CreERT2 knockin mouse lines.Genesis. 2012; 50: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We then induced recombination at P8 and P10 by injection of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and analyzed hearing function 3 weeks later. The mutant mice were deaf, indicating that the function of OHCs was affected (Figures 2B and 2C). We then studied the phenotype of mice obtained by crossings of Tmieflox/flox mice with Pax2-Cre and prestin-CreERT2 mice in more detail. Measurements of responses to pure tones revealed that the mutant offspring obtained with both Cre mouse lines were deaf across the entire analyzed frequency spectrum (Figure 2D). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were nearly eliminated (Figures 2E and 2F). It was somewhat surprising that ABRs and pure tone ABRs were so severely affected following inactivation of Tmie in OHCs only using prestin-Cre since inner hair cell (IHC) function should be preserved. However, it has previously been reported that the organ of Corti degenerates in Tmie-deficient mice by 3 weeks of age (Chung et al., 2007Chung W.H. Kim K.R. Cho Y.S. Cho D.Y. Woo J.H. Ryoo Z.Y. Cho K.I. Hong S.H. Cochlear pathology of the circling mouse: a new mouse model of DFNB6.Acta Otolaryngol. 2007; 127: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of Tmie in OHCs might lead to degenerative changes that affect not only OHCs, but also the overall structure of the organ of Corti including IHCs. To further define the cell types in the inner ear that express Tmie, we took advantage of the LacZ transgene in TmieLacZ mice. We stained histological sections of TmieLacZ/+ mice with X-Gal and observed that LacZ expression was confined to IHCs and OHCs (Figure 3A). To define the subcellular localization of TMIE in hair cells, we stained cochlear whole mounts at P4 with an antibody to TMIE. The antibody detected TMIE expression in the stereocilia of IHCs and OHCs (Figure 3B). Imaging of IHCs at higher resolution revealed expression near the tips of the shorter rows of stereocilia, but not or only weakly near the tips of the longest stereocilia (Figure 3B, upper right), which is consistent with a localization in the region of the lower insertion site of tip links. No signal was observed in TmieLacZ/LacZ mice (Figure 3B, lower right), confirming the specificity of the signal. Unfortunately, our antibodies were not of sufficient quality for immunogold localization studies. However, to independently confirm the immunolocalization data, we took advantage of our recently described gene-transfer method for hair cells that we now term injectoporation because it combines plasmid microinjection with electroporation (Figure 3C) (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong W.

Using injectoporation, we express a cDNA encoding a TMIE-HA fusion protein in hair cells at P4 and analyze expression of the transgene 2 days later. TMIE-HA accumulated at the tips of the shorter rows of stereocila (Figure 3C), providing additional evidence that TMIE is localized near the lower end of tip links. This localization pattern is consistent with the finding that PCDH15 and LHFPL5, which bind to TMIE, are also localized in this domain of stereocilia (Ahmed et al., 2006Ahmed Z.M. Goodyear R. Riazuddin S. Lagziel A. Legan P.K. Behra M. Burgess S.M. Lilley K.S. Wilcox E.R.

Thus, we conclude that TMIE is localized in stereocilia at least in part near the lower tip-link insertion site. So far, we have not observed any differences in expression levels of TMIE along the length of the cochlear duct, but additional studies will be necessary to address this point more conclusively. The localization of TMIE in hair cells and its interaction with PCDH15 and LHFPL5 prompted us to determine the extent to which TMIE is necessary for mechanotransduction by hair cells.

In this study, we investigated the early consequences of inactivating Rb in the context of cellular reprogramming. We found that Rb inactivation promotes the reprogramming of differentiated cells to a pluripotent state. Unexpectedly, this effect is cell cycle independent, and instead reflects direct binding of Rb to pluripotency genes, including Sox2 and Oct4, which leads to a repressed chromatin state. More broadly, this regulation of pluripotency networks and Sox2 in particular is critical for the initiation of tumors upon loss of Rb in mice. These studies therefore identify Rb as a global transcriptional repressor of pluripotency networks, providing a molecular basis for previous reports about its involvement in cell fate pliability, and implicate misregulation of pluripotency factors such as Sox2 in tumorigenesis related to loss of Rb function."

In zebrafish, as fish experience more and more danger, neurons in the ventral habenula (vHb) showed tonic increase in the activity to the presented cue and activated serotonergic neurons in the median raphe (MR). This neuronal activity could represent the expectation of a dangerous outcome and be used for comparison with a real outcome when the fish is learning how to escape from a dangerous to a safer environment. Indeed, inhibiting synaptic transmission from vHb to MR impaired adaptive avoidance learning, while panic behavior induced by classical fear conditioning remained intact. Furthermore, artificially triggering this negative outcome expectation signal by optogenetic stimulation of vHb neurons evoked place avoidance behavior. Thus, vHb-MR circuit is essential for representing the level of expected danger and behavioral programming to adaptively avoid potential hazard."

The purpose of our study was to investigate liver fibrosis in conventional and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice. Chronic liver injury was induced by administration of thioacetamide (TAA) in the drinking water for 21 wk or by repeated intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Increased liver fibrosis was observed in GF mice compared with conventional mice. Hepatocytes showed more toxin-induced oxidative stress and cell death. This was accompanied by increased activation of hepatic stellate cells, but hepatic mediators of inflammation were not significantly different. Similarly, a genetic model using Myd88/Trif-deficient mice, which lack downstream innate immunity signaling, had more severe fibrosis than wild-type mice. Isolated Myd88/Trif-deficient hepatocytes were more susceptible to toxin-induced cell death in culture. In conclusion, the commensal microbiota prevents fibrosis upon chronic liver injury in mice. This is the first study describing a beneficial role of the commensal microbiota in maintaining liver homeostasis and preventing liver fibrosis.—Mazagova, M., Wang, L., Anfora, A.

https://openalex.org/W2003731662,"Telomere maintenance by telomerase is impaired in the stem cell disease dyskeratosis congenita and during human aging. Telomerase depends upon a complex pathway for enzyme assembly, localization in Cajal bodies, and association with telomeres. Here, we identify the chaperonin CCT/TRiC as a critical regulator of telomerase trafficking using a high-content genome-wide siRNA screen in human cells for factors required for Cajal body localization. We find that TRiC is required for folding the telomerase cofactor TCAB1, which controls trafficking of telomerase and small Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs). Depletion of TRiC causes loss of TCAB1 protein, mislocalization of telomerase and scaRNAs to nucleoli, and failure of telomere elongation. DC patient-derived mutations in TCAB1 impair folding by TRiC, disrupting telomerase function and leading to severe disease. Our findings establish a critical role for TRiC-mediated protein folding in the telomerase pathway and link proteostasis, telomere maintenance, and human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2063407098,"Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) in postsynaptic dendrites is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) of many excitatory synapses, but the role of presynaptic axonal NMDARs in synaptic plasticity remains to be clarified. Here we report that axonal NMDARs play an essential role in LTP induction at mouse corticostriatal synapses by triggering activity-induced presynaptic secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Genetic depletion of either BDNF or the NMDAR subunit GluN1 specifically in cortical axons abolished corticostriatal LTP in response to theta burst stimulation (TBS). Furthermore, functional axonal NMDARs were required for TBS-triggered prolonged axonal Ca(2+) elevation and BDNF secretion, supporting the notion that activation of axonal NMDARs induces BDNF secretion via enhancing Ca(2+) signals in the presynaptic nerve terminals. These results demonstrate that presynaptic NMDARs are equally important as postsynaptic NMDARs in LTP induction of corticostriatal synapses due to their role in mediating activity-induced presynaptic BDNF secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2073461968,"Establishing how grid cells are anatomically arranged, on a microscopic scale, in relation to their firing patterns in the environment would facilitate a greater microcircuit-level understanding of the brain's representation of space. However, all previous grid cell recordings used electrode techniques that provide limited descriptions of fine-scale organization. We therefore developed a technique for cellular-resolution functional imaging of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons in mice navigating a virtual linear track, enabling a new experimental approach to study MEC. Using these methods, we show that grid cells are physically clustered in MEC compared to nongrid cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that grid cells are functionally micro-organized: the similarity between the environment firing locations of grid cell pairs varies as a function of the distance between them according to a ""Mexican hat""-shaped profile. This suggests that, on average, nearby grid cells have more similar spatial firing phases than those further apart."
https://openalex.org/W2033797039,"Spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM) are major pregnancy complications often associated with a fetal inflammatory response. Biomolecular markers of this fetal inflammatory response to both infectious and non-infectious risk factors and their contribution to PTB and pPROM mechanism are still unclear. This study examined fetal membrane production, activation and mechanistic properties of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a contributor of the non-infectious fetal inflammatory response.HMGB1 transcripts and active HMGB1 were profiled in fetal membranes and amniotic fluids collected from PTB and normal term birth. In vitro, normal term not in labor fetal membranes were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and water soluble cigarette smoke extract (CSE). HMGB1-transcripts and its protein concentrations were documented by RT-PCR and ELISA. Recombinant HMGB1 treated membranes and media were subjected to RT-PCR for HMGB1 receptors, mitogen activated protein kinase pathway analysis, cytokine levels, and Western blot for p38MAPK.HMGB1 expression and its active forms were higher in PTB and pPROM than normal term membranes and amniotic fluid samples. Both LPS and CSE enhanced HMGB1 expression and release in vitro. Fetal membrane exposure to HMGB1 resulted in increased expression of TLR2 and 4 and dose-dependent activation of p38MAPK-mediated inflammation.HMGB1 increase by fetal membrane cells in response to either oxidative stress or infection can provide a positive feedback loop generating non-infectious inflammatory activation. Activation of p38MAPK by HMGB1 promotes development of the senescence phenotype and senescence associated sterile inflammation. HMGB1 activity is an important regulator of the fetal inflammatory response regardless of infection."

https://openalex.org/W2049880398,"How the sequential specification of neurons and progressive loss of potency associated with aging neural progenitors are regulated in vertebrate brain development is poorly understood. By examining a temporal differentiation lineage in the hindbrain, we here identify Tgfβ as a switch signal that executes the transition between early and late phases of neurogenesis and concurrently constrains progenitor potency. Young progenitors have inherent competence to produce late-born neurons, but implementation of late-differentiation programs requires suppression of early identity genes achieved through temporally programmed activation of Tgfβ downstream of Shh signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that sequentially occurring fate-switch decisions are temporally coupled, and onset of Tgfβ signaling appears thereby to impact on the overall lifespan of the temporal lineage. Our study establishes Tgfβ as a regulator of temporal identity and potency of neural stem cells, and provides proof of concept that Tgfβ can be applied to modulate temporal specification of neurons in stem cell engineering."

Dynamic regulation of chromosomal conformations emerges as a novel layer for transcriptional mechanisms impacting neuronal signaling and cognition. Gene expression is governed by distal regulatory elements, including enhancers and locus control regions which have been intensely studied in extraneural tissues such as blood for more than 30 years (Banerji et al., 1981Banerji J.

Importantly, chromosomal loop formations are critical for this layer of transcriptional regulation, because many distal regulatory elements typically only become effective when placed in close spatial proximity to the TSSs of their target gene (Levine et al., 2014Levine M.

We provide evidence for a complex and multilayered regulatory network, involving multiple chromosomal loopings that target the GRIN2B/Grin2b TSS and, depending on their specific protein “cargo,” either repress or facilitate transcription. Long-range promoter-enhancer interactions governing GRIN2B expression are conserved between human and mouse brain, impact cognition and working memory, and confer liability for psychiatric disease. The multidimensional approaches presented here provide a roadmap to uncover neurological function for the vast but largely unexplored noncoding sequences in the human genome. To explore spatial genome architectures at the NMDA receptor GRIN2B locus, we employed chromosome conformation capture (3C) on prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult subjects, and cultured fibroblasts for comparison. Given that both the GRIN2B gene body and the surrounding 5′ and 3′ sequences were epigenetically decorated with sharp peaks for histone H3 acetylated at lysine 27, an open chromatin mark broadly enriched at active promoters and enhancers (Zhou et al., 2011Zhou V.W. Goren A. Bernstein B.E. Charting histone modifications and the functional organization of mammalian genomes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), we screened ∼800 kb on chromosome 12 encompassing GRIN2B (Figure 1A). Both PFC and FIB showed 3C PCR products for restriction fragments positioned less than 50 kb from the TSS. However, PFC but not FIB showed additional long-range interactions with intronic and intergenic sequences 348 and 449 kb downstream from the TSS (Figure 1B). These loops, which we hereafter named GRIN2BTSS+348kb and GRIN2BTSS+449kb, were in the PFC and neighboring cingulate cortex defined by sharp peaks of histone H3 acetylated at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), an open chromatin mark enriched at active promoters and enhancers (Figure 1A and see Figures S1A and S1B online). Notably, GRIN2B is expressed in PFC but not fibroblasts (Figure 1B). Therefore the absence of GRIN2BTSS+348kb and GRIN2BTSS+449kb loopings in fibroblasts would suggest a potential association with gene expression. To further test this hypothesis, we monitored GRIN2B RNA and the GRIN2BTSS+348kb and GRIN2BTSS+449kb loopings during the course of neuronal differentiation, using previously described protocols and induced pluripotent (iPS) and H9 embryonic stem cell lines (Bharadwaj et al., 2013Bharadwaj R. Jiang Y. Mao W. Jakovcevski M. Dincer A. Krueger W. Garbett K. Whittle C. Tushir J.S. Liu J. et al.Conserved chromosome 2q31 conformations are associated with transcriptional regulation of GAD1 GABA synthesis enzyme and altered in prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia.J.

In both cell lines, neuronal differentiation was associated with robust increases both in GRIN2B RNA and the long-range loop, GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figure 1C). We noticed that the 5′ end of GRIN2B is part of two long-range chromosomal loop formations, GRIN2BTSS+348kb and GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figure 1B). Interestingly, convergence of multiple loopings onto a common structure (“chromatin hub”) had previously been associated with transcriptional regulation and repression at the Globin and Myb loci (de Laat and Grosveld, 2003de Laat W.

Therefore, we speculated that GRIN2B expression could be governed by dynamic changes in repressive and facilitative chromosomal loopings converging at regulatory elements surrounding the GRIN2B TSS. To explore this, we choose human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, which robustly express several hundred neuronal genes, including GRIN2B (Shaw et al., 2002Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. Preferential transformation of human neuronal cells by human adenoviruses and the origin of HEK 293 cells.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HEK293 chromatin surrounding the GRIN2B gene showed multiple sharp peaks for the CCCTC-binding factor and chromosomal loop-organizer CTCF (Merkenschlager and Odom, 2013Merkenschlager M. Odom D.T. CTCF and cohesin: linking gene regulatory elements with their targets.Cell. 2013; 152: 1285-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), with the strongest binding around the distal arm of GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figures 2A, S1A, and S1B). CTCF and associated proteins function as insulators and anchors for promoter-enhancer interactions and often bind to sequences in direct proximity and overlap with enhancer elements (Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014Ghavi-Helm Y. Klein F.A. Pakozdi T. Ciglar L. Noordermeer D. Huber W. Furlong E.E.

Using 3C-ChIP-loop (chromatin immunoprecipitation with conformation capture) with an anti-CTCF antibody, we confirmed that the GRIN2B TSS and its partnering sequences positioned +449 kb further downstream are tethered together into higher-order chromatin enriched with CTCF (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the distal arm of GRIN2BTSS+449kb showed a strong enrichment for transcription factors previously attributed a key regulatory role for GRIN2B expression, including Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF-1) (Dhar and Wong-Riley, 2009Dhar S.S.

Role of AP-1 in ethanol-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit gene up-regulation in mouse cortical neurons.J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1A). Using a minimal promoter/luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed enhancer-like activity for two sequences in the distal arm of GRIN2BTSS+449kb, each extending over 100–125 base pairs and defined by sharp, up to 40-fold, enrichment for AP-1 motifs and NRF-1 and AP-1 proteins (Figure 2B). From this, one would predict that weakening or disruption of the GRIN2BTSS+449kb loop would result in decreased GRIN2B expression. We generated stable HEK subclones with tet-on transactivator controlled induction of the histone methyltransferase SET-domain Bifurcated 1 (SETDB1/ESET/KMT1E), a previously described negative regulator of GRIN2B expression which confers, in human cell lines and mouse brain, repressive histone H3-lysine K9 methylation at proximal intronic sequences spreading up to 40 kb downstream from the TSS (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang Y. Jakovcevski M. Bharadwaj R. Connor C. Schroeder F.A. Lin C.L. Straubhaar J. Martin G. Akbarian S. Setdb1 histone methyltransferase regulates mood-related behaviors and expression of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 7152-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, and as expected, doxycycline (DOX) but not vehicle-treated SETDB1-inducible HEK cells showed a marked upregulation of SETDB1 RNA and protein levels in conjunction with decreased GRIN2B expression (Figure 2C). This was associated with up to 5-fold increases in SETDB1 occupancy at the GRIN2B TSS and gene-proximal intronic sequences, in conjunction with localized histone H3K9 hypermethylation and a strong 5- to 10-fold increase in occupancy of heterochromatin-associated protein 1 HP-1α (Figure 2D). This “heterochromatization” around the TSS and first intron showed only limited spreading across the wider GRIN2B locus, because HP-1 and trimethyl-H3K9 remained at very low levels at distal, loop-bound sequences, including GRIN2BTSS+449kb, after DOX treatment. Conversely, proteins and histone marks with a facilitatory role for gene expression and transcription, including histone H3K27 acetylation and NRF-1 transcription factor and AP-1 protein FOSL2, were maintained at high levels at the sequences 449 kb dowstream from the TSS, regardless of DOX treatment. This would suggest that SETDB1 induction did not disrupt the molecular composition of the distal arm of the long-range loop, GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figures 2D and 2F). In sharp contrast, SETDB1 induction was associated with a significant 30%–40% decrease in GRIN2BTSS+348kb and GRIN2BTSS+449kb loopings, while the physical interactions between the TSS and the SETDB1 repressor-enriched proximal intronic sequences were significantly increased (Figure 2E). These experiments, taken together, demonstrate that SETDB1-mediated downregulation of GRIN2B expression is associated with dynamic repositioning of multiple distal DNA sequences competing, via specific loop formations, for access to the GRIN2B TSS and proximal promoters. Specifically, a localized increase in repressive H3K9me3 and HP1 heterochromatin around the TSS and the first intron is associated with disruption of long-range promoter-enhancer loopings, including GRIN2BTSS+449kb. These mechanisms thereby effectively “shield” the TSS and gene-proximal promoters from the access to GRIN2BTSS+449kb “cargo,” including AP-1 and NRF-1 transcription factors (Figure 2F). Having mapped GRIN2B higher-order chromatin in human PFC and explored the dynamics and competitive interactions of repressive and facilitative loopings in the HEK293 model, we next asked whether these mechanisms represent conserved regulatory mechanisms across different mammalian lineages. 3C assays on adult mouse cortex confirmed two long-range loopings, Grin2bTSS+378kb and Grin2bTSS+471kb, which harbored sequences with up to ∼90% conservation to portions of the distal arms of the human loops, GRIN2BTSS+348kb and GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figures S1C–S1F and S2A). Similarities in histone modification profiles between human and mouse cortex included a single sharp peak for the transcriptional mark, trimethyl-histone H3K4 (H3K4me3), at the TSS and H3K27ac enrichment at loop-bound sequences (Figures 1A, 3A, 3B , and S2B). Furthermore, intronic sequences positioned up to 40 kb from the Grin2b TSS are sensitive to SETDB1-mediated repressive chromatin remodeling in mouse cortical neurons (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang Y. Jakovcevski M. Bharadwaj R. Connor C. Schroeder F.A. Lin C.L. Straubhaar J. Martin G. Akbarian S. Setdb1 histone methyltransferase regulates mood-related behaviors and expression of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 7152-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), similar to SETDB1’s action in (human) HEK293 cells (Figures 2C and 2D). Therefore, we predicted that increased SETDB1 occupancy at TSS-bound intronic sequences in mouse cortex will result in significant weakening of the long-range loops, Grin2bTSS+378kb and Grin2bTSS+471kb. We conducted 3C on cortex of transgenic mice expressing full-length Setdb1 under control of the neuron-specific 9 kb calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II promoter (CK) in adult forebrain neurons (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang Y. Jakovcevski M. Bharadwaj R. Connor C. Schroeder F.A. Lin C.L. Straubhaar J. Martin G. Akbarian S. Setdb1 histone methyltransferase regulates mood-related behaviors and expression of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 7152-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, 3C PCR from adult CK-Setdb1 cortex showed, in comparison to littermate controls, significant decreases in Grin2bTSS+378kb and Grin2bTSS+471kb, while interactions between the TSS and proximal intronic sequences surrounding the SETDB1 target site were increased (Figures 3C and S2A). In addition, as previously reported (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang Y. Jakovcevski M. Bharadwaj R. Connor C. Schroeder F.A. Lin C.L. Straubhaar J. Martin G. Akbarian S. Setdb1 histone methyltransferase regulates mood-related behaviors and expression of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 7152-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), Grin2b RNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in CK-Setdb1 cortex (Figure 3D). Having shown SETDB1-mediated regulation of GRIN2B/Grin2b expression and long-range loopings in HEK cells (Figures 2C and 2D) and transgenic CK-Setdb1 cerebral cortex (Figure S2A), we then asked whether these mechanisms represent a physiological mechanism that operates in wild-type neurons to fine-tune Grin2b expression in a functional context, such as dynamic changes in synaptic activity. To this end, primary neuronal cultures from C57Bl6 hippocampi were exposed for 4–48 hr to GABAA receptor antagonist (picrotoxin/PTX, 100 μM) to increase activity. In comparison to vehicle (DMSO), PTX-treated cultures showed increased SETDB1 occupancy at TSS-bound intronic sequences, which was associated with a decline in Grin2b RNA most pronounced after 15 hr of treatment, resulting in decreased expression of protein. These alterations were associated with a significant downregulation of Grin2bTSS+378kb and Grin2bTSS+471kb (Figures 3E, S2C, and S2D). Therefore, spatial genome architectures are dynamically regulated by synaptic activity, by a mechanism that involves increased occupancy of H3K9 methyltransferase at proximal Grin2b repressor elements, and decreased access of facilitative chromatin from distal long-range loops (Grin2bTSS+378kb and Grin2bTSS+471kb) to the TSS and surrounding 5′ regulatory sequences. The long-range loop, GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Grin2bTSS+471kb in the mouse), is dynamically regulated in the context of differentiation (Figure 1C) and synaptic activity (Figure 3E), and facilitates expression by “carrying” AP-1 and NRF-1 transcription factors bound to intergenic DNA 3′ to the gene, into physical proximity with the TSS promoter-proximal sequences positioned at the 5′ end of GRIN2B/Grin2b (Figure 2F). To further test whether the long-range loop, Grin2bTSS+471kb, is involved in the regulation of gene expression, we engineered two transcription activator-like element (TALE) DNA-binding proteins (Boch et al., 2009Boch J. Scholze H. Schornack S. Landgraf A. Hahn S. Kay S. Lahaye T. Nickstadt A. Bonas U.

A simple cipher governs DNA recognition by TAL effectors.Science. 2009; 326: 1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar), fused to the VP64 transcriptional activator domain which is comprised of four tandem copies of the Herpes Simplex virus protein VP16 (Beerli et al., 1998Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas 3rd, C.F. Toward controlling gene expression at will: specific regulation of the erbB-2/HER-2 promoter by using polydactyl zinc finger proteins constructed from modular building blocks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Each TALE was designed against 20 bp of intergenic sequence positioned 3′ to Grin2b, in the distal arm of the loop Grin2bTSS+471kb and within a 500 bp segment showing up to 90% conservation to the human homolog, GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figure S1F). The TALE number 1, for target sequence TCAATAAACGTTAACTACAC, did not affect neuronal viability (in contrast to TALE number 2, which was designed for TAAGACAAACGTCACAGATG). For TALE number 1, with the exception of a 19 bp run on chromosome 15, no match was found in the mm9 reference genome. Importantly, there were no additional binding sites within 800 kb of sequence surrounding the Grin2b TSS, even with a very low filter threshold of up to three mismatches. The TALE-transfected cortical neurons showed 3 days after transfection a significant, ∼20% increase in Grin2b RNA. These changes were highly specific, because a related NR2 subunit, Grin2a, and the repressive regulator Setdb1, did not show significant changes in expression in transfected neurons. Furthermore, mouse neural crest-derived Neuro2a (N2a) and neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108 cells did not show detectable Grin2b expression in untransfected or TALE-transfected cultures (Figure 3F). ChIP-PCR with a VP16 antibody to measure TALE-VP64 occupancy confirmed sequence-specific binding at the target in the distal arm of Grin2bTSS+471kb in transfected neurons, but not in NG108 or N2a cells (Figure 3F). This lack of TALE binding at the target sequence in the two cell lines cannot be explained by incomplete transfection, because expression of the GFP tag was readily detectable in all three cell types (Figure 3F). However, chromatin surrounding the TALE target site showed high levels of the “open” chromatin mark H3K27ac in neurons, while levels were much lower for the corresponding sequences in NG108 and N2a cells (Figure S2E), suggesting that Grin2b chromatin was less accessible in the cell lines. We conclude that active Grin2b expression is sensitive to designer transcription factors binding 471 kb downstream from the TSS. Having shown that higher-order chromatin is a key control point for transcriptional regulation of GRIN2B/Grin2b in brain, we next asked whether these mechanisms could play a potential role in cognition and disease. We interrogated the Psychiatric Genome Consortium 2 (PGC2) data set, with 35,476 schizophrenia (SCZ) and 46,839 control subjects the largest available genome-wide association study to date (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5093) Google Scholar). Within a 10 Mb portion of chromosome 12p encompassing GRIN2B, a single SNP, rs117578877, passed the threshold of p < 10−6, with p = 6.6 × 10−7 and estimated Odds ratio (OR) of 1.15 for the minor (T) allele (Figure 4A). While rs 117578877 did not reach nominal genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8), we note the stepwise decrease of its p value with successively larger samples as part of earlier versions of the PGC2 analysis (Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Consortium, 2011Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) ConsortiumGenome-wide association study identifies five new schizophrenia loci.Nat.

Given the low minor allele frequency (cases, 5.18%; controls, 4.62%), future studies in larger cohorts are expected to reach a more definite conclusion on rs117578877 as risk polymorphism. Of note, rs117578877 is positioned in the center of the distal arm of GRIN2BTSS+449kb (Figure 4A). Therefore, noncontiguous DNA elements bypassing 0.5 Mb on the linear genome could contribute to genetic risk for SCZ by interacting with the GRIN2B TSS. We hypothesized that rs117578877 ris"

Interstitial myofibroblasts are the effector cells in renal fibrogenesis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cell-specific delivery of IFN-γ to platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-expressing myofibroblasts attenuates fibrosis in an obstructive nephropathy [unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)] mouse model. PEGylated IFN-γ conjugated to PDGFRβ-recognizing peptide [(PPB)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-IFN-γ] was tested in vitro and in vivo for antifibrotic properties and compared with free IFN-γ. PDGFRβ expression was >3-fold increased (P < 0.05) in mouse fibrotic UUO kidneys and colocalized with α-smooth muscle actin-positive (SMA+) myofibroblasts. In vitro, PPB-PEG-IFN-γ significantly inhibited col1a1, col1a2, and α-SMA mRNA expression in TGF-β-activated NIH3T3 fibroblasts (P < 0.05). In vivo, PPB-PEG-IFN-γ specifically accumulated in PDGFRβ-positive myofibroblasts. PPB-PEG-IFN-γ treatment significantly reduced renal collagen I, fibronectin, and α-SMA mRNA and protein expression. Compared with vehicle treatment, PPB-PEG-IFN-γ preserved tubular morphology, reduced interstitial T-cell infiltration, and attenuated lymphangiogenesis (all P < 0.05) without affecting peritubular capillary density. PPB-PEGIFN-γ reduced IFN-γ-related side effects as manifested by reduced major histocompatibility complex class II expression in brain tissue (P < 0.05 vs. free IFN-γ).

CXCR4 inhibitors promote the mobilization of bone marrow stem cells, limiting their clinical application for metastasis prevention. We investigated the CXCR4-initiated signaling circuitry to identify new potential therapeutic targets. We used HeLa human cancer cells expressing high levels of CXCR4 endogenously. We found that CXCL12 promotes their migration in Boyden chamber assays and single cell tracking. CXCL12 activated mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) potently in a pertussis-sensitive fashion. Inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by rapamycin [drug concentration causing 50% inhibition (IC50) = 5 nM] and mTORC1/mTORC2 by Torin2 (IC50 = 6 nM), or by knocking down key mTORC1/2 components, Raptor and Rictor, respectively, decreased directional cell migration toward CXCL12. We developed a CXCR4-mediated spontaneous metastasis model by implanting HeLa cells in the tongue of SCID-NOD mice, in which 80% of the animals develop lymph node metastasis. It is surprising that mTORC1 disruption by Raptor knockdown was sufficient to reduce tumor growth by 60% and spontaneous metastasis by 72%, which were nearly abolished by rapamycin. In contrast, disrupting mTORC2 had no effect in tumor growth or metastasis compared with control short hairpin RNAs. These data suggest that mTORC1 may represent a suitable therapeutic target in human malignancies using CXCR4 for their metastatic spread. ."

Sry-related high-mobility group box 11 (Sox11) plays critical roles in neural development and organogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the role of Sox11 in regulating trilineage differentiation (osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis) and migration of MSCs, and explored the effect of systemically administrated Sox11-modified MSCs on bone fracture healing using the rat model of open femur fracture. Our results demonstrated that Sox11 overexpression increased the trilineage differentiation and migration of MSCs, as well as cell viability under oxidative stress. The effect of Sox11 on osteogenesis was confirmed by ectopic bone formation assay conducted in nude mice. In addition, we found that Sox11 could activate the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad signaling pathway in MSCs. By dual-luciferase reporter assay, we also demonstrated that Sox11 could transcriptionally activate runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) expression. The activation of the BMP/Smad signaling pathway and Runx2, CXCR4 expression may have a synergic effect, which largely contributed to the effect of Sox11 on MSC fate determination and migration. Finally, using an open femur fracture model in rats, we found that a larger number of MSCs stably expressing Sox11 migrated to the fracture site and improved bone fracture healing. Taken together, our study shows that Sox11 is an important regulator of MSC differentiation and migration, and Sox11-modified MSCs may have clinical implication for accelerating bone fracture healing, which can reduce the delayed unions or nonunions."

Streptozotocin-treated rats were used to model type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Segments of the duodenum, ileum and colon were dissected, and the microbiome of the lumen material was analysed by using next-generation DNA sequencing, from phylum to genus level. The intestinal luminal contents were compared between diabetic, insulin-treated diabetic and healthy control rats. No significant differences in bacterial composition were found in the luminal contents from the duodenum of the experimental animal groups, whereas distinct patterns were seen in the ileum and colon, depending on the history of the luminal samples. Ileal samples from diabetic rats exhibited particularly striking alterations, while the richness and diversity obscured some of the modifications in the colon. Characteristic rearrangements in microbiome composition and diversity were detected after insulin treatment, though the normal gut flora was not restored. The Proteobacteria displayed more pronounced shifts than those of the predominant phyla (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) in the rat model of T1D. Diabetes and insulin replacement affect the composition of the gut microbiota in different, gut region-specific manners. The luminal samples from the ileum appear more suitable for diagnostic purposes than the colon/faeces. The Proteobacteria should be at the focus of diagnosis and potential therapy.

Considering that inactivation of estrogen receptor (ER)α promotes obesity and metabolic dysfunction in women and female mice, understanding the mechanisms and tissue-specific sites of ERα action to combat metabolic-related disease, including BrCA, is of clinical importance. To study the role of ERα in adipose tissue we generated fat-specific ERα knock-out (FERKO) mice. Herein we show that ERα deletion increased adipocyte size, fat pad weight, and tissue expression and circulating levels of the secreted glycoprotein, lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), an adipokine previously associated with BrCA development. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter studies showed that ERα binds the Lcn2 promoter to repress its expression. Because adipocytes constitute an important cell type of the breast microenvironment, we examined the impact of adipocyte ERα deletion on cancer cell behavior. Conditioned medium from ERα-null adipocytes and medium containing pure Lcn2 increased proliferation and migration of a subset of BrCA cells in culture. The proliferative and promigratory effects of ERα-deficient adipocyte-conditioned medium on BrCA cells was reversed by Lcn2 deletion.

https://openalex.org/W2085414372,"Sensory adaptation represents a form of experience-dependent plasticity that allows neurons to retain high sensitivity over a broad dynamic range. The mechanisms by which sensory neuron responses are altered on different timescales during adaptation are unclear. The threshold for temperature-evoked activity in the AFD thermosensory neurons (T*(AFD)) in C. elegans is set by the cultivation temperature (T(c)) and regulated by intracellular cGMP levels. We find that T*(AFD) adapts on both short and long timescales upon exposure to temperatures warmer than T(c), and that prolonged exposure to warmer temperatures alters expression of AFD-specific receptor guanylyl cyclase genes. These temperature-regulated changes in gene expression are mediated by the CMK-1 CaMKI enzyme, which exhibits T(c)-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in AFD. Our results indicate that CaMKI-mediated changes in sensory gene expression contribute to long-term adaptation of T*(AFD), and suggest that similar temporally and mechanistically distinct phases may regulate the operating ranges of other sensory neurons."

We show that depletion of GIPC-induced autophagy in pancreatic cancer cells, as evident from the upregulation of the autophagy marker LC3II. We further report that GIPC regulates cellular trafficking pathways by modulating the secretion, biogenesis, and molecular composition of exosomes. We also identified the involvement of GIPC on metabolic stress pathways regulating autophagy and microvesicular shedding, and observed that GIPC status determines the loading of cellular cargo in the exosome. Furthermore, we have shown the overexpression of the drug resistance gene ABCG2 in exosomes from GIPC-depleted pancreatic cancer cells. We also demonstrated that depletion of GIPC from cancer cells sensitized them to gemcitabine treatment, an avenue that can be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2145034901,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism catalyzed by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. These small molecules are autocrine and paracrine lipid mediators with important roles in inflammation, cardiovascular function, and angiogenesis. Recent evidence has highlighted EETs as potent promoters of organ regeneration and malignant metastasis. We speculated that EETs might impact osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. Using both in vitro and in vivo studies, we observed that EETs significantly attenuated bone loss and inhibited osteoclast formation and activity, which were associated with a decreased receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL): osteoprotegerin ratio and serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. At the molecular level, EETs abrogated RANKL-induced activation of NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and MAPKs, including ERK and JNK, but not p38, during osteoclast formation. EETs also prevented the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following RANKL stimulation. As a result, EETs suppressed osteoclast-specific gene expression, including tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CK), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EETs inhibit osteoclastogenesis through modulation of multiple pathways both upstream and downstream of RANKL signaling. The administration or stabilized endogenous levels of EETs could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoclast-related disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and postmenopausal osteoporosis.—Guan, H., Zhao.

https://openalex.org/W2054063683,"Through encounters with predators, competitors, and noxious stimuli, animals have evolved defensive responses that minimize injury and are essential for survival. Physiological adaptation modulates the stimulus intensities that trigger such nocifensive behaviors, but the molecular networks that define their operating range are largely unknown. Here, we identify a gain-of-function allele of the cmk-1 CaMKI gene in C. elegans and show that loss of the regulatory domain of the CaMKI enzyme produces thermal analgesia and shifts the operating range for nocifensive heat avoidance to higher temperatures. Such analgesia depends on nuclear CMK-1 signaling, while cytoplasmic CMK-1 signaling lowers the threshold for thermal avoidance. CMK-1 acts downstream of heat detection in thermal receptor neurons and controls neuropeptide release. Our results establish CaMKI as a key regulator of the operating range for nocifensive behaviors and suggest strategies for producing thermal analgesia through the regulation of CaMKI-dependent signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2026440984,"Hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis through several mechanisms. Resistance of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected hepatocytes to apoptosis is considered one of the major contributors to the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinoma. The Fas receptor/ligand (Fas/FasL) system plays a prominent role in hepatocyte death during HBV infection. Here we report that HBc mediates resistance of hepatoma cells to agonistic anti-Fas antibody (CH11)-induced apoptosis. When HBc was introduced into human hepatoma cells, the cells became resistant to CH11 cytotoxicity in a p53-dependent manner. HBc significantly down-regulated the expression of p53, total Fas, and membrane-bound Fas at the mRNA and protein levels and reduced FasL mRNA expression. In contrast, HBc up-regulated the expression of soluble forms of Fas by increasing Fas alternative mRNA splicing. Mechanistically, HBc-mediated Fas alternative mRNA splicing was associated with up-regulation of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 and down-regulation of Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase. These results indicated that HBc may prevent hepatocytes from Fas-induced apoptosis by the dual effects of reducing the expression of the proapoptotic form of Fas and enhancing the expression of the antiapoptotic form of the receptor, which may contribute to the survival and persistence of infected hepatocytes during chronic infection.—Liu, W., Lin, Y.-T., Yan, X.-L., Ding, Y.-L., Wu, Y.-L., Chen, W.-N., Lin, X.

https://openalex.org/W2108429812,"The embryonic pattern of global DNA methylation is first established in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst. The methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is produced in most cells through the folate cycle, but only a few cell types generate SAM from betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) via betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), which is expressed in the mouse ICM. Here, mean ICM cell numbers decreased from 18-19 in controls to 11-13 when the folate cycle was inhibited by the antifolate methotrexate and to 12-14 when BHMT expression was knocked down by antisense morpholinos. Inhibiting both pathways, however, much more severely affected ICM development (7-8 cells). Total SAM levels in mouse blastocysts decreased significantly only when both pathways were inhibited (from 3.1 to 1.6 pmol/100 blastocysts). DNA methylation, detected as 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) immunofluorescence in isolated ICMs, was minimally affected by inhibition of either pathway alone but decreased by at least 45-55% when both BHMT and the folate cycle were inhibited simultaneously. Effects on cell numbers and 5-MeC levels in the ICM were completely rescued by methionine (immediate SAM precursor) or SAM. Both the folate cycle and betaine/BHMT appear to contribute to a methyl pool required for normal ICM development and establishing initial embryonic DNA methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2089518320,"The occurrence of the proteasome in bacteria is limited to the phylum of actinobacteria, where it is maintained in parallel to the usual bacterial compartmentalizing proteases. The role it plays in these organisms is still not fully understood, but in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the proteasome supports persistence in the host. In complex with the ring-shaped ATPase Mpa (called ARC in other actinobacteria), the proteasome can degrade proteins that have been post-translationally modified with the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup. Unlike for the eukaryotic proteasome core particle, no other bacterial proteasome interactors have been identified to date. Here we describe and characterize a novel bacterial proteasome activator of Mycobacterium tuberculosis we termed Bpa (Rv3780), using a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods. Bpa features a canonical C-terminal proteasome interaction motif referred to as the HbYX motif, and its orthologs are only found in those actinobacteria encoding the proteasomal subunits. Bpa can inhibit degradation of Pup-tagged substrates in vitro by competing with Mpa for association with the proteasome. Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we show that Bpa forms a ring-shaped homooligomer that can bind coaxially to the face of the proteasome cylinder. Interestingly, Bpa can stimulate the proteasomal degradation of the model substrate β-casein, which suggests it could play a role in the removal of non-native or damaged proteins."

Expression of human cadherin-11 (Cad11), also known as osteoblast cadherin, in prostate cancer increases the migration of prostate cancer cells. How Cad11 mediates cell migration is unknown. Using the human Cad11 cytoplasmic domain in pulldown assays, we identified human angiomotin (Amot), known to be involved in cell polarity, migration, and Hippo pathway, as a component of the Cad11 protein complex. Deletion analysis showed that the last C-terminal 10 amino acids in Cad11 cytoplasmic domain are required for Amot binding. Further, Cad11 preferentially interacts with Amot-p80 than Amot-p130 isoform and binds directly to the middle domain of Amot-p80. Cad11-Amot interaction affects Cad11-mediated cell migration, but not homophilic adhesion, as deletion of Amot binding motif of Cad11 (Cad11-ΔAmot) did not abolish Cad11-mediated cell-cell adhesion of mouse L cells, but significantly reduced Cad11-mediated cell migration of human C4-2B4 and PC3-mm2 prostate cancer cells and human HEK293T cells. Together, our studies identified Amot-p80 as a novel component of the Cad11 complex and demonstrated that Amot-p80 is critical for Cad11-mediated cell migration."

We also evaluated a 5' distal weak enhancer (IGF-1 5'-upstream region growth hormone response element; 5URGHRE) as a GHRE specificity control. IUGR was induced through a well-characterized model of bilateral uterine artery ligation of the pregnant rat. Offspring livers were tested at d 0 and 21. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and bisulfite sequencing quantified epigenetic characteristics. We found that distinct age-related developmental patterns of histone and DNA methylation characterize each GHRE. Development increased H3K4 trimethylation (me3) in both GHREs. However, H3K9me3 decreased with age at IN2GHRE and increased with age at 5URGHRE. IUGR altered the developmental pattern of H3K4me3 and K9me3 around the GHREs in a sex-specific manner at d 21. Developmental and IUGR-induced DNA methylation occurred in a GHRE-, CpG site-, and sex-specific manner.

In C. glutamicum, which is widely used for the industrial production of amino acids and serves as a non-pathogenic model organism for members of the Corynebacteriales including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the GlxR homodimer controls the transcription of a large number of genes involved in carbon metabolism. GlxR therefore represents a key target for understanding the regulation and coordination of C. glutamicum metabolism.

The detailed structural analysis and comparison of GlxR with CRP reveals that the protein undergoes a distinctive conformational change upon cyclic AMP binding leading to a dimer structure more compatible to DNA-binding. As the two binding sites in the GlxR homodimer are structurally identical dynamic changes upon binding of the first ligand are responsible for the allosteric behavior. The results presented here show how dynamic and structural changes in GlxR lead to optimization of orientation and distance of its two DNA-binding helices for optimal DNA recognition."

We performed a genome-wide discovery of PHAS loci in Chinese sacred lotus and identified a total of 106 PHAS loci. Of these, 47 loci generate 21 nucleotide (nt) phasiRNAs and 59 loci generate 24 nt phasiRNAs, respectively. We have also identified a new putative TAS3 and a putative TAS4 loci in the lotus genome. Our results show that some of the nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) disease resistance proteins and MYB transcription factors potentially generate phasiRNAs. Furthermore, our results suggest that some large subunit (LSU) rRNAs can derive putative phasiRNAs, which is potentially resulted from crosstalk between small RNA biogenesis pathways that are employed to process rRNAs and PHAS loci, respectively. Some of the identified phasiRNAs have putative trans-targets with less than 4 mismatches, suggesting that the identified PHAS are involved in many different pathways.

Our research has focused on the epigenetic silencing of cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we describe detection of CDO1 methylation in the plasma of CRC patients using methylation specific PCR (Q-MSP) and extensive analysis of the PCR reaction. Methods DNA was extracted from plasma, and analysed for methylation of the CDO1 gene using Q-MSP. The detection rate of CDO1 gene methylation was calculated and compared with that of diluted DNA extracted from “positive control” DLD1 cells. CDO1 gene methylation in the plasma of 40 CRC patients that were clinicopathologically analysed was then determined. Results (1) The cloned sequence analysis detected 93.3% methylation of the promoter CpG islands of the CDO1 gene of positive control DLD1 cells and 4.7% methylation of the negative control HepG2 CDO1 gene. (2) DLD1 CDO1 DNA could not be detected in this assay if the extracted DNA was diluted ∼1000 fold. The more DNA that was used for the PCR reaction, the more effectively it was amplified in Q-MSP. (3) By increasing the amount of DNA used, methylated CDO1 could be clearly detected in the plasma of 8 (20%) of the CRC patients. However, the percentage of CRC patients detected by methylated CDO1 in plasma was lower than that detected by CEA (35.9%) or CA19-9 (23.1%) in preoperative serum. Combination of CEA/CA19-9 plus plasma methylated CDO1 could increase the rate of detection of curable CRC patients (39.3%) as compared to CEA/CA19-9 (25%). Conclusion We have described detection of CDO1 methylation in the plasma of CRC patients. Although CDO1 methylation was not detected as frequently as conventional tumor markers, analysis of plasma CDO1 methylation in combination with CEA/CA19-9 levels increases the detection rate of curable CRC patients."

Here, we investigated the functional properties of this subset and identified effector molecules and pathways which mediate their function. Adoptive transfer of IL-15 activated CXCR3+ innate CD8+ T cells conferred increased protection against Listeria monocytogenes infection in susceptible IFN-γ–/– mice compared with similarly activated CXCR3– subset. This was associated with enhanced proliferation and IFN-γ production in CXCR3+ cells. Further, CXCR3+ innate cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity against a tumor cell line in vitro. In depth analysis of the CXCR3+ subset showed increased gene expression of Ccl5, Klrc1, CtsW, GP49a, IL-2Rβ, Atp5e, and Ly6c but reduced IFN-γR2 and Art2b.

https://openalex.org/W1972321650,"The EGF receptor (EGFR) family comprises four homologs in humans collectively known as the ErbB or HER proteins. ErbB proteins are receptor tyrosine kinases that become activated when ligands bind to their extracellular regions and promote formation of specific homo- and heterodimers with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. An essential feature of ErbB activation is formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase serves as the activator or donor kinase by binding the N-terminal lobe of a receiver or acceptor kinase and stabilizing its active conformation. ErbB extracellular regions are also thought to form active asymmetric dimers in which only one subunit binds ligand. The observation that the unliganded ErbB2 kinase preferentially serves as the activator kinase when paired with EGFR/ErbB1 implied that extracellular asymmetry in ErbB proteins might be coupled to intracellular asymmetry with unliganded partners favoring the activator kinase position. Using cell-based stimulation assays and chimeric ErbB proteins, we show that extracellular asymmetry is not coupled to intracellular asymmetry and that ErbB intracellular regions are sufficient to determine relative kinase activator-receiver orientation.

The EGF receptor (EGFR) family comprises four homologs in humans collectively known as the ErbB or HER proteins. ErbB proteins are receptor tyrosine kinases that become activated when ligands bind to their extracellular regions and promote formation of specific homo- and heterodimers with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. An essential feature of ErbB activation is formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase serves as the activator or donor kinase by binding the N-terminal lobe of a receiver or acceptor kinase and stabilizing its active conformation. ErbB extracellular regions are also thought to form active asymmetric dimers in which only one subunit binds ligand. The observation that the unliganded ErbB2 kinase preferentially serves as the activator kinase when paired with EGFR/ErbB1 implied that extracellular asymmetry in ErbB proteins might be coupled to intracellular asymmetry with unliganded partners favoring the activator kinase position. Using cell-based stimulation assays and chimeric ErbB proteins, we show that extracellular asymmetry is not coupled to intracellular asymmetry and that ErbB intracellular regions are sufficient to determine relative kinase activator-receiver orientation. We further show a hierarchy of activator-receiver preferences among ErbB proteins, with EGFR/ErbB1 being the strongest receiver, followed by ErbB2 and then ErbB4, and that cis-phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 appears to be negligible.

Impairment in skeletal muscle glucose handling capacity leads to the state of insulin resistance. The TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) cytokine has now emerged as a major regulator of skeletal muscle mass and function. However, the role of TWEAK in skeletal muscle metabolic function remains less understood. Here, we demonstrate that with progressive age, skeletal muscle-specific TWEAK-transgenic (TWEAK-Tg) mice gain increased body weight (~16%) and fat mass (~64%) and show glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity. TWEAK-Tg mice also exhibit adipocyte hypertrophy in the epididymal fat. Oxygen uptake, voluntary physical activity, and exercise capacity were significantly reduced in TWEAK-Tg mice compared with controls. Overexpression of TWEAK inhibited (~31%) 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduced (~31%) the levels of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) without affecting the Akt pathway. TWEAK also inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (~32%) and repressed the levels of GLUT4 (~50%) in cultured myotubes from C57BL6 mice. TWEAK represses the levels of Krüppel-like factor 15; myocyte enhancer factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, which are required for the activation of the GLUT4 locus. Collectively our study demonstrates that elevated levels of TWEAK in skeletal muscle cause metabolic abnormalities. Inhibition of TWEAK could be a potential approach to prevent weight gain and type 2 diabetes.—Sato, S., Ogura, Y., Tajrishi, M.

Recent evidences suggest that diabetic patients tend to show a higher future risk for PD advocating a strong correlation between PD and Diabetes, thus making it intriguing to decipher common genetic cues behind these ailments. We carried out studies on ida-1, the C. elegans orthologue of mammalian type-1 diabetes auto-antigen IA-2 towards achieving its functional workup vis-à-vis various associated endpoints of PD and Diabetes. Employing transgenic C. elegans strain expressing “human” alpha synuclein (NL5901) under normal and increased glucose concentrations, we studied aggregation of alpha synuclein, content of dopamine, expression of dopamine transporter, content of reactive oxygen species, locomotor activity, nuclear translocation of FOXO transcription factor Daf-16, and quantification of Daf2/Daf-16 mRNA. Our findings indicate that ida-1 affords protection in the studied disease conditions as absence of ida-1 resulted in higher alpha-synuclein aggregation under conditions that mimic the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients. We also observed reduced dopamine content, decreased motility, defective Daf-16 translocation and reduced expression of Daf-2 and Daf-16. Our studies establish important function of ida-1 as a modulator in Daf-2/Daf-16 insulin like signalling pathway thus possibly being a common link between PD and Diabetes."

The role of NPTX2 in regulating structural synaptic plasticity and behavior in a developing vertebrate is indefinite. We characterized the expression of nptx2a in larvae and adult zebrafish and established a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated nptx2a mutant (nptx2a-/-) to study the role of Nptx2a in regulating structural synaptic plasticity and behavior. Similar to mammals, the zebrafish nptx2a was expressed in excitatory neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Its expression was induced in response to a mechanosensory stimulus but did not change during day and night. Behavioral assays showed that loss of Nptx2a results in reduced locomotor response to light-to-dark transition states and to a sound stimulus. Live imaging of synapses using the transgenic nptx2a:GAL4VP16 zebrafish and a fluorescent presynaptic synaptophysin (SYP) marker revealed reduced synaptic density in the axons of the spinal motor neurons and the anterodorsal lateral-line ganglion (gAD), which regulate locomotor activity and locomotor response to mechanosensory stimuli, respectively. These results suggest that Nptx2a affects locomotor response to external stimuli by mediating structural synaptic plasticity in excitatory neuronal circuits.—Elbaz, I., Lerer-Goldshtein, T., Okamoto, H., Appelbaum, L.

https://openalex.org/W2037777502,"The p21-activated serine-threonine kinase (PAK1) regulates cell motility and adhesion. We have previously shown that the prolactin (PRL)-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 phosphorylates PAK1 in vivo and in vitro and identified tyrosines 153, 201, and 285 in PAK1 as sites of JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Here, we further investigate the role of the tyrosyl phosphorylated PAK1 (pTyr-PAK1) in regulation of cell adhesion. We use human breast cancer T47D cell lines that stably overexpress PAK1 wild type or PAK1 Y3F mutant in which these 3 JAK2 phosphorylation sites were mutated to phenylalanine. We demonstrate that PRL/JAK2-dependent phosphorylation of these tyrosines promotes a motile phenotype in the cells upon adhesion, participates in regulation of cell adhesion on collagen IV, and is required for maximal PAK1 kinase activity. Down-regulation of PAK1 abolishes the effect of PAK1 on cell adhesion. We show that the tyrosyl phosphorylation of PAK1 promotes PAK1 binding to β-PAK1-interacting guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (βPEX) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting target 1 (GIT1), phosphorylation of paxillin on Ser273, and formation and distribution of adhesion complexes. Using phosphospecific antibodies (Abs) directed to single phosphorylated tyrosines on PAK1, we identified Tyr285 as a site of PRL-dependent phosphorylation of PAK1 by JAK2. Furthermore, using PAK1 Y285F mutant, we provide evidence for a role of pTyr285 in cell adhesion, enhanced bPIX/GIT1 binding, and adhesion turnover. Our immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrates that pTyr285-PAK1 may modulate PAK1 signaling during tumor progression.—Hammer, A., Oladimeji, P., De La Casas, L.

To determine whether a soluble ActRIIb receptor Fc fusion protein (ActRIIB.Fc), a ligand trap for TGF-β/activin family members including myostatin, can prevent or restore loss of lean body mass and body weight in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Fourteen pair-housed, juvenile male rhesus macaques were inoculated with SIVmac239 and, 4 wk postinoculation (WPI) treated with intramuscular injections of 10 mg · kg-1 · wk-1 ActRIIB.Fc or saline placebo. Body weight, lean body mass, SIV titers, and somatometric measurements were assessed monthly for 16 wk. Age-matched SIV-infected rhesus macaques were injected with saline. Intervention groups did not differ at baseline. Gains in lean mass were significantly greater in the ActRIIB.Fc group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Administration of ActRIIB.Fc was associated with greater gains in body weight (P = 0.01) and upper arm circumference than placebo. Serum CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and SIV copy numbers did not differ between groups. Administration of ActRIIB.Fc was associated with higher muscle expression of myostatin than placebo.

https://openalex.org/W2062348609,"In this study, the protective effects of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2] on quinclorac- induced toxicity were investigated in silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). The fish were fed for 60 days with a diet in the absence or in the presence of 3.0 mg/Kg (PhSe)2. Animals were further exposed to 1 mg/L quinclorac for 8 days. At the end of experimental period, fish were euthanized and biopsies from liver and gills, as well as blood samples, were collected. The cortisol and metabolic parameters were determined in plasma, and those enzyme activities related to osmoregulation were assayed in the gills. In liver, some important enzyme activities of the intermediary metabolism and oxidative stress-related parameters, such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS), protein carbonyl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and ascorbic acid contents were also evaluated. Compared to the control group, quinclorac exposure significantly decreased hepatosomatic index and increased cortisol and lactate values in plasma. Moreover, the activities of fructose biphosphatase (FBPase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6Pase), glycogen phosphorilase (GPase) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly increased in liver. Quinclorac also induced lipid peroxidation while the activity of SOD, NPSH and ascorbic acid levels decreased in the liver. However, dietary (PhSe)2 reduced the herbicide-induced effects on the studied parameters. In conclusion, (PhSe)2 has beneficial properties based on its ability to attenuate toxicity induced by quinclorac by regulating energy metabolism and oxidative stress-related parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2076024626,"Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) play an important role in vascular homeostasis and hold therapeutic promise for treating a variety of cardiovascular diseases. However, further improvements are needed because the effects of CAC therapy remain minimal or transient. The regenerative potential of these cells can be improved by culture on a collagen-based matrix through the up-regulation of key integrin proteins. We found that human CAC function was enhanced by using the matricellular protein CCN1 (CYR61/CTGF/NOV family member 1) to target integrin αV and β3, which are up-regulated on matrix. Compared to matrix-cultured CACs, CCN1-matrix CACs exhibited a 2.2-fold increase in cell proliferation, 1.8-fold greater migration toward VEGF, and 1.7-fold more incorporation into capillary-like structures in an angiogenesis assay. In vivo, intramuscular injection of CCN1-matrix-cultured CACs into ischemic hind limbs of CD-1 nude mice resulted in blood flow recovery to 80% of baseline, which was greater than matrix-cultured CACs (66%) and PBS (35%) treatment groups. Furthermore, transplanted CCN1-matrix CACs exhibited greater engraftment (11-fold) and stimulated the up-regulation of survival and angiogenic genes (>3-fold). These findings reveal the importance of cell-matrix interactions in regulating CAC function and also reveal a mechanism by which these may be exploited to enhance cell therapies for ischemic disease.—McNeill, B., Vulesevic, B., Ostojic, A., Ruel, M., Suuronen, E.

https://openalex.org/W2009244491,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a pivotal role in synaptic transmission of neuronal signaling pathways and are fundamentally involved in neuronal disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. In vertebrates, cholinergic pathways can be selectively inhibited by α-conotoxins; we show that in the model organism Drosophila, the cholinergic component of the giant fiber system is inhibited by α-conotoxins MII, AuIB, BuIA, EI, PeIA, and ImI. The injection of 45 pmol/fly of each toxin dramatically decreases the response of the giant fiber to dorsal longitudinal muscle (GF-DLM) connection to 20 ± 13.9% for MII; 26 ± 13.7% for AuIB, 12 ± 9.9% for BuIA, 30 ± 11.3% for EI, 1 ± 1% for PeIA, and 34 ± 15.4% for ImI. Through bioassay-guided fractionation of the venom of Conus brunneus, we found BruIB, an α-conotoxin that inhibits Drosophila nicotinic receptors but not its vertebrate counterparts. GF-DLM responses decreased to 43.7 ± 8.02% on injection of 45 pmol/fly of BruIB. We manipulated the Dα7 nAChR to mimic the selectivity of its vertebrate counterpart by placing structurally guided point mutations in the conotoxin-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2045986031,"Background Neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of seizures and epilepsy in most of the world, and it occurs when Taenia solium larval cysts infect the central nervous system. T. solium tapeworm infection is endemic in much of Peru, but there are scarce data on the prevalence in many rural highland communities where it is likely to be hyper-endemic. Peace Corps Volunteers live and work in these communities; however, to our knowledge, they have not been used to facilitate public health research. Materials and Methods We utilized Peace Corps Volunteers to estimate the prevalence of T. solium tapeworm infection in seven rural communities in northern Peru. A convenience non-random sampling frame was used. Peace Corps Volunteers facilitated the collection of stool samples (N = 2,328), which were analyzed by sedimentation and microscopy. Niclosamide treatment and purgation preceded species identification, which was done by PCR-REA. Results Taenia sp. egg-positive stool samples were found in three of the seven communities we surveyed. The overall prevalence of Taenia sp. egg positivity was 2.1% (49/2,328) (95% CI = 1.6–2.8%) with prevalence up to 4.3% (42/977) (95% CI = 3.1–5.8%) by community. All 34 of the specimens tested by PCR-REA were T. solium. The overall prevalence of T. solium tapeworm infection was 1.5% (34/2,328) (95% CI = 1.0–2.0%). Prevalence up to 2.9% (28/977) (95% CI = 1.9–4.1%) by community was observed. Conclusion/Significance This study recorded high T. solium tapeworm prevalence, and identified hyper-endemic rural communities. It demonstrates that synergy between researchers and Peace Corps Volunteers can be an effective means to conducting large-scale, community-based studies in remote areas of Peru."

To determine the role of TNF-TNFR2/p75 signaling in ischemia-induced inflammation and muscle regeneration, we subjected wild-type (WT) and TNFR2/p75 knockout (p75KO) mice to hind limb ischemia (HLI) surgery. Ischemia induced significant and long-lasting inflammation associated with considerable decrease in satellite-cell activation in p75KO muscle tissue up to 10 d after HLI surgery. To determine the possible additive negative roles of tissue aging and the absence of TNFR2/p75, either in the tissue or in the bone marrow (BM), we generated 2 chimeric BM transplantation (BMT) models where both young green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive p75KO and WT BM-derived cells were transplanted into adult p75KO mice. HLI surgery was performed 1 mo after BMT, after confirming complete engraftment of the recipient BM with GFP donor cells. In adult p75KO with the WT-BMT, proliferative (Ki67(+)) cells were detected only by d 28 and were exclusively GFP(+), suggesting significantly delayed contribution of young WT-BM cell to adult p75KO ischemic tissue recovery. No GFP(+) young p75KO BM cells survived in adult p75KO tissue, signifying the additive negative roles of tissue aging combined with decreased/absent TNFR2/p75 signaling in postischemic recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1987465924,"“Moving to the beat” is both one of the most basic and one of the most profound means by which humans (and a few other species) interact with music. Computer algorithms that detect the precise temporal location of beats (i.e., pulses of musical “energy”) in recorded music have important practical applications, such as the creation of playlists with a particular tempo for rehabilitation (e.g., rhythmic gait training), exercise (e.g., jogging), or entertainment (e.g., continuous dance mixes). Although several such algorithms return simple point estimates of an audio file’s temporal structure (e.g., “average tempo”, “time signature”), none has sought to quantify the temporal stability of a series of detected beats. Such a method-a “Balanced Evaluation of Auditory Temporal Stability” (BEATS)–is proposed here, and is illustrated using the Million Song Dataset (a collection of audio features and music metadata for nearly one million audio files). A publically accessible web interface is also presented, which combines the thresholdable statistics of BEATS with queryable metadata terms, fostering potential avenues of research and facilitating the creation of highly personalized music playlists for clinical or recreational applications."
https://openalex.org/W1967795498,"Evidence-based criteria for applying cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy are still scarce. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography (RT-MCE) in a preclinical canine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy who received CRT. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was produced by ligating the first diagonal branch in 20 beagles. Dogs were subsequently divided into two groups that were either treated with bi-ventricular pacing (CRT group) or left untreated (control group). RT-MCE was performed at baseline, before CRT, and 4 weeks after CRT. Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging was used to evaluate the standard deviation of circumferential (Cir12SD), radial (R12SD), and longitudinal (L12SD) strains of left ventricular segments at basal as well as middle levels. Four weeks later, the Cir12SD, R12SD, and myocardial blood flow (MBF) of the treated group were significantly improved compared to their non-CRT counterparts. Furthermore, MBF values measured before CRT were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders to bi-ventricular pacing. Meanwhile, no significant differences were observed between the responder and non-responder groups in terms of Cir12SD, R12SD, and L12SD. A high degree of correlation was found between MBF values before CRT and LVEF after CRT. When MBF value>24.9 dB/s was defined as a cut-off point before CRT, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-MCE in predicting the response to CRT were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. Besides, MBF values increased significantly in the CRT group compared with the control group after 4 weeks of pacing (49.8±15.5 dB/s vs. 28.5±4.6 dB/s, p<0.05). Therefore, we considered that myocardial perfusion may be superior to standard metrics of LV synchrony in selecting appropriate candidates for CRT. In addition, CRT can improve myocardial perfusion in addition to cardiac synchrony, especially in the setting of ischemic cardiomyopathy."
