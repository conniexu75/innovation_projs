https://openalex.org/W2019875735,"Human color vision is based on three light-sensitive pigments. The isolation and sequencing of genomic and complementary DNA clones that encode the apoproteins of these three pigments are described. The deduced amino acid sequences show 41 +/- 1 percent identity with rhodopsin. The red and green pigments show 96 percent mutual identity but only 43 percent identity with the blue pigment. Green pigment genes vary in number among color-normal individuals and, together with a single red pigment gene, are proposed to reside in a head-to-tail tandem array within the X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2041534105,"Many observations suggest the presence of transmembrane linkages between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. In fibroblasts both light and electron microscopic observations reveal a co-alignment between actin filaments at the cell surface and extracellular fibronectin1–3. These associations are seen at sites of cell matrix interaction, frequently along stress fibres and sometimes where these bundles of microfilaments terminate at adhesion plaques (focal contacts). Non-morphological evidence also indicates a functional linkage between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Addition of fibronectin to transformed cells induces flattening of the cells and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, with the concomitant appearance of arrays of stress fibres4–6. Conversely, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by treatment with cytochalasin B leads to release of fibronectin from the cell surface7. As yet, there is no detailed knowledge of the molecules involved in this transmembrane linkage, although several proteins have been suggested as candidates in the chain of attachment between bundles of actin filaments and the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane: these include vinculin8, α-actinin9 and talin10, each one having been identified at regions where bundles of actin filaments interact with the plasma membrane and underlying cell-surface fibronectin10–13. Recently, the cell-substrate attachment (CSAT) antigen14 has been identified as a plasma membrane receptor for fibronectin15, raising the possibility that this glycoprotein complex may serve as a bridge between fibronectin and one or more of the underlying cytoskeletal components mentioned. Here we have investigated the interaction of the purified CSAT antigen with these cytoskeletal components, and we demonstrate an interaction specifically between the CSAT antigen and talin."

Electron microscopy showed that the endothelial cells lining the lumen and the smooth muscle cells in the wall were healthy and well differentiated. The lining of endothelial cells functioned physically, as a permeability barrier, and biosynthetically, producing von Willebrand's factor and prostacyclin. The strength of the model depended on its multiple layers of collagen integrated with a Dacron mesh."
https://openalex.org/W2065142882,"A sensitive radioimmunoassay for atrial natriuretic peptide was used to examine the relation between circulating atrial natriuretic peptide and cardiac filling pressure in normal human subjects, in patients with cardiovascular disease and normal cardiac filling pressure, and in patients with cardiovascular disease and elevated cardiac filling pressure with and without congestive heart failure. The present studies establish a normal range for atrial natriuretic peptide in normal human subjects. These studies also establish that elevated cardiac filling pressure is associated with increased circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and that congestive heart failure is not characterized by a deficiency in atrial natriuretic peptide, but with its elevation."
https://openalex.org/W2092197701,"Rabbit genomic DNA contains two genes that encode Ca2+ ATPases of fast twitch and of slow twitch (and cardiac) sarcoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of the products of the two genes are highly conserved in putative Ca2+ binding regions, in sectors leading from cytoplasmic domains into transmembrane domains, and in transmembrane helices. A transport mechanism is proposed in which Ca2+ binds to negatively charged groups on amphipathic stalk sectors, becoming occluded during enzyme phosphorylation by bound ATP. Rotation of the stalk sectors is induced as the energy in the phosphorylated enzyme (E1P) is utilized in conformational changes leading to the low energy form, E2P. Rotation leads to disruption of high affinity Ca2+ binding sites and release of Ca2+ into a charge-lined membrane channel. Ca2+ then traverses the membrane by exchange diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2032923234,"Many retroviral oncogenes have been classified into one of several categories based on structure, enzymology and cellular localization1. These genes originated from host cells and are probably derived from genes normally involved in the control of cell proliferation2. The cellular counterparts of three oncogenes have been identified as a growth factor or growth factor receptor3–6; related oncogenes include receptor-like membrane proteins which often express tyrosine kinase activity. These growth factor-related oncogenes are structurally and biochemically distinct from the membrane-associated ras gene family, which bind and hydrolyse GTP7–9. Oncogenes localized primarily in the cytoplasm which probably have serine kinase activity, have also been identified10–12. Although the structure and biochemistry of many oncogenes have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the functional relationships of oncogene proteins within the cell. An opportunity to study such interaction is provided by the identification of a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes cellular ras proteins when microinjected into cells13. It has been shown previously that the injected antibody inhibits the initiation of S-phase in NIH 3T3 cells14. In the present study we injected this monoclonal antibody into NIH 3T3 cells transformed by a variety of oncogenes. The results show that transformation by three growth factor receptor-like oncogenes depends on c-ras proteins, while transformation by two cytoplasmic oncogenes appears to be independent of c-ras protein."

https://openalex.org/W1980807416,"We have employed a gel assay to detect a transcription factor in nuclear extracts of adenovirus-infected cells that interacts with the adenovirus E2 promoter, an E1A inducible promoter. Binding of the factor to the promoter protected sequences between -33 and -74 from DNAase cleavage in a footprint assay. This region was also protected from exonuclease III digestion. These sequences coincide with those previously shown to be essential for promoter activity and E1A stimulation. The factor could be detected in extracts of uninfected cells, although at greatly reduced levels. The increased level of factor in infected cells required a functional E1A gene. These results suggest that the E2 binding activity is a cellular transcriptional factor, the concentration or binding activity of which increases as a result of the action of the E1A gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2021152296,"We describe nine T cell γ variable (V) gene segments isolated from human DNA. These genes, which fall into two subgroups, are mapped in two DNA regions covering 54 kb and probably represent the majority of human Vγ genes. One subgroup (VγI) contains eight genes, consisting of four active genes and four pseudogenes. The single VγII gene is potentially active. Sequence analysis of the VγI genes shows variation clustered in hypervariable regions, but somatic variability is restricted to N-region diversity. Studies on rearrangement in T cell lines and in thymic DNA show that major rearrangements can be observed that are attributable to the five active Vγ genes. In addition, human cells with the phenotype of helper T cells can undergo productive Vγ-Jγ joining."

https://openalex.org/W2028158224,Antigenic or mitogenic stimulation of T cells induces the secretion of an array of protein hormones that regulate immune responses. Molecular cloning has contributed strongly to our present understanding of the nature of this regulation. A complementary DNA (cDNA) library prepared from a cloned concanavalin A-activated mouse T-helper cell line was screened for abundant and induction-specific cDNA's. One such randomly chosen cDNA was found to encode mouse preproenkephalin messenger RNA (mRNA). Preproenkephalin mRNA represented about 0.4 percent of the mRNA in the activated cell line but was absent in resting cells of this line. Other induced T-helper cell lines have 0.1 to 0.5 percent of their mRNA as preproenkephalin mRNA. Induced T-helper cell culture supernatants have [Met]enkephalin-immunoreactive material. The production by activated T cells of a peptide neurotransmitter identifies a signal that can potentially permit T cells to modulate the nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1524135583,"The mechanism of the activation of plasminogen by recombinant pro-urokinase (Rec-pro-UK), obtained by expression of the human pro-urokinase gene in Escherichia coli, was investigated in purified systems. In mixtures of Rec-pro-UK and plasminogen, both active urokinase and plasmin are quickly generated. Addition of plasmin inhibitors (aprotinin or alpha 2-antiplasmin) abolishes the conversion of Rec-pro-UK to urokinase but not the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, suggesting that Rec-pro-UK activates plasminogen directly. Human plasma competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen by pro-urokinase with a Ki of 0.2% (v/v). This explains the relative stability of Rec-pro-UK in plasma and the lack of activation of the plasma fibrinolytic system in the absence of fibrin. The competitive inhibition by plasma is abolished by the addition of CNBr-digested fibrinogen although Rec-pro-UK has no specific affinity for fibrin. These findings suggest that the fibrin specificity of the activation of plasminogen by pro-urokinase is due to neutralization by fibrin of the competitive inhibition exerted by plasma and not to fibrin-enhanced activation of plasminogen."

https://openalex.org/W2042464106,"Cardiocytes in the atria contain a prohormone that gives rise to atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP's), which have intrinsic hemodynamic regulatory activity. The distribution of ANP's in the brain suggests the involvement of these peptides in central cardiovascular regulation. In conscious rats with chronic indwelling catheters, volume loading with isotonic saline or glucose increased the amount of circulating immunoreactive ANP's by a factor of 4 to 5, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Hyperosmotic challenge with a hypertonic NaCl solution or anesthesia with halothane caused similar increases in plasma ANP's. Results obtained with the denervated-heart preparation indicate that neuronal influences are important in the release of ANP's induced by volume loading. As judged from reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of extracted plasma and radioimmunoassay of collected fractions, the circulating physiologically important ANP's in the conscious rodent appear to be alpha-rANP(5-28) (atriopeptin III) and either alpha-rANP(3-28) [ANF(8-33)] or alpha-rANP(1-28) (ANF)."
https://openalex.org/W1479961610,"The mannose analogue, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which inhibits Golgi alpha-mannosidase I but not endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alpha-mannosidase has been used to determine the role of the ER alpha-mannosidase in the processing of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins in intact cells. In the absence of the inhibitor, the predominant oligosaccharide structures found on the ER glycoprotein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in UT-1 cells are single isomers of Man6GlcNAc and Man8GlcNAc. In the presence of 150 microM 1-deoxymannojirimycin, the Man8GlcNAc2 isomer accumulates indicating that the 1-deoxymannojirimycin-resistant ER alpha-mannosidase is responsible for the conversion of Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2 on reductase. The processing of Man8GlcNAc2 to Man6GlcNAc2, however, must be attributed to a 1-deoxymannojirimycin-sensitive alpha-mannosidase. When cells were radiolabeled with [2-(3)H]mannose for 15 h in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin and then further incubated for 3 h in nonradioactive medium without inhibitor, the Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides which accumulated during the labeling period were partially trimmed to Man6GlcNAc. This finding suggests that a second alpha-mannosidase, sensitive to 1-deoxymannojirimycin, resides in the crystalloid ER and is responsible for trimming the reductase oligosaccharide chain from Man8GlcNAc2 to Man6GlcNAc2. To determine if ER alpha-mannosidase is responsible for trimming the oligosaccharides of all glycoproteins from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc, the total asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of rat hepatocytes labeled with [2-(3)H]mannose in the presence or absence of 1.0 mM 1-deoxymannojirimycin were examined. the inhibitor prevented the formation of complex oligosaccharides and caused a 30-fold increase in the amount of Man9GlcNAc2 and a 13-fold increase in the amount of Man8GlcNAc2 present on secreted glycoproteins. This result suggests that only one-third of the secreted glycoproteins is initially processed by ER alpha-mannosidase, and two-thirds are processed by Golgi alpha-mannosidase I or another 1-deoxymannojirimycin-sensitive alpha-mannosidase. The inhibitor caused only a 2.6-fold increase in the amount of Man9GlcNAc2 on cellular glycoproteins suggesting that a higher proportion of these glycoproteins are initially processed by the ER alpha-mannosidase. We conclude that some, but not all, hepatocyte glycoproteins are substrates for ER alpha-mannosidase which catalyzes the removal of a specific mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to form a single isomer of Man8GlcNAc2."
https://openalex.org/W1544096350,"Gene uvsX of bacteriophage T4 encodes a 40,000-dalton protein that plays a key role in the major pathway for genetic recombination in T4-infected cells. Mutations at the uvsX locus lead to increased sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents, reduced phage bursts, decreased genetic recombination, and early arrest of DNA synthesis. Like the Escherichia coli recA protein, the purified uvsX protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase that catalyzes pairing between homologous single- and double-stranded DNA molecules in vitro (Yonesaki, T., Ryo, Y., Minagawa, T., and Takahashi, H., (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 148, 127-134). At physiological salt concentrations, the uvsX protein binds tightly and cooperatively to single-stranded DNA, covering about five nucleotides per protein monomer; at lower salt concentrations, a similar type of binding to double-stranded DNA is detected (Griffith, J., and Formosa, T., (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4484-4491). We show here that the ATPase activity of this protein is unusual in producing both ADP plus Pi and AMP plus PPi as products. Generating the fully active form of the ATPase is a cooperative process, apparently requiring that a protein monomer be bound to single-stranded DNA while surrounded by other ATP-bound monomers. The catalysis of homologous pairing by the uvsX protein is shown to be greatly stimulated by the presence of the T4 gene 32 protein, a helix-destablizing protein previously studied in this laboratory, and it requires continued ATP hydrolysis. We present a method that allows the purification of the uvsX protein to essential homogeneity. We also describe the complete purification of two proteins that bind to the uvsX protein: the T4 uvsY protein (16,000 daltons) and an E. coli host protein of 32,000 daltons whose gene is unknown. The host protein is likely to play a role in DNA metabolism, because it also binds to the T4 gene 32 protein and to DNA; the sequence of its amino-terminal 29 amino acids has been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1534824082,"Human alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) exists as a heterogeneous group of isozymes capable of oxidizing a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols. The five distinct human ADH subunits, each encoded by a separate gene, are differentially expressed during development and are subject to tissue-specific regulation. To analyze the organization and regulation of human ADH genes we first isolated a cDNA clone (pADH12) encoding the 3' portion of the beta ADH gene. In the current study pADH12 was used to screen a human genomic library, and several overlapping and nonoverlapping clones were selected. Hybridization and partial nucleotide sequence analyses of the clones indicated that three full-length human ADH genes encoding the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits were isolated. Human genomic DNA hybridization results indicate that the alpha, beta, and gamma ADH genes form a closely related gene family and suggest that the other known human ADH genes (i.e. those encoding the pi and chi subunits) share a more distant evolutionary relationship. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the beta ADH gene reveals that the coding region is interrupted by eight introns and spans approximately 15 kilobases. A presumptive transcription initiation site for the beta ADH gene was located by S1 nuclease mapping at a position 70 base pairs upstream of the start codon. The 5' flanking region possesses a TATA box promoter element as well as two tandem DNA sequences which display homology to previously examined glucocorticoid-responsive elements."
https://openalex.org/W2007281794,"The adenovirus type 5 genome contains two distinct enhancer elements located at the left end of the viral chromosome. The first element is repeated and specifically regulates region E1A transcription within infected cells. One copy of this element is sufficient to fully activate E1A transcription in vivo. The second element is located between these repeated sequences and regulates transcription in cis of all early regions on the chromosome. These enhancer elements function independently of each other, and neither element is required for efficient viral DNA replication. Since mutations within the two E1A enhancer components generate different physiological responses, transcriptional enhancement can be achieved through multiple mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1521047460,"Abstract The kinetics of the activation of plasminogen by recombinant pro-urokinase obtained by expression of human urokinase cDNA in Escherichia coli was studied. The conversion of pro-urokinase (U) and plasminogen (P) to urokinase (u) and plasmin (p) is represented by a sequence of three reactions which each obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics, i.e. (Formula: see text). In this model, pro-urokinase formally behaves as an enzyme in Reaction I and as a substrate in reaction II. The experimentally measured overall rates of formation of urokinase and plasmin are in good agreement with those calculated from the kinetic parameters and the initial concentrations of pro-urokinase and plasminogen, confirming the validity of the model. It appears that recombinant pro-urokinase is an equally potent activator of plasminogen = 0.05 microM-1 s-1), as in urokinase (k2/Km = 0.02 microM-1 s-1). This is due to the fact that the proenzyme, which is virtually inactive toward low Mr substrates for urokinase, forms an intermediate of the Michaelis-Menten type with plasminogen, with a much higher affinity than that of the active enzyme with its substrate. This is an exceptional phenomenon among the serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2046882513,"A critical enzyme in protein breakdown in Escherichia coli is protease La (the lon gene product), which hydrolyzes proteins and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in a coupled process. The mechanism of this process was studied with fluorogenic tripeptides. Although proteins and peptides are degraded at the same active site, protein substrates enhance the ability of the enzyme to degrade these peptides two- to tenfold. Proteins that are not substrates had little or no effect. Thus, protein substrates must bind to protease La at two sites, the active site and an allosteric site whose occupancy enhances proteolytic activity. This effect did not require that the proteins themselves be degraded. Proteins could induce peptide breakdown even in the absence of ATP, and proteins and ATP had additive effects in stimulating peptidase activity. A multistep cyclical mechanism is proposed in which the binding of the substrate and ATP activates the protease. The enzyme can then cleave a peptide bond, but is inactivated through ATP hydrolysis. Such a mechanism may help account for the selectivity of protein breakdown and prevent inappropriate or excessive proteolysis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1487339116,"Irradiation of soluble dynein 1 from sea urchin sperm flagella at 254 nm in the presence of 50 microM ATP and 100 microM inorganic vanadate (Vi) cleaves the alpha and beta heavy chains into approximately equal quantities of two polypeptides of Mr 228,000 and 200,000, with a conversion efficiency of about 63%. A similar cleavage occurs in the presence of Vi and either ADP or 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3ATP); in the latter case, 8-N3ATP becomes covalently bound principally to the Mr 228,000 polypeptide. No detectable amount of these fragments is formed if either the Vi or the nucleotide is omitted or in the presence of Vi and 50 microM AMP. These results emphasize the basic similarity of the two ATPases associated with the alpha and beta heavy chain subunits of dynein 1 and give a mean Mr of 428,000 for the intact heavy chains."
https://openalex.org/W1546624056,"Membrane vesicles capable of energized Ca2+ pumping have been reconstituted from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Cardiac SR was solubilized with Triton X-100 in a detergent to protein weight ratio of 0.8, and membranous vesicles were reconstituted by removal of detergent with Bio-Beads SM-2 (a neutral porous styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer). The reconstituted vesicles exhibited ATP-dependent oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ accumulation with rates and efficiency comparable to the best reconstituted skeletal muscle preparation (Ca2+-loading rate = 1.65 +/- 0.31 mumol mg-1 min-1, Ca2+-activated ATPase activity = 2.39 +/- 0.25 mumol mg-1 min-1, efficiency (Ca2+/ATP) = 0.69 +/- 0.09). Phospholamban in the reconstituted vesicles was phosphorylated with added catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to almost the same extent as that in original vesicles. However, phosphorylation of phospholamban had no effect on the Ca2+ accumulation of the reconstituted vesicles. This is to be contrasted with a decrease in the half-maximal concentration of Ca2+ for Ca2+ accumulation (KCa) in the original vesicles from 1.35 +/- 0.08 microM to 0.75 +/- 0.12 microM by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban. On the other hand KCa for the reconstituted vesicles was about 0.5 microM and remained unchanged by phosphorylation, indicating that the Ca2+ pump in the reconstituted vesicles is already fully activated. These results suggest that in normal cardiac SR, phospholamban in the dephosphorylated state acts as a suppressor of the Ca2+ pump and that phosphorylation of phospholamban serves to reverse the suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2054034728,"The adenovirus E1A gene product trans-activates a number of viral and cellular promoters. The mechanism for this transcriptional induction was investigated with an in vivo exoIII mapping technique to assay for proteins that interact with an E1A-inducible promoter. A protein bound to the early E2 promoter was detected in wild-type infected cells. In the absence of E1A induction, specific interactions at the promoter could not be detected, as indicated by the absence of an exoIII-protected fragment. However, if conditions were established that allowed transcription of the E2 gene in the absence of E1A, the same exoIII protection was observed as was found in the presence of E1A. These results suggest a model in which the efficient utilization of the E2 promoter is mediated by a cellular transcription factor. In the absence of E1A, the interaction can take place, but slowly and inefficiently in comparison with the interaction in the presence of E1A."
https://openalex.org/W1597358313,"The role of phosphorylation in the regulation of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase was investigated by monitoring the effect of this covalent modification on the steady-state kinetics and complex formation between F-actin and the enzyme. Binding of phosphofructokinase to F-actin at pH 7.0 and 23 degrees C was monitored by sedimentation. These experiments show that phosphorylated phosphofructokinase has a higher apparent affinity for F-actin than does the dephosphorylated form. Control experiments showed that the complex formation is specific. Steady-state kinetic measurements at pH 7.0, 23 degrees C, showed that the presence of F-actin did not significantly affect the basic kinetic properties of the dephosphorylated form. Under identical conditions, F-actin acted as a positive effector of the phosphorylated form, and the effect of F-actin is specific. Results from these in vitro studies are consistent with in vivo observations which show that upon stimulation of muscle contraction, the enzyme is phosphorylated to a greater extent and the binding to the muscle matrix is increased. Hence, phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase does not only alter the kinetic behavior of the enzyme, but also serves as a means to regulate the compartmentalization of the enzyme in order to provide energy to the cellular component where it is needed."
https://openalex.org/W1605519274,"Phospholamban, originally described as a cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum protein, was localized in cryostat sections of three adult canine skeletal muscles (gracilis, extensor carpi radialis, and superficial digitalis flexor) by immunofluorescence labeling with highly specific phospholamban antibodies. Only some myofibers were strongly labeled with phospholamban antibodies. The labeling of myofibers with phospholamban antibodies was compared to the distribution of Type I (slow) and Type II (fast) myofibers as determined by staining adjacent sections cytochemically for the alkali-stable myosin ATPase, a specific marker for Type II myofibers. All the skeletal myofibers labeled for phospholamban above background levels corresponded to Type I (slow) myofibers. The presence of phospholamban in microsomal fractions isolated from canine superficial digitalis flexor (89 +/- 3% Type I) and extensor carpi radialis skeletal muscle (14 +/- 6% Type I) was confirmed by immunoblotting. Antiserum to cardiac phospholamban bound to proteins of apparent Mr values of 25,000 (oligomeric phospholamban) and 5,000-6,000 (monomeric phospholamban) in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from both muscles. Quantification of phospholamban in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from cardic, slow, and fast skeletal muscle tissues following phosphorylation with [gamma-32P] ATP suggested that superficial digitalis flexor and extensor carpi radialis skeletal muscle contained about 16 and 3%, respectively, as much phospholamban as cardiac muscle per unit of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The presence of phospholamban in both Type I (slow) and cardiac muscle fibers supports the possibility that the Ca2+ fluxes across the sarcoplasmic reticulum in both fiber types are similarly regulated, and is consistent with the idea that the relaxant effect of catecholamines on slow skeletal muscle is mediated in part by phosphorylation of phospholamban."
https://openalex.org/W1912088000,"Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein. It functions as a cofactor to activated protein C in the inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa by limited proteolysis. Protein S is very sensitive to proteolysis by thrombin which reduces its calcium ion binding and leads to a loss of its cofactor activity. We have now determined the sequence of the 100 amino-terminal amino acid residues and localized the thrombin cleavage sites. Protein S contains 11 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the amino-terminal region (residues 1-36). This part of protein S is highly homologous to the corresponding parts in the other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, whereas the region between residues 45 and 75 is not at all homologous to the other clotting factors. Thrombin cleaves two peptide bonds in this part of protein S, first at arginine 70 and then at arginine 52. The peptide containing residues 53-70 is released from protein S after thrombin cleavage. The amino-terminal fragment, residues 1-52, is linked to the large carboxyl-terminal fragment by a disulfide bond, which involves cysteine 47. After residue 78, protein S is again homologous to factors IX and X and to proteins C and Z, but not to prothrombin. Position 95 is occupied by a beta-hydroxyaspartic acid residue."
https://openalex.org/W1506884783,"A preparation of purified erythrocyte membrane ATPase whose activation by Ca2+ is or is not dependent on calmodulin depending on the enzyme dilution was used in the low dilution state for these studies. In appropriate conditions, the purified ATPase in the absence of calmodulin exhibited a Ca2+ concentration dependence identical to that of the native enzyme in the erythrocyte membrane ghost in the presence of calmodulin. Accordingly, an apparent Kd approximately equal to 1 X 10(-7) M was derived for cooperative calcium binding to the activating and transport sites of the nonphosphorylated enzyme. The kinetics of enzyme phosphorylation in the transient state following addition of ATP to enzyme activated with calcium were then resolved by rapid kinetic methods, demonstrating directly that phosphoenzyme formation precedes Pi production, consistent with the phosphoenzyme role as an intermediate in the catalytic cycle. Titration of a low affinity site (Kd approximately equal to 2 X 10(-3) M) with calcium produced inhibition of phosphoenzyme cleavage and favored reversal of the catalytic cycle, indicating that calcium dissociation from the transport sites precedes hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoenzyme. The two different calcium dissociation constants of the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme demonstrate that a phosphorylation-induced reduction of calcium affinity is the basic coupling mechanism of catalysis and active transport, with an energy expenditure of approximately 6 kcal/mol of calcium in standard conditions. From the kinetic point of view, a rate-limiting step is identified with the slow dissociation of calcium from the phosphoenzyme; another relatively slow step following hydrolytic cleavage and preceding recycling of the enzyme is suggested by the occurrence of a presteady state phosphoenzyme overshoot."
https://openalex.org/W1512590369,"Incubation of HTC rat hepatoma cells with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone rapidly inhibits plasminogen activator (PA) activity secondary to the induction of a specific acid-stable inhibitor of plasminogen activation (Cwikel, B. J., Barouski-Miller, P.A., Coleman, P.L., and Gelehrter, T.D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6847-6851). We have further characterized this inhibitor with respect to its interaction with both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, and its protease specificity. The HTC PA inhibitor rapidly inhibits urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator with an apparent second-order rate constant of 3-5 x 10(7) M-1 X s-1. The inhibitor forms stable covalent complexes with both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, with which plasmin, trypsin, and factor Xa apparently do not compete. Complex formation is saturable and requires the active site of the PA. The mass of the inhibitor-PA complex is 50,000 daltons greater than that of PA alone, consistent with an Mr for the PA inhibitor of 50,000 as demonstrated directly by reverse fibrin autography. The HTC PA inhibitor does not inhibit thrombin and differs in its kinetic and biochemical properties from protease nexin."
https://openalex.org/W1570934020,"The human complement C3b/C4b receptor (CR1), a single chain membrane glycoprotein of Mr approximately 200,000, has several cell-specific Mr variations as well as an allelic variation involving four phenotypes whose Mr values span a range of 90,000. We investigated the role of glycosylation in these structural variations and in receptor metabolism. In the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cell line differentiated toward granulocytes or monocytes and in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines of the common phenotype, CR1 is synthesized as a precursor of Mr = 222,000 that is converted into mature CR1s with differing Mr values. Endoglycosidase F treatment of mature CR1 from all these cell types produced the same lower Mr band. Additionally, the previously noted 5,000 higher Mr of CR1 from human peripheral granulocytes versus erythrocytes was abrogated by endoglycosidase F. Hence these cell-specific variations are due to differences in N-glycosylation. Lectin affinity chromatography shows that these N-linked oligosaccharides are mostly tri- and tetraantennary complex-type species with specific differences in fractionation patterns that correlate with their differing Mrs. In lymphoblastoid cell lines, the four allelic variants each have a precursor 6,000 lower in Mr than the respective mature CR1. In the presence of tunicamycin, each of the CR1 allelic products is 25,000 lower in Mr than the glycosylated receptor. The failure to radiolabel CR1 with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of tunicamycin indicates the lack of O-linked oligosaccharide on CR1. These data, taken together, strongly suggest that the CR1 polymorphism resides at the polypeptide level. Nonglycosylated CR1 synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin had twice the turnover rate of glycosylated CR1. The efficiency of surface membrane insertion and of ligand binding to hemolytically inactive C3 were markedly reduced for nonglycosylated CR1, suggesting that glycosylation is important for the proper expression of CR1 function."

After thrombin cleavage the NH2-terminal region containing gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) is linked to the large COOH-terminal fragment by a disulfide bond. Measurements of the rate of disulfide bond reduction by thioredoxin in intact protein S showed that the disulfide bonds are largely inaccessible to thioredoxin in the presence of Ca2+ ions, whereas in the presence of EDTA apparently all of the disulfide bonds are rapidly reduced. Probing the reactivity of the disulfide bonds in thrombin-modified proteins indicated that the thrombin cleavage induces a conformational change in the protein. After thrombin cleavage of protein S, the domain containing gamma-carboxyglutamic acid could be removed by selective reduction with thioredoxin followed by alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups. Ca2+ ion binding was compared in intact protein S, thrombin-modified protein S, and Gla domainless protein S. The intact protein S bound several Ca2+ ions, and the binding was not saturable. Thrombin-modified protein S, whether intact or with the Gla domain removed by selective reduction, bound two to three Ca2+ ions with a KD of 15-20 microM. The Gla domain in thrombin-modified protein S thus does not contribute significantly to the high affinity Ca2+ ion binding. Thrombin cleavage of protein S may be of physiological importance in the regulation of blood coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W1607054551,"A hybrid gene was constructed containing a fusion between the DNA sequences encoding the secretory precursor of the yeast mating pheromone alpha-factor and a synthetic sequence encoding a biologically active 24-amino acid carboxyl-terminal portion of the human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) precursor. Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the hybrid gene resulted in the yeast cells secreting biologically active hANP into the extracellular medium. The secreted hANP was purified and found to be accurately processed at the junction in the chimeric alpha-factor/hANP protein, producing the desired mature hANP amino terminus. The secreted product was also folded correctly with respect to the single disulfide bond. However, the carboxyl terminus of the secreted hANP material was heterogeneous such that the major form lacked the last two amino acids of the peptide while the minor form was the full length material. The observed processing at the carboxyl terminus of the secreted hANP may reflect a normal processing event involved in alpha-factor peptide maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1503552203,"In the presence of ATP and the absence of Ca2+, the binding of myosin subfragment-1 to actin is only slightly inhibited by troponin-tropomyosin, while the actin-activated subfragment-1 ATPase rate is 95% inhibited (Chalovich, J. M., Chock, P. B., and Eisenberg, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 575-578). On the other hand, it has been reported the troponin-tropomyosin markedly inhibits the binding of heavy meromyosin (HMM) to actin in the presence of ATP and the absence of Ca2+, providing that the HMM has intact light chain 2 (Wagner, P. D., and Stone, D. (1982) Biochemistry 22, 1334-1342). In the present study, we reinvestigated the binding of HMM with 85% intact light chain 2, to regulated actin. If we assume that only a single population of HMM is present, the binding constant of HMM to regulated actin at 19 mM ionic strength is only about 3 times larger in the presence of Ca2+ than in the absence of Ca2+ (2.4 X 10(4) M-1 compared to 8.8 X 10(3) M-1). On the other hand, if we correct for the population of HMM with degraded light chain 2, the difference in the binding constants in the presence and absence of Ca2+ may be as great as 5-fold. A double binding experiment also suggested that HMM with intact light chain 2 binds at most 5 times more strongly to regulated actin in the presence of Ca2+ than in its absence. We conclude that, just as with subfragment-1, the primary effect of troponin-tropomyosin in regulating the acto HMM ATPase activity is to inhibit a kinetic step in the ATPase cycle. However, our data with HMM also suggest that, in addition to this primary effect, troponin-tropomyosin may modulate the binding of the cross-bridge to actin in relaxed muscle to a small extent."
https://openalex.org/W1986807337,"Suppressor cells specific for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were induced in a population of lymphocytes previously sensitized to AChR, obtained from rats with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG). The lymphocytes were cultured with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A plus purified AChR for 7 days. These cells, when mixed with lymphocytes from rats with EAMG in vitro, strongly suppressed the antibody response to AChR. They did not inhibit antibody responses to an unrelated antigen, an indication that suppression was specific for AChR. This approach should be a useful way to induce specific suppressor cells from sensitized populations of lymphocytes and may be applicable in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis."
https://openalex.org/W1544015573,"A new adenine nucleotide analog, [3H]pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (PLP-AMP), has been synthesized. The effectiveness of PLP-AMP as an affinity probe has been tested using a number of nucleotide-binding enzymes. In comparison to reaction with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, PLP-AMP binds more tightly and exhibits greater specificity of labeling for most enzymes tested. PLP-AMP is a very potent inhibitor of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, with complete inhibition obtained upon incorporation of 1 mol of reagent/mol of catalytic subunit. The reagent is also a potent inhibitor of yeast hexokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase. When modified in the absence of substrates, these enzymes require 2 mol of reagent/mol of active site for complete inhibition. However, when modified in the presence of sugar substrates, this stoichiometry decreases to 1.1 for the hexokinase-glucose complex and 1.4 for the phosphoglycerate kinase . 3-phosphoglycerate complex. The most potent inhibition by PLP-AMP was observed with rabbit muscle adenylate kinase. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at a concentration of approximately 1 microM. In contrast to these examples, PLP-AMP, as well as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, fails to act as a potent or specific inhibitor of beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATP-ase. The high specificity of labeling and the ability of nucleotide substrates to decrease the rate of inactivation of the kinases and dehydrogenase are consistent with the modification of active site residues. The complete reversibility of both modification and inactivation in the absence of reduction by NaBH4 and the absorption spectra of modified enzymes prior to and following reduction indicate reaction with lysyl residues. We conclude that PLP-AMP holds considerable promise as an affinity label for exploring the structure and mechanism of nucleotide-binding enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1520273710,"Active Ca2+ transport and passive release were characterized in crude and purified human platelet membranes to facilitate comparison with skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Endoplasmic reticulum markers were enriched from 3- to 14-fold in the purified membranes, while surface membrane antigens were reduced 4-fold and mitochondrial contamination was completely eliminated. The pH optimum for active Ca2+ transport in platelet membranes was 7.6, and the optimum for Ca2+-ATPase activity ranged from 7.6 to 8.0. Upon addition of MgATP there was a burst in active Ca2+ transport activity. In the absence of phosphate, steady state was reached within 20 s; added phosphate promoted continued uptake for greater than 1 h. The maximum pump stoichiometry was 2.0 Ca2+/ATP. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 caused rapid release of 90% of the sequestered Ca2+ in the presence of phosphate. The dependence of Ca2+ transport on MgATP was biphasic with apparent Km values of 0.6 mM and 9.5 microM. Kinetic measurements with varied external Ca2+ yielded a single Km of 0.1 microM. Mg2+ stimulated Ca2+ transport and Ca2+-ATPase activities. Results with crude and purified membranes were similar, and comparison with the Ca2+ pump from sarcoplasmic reticulum revealed nearly identical enzymatic properties. In contrast to the results of comparing active Ca2+ transport, the characteristics of Ca2+ release from platelet membranes were quite different from those of sarcoplasmic reticulum. External Ca2+ did not promote release of sequestered Ca2+ from platelet membranes in contrast to sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, spontaneous release of Ca2+ from platelet membranes did not occur after ATP depletion. Inositol trisphosphate induced rapid partial release of Ca2+ from platelet membranes but had no effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum under identical conditions. Thus active Ca2+ transport is quite similar in internal membranes of platelet and skeletal muscle, but the mechanism of Ca2+ release appears to be entirely different."
https://openalex.org/W1485256882,"The disulfide reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT) and the sulfhydryl-modifying reagents p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were employed to assess the role of disulfide and sulfhydryl groups in organic cation transport. The transport of N1-[3H]methylnicotinamide (NMN), a prototypic organic cation, was examined employing brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from the outer cortex of canine kidneys. DTT inhibited NMN transport reversibly with an IC50 of 250 microM/mg of protein. 5 mM NMN protected against DTT inactivation. The specificity of substrate protection was demonstrated by showing that D-glucose had no effect on the DTT inactivation of NMN transport and conversely that NMN had no effect on the DTT inactivation of D-glucose transport. Disulfide bonds reduced by DTT could be reoxidized by washing with excess buffer or by addition of 0.02% H2O2 thereby restoring NMN transport. p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid reversibly inactivated NMN transport with an IC50 of 25 microM/mg of protein. 5mM NMN protected against inactivation. NEM irreversibly inactivated transport with an IC50 of 250 microM/mg of protein. The rate of NMN inactivation by NEM followed pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. A replot of the data gave a linear relationship between the apparent rate constants and the NEM concentration with a slope of 1.3. The data are consistent with a simple bimolecular reaction mechanism and imply that one molecule of NEM inactivates 1 sulfhydryl group/active transport unit. The presence of 5 mM NMN affected the rate of NEM (2.5 mM) inactivation: the t1/2 values for inactivation in the presence and absence of substrate were 7.3 and 2.0 min, respectively. The results demonstrate an essential requirement for disulfide and sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1525184673,"The vanadate-sensitive ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis, purified to homogeneity, was reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles in a functional state. Freeze-fracture electron micrographs revealed a relatively uniform population of unilamellar liposomes of 50-100 nm in diameter, with particles protruding from both fracture faces. Transport studies with 42K+ and with a K+-selective electrode showed that the ATP-ase catalyzes electrogenic potassium extrusion in proteoliposomes. The following parameters for potassium transport in the reconstituted system were determined: K+/ATP stoichiometry = 1, Km for potassium = 1.4 mM, Vmax = 0.1 mumol/min/mg. The ATPase could be activated by an electrical membrane potential, vesicle interior positive. This ATPase thus appears to function as a potential regulated, ATP-driven pump that serves in electrogenic potassium accumulation by the bacterial cell."
https://openalex.org/W1625955552,"The decomposition of 32P phosphorylated enzyme intermediate formed by incubation of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase with [gamma-32P]ATP was studied following dilution of the reaction medium with a large excess of nonradioactive ATP. The phosphoenzyme decomposition includes two kinetic components. The fraction of intermediate undergoing slower decomposition is minimal in the presence of low (microM) Ca2+ and maximal in the presence of high (mM) Ca2+. A large fraction of phosphoenzyme undergoes slow decomposition when the Ca2+ concentration is high inside the vesicles, even if the Ca2+ concentration in the medium outside the vesicles is low. Parallel measurements of ATPase steady state velocity in the same experimental conditions indicate that the apparent rate constant for the slow component of phosphoenzyme decomposition is inadequate to account for the steady state ATPase velocity observed under the same conditions and cannot be the rate-limiting step in a single, obligatory pathway of the catalytic cycle. On the contrary, the steady state enzyme velocity at various Ca2+ concentrations is accounted for by the simultaneous contribution of both phosphoenzyme fractions undergoing fast and slow decomposition. Contrary to its slow rate of decomposition in the forward direction of the cycle, the phosphoenzyme pool formed in the presence of high Ca2+ reacts rapidly with ADP to form ATP in the reverse direction of the cycle. Detailed analysis of these experimental observations is consistent with a branched pathway following phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the enzyme, whereby the phosphoenzyme undergoes an isomeric transition followed by ADP dissociation, or ADP dissociation followed by the isomeric transition. The former path is much faster and is prevalent when the intravesicular Ca2+ concentration is low. When the intravesicular Ca2+ concentration rises, a pool of phosphoenzyme is formed by reverse equilibration through the alternate path. In the absence of ADP this intermediate decays slowly in the forward direction, and in the presence of ADP it decays rapidly in the reverse direction of the cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1487181330,"Unfertilized sea urchin eggs contain a Mg2+-ATPase which shares physical and enzymatic characteristics with dynein, the enzyme which powers ciliary and flagellar movement. To further investigate the homology of the egg ATPase and axonemal dynein, ATP-binding subunits in preparations of each of the enzymes were identified using a photoaffinity probe of ATP, 8-azido-ATP (8-N3ATP), and three high molecular weight (HMW) polypeptide components of the two enzymes were compared by one-dimensional peptide mapping. Two heavy chains (A and B) of both the flagellar and egg ATPases bound [alpha-32P]8-N3ATP. The labeling of the HMW bands was specifically inhibited by ATP or ADP. Both the cytoplasmic ATPase and flagellar dynein utilized 8-N3ATP as a substrate indicating that the reagent binds to the active site. The two HMW ATP-binding polypeptides and one other HMW component of the egg ATPase were compared to flagellar dynein heavy chains by peptide mapping. Digestion of the egg versus flagellar HMW polypeptides with Staphylococcus V8 protease or alpha-chymotrypsin produced a highly similar group of peptides, and each pair of heavy chains was qualitatively estimated to be over 85% homologous. These data support the identification of the egg ATPase heavy chains as components of a cytoplasmic dynein and suggest that the HMW polypeptides form active enzymatic sites in flagellar and egg dynein which are substantially homologous."
https://openalex.org/W1580184559,"The crude actomyosin precipitate from sea urchin (Arbacia punctulata) egg extracts contains Ca2+-sensitive myosin light chain kinase activity. Activity can be further increased by exogenous calmodulin (CaM). Egg myosin light chain kinase activity is purified from total egg extract by fractionating on three different chromatographic columns: DEAE ion exchange, gel filtration on Sephacryl-300, and Affi-Gel-CaM affinity. The purified egg kinase depends totally on Ca2+ and CaM for activity. Unphosphorylated egg myosin has very little actin-activated ATPase. After phosphorylation of the phosphorylable light chain by either egg kinase or gizzard myosin light chain kinase, the actin-activated ATPase of egg myosin is enhanced several fold. However, the egg kinase bears some unique characteristics which are very different from conventional myosin light chain kinases of differentiated tissues. The purified egg kinase has a native molecular mass of 405 kDa, while on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis it shows a single subunit of 56 kDa. The affinity of egg kinase for CaM (Ka = 0.4 microM) is relatively weaker than that of the gizzard myosin light chain kinase. The egg kinase autophosphorylates in the presence of Ca2+ and CaM and has a rather broad substrate specificity. The possible relationship between this egg Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinase and the Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinases from brain and liver is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575137943,"Acanthamoeba myosin II contains two heavy chains of Mr 185,000 and two pairs of light chains of Mr 17,500 and 17,000. We now report the purification of a globular proteolytic 103-kDa subfragment of myosin II which contained a 68-kDa NH2-terminal segment of the heavy chain and one pair of intact light chains. The myosin II head fragment expressed full Ca2+-ATPase activity but its actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity had a Vmax of only 0.07 s-1 compared to 1.9 s-1 (per head) for filaments of native unphosphorylated myosin II. The head fragment had a similar KATPase to that of filaments (5 versus 4 microM) and about 75% of the head fraction could bind to F-actin in the presence of ATP with a Kbinding of 5.6 microM. The Kbinding of the head fragment may be similar to that of individual heads in the native myosin II filaments although the experimentally determined apparent Kbinding for filaments is much lower, 0.3 microM. The head fragment was covalently cross-linked to F-actin in the absence of nucleotide using the zero length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. The cross-linked actin-myosin head complex hydrolyzed MgATP at a rate equivalent to Vmax for the active dephosphorylated native myosin II. These data indicate that the isolated head fragment had intact catalytic and actin-binding domains but that it bound to F-actin in the presence of ATP in a relatively inactive conformation. When covalently cross-linked to F-actin the head fragment was apparently locked into a catalytically fully active conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1488734582,"A protein has been purified from rat liver (about 5 mg from 100 g) which inactivates rat liver phosphofructokinase-1. According to dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis the protein consists of a single peptide chain with a Mr of 19,000. The inactivation of phosphofructokinase-1 by this protein results from a dissociation of phosphofructokinase-1 into its inactive protomers (Mr = 82,000). The inactivation is dependent on zinc ions in micromolar concentration (about 1-2 microM), but is inhibited by higher concentrations (greater than 50 microM). Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as well as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibit the inactivation reaction. In addition, both compounds as well as ATP can reverse the dissociation of phosphofructokinase-1. The phosphofructokinase-1 inactivating protein has no phosphatase activity with [32P]phosphofructokinase or low molecular weight phospho-compounds and does not possess any detectable proteolytic activity. It has the same affinity for the phospho- and the dephosphoform of phosphofructokinase-1, but preincubation of phosphofructokinase-1 with this inactivating protein reduces the maximum amount of phosphate incorporated into phosphofructokinase-1 and accelerates the velocity of the dephosphorylation reaction. A direct Zn2+-dependent binding of phosphofructokinase-1 to the inactivating protein has been demonstrated in experiments with matrix-bound phosphofructokinase-1 inactivating protein."
https://openalex.org/W1575734403,"Scatchard analyses of the equilibrium binding of radiolabeled human interferon-alpha2 (huIFN-alpha2) to Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells previously exposed to subsaturating concentrations of IFN-alpha showed approximately a 50% decrease in the number of cell surface receptors and no change in the apparent dissociation constant, Kd, compared with cells not exposed to interferon. The steady state equations describing the interaction of polypeptide ligands with cell surface receptors under physiological conditions (Wiley, H.S., and Cunningham, D.D. (1981) Cell 25, 433-440) have allowed us to determine, under steady state conditions, the rate of insertion of receptors into the cell membrane, the endocytic rate constant of occupied receptors, the rate constant of turnover of unoccupied receptors, and the rate of hydrolysis of internalized ligand. Our results indicate that occupied and unoccupied interferon receptors are cleared from the cell surface at approximately the same rate. This suggests that the down-regulation of the huIFN-alpha2 receptor on Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells by huIFN-alpha2 differs from that of several other surface receptors for polypeptide hormones and growth factors analyzed on cultured cells in that the binding of huIFN-alpha2 to its receptor does not increase the rate of receptor endocytosis."

Because is regenerated as ornithine is formed, the enzyme has only a catalytic or anaplerotic role in the pathway, maintaining acetyl groups during growth. We have detected this enzyme in crude extracts of Neurospora crassa and have localized it to the mitochondria along with other ornithine biosynthetic enzymes. The enzyme is bound to the mitochondrial membrane. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 9.0 and Km values for glutamate and CoASAc of 6.3 and 1.6 mM, respectively. It is feedback-inhibited by L-arginine (I0.5 = 0.16 mM), and its specific activity is augmented 2-3-fold by arginine starvation of the mycelium. Mutants of the newly recognized arg-14 locus lack activity for the enzyme. Because these mutants are complete auxotrophs, we conclude that N-acetylglutamate synthase is an indispensible enzyme of arginine biosynthesis in N. crassa. This work completes the assignment of enzymes of the arginine pathway of N. crassa to corresponding genetic loci. The membrane localization of the enzyme suggests a novel mechanism by which feedback inhibition might occur across a semipermeable membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1600784284,"Rabbit muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase has been shown to bind gadolinium ion (Gd3+) at two high affinity Ca2+ sites (Stephens, E. M., and Grisham, C. M. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 4876-4885). Gd3+ bound at these sites exhibits an unusually long electron spin relaxation time, consistent with occlusion of these sites and reduced contact with solvent H2O. In this report, the nature of the Gd3+ sites was examined in preparations of the enzyme solubilized with the detergent C12E8. The frequency dependence of water proton relaxation in solutions containing the solubilized Ca2+-ATPase yields dipolar correlation times, tau c, for the 1H-Gd3+ interaction of 1.04 X 10(-9) s for Gd3+ bound at site 1 and 1.98 X 10(-9) s for Gd3+ bound at site 2. The correlation time itself is frequency dependent below 30 MHz, indicating that the correlation time is dominated by the electron spin relaxation time of bound Gd3+. The long values of the correlation time found in the present study are consistent with a poor accessibility of these Gd3+ sites (particularly site 2) to solvent water molecules. Analytical ultracentrifugation and molecular sieve high performance liquid chromatography indicated that the active fraction of the soluble Ca2+-ATPase was monomeric. Thus occlusion of the Ca2+ sites in this enzyme is largely dependent on the tertiary structure of the monomeric ATPase and does not appear to depend on multimeric membrane structures."
https://openalex.org/W1599519092,"Abstract The aggregation of the membrane-bound calcium ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum has been studied by resonance energy transfer. The temperature dependence of resonance energy transfer from a fluorescent membrane lipid donor to an acceptor covalently linked to the Ca2+ ATPase was observed for the native sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and for purified protein reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The efficiency of energy transfer in these systems increases as the size of protein aggregates decrease. This is due to the increased exposure of the protein in the lipid domain that results in the shortening of distances between donors and acceptors. The degree of aggregation was observed to decrease with increasing temperature. Aggregates rea h a limiting size at low temperature (5 degrees C) but not a high temperatures (45 degrees C). For the reconstituted system, the aggregate size showed a continuous, smooth decrease with increasing temperature. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles showed a decrease in aggregation except for a region from 20 to 30 degrees C in which no change occurred. Arrhenius plots of the calcium transport activities for both systems do not reflect these differences, but instead show similar discontinuities and activation energies. A theoretical model is used to analyze the resonance energy transfer results for the reconstituted vesicles. The average radius of the ATPase aggregate is obtained from this analysis. The limiting, low temperature value of the aggregate radius is consistent with the formation of a tetramer. This structure breaks down to smaller, functional units at higher temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1549654983,"To clarify the characteristics of myosin isozymes in the atrium, we fractionated two isoforms of myosin heavy chain (HC), atrial HC alpha (A-HC alpha) and HC beta (A-HC beta), from the canine heart by affinity chromatography, using monoclonal antibodies specific for HC alpha (CMA19) and HC beta (HMC50), respectively, and then compared their peptide composition and enzymatic properties with those of ventricular HC alpha (V-HC alpha) and HC beta (V-HC beta). The reactivity of these isozymes with three monoclonal antibodies revealed that there are at least three different epitopes between A-HC alpha and A-HC beta. Differences in the primary structure of A-HC alpha and A-HC beta were confirmed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analyses of these peptides, produced by digestion with alpha-chymotrypsin and cyanogen bromide (CNBr). A-HC alpha and V-HC alpha were indistinguishable proteins, and A-HC beta was also very similar to V-HC beta. Furthermore, there were differences between A-HC alpha and A-HC beta in their Ca2+-activated ATPase activities. The ATPase activity of A-HC beta was lower than that of A-HC alpha and was similar to that of V-HC beta. We concluded that there are two different isozymes of myosin heavy chain in the atrium (A-HC alpha and A-HC beta), as well as in the ventricle (V-HC alpha and V-HC beta), and that A-HC beta is very similar to V-HC beta, the predominant form of ventricular myosin, in its molecular structure and enzymatic activity."
