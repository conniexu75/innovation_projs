https://openalex.org/W65617761,"Purified cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase of bovine cardiac muscles catalyzes the incorporation of 2 mol of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP to seryl residues in its cAMP-binding protein. The reaction appears to be catalyzed by the protein kinase itself rather than by a protein kinase kinase and is enhanced by cAMP and by the addition of polyarginine. Phosphorylation of the purified enzyme facilitates its dissociation by cAMP (Erlichman, J., Rosenfeld, R., and Rosen, O.M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5000-5003) but does not affect cAMP binding. At equilibrium, 2 mol of cAMP are bound to both the phospho- and dephospho-enzymes. Phosphorylation of protein kinase is reversible. Upon addition of ADP and Mg2+, phosphate is transferred from the protein to ADP, and ATP is formed. The reverse reaction is optimal at pH 5.5 unlike the forward reaction which has a broad, more alkaline pH activity optimum. It is activated by polyarginine and dependent upon the addition of cAMP to a much greater degree than the forward reaction. The data suggest that the catalytic subunit of protein kinase catalyzes the forward and reverse reactions but do not exclude the possibility that the holoenzyme may also be active. Autophosphorylation by protein kinase and dephosphorylation by phosphrprotein phosphatases of by reverals of the autophosphorylation reaction may regulate the sensitivity of certain protein kinases to activation by cAMP in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1571275312,"The PII regulatory protein of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase exists in two interconvertible forms: a uridylylated form (PIID) which promotes the deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase and an unmodified form (PIIA) which promotes the adenylylation of glutamine synthetase (Mangum, J.H., Magni, G., and Stadtman, E.R. (1973) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 158, 514-525). PII has been purified to homogeneity. Its molecular weight is 44,000. The protein is composed of four subunits, each with a molecular weight of approximately 11,000. The subunits are identical as judged by: (a) the homogeneity of the subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate, 8 M urea, and 6 M guanidine HCl; (b) the minimal molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition; and (c) the isolation of only two tryptic peptides containing tyrosine (there are 8 tyrosyl residues per 44,000 molecular species). Following iodination of PIIA and PIID with 125I in the presence of chloramine-T, tryptic digestion yields two radioactive peptides from PIIA and only one from PIID. Since a tyrosine with a substituted hydroxyl group cannot be iodinated, this result indicates that 1 tyrosyl residue in each subunit is modified by the covalent attachment of UMP. This conclusion is supported also by the fact that treatment of PIID with snake venom phosphodiesterase results in the release of covalently bound UMP and the stoichiometric appearance of phenolate ion (pH 13) as measured by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. The enzyme activities (uridylyl-removing) responsible for removal and (uridylytransferase) responsible for attachment of UMP to PII have been partially purified. These activities co-purify through a variety of procedures, including hydrophobic chromatography, and are stabilized by high ionic strength buffers. Whereas Mn2+ alone supports only uridylyl-removing activity, ATP, alpha-ketoglutarate, and Mg2+ support both uridylyl-removing and uridylyltransferase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1639569895,"1. A highly stable ATPase (TF1) was purified to a monodispersed state from the membranes of a thermophilic bacterium PS3. Its molecular weight was 380,000, and it was composed of five subunits alpha, beta, gamma, sigma', and sigma with molecular weights of 56,000, 53,000, 32,000, 15,500, and 11,000, respectively. 2. TF1 was stable against dissociating agents such as 5.5 M urea and 4.0 M LiCl, organic solvents, such as 60% acetone, heavy metals, and detergents. Low concentrations of all these agents stimulated its activity at 60 degrees. 3. TF1 was not cold-labile and showed a maximal activity at 70 degrees. Its CD spectrum revealed that its conformation changed between 81 and 96 degrees, and that its contents of alpha helices and beta structures were 27.3 and 12.8%, respectively, at 75 degrees. 4. TF1 was completely dissociated by treatment with dodecyl sulfate at 60 degrees and then with 7.1 M urea. The dissociated TF1 was reconstituted by treatment with Dowex 1-X2, and then dialysis. 5. [3H]Acetyl-TF1 bound to TF1-depleted membranes. TF1 only catalyzed 32Pi-ATP exchange and showed sensitivity to inhibitors of energy transfer when bound to the membranes. 6. A hydrophobic membrance component (TFo) was isolated which rendered TF1 sensitive to inhibitors of energy transfer. It was composed of three subunits (with molecular weights of 19,000, 13,500, and 5,400) and P-lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1505156979,"A simple procedure has been devised to isolate beta-galactosidase from jack bean meal. The final preparation gives one major protein banc in disc gel electrophoresis. The substrate specificity of this enzyme toward some natural oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and sphingoglycolipids has been examined in detail. Among three isomers of N-acetyllactosamine, Galbeta1leads to4GlcNAc; while Galbeta1leads to3GlcNAc was hydrolyzed very slowly. This property can be used to distinguish the galactose linkage in asialo-GM1 (Galbeta1leads to3GalNAcbeta1leads to4Galbeta1leads to4Glcleads toCer) and that in lacto-N-neotetraosylceramide (Galbeta1leads to4GlcNAcbeta1leads to 3Galbeta1leads to4Glcleads toCer). For hydrolyzing glycolipids, the effect of sodium taurodeoxycholate and sodium taurochenodeoxycholate on the rate of hydrolysis was carefully examined. This enzyme hydrolyzes lactosylceramide and asialo-GM1 faster than GM1. These results suggest that in addition to the type and linkage of the penultimate sugar unit, the sugar unit at the distal position of the saccharide chain also affects the hydrolysis rate. It also readily liberates 80% D-galactosyl units from asialo alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase on the other hand cannot hydrolyze asialo-alpha1-acid glycoprotein, lactosylceramide, GM1, asialo-GM1, and lacto-N-neotetraosylceramide. The molecular weight of this enzyme is about 75,000 and the isoelectric point is pH 8.0. With p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside as substrate, optimal activity occurs at pH 2.8 with glycine-HCl buffer and at pH 3.5 with citrate-phosphate buffer. With lactose as substrate, the pH optimum in these two buffers are 2.8 and 4.0, respectively. Km values for p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside, o-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside and lactose are 0.51 mM, 0.63 mM, and 12.23 mM, respectively. Many inhibitors for this enzyme including inorganic ions, monosaccharides, and glycosides are investigated. In contrast to E. coli beta-galactosidase, jack bean beta-galactosidase is not inhibited by p-aminophenyl thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside."
https://openalex.org/W1603897676,"Human liver alpha-L-fucosidase has been purified 6300-fold to apparent homogeneity with 66% yield by a two-step affinity chromatographic procedure utilizing agarose epsilon-aminocaproyl-fucosamine. Isoelectric focusing revealed that all six isoelectric forms of the enzyme were purified. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified alpha-L-fucosidase demonstrated the presence of six bands of protein which all contained fucosidase activity. The purified enzyme preparation was found to contain only trace amounts of seven glycosidases. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed on the purified fucosidase. Preliminary carbohydrate analysis indicated that only about 1% of the molecule is carbohydrate. Gel filtration on Sepharose 4B indicated an approximate molecular weight for alpha-L-fucosidase of 175,000 +/- 18,000. High speed sedimentation equilibrium yielded a molecular weight of 230,000 +/- 10,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels indicated the presence of a single subunit of molecular weight, 50,100 +/- 2,500. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 4.6 with a suggested second optimum of 6.5. Apparent Michaelis constants and maximal velocities were determined on the purified enzyme with respect to the 4-methylumbelliferyl and the p-nitrophenyl substrates and were found to be 0.22 mM and 14.1 mumol/mg of protein/min and 0.43 mM and 19.6 mumol/mg of protein/min, respectively. Several salts had little or no effect on fucosidase activity although Ag+ and Hg2+ completely inactivated the enzyme. Antibodies made against the purified fucosidase were dound to be monospecific against crude human liver supernatant fluids and the pure antigen. No cross-reacting material was detected in the crude liver supernatant fluid from a patient who died with fucosidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1493963818,"Oxidation of methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol by the microsomal fraction of rat liver homogenate is described. This microsomal alcohol-oxidizing system is dependent on NADPH and molecular oxygen and is partially inhibited by CO, features which are common for microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes. The activity of the microsomal alcohol-oxidizing system could be dissociated from the alcohol peroxidation via catalase-H2O2 by differences in substrate specificity, since higher aliphatic alcohols react only with the microsomal system, but not with catalase-H2O2. Following solubilization of microsomes by ultrasonication and treatment with deoxycholate, the activity of the microsomal alcohol-oxidizing system was separated from contaminating catalase by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, ruling out an obligatory involvement of catalase-H2O2 in the activity of the NADPH-dependent microsomal alcohol-oxidizing system. In intact hepatic microsomes, the catalase inhibitor sodium azide slightly decreased the oxidation of methanol and ethanol, but not that of propanol and butanol, indicating a facultative role of contaminating catalase in the microsomal oxidation of lower aliphatic alcohols only. It is suggested that the microsomal alcohol-oxidizing system accounts, at least in part, for that fraction of hepatic alcohol metabolism which is independent of the pathway involving alcohol dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1490494517,"The activity of 5alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, has been assessed in cell-free extracts of fibroblasts grown from foreskin, labia majora, scrotum, and nongenital skin from control subjects, from patients with developmental defects of the urogenital system, drom two subjects with the type 2 form of familial incomplete male pseudohermaphroditism and from individuals with other forms of hereditary male pseudohermaphoditism. Enzyme activity was shown to be maximal in the pH range of 5 to 6. Substrate specificity studies indicated that the enzyme so assayed is the 5alpha-reductase previously characterized in human foreskin. The activity of the enzyme was low in normal fibroblasts grown from nongenital skin and high in most fibroblasts grown from genital skin. 5alpha-Reductase activity in extracts of foreskin fibroblasts from two subjects with the type 2 disorder was undetectable at pH 5.5. Activity in comparable fibroblast extracts from most patients with other forms of hereditary male pseudohermaphroditism was easily measurable."

https://openalex.org/W1549139718,"We have previously demonstrated the existence of two types of endopeptidase in Escherichia coli. A purification procedure is described for one of these, designated protease II. It has been purified about 13,500-fold with a recovery of 24%. The isolated enzyme appears homogeneous by electrophoresis and gel filtration. Its molecular weight is estimated by three different methods to be about 58,000. Its optimal pH is around 8. Protease II activity is unaffected by chelating agents and sulfhydryl reagents. Amidase and proteolytic activities are stimulated by calcium ion, which decreases the enzyme stability. Like pancreatic trypsin, this endopeptidase catalyses the hydrolysis of alpha-amino-substituted lysine and arginine esters. It appears distinct from the previously isolated protease I, which is a chymotrypsin-like enzyme. The apparent Michaelis constant for hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester is 4.7 X 10(-4) M. The esterase activity is inhibited by diisopryopylphosphorofluoridate (Ki(app) equals 2.7 X 10(-3) M) and tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone (Ki(app) equals 1.8 X 10(-5) M), indicating that serine and histidine residues may be present in the active site. However, protease II is insensitive to phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and several natural trypsin inhibitors. Its amidase and esterase activities are competitively inhibited by free arginine and aromatic amidines. The proteolytic activity measured on axocasein is very low. In contrast to trypsin, protease II is without effect on native beta-galactosidase. It easily degrades aspartokinase I and III. Nevertheless both enzymes are resistant to proteolysis in the presence of their respective allosteric effectors. These results provide further evidence that such differences in protease susceptibility can be related to the conformational state of the substrate. The possible implication of structural changes in the mechanism of preferential proteolysis in vivo, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1576292254,"A new ribonuclease has been isolated from Escherichia coli. The enzyme is present in the 100,000 times g supernatant fraction and has been purified over 200-fold. Studies of the enzyme reveal that: 1. The enzyme shows a marked preference for oligoribonucleotides; indeed, the reaction rate is inversely proportional to the chain length of the substrate. The enzyme does not attack polynucleotides even at high concentrations of enzyme and has no detectable DNase activity. 2. The enzyme is stimulated strongly by Mn2+, less strongly by Mg2+, and not at all by Ca2+ and monovalent cations. 3. The enzyme is purified free of RNase I, RNase II, RNase III, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and other known ribonucleases of E. coli. The enzyme displays identical properties when isolated from mutants of E. coli that are deficient in the above ribonucleases. 4. The enzyme has a marked thermostability, a point of further distinction from RNase II."
https://openalex.org/W1679358535,"The reactions of purified, homogeneous bovine testicular hyaluronidase have been studied with radioactively labeled oligomers of hyalobiuronic acid, (GlcUA-GlcNAc)n, as substrates and acceptors. Transglycosylation occurs by transfer of a glycosyl residue with retention of configuration from a leaving group to an acceptor. On the basis of detailed examination of cleavage and transglycosylation patterns for the trimer; comparison of trimer, tetramer, and polymer as substrates; comparison of acceptors; equilibrium binding; and other data, it is proposed that the enzyme's active site consists of five subsites for hyalobiuronate residues. In the terminology of Schechter, I., and Berger, A. ((1966) Biochemistry 5, 3371), these are s2-s1-s' 2-s3, where the reducing terminus is to the right, and cleavage occurs between s1 and s' 1. It is proposed that subsite s'2 has a high affinity for a substrate residue, while s1 and s'1 have low substrate affinity, and s2 and s' 3 are intermediate in affinity. This proposal is seen to have mechanistic implications. The reactions of several substrates show similar bell-shaped pH dependences, with optima in the region of pH 5 to 5.5."

https://openalex.org/W1569267297,"The energy-dependent uptake of calcium by inverted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli was investigated. Methods for preparation and storage of the vesicles were devised to allow for the maximal activity and stability of the calcium transport system. The pH and temperature optima for the reaction were observed to occur at pH 8.0 AND 30 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. The eft was found that the extent of the reaction depended on the presence of phosphate or oxalate. Phosphate was found to enter the vesicles at a rate slower than that of calcium. A Ca2+:Pi ratio of approximately 1.5 was found, suggesting formation of Ca3(PO4)2. Monovalent cations stimulated calcium uptake, with the order of effectiveness being K+ is greater than Na+ is greater than Li+ is greater than NH4+. Inhibition was found with certain divalent cations, but these also inhibited the electron transport chain. Of the divalent cations examined only Mg2+ and Sr2+ inhibited calcium transport without a corresponding inhibition of respiration. Calcium transport exhibited biphasic Kinetics, with a low affinity system and a high affinity system. The low affinity system showed a Km of 0.34 mM and a Vmax of 85 nmol/min/mg of protein. The kinetic constants of the high affinity system were 4.5 muM and 2 nmol/min/mg of protein. The energy for calcium transport could be derived from the electron transport chain by oxidation of NADH, D-lactate, and succinate, in order of their effectiveness. Respiration-driven calcium transport was inhibited by inhibitors of the electron transport chain and by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. ATP could also be used to supply enerty for calcium transport. The ATP-driven reaction was inhibited by inhibitors of the Mg2+ATPase and by an antiserum prepared against that protein, demonstrating that that enzyme is involved in the utilization of ATP for active transport in inverted vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1516120784,"5-Oxo-L-prolinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 5-oxo-L-proline (L-pyroglutamate; L-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate) to L-glutamate coupled with the cleavage of ATP to ADP and Pi, has been purified about 1600-fold from rat kidney. Purification was carried out in the presence of 5-oxo-L-proline which protects the enzyme under a variety of conditions. An estimate of the molecular weight (about 325,000) was made by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. K+ (or NH4+) and Mg2+ were required for activity. GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP were much less active than ATP; dATP was 43% as active as ATP. ADP inhibited and addition of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate activated the reaction. The enzyme, which is protected during storage by dithiothreitol, is inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodoacetamide. The apparent Km values for 5-oxo-L-proline and ATP are, respectively, 0.05 and 0.17 mM. The pH profile indicates a broad range of activity from about pH 5.5 to pH 11.2 with apparent maxima at about pH 7 and pH 9.7. The formation of Pi and glutamate was equimolar over a wide pH range. When the enzyme was incubated with ATP, Mg2+, K+, and L-2-imidazolidone-4-carboxylate or L-dihydroorotate, cleavage of ATP to ADP and Pi occurred, but no cleavage of the imino acid substrates was observed; when the enzyme was incubated under these conditions with 2-piperidone-6-carboxylate, 4-oxy-5-oxoproline, and 3-oxy-5-oxoproline, the corresponding dicarboxylic amino acids were formed, but the molar ratio of Pi to amino acid formation was significantly greater than unity."
https://openalex.org/W1579057416,"The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acyltransferase, the first enzyme of membrane phospholipid synthesis in Escherichia coli, was investigated in a wild type and a mutant strain defective in this activity. The mutant strain, selected as a glycerol-P auxotroph, was previously shown to contain a glycerol-P acyltransferase activity with an apparent Km for glycerol-P 10 times higher than that of its parent or revertants. The membranous mutant glycerol-P acyltransferase but did not appear to be thermolabile in vivo. Revertants no longer requiring glycerol-P for growth, showed glycerol-P acyltransferase activity with thermolability properties similar to the wild type. The second phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme, 1-acylglycerol-P acyltransferase, was not thermolabile in membranes containing a thermolabile glycerol-P acyltransferase activity. The pH optimum for the mutant acyltransferase was over 1 pH unit higher than that of the parental activity. Further, the mutant and wild type glycerol-P acyltransferase differed in their response to magnesium chloride and potassium chloride. The palmitoyl-CoA dependence of the wild type and mutant glycerol-P acyltransferase activities were different. The mutant glycerol-P acyltransferase activity was inhibited greater than 90% by Triton X-100 under conditions where the wild type activity was not affected. These experiments provide novel information about the wild type glycerol-P acyltransferase activity of E. coli and provide six additional lines of evidence for the mutant character of the glycerol-P acyltransferase in the mutant strains."
https://openalex.org/W1553340893,"Porcine muscle adenylate kinase with a molecular weight of 22,000 has 2 histidine, 5 phenylalanine, 7 tyrosine, and no tryptophan residues. The effect of pH, substrate, and the paramagnetic manganous ion on the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the enzyme, particularly the aromatic region, has been investigated at 220 MHz. The well resolved C2 proton peaks of the 2 histidine residues have been individually assigned to His-36 and His-189 by comparison with the spectrum of the carp muscle enzyme which has only one C2 proton peak and only 1 histidine residue, 36. The chemical shift of the peak designated C2-H of His-36 in the porcine enzyme has a normal titration curve with a pKalpha = 6.3 but the peak for His-189 is not titratable in the pH range 5.8 to 8.1. The pKalpha of the single His-36 of the carp enzyme is similar to that of His-36 of the porcine enzyme. Changes in pH, particularly at low pH, also affect the chemical shifts of the tyrosine residues. Occupation of either the monophosphate site by AMP or the triphosphate site by ATP or GTP causes a downfield shift of the C2-H of His-36, and the equilibrium mixture causes an even greater shift, but no shift in the C2-H of His-189. The substrates also induce changes in the chemical shifts in the phenylalanine-tyrosine region of the spectrum. Tentative assignments of the highest and lowest field peaks in this region have been made based on the three-dimensional structure determined by x-ray crystallography. On the basis of these assignments, it is concluded that Phe-183 is unperturbed by substrate binding but that Tyr-153 or -154 at the hinge of the molecule, are perturbed. The C2-H of adenine and C8-H of adenine or guanine of the bound substrates were also observed; those of AMP are unperturbed but C2-H of ATO is shifted downfield and the C8-H of ATP and GTP are shifted upfield. The paramagnetic manganous ion had no effect on the spectrum at Mn(II) to enzyme ratios below 1:10; above this ratio, a general broadening was observed..."
https://openalex.org/W1537137730,"An Escherichia coli B mutant, SG14, accumulates glycogen at 28% the rate observed for the parent E. coli B strain. The glycogen accumulated in the mutant is similar to the glycogen isolated from the parent strain with respect to alpha- and beta-amylosis, chain length determination, and I2-complex absorption spectra. The SG14 mutant contains normal glycogen synthase and branching enzyme activity but has an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase with altered kinetic and allosteric properties. The mutant enzyme has been partially purified and requires a 12-fold higher concentration of fructose-P2 or a 26 fold higher concentration of pyridoxal-P than the parent type enzyme for 50% of maximal allosteric activation. TPNH, an effective activator of the E. coli B enzyme, does not activate the SG14 ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Other studies show that for the SG14 enzyme the concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ in the synthesis direction and the concentrations of ADP-glucose and PPi in the pyrophosphorolysis direction required to give 50% of maximal activity are 3- to 6-fold higher than those observed for the parent E. coli B ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The Km for alpha-glucose-1-P at saturating to half-saturating concentrations of the activator, fructose-P2, are about the same for both enzymes. However, in the presence of no activator, the concentration of glucose-1-P required for half-maximal activity is about 1.8-fold higher for the SG14 enzyme. Thus SG14 ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has lower affinity for its substrates than does the parent enzyme. Previously the SG14 enzyme had been shown to be less sensitive to inhibition by 5'-AMP than the E. coli B enzyme. This ensensitivity to inhibition renders the SG14 enzyme less responsive to energy charge than the E. coli B ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. On the basis of the above results and taking into account the reported concentrations of fructose-P2, of pyridoxal-P, and of the adenine nucleotide pool and its energy charge in E. coli strains, it is concluded that furctose-P2 is the important physiological allosteric activator of E. coli ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Furthermore, the 1.7-fold increased rate of accumulation of glycogen observed when E. coli B or SG14 shifts from exponential phase to stationary phase of growth in nitrogen-limiting media can be accounted for by the 2.4-fold increase of the levels of the glycogen biosynthetic enzymes, glycogen synthase, and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Thus both allosteric regulation of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase as well as the genetic regulation of the biosynthesis of the glycogen biosynthetic enzymes are involved in the regulation of glycogen accumulation in E. coli B."
https://openalex.org/W1575696732,"Pyridoxal-P reacts specifically with a single lysine residue at the active site of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase (Greenwell, P., Jewett, S. L., and Stark, G. R. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5994-6001). Reduction of the Schiff base with sodium borohydride, succinylation of the remaining lysine residues, and digestion with trypsin result in formation of a single pyridoxyl peptide, which was purified to homogeneity after chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, treatment with alkaline phosphatase, and rechromatography. Amino acid composition and the results of limited sequential degradation showed that this peptide corresponds to residues 62 to 98 in the sequence of Konigsberg and co-workers, and contains 2 residues of lysine (Henderson, L., Roy, D., Martin, D., and Konigsberg, W., personal communication). By similar isolation, a second peptide was obtained from unsuccinylated catalytic subunit, containing only the pyridoxylated lysine, which corresponds to Lys-80. Derivatives of catalytic subunit containing an average of either one, two, or three pyridoxamine-P moieties per trimer have been prepared by reduction. These species, which retain catalytic activity in proportion to their unmodified active sites, were recombined with regulatory subunit to prepare partially modified derivatives of native aspartate transcarbamylase. At pH 8, fluorescence emission bands were observed at 340 nm, due to aromatic amino acids in the protein, and at 395 nm, due to the pyridoxamine-P moiety. Upon excitation at 280 nm energy transfer from protein to pyridoxamine-P was approximately 15%. The properties of the probe were used to study changes accompanying the binding of substrates and inhibitors. The effects of CTP and ATP were small. With the transition state analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) or the substrate carbamyl-P, two types of response were observed. Derivatives of catalytic subunit and native enzyme which contain some unmodified sites and hence retain partial catalytic activity gave large increases in fluorescence at 395 nm. However, fully modified inactive derivatives gave much smaller increases. A derivative of native enzyme containing one triply modified and one unmodified catalytic subunit behaved like the other partially modified species. These results indicate that there is communication among the active sites of different catalytic trimers in modified native enzyme, as well as among active sites within the same modified catalytic trimer. The increases in fluorescence result from a red shift of the absorption maximum of the pyridoxamine-P moiety from 315 to 325 nm, which increases the absorbance at the excitation wavelength for fluorescence. At pH 7, the absorption spectrum is already shifted and, consequently, the binding of PALA and carbamyl-P has little effect on the fluorescence. Therefore, the binding of these compounds at pH 8.0 must cause a structural change in the protein, which in turn causes protonation of a group in the modified active sites, altering the spectral properties."

This compound, 5-phosphoarabinonate, is the strongest known competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki = 3 times 10(-7) M below pH 7). A distinctive pH dependence of binding, also found for two other aldonic acid omega-phosphates, 6-phosphogluconate and 4-phosphoerythronate, involves pertubation of a pKa from 7.0 in the free enzyme to 9.0 in the enzyme-inhibitor complex. This perturbation may reflect a catalytically advantageous increase in basicity which occurs around the transition state of the normal enzymatic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1539647160,"A new binding protein named corticosteroid Binder IB elutes just after ligandin in DEAE-Sephadex chromatograms. It has been partially purified to about 2500-fold over cytosol proteins. Calculation of the number of steroid binding sites, assuming one site per molecule of Binder IB fraction after DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, suggests a concentration of the binding protein of about 0.0004% of cytosol proteins. Its pI value is judged to be 7.5 to 8 from it elution position on DEAE-Sephadex chromatograms. IB has an apparent molecular weight of 30,500 +/- 10% by gel filtration and a Stokes radius of 20 A. Binder IB binds radioactive dexamethasone, cortisol, and corticosterone in vitro with estimated KD values of 1, 13, and 25 nM, respectively. Saturation curves are abnormal, showing two phases. The saturation curves within the physiological range of concentrations of steroid are abnormal and suggestive of cooperativity. The second phase, at concentrations of glucocortidoids above saturation and physiological levels, shows extensive binding. After fractionation from other steroid binding proteins, the specificity of binding from competition studies in vitro is dexamethasone greater than or equal to cortisol = corticosterone = estradiol-17beta greater than or equal to deoxycorticosterone = dihydrotestosterone greater than aldosterone = cortexolone greater than testosterone. Other steroids tested are less efficient ligands. The binding is probably noncovalent, but strong; and the complex becomes more dissociable as purification proceeds, suggesting a conformational change in the protein. Storage and rebinding with steroid are possible throughout the purification process, although extensive ligand dissociation and denaturation of the protein occur after the final purification step. Binding in vitro is temperature-sensitive and binding is sharply pH dependent with an optimum at 7.5. The ligand is the unmetabolized steroid as judged by extraction of steroid-IB complex with methylene chloride and subsequent thin layer chromatography. The physiological function of this protein is unknown at present and purification fo the major corticosteroid hormone receptor to homogeneity may be required before the function of Binder IB is fully understood."

The occupancy of the Co2+ site is much lower, about 0.048. Gd3+ appears to be bound at two sites, the main one 2.5 A from an oxygen atom of the Glu-35 side chain, the other 3.1 A from an oxygen atom of the Asp-52 chain. The occupancy of both Gd3+ sites is low, 0.036 and 0.016, the latter being so low that the presence of the ion at this site is in doubt. The binding site of Mn2+ in the di(N-acetylglucosamine)-lysozyme complex has also been determined. It does not differ significantly from the Mn2+ binding site in the native protein, but the occupancy is lower, 0.16."
https://openalex.org/W2104366258,"When succinate dehydrogenase contains oxalacetate in firmly bound form, activity cannof the enzyme results in dissociation of oxalacetate and activation of the enzyme. The course of reductive titrations appears the same whether or not the enzyme contains oxalacetate, and complete reduction as monitored by bleaching of chromophoric groups requires the incorporation of 6 to 7 reducing equivalents in either case. The stoichiometry is that expected from the non-heme iron and flavin content of the enzyme. Activation of the enzyme during reductive titrations occurs predominantly with the incorporation of the second pair of electrons, while determination of activation levels at various poised potentials shows that the group involved is reduced with the uptake of 2 H+ and 2 e-. These characteristics are consistent with titration of the flavin moiety rather than non-heme iron groups. Thus it appears that activation is concurrent with the reduction of flavin to the hydroquinone form. From the measured half-reduction potential for activation, that of the flavin in an oxalacetate-free enzyme has been estimated at -90 to -60 mv at pH 7."
https://openalex.org/W1499146003,"Revertants of Escherichia coli mutants defective in the first enzyme of membrane phospholipid synthesis, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acyltransferase, were investigated. These glycerol-P acyltransferase mutants, selected as glycerol-P auxotrophs, contained membranous glycerol-P acyltransferase activity with an apparent Km for glycerol-P 10 times higher than the parental activity. The glycerol-P acyltransferase activity was also more thermolabile in vitro than the parental activity. Most revertants no longer requiring glycerol-P for growth regained glycerol-P acyltransferase activity of normal thermolability and apparent Km for glycerol-P. However, two novel revertants were isolated which retained an abnormal glycerol-P acyltransferase activity. The glycerol-P dehydrogenase activities of these novel revertants were about 20-fold less sensitive to feedback inhibition by glycerol-P. The feedback-resistant glycerol-P dehydrogenase co-transduced with gpsA, the structural gene for the glycerol-P dehydrogenase. Further transduction experiments demonstrated that the feedback resistant glycerol-P dehydrogenase phenotypically suppressed the glycerol-P acyltransferase Km lesion. The existence of the class of glycerol-P auxotrophs which owe their phenotype to the glycerol-P acyltransferase Km lesion therefore depends on the feedback regulation of glycerol-P synthesis in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1541603029,"Guanylate cyclase from the rat renal medulla is found in both the soluble and particulate fractions of the cell. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration in H2O and D2O indicate that the enzyme from the soluble cell fraction has the following properties: S20w, 6.3 S; Stokes radius, 54 A; partial specific volume, 0.75 ml/g; mass, 154,000 daltons; f/fo, 1.4; axial ratio (prolate ellipsoid), 7. The addition of 0.1% Lubrol PX to this fraction activates the enzyme and changes thartial specific volume, 0.74 ml/g; mass, 148,000 daltons; f/fo, 1.6; axial ratio (prolate ellipsoid), 11. These findings show that detergent activates the enzyme by changing its conformation and not simply by dispersing nonsedimentable membrane fragments. The dimensions of this guanylate cyclase in detergent are very similar to those of detergent-solubilized adenylate cyclase from the same tissue (Neer, E.J. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6527-6531). Guanylate cyclase can be solubilized from the particulate cell fraction with 1% Lubrol PX but has properties quite different from those of the guanylate cyclase in the soluble cell fraction. It is a large aggregate with a value of S20,w of about 10 S, Stokes radius of 65 A, and a mass of approximately 300,000 daltons. However, the peaks of guanylate cyclase activity in column effluents and sucrose density gradients are very broad indicating a mixture of different size proteins. The conditions used to solubilize guanylate cyclase from the particulate fraction also solubilize adenylate cyclase, and the two activities can be separated on the same sucrose gradient. Studies of this sort require a rapid, accurate guanylate cyclase assay. We have developed an assay for guanylate cyclase activity which meets these criteria by adapting the competitive protein binding assay for guanosine cyclic 3':5' monophosphate originally described by Murad et al. (Murad, F., Manganiello, V., and Vaughn, M. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 68, 736-739)."

https://openalex.org/W1563130229,"In the course of searching for specific chromogenic substrates which might be useful in screening for protease-deficient mutants of Bacillus subtilis, we have developed a method for the synthesis of N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine thiobenzyl ester (BzTyrSBzl) in good yield. Spontaneous base hydrolysis of this thiol ester is low, but several serine proteases hydrolyze it readily. Spectrophotometric measurement of the hydrolysis of the ester in the presence of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) provides a continuous assay for chymotrypsin as sensitive as any assay reported in the literature. Serine proteases which hydrolyze this substrate may be detected in polyacrylamide disc gels by incubation in the presence of nitro blue tetrazolium. Apparent Km values of 0.02 and 7 mM and kcat values of 37 S-1 and 126 S-1 were observed for the hydrolysis of BzTyrSBzl by alpha-chymotrypsin and subtilisin BPN', respectively. Additionally, 5 mM indole was observed to behave as a strict competitive inhibitor of the alpha-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of BzTyrSBzl but was observed to increase the maximal rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate by alpha-chymotrypsin by 30%, as previously described. These data, the published data of other workers, and results from studies with molecular models of trypsin and subtilisin BPN' are used as the basis for describing more fully a secondary hydrophobic binding pocket on alpha-chymotrypsin. The pocket is immediately adjacent to the active site serine and is tentatively suggested to be composed of 4 aliphatic side chain residues and 2 glycine residues."

When partially purified chromatin is passed through a Sephadex G-200 column in the presence of 1 M NaCl, enzyme activities catalyzing the liberation of nicotinamide from NAD elute in two peaks. One, which appears in the void volume fraction, hydrolyzes the nicotinamide-ribose linkage of NAD to produce nicotinamide and ADP-ribose in stoichiometric amounts. This activity is not inhibited by 5 mM nicotinamide. The other, which elutes much later, catalyzes the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) from NAD and is completely inhibited by 5 mM nicotinamide. The former, NADase, is DNase-insensitive and thermostable, has a pH optimum of 6.5 to 7, a Km for NAD of 28 muM, and a Ki for nicotinamide of 80 mM, and hydrolyzes NADP as well as NAD. The latter, poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, is sensitive to DNase treatment and heat labile, has a pH optimum of 8 to 8.5, a Km for NAD of 250 muM and a Ki for nicotinamide of 0.5 mM and is strictly specific for NAD. Further, the former NADase is shown to lack transglycosidase activity, which has been documented to be a general property of NADases derived from animal tissues. These results indicate that the NAD-hydrolyzing enzyme newly isolated from nuclei is a novel type of mammalian NADase which catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the nicotinamide-ribose linkage of NAD."
https://openalex.org/W1591032267,"Hemoglobin Abruzzo is an abnormal human hemoglobin with a substitution at a residue known to be involved in the binding of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. It has increased oxygen affinity and reduced heme-heme interaction in the absence of organic or inorganic phosphate cofactors. In inorganic phosphate buffers the Bohr effect and heme-heme interaction are normal, but the oxygen affinity remains higher than that of hemoglobin A. CO combination in inorganic phosphate is more strongly autocatalytic than in normal hemoglobin and a slower rate of oxygen dissociation is observed. Although many of the functional differences of this variant may be attributed to the high oxygen affinity of the mutant beta chains, the interactions between subunits are also affected by the histidine to arginine substitution at beta143. Stripped hemoglobin Abruzzo appears to be significantly more dissociated than hemoglobin A. Kinetic studies indicate that interaction with organic or inorganic phosphates decreases its subunit dissociation. In all of the functional properties examined, hemoglobin Abruzzo is more sensitive to the allosteric influence of organic and inorganic anions than is hemoglobin A."
https://openalex.org/W1496057523,"The wide ligand affinity range previously observed for carp hemoglobin is bounded at both extremes by regions of constant affinity. Within these regions, pH, organic phosphates, and the extent of ligand binding have no effect on the measured affinity and the cooperativity of ligand binding is greatly reduced or absent. The rates of CO recombination to fully and partially unliganded carp hemoglobin, under various organic phosphate and pH conditions, are shown to reflect this behavior. Constant kinetic rates are seen to directly correspond to the regions of constant affinity. Therefore, these are taken to be single protein conformations, one of high and one of low ligand affinity. In the simplest view, these conformations represent the R and T states of a two-state model, and most of the properties of carp hemoglobin are explained quite well within this framework. Increases in either hydrogen or phosphate ion concentrations favor the stabilization of the low affinity structure of even fully liganded carp hemoglobin. We have studied the structural transition from high to low affinity by monitoring the absorption spectra of carp hemoglobins at constant pH as a function of organic phosphate concentration. We find that different spectra are induced in both carp methemoglobin and cyanomethemoglobin by inositol hexaphosphate addition. Furthermore, the dependence of the magnitude of the spectral changes on pH and organic phosphate concentration is the close agreement with that predicted from studies of the ligand binding properties of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1539937426,"Investigations into the nature of the axial heme ligands, the strength of the heme crevice, the reactivity with cyanide, and the ascorbate reducibility of cytochrome c1 were performed to explore structure-function relationships of cytochrome c1. The existence of an absorbance band at 690 nm, which was quenched by raising the pH with a pK of 9.2 corresponding to a low spin-low transition, suggested that a methionine residue probably functioned as one of the axial heme iron ligands in this cytochrome. Spectral titrations of cytochrome c1 in the low pH range showed a markedly elevated pK for the low spin-high spin transition relative to cytochrome c. Denaturation studies with urea, the absence of any reaction with cyanide, and the evidence from other lines would appear to indicate that the heme group of cytochrome c1 was reduced by ascorbate at approximately 5% of the rate of reduction of cytochrome c but this rate dramatically increased with increasing pH concomitant with the disappearance of the 690 nm absorbance band. Circular dichroic spectra substantiated that elevated pH produced conformational changes localized to the heme crevice and probably also the regions containing aromatic residues. The enhanced rate of ascorbate reduction was perhaps a consequence of the increased accessibility of the heme iron to ascorbate. Major unfolding of the protein in 8 M urea, however, completely abolished the ascorbate reducibility of cytochrome c1. The buried nature of the heme group of cytochrome c1 would probably preclude transfer of an electron from cytochrome c1 to cytochrome c through a direct Fe-Fe or a heme-heme interaction. This poses an important question concerning the mechanism of this electron transfer between these two cytochromes not only in mitochondria but also in solution."

More activity is observed with Mn2+ than with Mg2+, and maximal activity is observed at 0.14 mM Mn2+ and 1.4 mM Mg2+. Based on its behavior on Sephadex G-100, the molecular weight of E. coli guanylate cyclase is about 30,000.

The molecular weights of the active form and of the proenzyme were determined by electrophoresis and gel filtration to be 35,000 and 42,000, respectively. The proenzyme was more stable than the active form in alkaline solution and can be converted into the active enzyme under acidic conditions. The active form of the acidic protease can hydrolyze hemoglobin, N,N'-dimethylcasein, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-diiodotyrosine, and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-glutamyl-L-phenylalanine, but cannot hydrolyze bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosine.

https://openalex.org/W51193658,"The separate interaction of the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and a metal ion cofactor Mn2+ with neutral hexosebisphosphatase has been studied under equilibrium conditions at pH 7.5 with gel filtration and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements, respectively. Binding data for both ligands to the enzyme yielded nonlinear Scatchard plots that analyze in terms of four negatively cooperative binding sites per enzyme tetramer. Graphical estimates of the binding constants were refined by a computer searching procedure and nonlinear least squares analysis. These results are qualitatively similar to those obtained from binding studies involving teh alkaline enzyme, a modified form of hexosebisphosphatase whose pH optimum is in the alkaline pH region. Both forms of the enzyme enhance the proton relaxation rate of water protons by a factor of approximately 7 to 8 at 24 MHz, demonstrating similar metal ion environments. Teh activator Co(III)-EDTA did not affect Mn2+ binding to the neutral enzyme. In the presence of (alpha + beta)methyl-D-fructofuranoside 1,6-bisphosphate, however, two sets--each containing four Mn2+ binding sites--were observed per enzyme tetramer with loss of the negatively cooperative interaction. These results are viewed in terms of four noncatalytic and four catalytic Mn2+ binding sites. Parallel kinetic investigations were conducted on the neutral enzyme to determine specific activity as a function of Mn2+ and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration. A pro-equilibrium sequential pathway model involving Mn2+-enzyme and the Mn2+-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate complex both as substrate and as an allosteric inhibitor satisfactorily fit the kinetic observations. All possible enzyme species were computed from the determined binding constants and grouped according to the number of moles of Mn2+-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate complex bound to the Mn2+-enzyme, and individual rate constants were calculated. The testing of other models and their failure to describe the kinetic observations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1485873166,"Alkyl isocyanates are effective inactivators of guinea pig liver transglutaminase. Based on the specificity of the reaction the protection against inactivation by glutamine substrate, and the essential nature of calcium for the inactivation reaction, it is concluded that these reagents act as amide substrate analogs and, thus function in an active site-specific manner. Support for the contention that inactivation results from alkyl thiocarbamate ester formation through the single active site sulfhydryl group of the enzyme is (a) the loss of one free--SH group and the incorporation of 1 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme in the reaction, (b) similarity in chemical properties of the inactive enzyme derivative formed to those previously reported for another alkyl thiocarbamoylenzyme and an alkyl thiocarbamoylcysteine derivative, and (c) the finding that labeled peptides from digests of [methyl-14C]thiocarbamoyltransglutaminase and those from digests of iodoacetamide-inactivated enzyme occupy similar positions on peptide maps. Transglutaminase was found to be inactivated neither by urethan anlogs of its active ester substrates nor by urea analogs of its amide substrates. It is concluded on the basis of these findings that inactive carbamoylenzyme derivatives are formed only by direct addition of the transglutaminase active--SH group to the isocyanate C--N double bond, and not, like several serine active site enzymes, by nucleophilic displacement with urethan analogs of substrate, or by nucleophilic displacement with urea analogs of substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1565857415,"The stoichiometry of 4-methyl sterol oxidase has been investigated by concurrent assays of rates of oxygen consumption, oxidation of reduced pyridine nucleotide, and formation of steroid 4alpha-oic acid, which is the oxidized product of attack of 4-methyl sterol precursors of cholesterol. The basal, steroid-independent rates of oxidation of alpha-NADH and alpha-NADH-dependent oxygen consumption by rat liver microsomes are about 10 to 15% of the rates observed with beta-NADH. Thus, alpha-NADH is substituted for beta-NADH; alpha-NADH oxidation is observed spectrophotometrically. The slow rate of oxygen consumption is measured accurately with a galvanic oxygen electrode that is attached to an offset amplifier. For maximal velocity, 4alpha-hydroxymethyl-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol is the steroid substrate, and oxidase activity is induced 2-fold with a dietary bile acid sequestrant. Under these conditions, accurate measurements are obtained for substrate-dependent increments, which are equal to or greater than basal, substrate-independent rates. For each equivalent of hydroxymethyl group oxidized to carboxylic acid, 2 eq each of oxygen and alpha-NADH are consumed. Thus, the stoichiometry is consistent with that expected for two sequential attacks of the 4alpha-hydroxymethyl group by an external mixed function oxidase. In addition to establishing the stoichiometry of the 4-methyl sterol oxidase, the results further demonstrate that the steroidal 4alpha-carboxylic acid is formed from the hydroxymethyl intermediate by catalysis of a mixed function oxidase rather than dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1579058398,"In contrast to the strongly pH-dependent inhibition of phosphoglucose isomerase by substrate analogues with a free carboxyl group, inhibition of this enzyme by neutral sugar phosphates is essentially invariant between pH 7 and 9.

The unique exception is erythrose 4-phosphate whose Ki (0.7 muM, independent of pH) reflects a tightness of binding similar to that found at pH values near or below neutrality for the transition state analogue 5-phosphorarabinonate.

https://openalex.org/W1580340872,"Four titrating histidine ring C2 and C4 proton resonances are observed in 220 MHz proton NMR spectra of human metmyoglobin as a function of pH. Values of ionization constants determined from the NMR titration data using an equation describing a simple proton association-dissociation equilibrium are curves (1) 6.6, (2) 7.0, (3) 5.8, and (4) 7.4. Four histidine residues have also been found to be solvent-accessible in human metmyoglobin by carboxymethylation studies (Harris, C.M., and Hill, R.L. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 2195-2203). Two of the titration curves (3 and 4) deviate significantly from the chemical shift values normally observed for histidine C2 proton resonances. Curve 3, with a low pKa, is shifted downfield at high values of pH and also exhibits a second minor inflection with a pKa value of 8.8. On the other hand, the high pKa curve, 4, is shifted upfield at all values of pH. The characteristics of the NMR titration curves with the lowest and highest pKa values (3 and4) are very similar to curves observed previously with sperm whale and horse metmyoglobins (Cohen, J.S., Hagenmaier, H., Pollard, H., and Schechter, A.N. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 71, 513-519). These results indicate that the histidine residues from which these curves are derived have unusual and characteristic environments in this series of homologous proteins. The NMR spectra of all three metmyoglobins are changed extensively as a result of azide ion binding, indicating conformational changes affecting the environments of several imidazole side chains. The presence of azide ion causes a selective downfield chemical shift for the low pKa curve and a selective upfield chemical shift for the high pKa curve in all three proteins. Azide also abolishes the second inflection seen in the low pKa curve at high pH. In addition to these effects, the presence of azide ion permits the observation of two additional titrating proton resonances for all three metmyoglobins. Increasing the azide to protein ratio at several fixed values of pH yields results which show that a slow exchange process is occurring with each of the metmyoglobins. In the azide titration studies the maximum changes in the NMR spectra occurred at approximately equimolar concentrations. The NMR results for these proteins in the absence and presence of azide ion are related to x-ray crystallographic studies of sperm whale metmyoglobin and the known alkylation properties of the histidine residues. Tentative assignments of the titrating resonances observed are suggested."

The fluorometric titration results indicate the presence of nonequivalent binding sites in the apoprotein. A model based on two classes of independent binding sites fits the fluorometric data reasonably well. The presence of nonequivalent fluorescent sites in reduced cystathionase was also detected by nanosecond spectroscopy. In contrast to the model compound P-pyridoxyl-epsilon-lysine (tau equals 2.6 ns), the P-pyridoxyl residues of cystathionase display multiexponential fluorescence decay. Two fluorescence lifetimes (tau2 equals 4.1 ns and tau2 equals 15 ns) fit the deconvoluted decay results obtained by pulse fluorimetry.

The enzyme has a pH optimum of 10. 5 or higher. It is stabilized by dithiothereitol and inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and heavy metals (Ag+, Hg2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+), suggesting the presence of a functionally essential sulfhydryl group; pre-treatment of enzyme with NAD+ prevents inhibition by p-hydrocymercuribenzoate and heavy metals indicating that this sulfhydryl group may be near the NAD+ binding site. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for NAD+; NADP+ is an ineffective coenzyme. Several lines of evidence indicate that the same enzyme acts on both 2-keto-3-deocy-L-fuconate and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabonate; thus, the pure enzyme acts on both substrates, the two substrates have very similar kinetic parameters (Km values are: 2-keto-3-deocy-L-fuconate, 0.20 mM; 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabonate, 0.25 mM; NAD+ for either substrate, 0.22 to 0.25 mM), the two substrates show identical pH and temperature profiles and the two substrates compete for common enzyme active sites. A large number of other sugars and sugar acids, including several 2-keto-3-deoxyaldonates, were ineffective as substrates. The dehydrogenase was also found in calf, beef, lamb, mouse, and rat liver. These studies when considered together with previous studies on the metabolism of L-fucose in pork liver indicate the presence of a soluble enzyme pathway capable of converting L-fucose to 2,4(or 5)-diketo-5(or 4)-monohydroxyhexanoate; this pathway can also convert D-arabinose, and probably L-galactose, to the analogous derivatives (diketomonohydroxypentanoate and diketodihydroxyhexanoate, respectively."

Thus, the specific protection afforded by NADP and NMN, but not by 2'-monophosphoadenosine-5'-diphosphoribose, indicates that tyrosine-168 is involved in binding the nicotinamide portion of the coenzyme."

Increasing the assay pH from 6.0 to 8.0 progressively desensitizes the enzyme from both homotropic and heterotropic ligand interactions. This pH-dependent reversible transition has a pK of 6.2. Hill coefficients for the substrate L-tryptophan of 2.0 and 1.4 were measured at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0, respectively. In attempting to identify the enzymatic residue (or residues) responsible for these pH-dependent effects, the enzyme was observed to be irreversibly inactivated by photoinduced oxidation in the presence of the sensitizer, methylene blue. The photoinactivated enzyme showed a loss of one-half its Soret (405 nm) absorption which accompanied the loss of one-half its heme and histidine contents. This first order photoinduced inactivation was pH-dependent and corresponded to a requirement for a protonated species with a pK of 6.2. These results suggest that histidine residues may be involved in the catalytic function and in mediating cooperative interactions of tryptophan oxygenase. Absolute and difference sedimentation velocity analyses indicate that the molecule undergoes a conformational transition when the pH is decreased from pH 8.0 to pH 6.0. This conformational alteration, measured as a 3.9% increase in S20, w can be regarded as an equivalent decrease in the frictional coefficient. If, a more or less spherical shape to the molecule is assumed, then, the 3.9% decrease in the frictional coefficient between pH 8.0 and 6.0 corresponds to a 12% decrease in apparent hydrodynamic volume of the enzyme. Thus, protonation of an enzymatic moiety, possibly histidine, determines both the conformational and functional interactions between enzymatic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1562594164,"The tryptic maps of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from beef pancreas show that the 8 cysteinyl residues of the enzyme subunit are located, 2 by 2, on four different peptides. The kinetics of the incorporation of radioactivity from N-[ethyl-14C]ethylmaleimide into these peptides are compared in this paper with the kinetics of the changes of the catalytic properties of the enzyme occurring during alkylation. This comparison allows the identification of (a) the peptide carrying the cysteinyl residues located on the surface of the molecule, (b) the peptide carrying the deeply buried residues unmasked by the dissociation of the subunits, and (c) the peptide carrying the --SH group located in the vicinity of the binding site of tryptophan. The fourth peptide is shown to have a great sensitivity to pH with respect to the reactivity of its cysteinyl residues toward N-ethylmaleimide. The same unusual pH dependence is found for the rate of quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein during the alkylation, suggesting a strong sensitivity of the conformation of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase to pH in the range of 7 to 9."
