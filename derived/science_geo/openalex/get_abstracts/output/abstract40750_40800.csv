https://openalex.org/W2043711125,"Antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 14 amino acid residues at the COOH-terminus of a protein deduced from the human c-erbB-2 nucleotide sequence. These antibodies immunoprecipitated a 185-kilodalton glycoprotein from MKN-7 adenocarcinoma cells. Incubation of the immunoprecipitates with (gamma-32P)ATP resulted in the phosphorylation of this protein on tyrosine residues. These results indicate that the human c-erbB-2 gene product is the 185-kilodalton glycoprotein that is associated with tyrosine kinase activity. Although the c-erbB-2 protein was predicted to encode a protein very similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, EGF did not stimulate this kinase activity either in vivo or in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2059599036,"In a study of genetic variation in the AIDS virus, HTLV-III/LAV, sequential virus isolates from persistently infected individuals were examined by Southern blot genomic analysis, molecular cloning, and nucleotide sequencing. Four to six virus isolates were obtained from each of three individuals over a 1-year or 2-year period. Changes were detected throughout the viral genomes and consisted of isolated and clustered nucleotide point mutations as well as short deletions or insertions. Results from genomic restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence comparisons indicated that viruses isolated sequentially had evolved in parallel from a common progenitor virus. The rate of evolution of HTLV-III/LAV was estimated to be at least 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the env gene and 10(-4) for the gag gene, values a millionfold greater than for most DNA genomes. Despite this relatively rapid rate of sequence divergence, virus isolates from any one patient were all much more related to each other than to viruses from other individuals. In view of the substantial heterogeneity among most independent HTLV-III/LAV isolates, the repeated isolation from a given individual of only highly related viruses raises the possibility that some type of interference mechanism may prevent simultaneous infection by more than one major genotypic form of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2120654193,"We have purified two 35 kd phospholipase A2 inhibitors from human placenta, which we refer to as lipocortin I and II. Both proteins exhibit similar biochemical properties and occur in placenta at about 0.2% of the total protein. By peptide mapping, sequence, and immunological analyses, we show that lipocortin I and the 35 kd substrate for the EGF-receptor/kinase from A431 cells are the same protein. By similar criteria, we determine that lipocortin II is the human analogue of pp36, a major substrate for pp60src, which has been characterized in chicken embryo fibroblasts and in bovine brush border preparations. The amino acid sequences of lipocortin I and II that we deduced from cDNA clones share 50% homology, indicating that they probably evolved from a common gene."

https://openalex.org/W2072594233,"We have isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA clone for the protein-tyrosine kinase substrate p36 (calpactin I heavy chain). This sequence predicts a 339 amino acid (Mr 38,493) protein containing an N-terminal region of 20 amino acids, known to interact with a 10 kd protein (light chain), and a C-terminal region, found to contain two Ca2+/phospholipid-binding sites, that can be aligned as four 70 amino acid repeats. A single p36 gene was detected in the mouse genome, and a major p36 mRNA of 1.6 kb was found to be expressed in different mouse tissues. Unexpectedly, p36 and the phospholipase A2 inhibitor lipocortin I were found to be 50% identical in sequence over the C-terminal 300 residues. The function of p36 and its relation to other proteins are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2058023750,The long terminal repeat of Moloney Murine Sarcoma Virus (MoMSV) contains an imperfect direct repeat that serves as a strong transcriptional enhancer. The strength of the MoMSV enhancer is strongly dependent on the presence of glucocorticoid hormone. Mapping studies in combination with DNAase I footprinting experiments define the presence of glucocorticoid regulatory elements at the promoter-proximal ends of each enhancer repeat. These elements behave like inducible enhancers: their regulatory activity is independent of position and orientation when they are linked in cis to a heterologous promoter. These data demonstrate the modular nature of the MoMSV enhancer and identify the glucocorticoid receptor as one of the trans-acting factors that interact with the MoMSV enhancer and mediate its transcriptional activity.

https://openalex.org/W2044089537,"Transcription factor IIIA, which binds to the internal control region of the Xenopus 5S RNA gene has a novel structure consisting of nine tandemly repeated structural units. It was proposed by us that each unit interacts with about 5 bp of DNA. We show here that there is a periodicity on this scale in the DNA sequence and, by fine scale probing with nucleases, a corresponding structural repeat. Similar sequence periodicities are found in the internal control regions of other genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and also in the SV40 promoter and a monkey gene region to which the transcription factor Sp1 binds. We propose that transcription factor IIIA is the type of a novel class of transcription factors offering combinatorial possibilities for the specific recognition of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1963591075,"Preimplantation mouse embryos were infected with a recombinant retrovirus, which serves as a genetic marker for the progeny of an infected blastomere. Quantitative analysis of proviruses carried in mosaic animals indicated that the molarity of individual proviral bands was equal in almost all tissues. The cells that give rise to the embryo proper must therefore intermingle extensively before final tissue allocation to ensure equal contribution of founder cells to all somatic tissues. The distribution of molarities of individual proviruses suggested that somatic lineages are derived from at most eight founder cells. About half of the proviruses were present in the germ line and the somatic tissues of mosaic animals, while the remaining proviruses were found either in the germ line or in the somatic tissues, but not in both. Our results suggest that at least three cells form the germ line and are set aside prior to somatic tissue allocation."

https://openalex.org/W1577039421,"Calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase purified from bovine cardiac muscle catalyzed the rapid dephosphorylation of Ser-95 of bovine cardiac cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit (RII). The kinetic constants determined for the reaction (Km = 20 microM; Vmax = 2 mumol min-1 mg-1) are comparable to those determined for other good substrates of this phosphatase. Because little is known about the determinants of substrate specificity for the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, various phosphopeptides were used to investigate the structural features important for substrate recognition. Limited proteolysis of phospho-RII with trypsin and chymotrypsin yielded fragments (residues 93-400 and 91-400, respectively) that were poor substrates, whereas digestion with Staphylococcal aureus V8 protease produced three phosphopeptides that were all dephosphorylated as rapidly as intact RII. The sequence of the shortest phosphopeptide produced by S. aureus V8 protease was determined by sequence analysis to be Asp-Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ile-Pro-Gly-Arg-Phe-Asp-Arg-Arg-Val-Ser-Val-Cys-Ala-Glu, corresponding to residues 81-99 of RII. Synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to residues 81-99, 85-99, 90-99, and 91-99 were prepared to determine the minimum sequence necessary for substrate recognition. Only the 19-residue peptide (81-99) was dephosphorylated with kinetics comparable to RII (Km = 26 microM, Vmax = 1.7 mumol min-1 mg-1). Structural analysis of this peptide indicates that an amphipathic beta-sheet structure may be an important structural determinant for some substrates of the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase."

https://openalex.org/W2035539254,"Members of the ras gene family encode proteins that when overproduced or mutated can transform immortalized mammalian cells. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms by which the ras genes are regulated. The promoter region of the human Harvey ras proto-oncogene c-Ha-ras1 initiates RNA transcription at multiple sites and contains repeated copies of the hexanucleotide GGGCGG and its inverted complement CCGCCC, referred to as GC boxes. These GC boxes consist of sequences identical to those found in the SV40 early promoter, where the human cellular transcriptional factor Sp1 binds. Footprinting analysis with deoxyribonuclease I was used to show that Sp1 binds to six GC box sequences within the c-Ha-ras1 promoter. An in vivo transfection assay showed competition between the 21-base pair repeats of the SV40 promoter and the c-Ha-ras1 promoter for common regulatory factors. In this system the presence of Sp1 is apparently required for c-Ha-ras1 transcription. Analysis of deletions of the c-Ha-ras1 promoter region by means of a transient expression assay revealed that the three Sp1 binding sites closest to the RNA start sites were sufficient for full transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2162906910,"Transgenic mice containing the early region of human papovavirus JC were produced. Some of these mice exhibited a shaking disorder similar to the previously described mutant mice jimpy or quaking. Neuropathological analysis indicated a dysmyelination in the central nervous system, but not the peripheral nervous system. A high level of JCV T-antigen mRNA was present in the brains of the mice exhibiting the myelin disorder. JC virus is associated in humans with a degenerative demyelinating disease: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The JCV-containing transgenic mice may therefore provide an animal model for studying this disease."
https://openalex.org/W1570718731,"The effects of starvation, refeeding a diet high in carbohydrate, administration of glucagon and cyclic AMP, thyroidectomy, and adrenalectomy on transcription of the gene for liver L-type pyruvate kinase and on the accumulation of cytoplasmic mRNA for L-type pyruvate kinase were investigated in rat. Transcription of the gene was undetectable in either fasted or protein-fed rats. Refeeding fasted rats a carbohydrate-rich diet stimulated an increase in L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA, preceded by an increase in the gene transcription. Transcription was maximal at 12 h of refeeding, decreasing to 10% of maximum at 72 h. The level of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA remained constant at 50% of maximum for at least 120 h. Neither thyroidectomy nor adrenalectomy affected gene transcription in fasted rats refed the carbohydrate-rich diet, despite a decrease in mRNA abundance to 40 and 20%, respectively, of controls fed a normal diet. Glucagon or cyclic AMP totally blocked the increase in transcription of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene caused by feeding a carbohydrate-rich diet to previously fasted rats. Nevertheless, the level of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA remained high for 3 h after glucagon administration. After 3 h, the mRNA decreased rapidly with a half-life less than 1 h. Thus, expression of the gene for L-type pyruvate kinase is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The transcription is regulated by two major effectors, one positive, namely carbohydrates, and one negative, namely glucagon (via cyclic AMP). Both agents probably act at the level of the mRNA stability as well. Glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones do not regulate transcription of the gene for L-type pyruvate kinase but do appear to be required for a normal accumulation of the transcripts in the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1496496869,"Abstract Various hydroxybenzenes, hydroxybenzoic acids, and related compounds resemble structurally both 2-oxoglutarate and ascorbate, two reactants needed in the reaction of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. These substances were found to inhibit prolyl 4-hydroxylase competitively with respect to both cosubstrates. Ortho-dihydroxy derivatives, which are capable of chelating the enzyme-bound iron, were the most effective inhibitors, with Ki values of about 5 microM. In contrast, pyridine 2-carboxylates, which have previously been reported to inhibit the enzyme competitively with respect to 2-oxoglutarate, were found to inhibit it uncompetitively with respect to ascorbate. In a separate set of experiments the side chain of the ascorbate molecule was shown to make no significant contribution to the binding of the reductant to the enzyme, as D(-)-isoascorbate and 5,6-O-isopropylidene ascorbate gave essentially the same Vmax and Km values as ascorbate. On the other hand, structural modifications of the ring atoms that abolished the chelating capacity destroyed both the cosubstrate and inhibitory activity, as in L-galactono gamma-lactone. The ascorbate binding site therefore appears to consist of two cis-positioned coordination sites of the enzyme-bound iron and is thus partially identical to the binding site of 2-oxoglutarate. This mode of interaction suggests that ascorbate reduces the enzyme-bound iron through an inner-sphere mechanism. The inhibitors studied appear to react at different phases of the catalytic cycle, determined by the oxidation state of the enzyme-bound iron atom."
https://openalex.org/W1586349430,"The nucleotide sequences of rbsD, rbsA, and rbsC have been determined. These genes encode components of the high affinity ribose transport system in Escherichia coli, and together with the sequences of rbsB (Groarke, J.M., Mahoney, W.C., Hope, J.N., Furlong, C.E., Robb, F.T., Zalkin, H., and Hermodson, M.A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12952-12956) and rbsK (Hope, J.N., Bell, A.W., Hermodson, M.A., and Groarke, J.M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7663-7668), they complete the nucleotide sequence of the first five genes of the rbs operon. Nuclease S1 mapping places the transcriptional start site for the operon 29 base pairs upstream from the most likely translational start site for rbsD. The open reading frames of rbsD, rbsA, and rbsC encode proteins of 139, 501, and 321 amino acid residues, respectively. The character of the proteins varies widely, from very hydrophilic for the rbsA product to exceedingly hydrophobic for the rbsC product. The intercistronic spaces between the three genes are very short, with the stop codons of the upstream genes overlapping the ribosome-binding sites of the downstream genes. This may imply translational control of expression of these genes, the products of which presumably form a membrane-bound transport complex."
https://openalex.org/W1494438334,"Using affinity chromatography with immobilized gelatin and native type I collagen, we have identified the major collagen-binding proteins in Nonidet P-40 extracts of chick embryo fibroblasts labeled with [35S] methionine. After washing the gelatin- or collagen-Sepharose beads with high ionic strength buffer, a 47,000-dalton protein was the only major protein besides fibronectin found to bind to these affinity beads. The isoelectric point of this protein was approximately 9.0, with a closely spaced minor spot. The total amount and the synthesis of this collagen-binding protein were both decreased in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells. This collagen-binding protein was found to be phosphorylated by incubating intact cells with [32P]orthophosphate. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated, but tyrosine was not. Although quantities of the 47,000-dalton protein labeled with [35S]methionine were decreased by a factor 2.5 after transformation, the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate/unit of protein was 5-7-fold higher in transformed cells. In temperature-sensitive mutant virus-infected cells, the amount of the 47,000-dalton protein was also decreased at the temperature permissive for transformation, and the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate/protein was also increased. These studies establish that a major membrane-associated collagen-binding protein of fibroblasts is phosphorylated and that it is altered in both total quantity and degree of phosphorylation after malignant transformation."

The total amount of platelet-activating factor in the ionophore stimulated elicited polymorphonuclear leukocytes deficient in arachidonate, measured by gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, was 84% less than that of control. The mass spectrometry also revealed the presence of various molecular species of platelet-activating factor ranging from 1-O-tetradecyl to 1-O-nonadecyl forms in both the deficient and control cells. However, the 1-O-hexadecyl was the predominate molecular species representing 79 and 96% of the total platelet-activating factor in the respective deficient and control cells. Other molecular species were less than 1.5 and 8.5% of the total for control and deficient polymorphonuclear leukocytes, respectively. Leukotriene B4 formation was also inhibited by 90% in the deficient cells. Both platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4 biosynthesis could be partially restored in arachidonic acid-deficient cells by prelabeling the cells with arachidonate. This represents the first dietary link with platelet-activating factor biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2078293241,"In many viral infections the host cell carries the viral genome without producing viral particles, a phenomenon known as viral latency. The cellular mechanisms by which viral latency is maintained or viral replication is induced are not known. The modulation of intracellular calcium concentrations by calcium ionophores induced Epstein-Barr viral antigens in lymphoblastoid cell lines that carry the virus. When calcium ionophores were used in conjunction with direct activators of protein kinase C (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate and a synthetic diacylglycerol), a greater induction of viral antigens was observed than with either agent alone. Activation of protein kinase C may be required for the expression of the viral genome."

https://openalex.org/W1496848648,"Abstract We have constructed a cDNA clone, pGTA/C48, which is complementary to the rat liver glutathione S-transferase Yb2 mRNA. Recombinant clone pGTA/C48 contains a cDNA insert of 845 base pairs which overlaps nucleotides 108-952 of the Yb1 cDNA clone, pGTA/C44, described previously by our laboratory (Ding, G. J.-F., Lu, A. Y. H., and Pickett, C. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13268-13271). Over the protein coding region of the Yb1 and Yb2 cDNA clones there is an 84% nucleotide sequence homology, whereas the 3' untranslated regions are only 32% homologous. The complete amino acid sequence of the Yb2 subunit has been determined from a combination of DNA sequence analysis of pGTA/C48 and conventional protein sequence analysis of the glutathione S-transferase Yb1 Yb2 heterodimer. The Yb2 subunit is comprised of 218 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25,705 and has an amino acid sequence which is 79% homologous to the sequence of the Yb1 subunit. We have utilized the divergent 3' untranslated regions of three rat liver glutathione S-transferase cDNA clones as specific probes to determine the effect of phenobarbital on the level of Yb1, Yb2, and Yc mRNAs. Our results clearly show that the Yb1 and Yb2 mRNAs are elevated approximately 5-6-fold by phenobarbital administration; whereas the Yc mRNA is only modestly elevated by this xenobiotic. Finally, our data suggest that the Yb2 subunit is encoded by a gene(s) which is distinct from the Yb1 gene(s) and provides direct evidence for the existence of multiple glutathione S-transferase Yb genes in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W2135271358,"We have previously reported that the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces, in the TT cell line of human medullary thyroid carcinoma, decreased cellular proliferation, increased calcitonin secretion, and enhanced calcitonin gene transcription (deBustros, A., Baylin, S. B., Berger, C. L., Roos, B. A., Leong, S. S., and Nelkin, B. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 98-104). The cellular responses evoked by TPA are thought to be mediated by protein kinase C. In the present study, we have investigated whether protein kinase A, another key mediator of extracellular signal transduction, may also alter the differentiation status of the TT cells. We find that the effects of cAMP, an activator of protein kinase A, on cellular growth, calcitonin secretion, and calcitonin gene transcription almost parallel those of TPA. We also show that both TPA and cAMP lead to similar increases of both major mRNA species encoded within the calcitonin gene, calcitonin itself and the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide. In addition, cAMP increases nuclear calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide mRNA precursors to a greater extent (8-10-fold) than it does the mature cytoplasmic mRNA species (2-4-fold). The effects of TPA and cAMP on the TT cells are additive rather than synergistic. Furthermore, TPA evokes no increase in intracellular cAMP. We thus conclude that TPA and cAMP can trigger, independently, in the TT cells, a similarly programmed set of events resulting in a more differentiated phenotype. These cells provide a model system to explore how these two pathways of signal transduction converge to regulate molecular events such as the transcription of the calcitonin gene."

DNA hybridization analysis led to the identification of two contrasting point mutations in the same codon. In a severe hemophiliac with no detectable factor VIII activity, the normal arginine codon (number 2307) is converted to a stop codon, while in a mild hemophiliac with 10 percent of normal activity, this same codon is converted to glutamine."
https://openalex.org/W1577653677,"The relationship between the steady-state sodium gradient (delta pNa) and the protonmotive force developed by endogenously respiring Escherichia coli cells has been studied quantitatively, using 23Na NMR for measurement of intracellular and extracellular sodium concentrations, 31P NMR for measurement of intracellular and extracellular pH, and tetraphenylphosphonium distribution for measurement of membrane potential. At constant protonmotive force, the sodium concentration gradient was independent of extracellular concentrations over the measured range of 4-285 mM, indicating that intracellular sodium concentration is not regulated. The magnitude of delta pNa was measured as a function of the composition and magnitude of the protonmotive force. At external pH values below 7.2, delta pNa was parallel to delta pH but showed no simple relationship to the membrane potential; above pH 7.2 the parallel relationship began to diverge, with delta pH continuing to decrease but delta pNa starting to level off or increase. Although plots of delta pNa versus delta pH had slopes of close to 1, the value of delta pNa consistently exceeded that of delta pH by approximately 0.4 units, indicating a partially electrogenic character to the putative H+/Na+ antiport. The apparent stoichiometry was 1.13 +/- 0.01 at external pH below 7.2. The possible significance of this nonintegral stoichiometry is discussed according to a model in which two distinct integral stoichiometries (possibly 1H+/1Na+ and 2H+/1Na+) are available with some relative probability; the model predicts futile cycling of sodium ions and a dissipative proton current. In the course of this study, we discovered that the magnitude of the pH gradient developed by the cells was osmolarity-dependent, yielding steady-state intracellular pH values that varied from 7.1 at 100 mosm to 7.7 at 800 mosm."
https://openalex.org/W1509985961,"In lymphocytes, the Na+/H+ antiport can be stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and by osmotic shrinking. Since TPA acts by stimulating protein kinase C, we undertook experiments to determine if protein phosphorylation also underlies the osmotic stimulation of the antiport. We found that at least one of the membrane polypeptides labeled in cells treated with TPA is also phosphorylated by hypertonic shrinking. In both instances phosphorylation is alkali labile and associated with serine and threonine residues. We tested the possibility that shrinking activates phospholipase C, thereby stimulating protein kinase C through release of diacylglycerol. No decrease in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels was detected in hypertonically treated cells. Moreover, the concentrations of inositol phosphates, including inositol trisphosphate, were not altered in shrunken cells. Thus, shrinking does not appear to activate phospholipase C. Whereas TPA induced intracellular redistribution of soluble protein kinase C, no such effect was detected in osmotically activated cells. It was concluded that osmotic stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport is associated with activation of protein phosphorylation by a kinase that is similar, but not identical to protein kinase C. Experiments in Na+-free or amiloride-containing media indicate that phosphorylation is not a consequence of activation of the antiport."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of iodinated purified receptor preparations reveals a peptide with an apparent Mr = 80,000 that co-migrates with the peptide labeled by the specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor photoaffinity probe 4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-[4-[5-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodophenyl)pentanoyl] -1-piperazinyl] quinazoline. The specific activity (approximately 13,600 pmol of ligand binding/mg of protein) of purified receptor preparations is consistent with that expected for a pure peptide of Mr = 80,000 containing a single ligand binding site. Overall yields approximate 14% of initial crude particulate binding. The purified receptor preparations bind agonist and antagonist ligands with appropriate alpha 1-adrenergic specificity, stereoselectivity, and affinity. Peptide maps of the pure alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and the pure human platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (Regan, J.W., Nakata, H., DeMarinis, R.M., Caron, M.G., and Lefkowitz, R.J. (1986) J.

https://openalex.org/W2018186297,"Forskolin- and cholera toxin-activated adenylate cyclase activity increases between the morula and blastocyst stages of mouse preimplantation development, as assessed by the ability of these agents to increase embryonic cAMP levels. Development of activatable adenylate cyclase requires transcription but is independent of the fifth nuclear replication, cell division, and compaction. Early cavitating embryos treated with cholera toxin and forskolin or with N6-monobutyryl-cAMP display an increase in the rate of fluid accumulation in comparison with untreated controls. The stimulatory effect is specific for cAMP, since neither the inactive cAMP analogue N6-monobutyryl-2'-deoxy-cAMP nor N2-monobutyryl-cGMP stimulates the rate of fluid accumulation. These results constitute the first report of a possible physiological function for cAMP in preimplantation development, namely, in blastocoel formation."
https://openalex.org/W1602345641,"Purified alkaline phosphatase and plasma membranes from human liver were shown to dephosphorylate phosphohistones and plasma membrane phosphoproteins. The protein phosphatase activity of the liver plasma membranes was inhibited by levamisole, a specific inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, and by phenyl phosphonate and orthovanadate, but was relatively insensitive to fluoride (50 mM). Endogenous membrane protein phosphatase activity was optimal at pH 8.0, compared to pH 7.8 for purified liver alkaline phosphatase. Plasma membranes also exhibited protein kinase activity using exogenous histone or endogenous membrane proteins (autophosphorylation) as substrates; this activity was cAMP-dependent. Autophosphorylation of plasma membrane proteins was apparently enhanced by phenyl phosphonate, levamisole, or orthovanadate. The dephosphorylation of phosphohistones by protein phosphatase 1 was not inhibited by levamisole but was inhibited by fluoride. Inhibition of endogenous protein phosphatase activity by orthovanadate during autophosphorylation of plasma membranes could be reversed by complexation of the inhibitor with (R)-(-)-epinephrine, and the dephosphorylation that followed was levamisole-sensitive. Neither plasma membranes nor purified liver alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase a. These results suggest that the increased [32P]phosphate incorporation by endogenous protein kinases into the membrane proteins is due to inhibition of alkaline phosphatase and that the major protein phosphatase of these plasma membranes is alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1525751756,"The nucleotide sequence of a 1455-base pair TaqI-HinfI fragment of the rbs operon of Escherichia coli K12 has been determined. It includes the 3' terminus of rbsB (the gene for ribose-binding protein) and the entire rbsK gene, encoding ribokinase. Potential consensus promoter sequences and a stable stem-loop structure are present in the rbsB-rbsK intercistronic region. The regulatory significance of these sequence features is discussed with respect to the rbs operon. rbsK has been cloned downstream from the Serratia marcescens trp promoter on a multicopy plasmid. Cells harboring this plasmid, when grown on minimal ribose plus ampicillin, express ribokinase at the level of 2% of the soluble protein, and induction with indoleacrylic acid raises ribokinase levels another 8-fold. Ribokinase has been purified to homogeneity (216 mumol/min/mg) from a strain harboring this plasmid. Protein sequence analyses of peptides generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage and o-iodosobenzoic acid cleavage confirmed the translation initiation site and the reading frame of the DNA sequence. Amino acid compositions of native ribokinase and the C-terminal dodecapeptide agree with the predicted amino acid compositions, confirming the accuracy of the DNA sequence and the translation termination site."

Purification of 3200-fold and 2800-fold was achieved from wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose eluates with regard to IGF-I binding and kinase activities. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed two major protein bands corresponding to the alpha and beta subunits of the receptor, which accounted for at least 90% of the protein content. The purified receptor bound 10-20 micrograms of IGF-I/mg of protein and was more than 95% free of contamination by insulin receptor. It sedimented in glycerol gradients as a single species with a sedimentation coefficient of 13.7 S and gave three protein bands with Mr = approximately 300,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, indicating that alpha 2 beta 2 is an intact form of the IGF-I receptor. The purified receptor, when incubated with [gamma-32P] ATP, became phosphorylated at tyrosine residues of its beta subunit. This was stimulated 3-fold by IGF-I. It also had IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity (5264 pmol of 32P incorporated/min/mg of protein) toward a synthetic peptide corresponding to the autophosphorylation site of pp60src. These data strongly suggest that it is a tyrosine-specific protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2092508732,"A monoclonal antibody to the chicken transferrin receptor (JS-8) blocked temperature-induced and spontaneous differentiation of avian erythroid cells transformed by ts- and wt-retroviral oncogenes. In cells committed to differentiate, JS-8 caused an arrest at the erythroblast or early reticulocyte stage, followed by premature cell death, whereas proliferation of noncommitted erythroid cells or other hematopoietic cells remained unaffected. JS-8 had no effect on transferrin binding or internalization, but blocked subsequent receptor-recycling resulting in reduced iron uptake. Restoration of high intracellular iron levels neutralized the action of JS-8, whereas an inhibitor of porphyrine biosynthesis (4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid) closely mimicked the effect of JS-8. This suggests that erythroid differentiation might involve coordinate synthesis of erythrocyte proteins subject to regulation by hemin or hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1602085473,"Prolactin (PRL) release in permeable GH3 pituitary cells was stimulated by the protein kinase C activators 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). Both agents stimulated secretion at 10 nM Ca2+, but higher [Ca2+] (greater than 0.1 microM) potentiated TPA and OAG action. Maximal potentiation occurred at 1 microM calculated free Ca2+, and a similar value was obtained when the cytoplasmic [Ca2+] was measured with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Quin 2. Release of a secretory sulfated proteoglycan was also stimulated by TPA and OAG in permeable GH3 cells, with characteristics similar to those for PRL release. Trifluoroperazine, polymyxin B, neomycin, and 8-(diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate all inhibited both TPA- and Ca2+-stimulated PRL release, but in each case the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations were approximately 2-fold higher for TPA-stimulated release compared to Ca2+-stimulated release. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and guanosine 5'-Q-thiotriphosphate, which stimulate polyphosphoinositide breakdown in permeable cells, were found to be only weak stimulators of PRL release, compared to TPA and exogenous diacylglycerol. However, a much stronger effect of TRH was seen if cells were briefly treated with TRH prior to permeabilization. PRL release from TRH-pretreated permeable cells resembled TPA- and OAG-stimulated secretion, with [Ca2+] greater than 0.1 microM potentiating the effect of TRH pretreatment. These studies support the hypothesis that PRL release in GH3 cells can be stimulated directly by a diacylglycerol-activated secretory mechanism whose activity is modulated by [Ca2+]."
https://openalex.org/W1549222475,"The o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzyl chlorides are reduced aerobically and anaerobically by NADPH and rat hepatic microsomes. Under aerobic conditions, these nitro anion radicals reduce oxygen to superoxide as demonstrated by oxygen consumption and spin trapping of superoxide with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide. At low oxygen concentration, the p- and o-nitro anion radicals undergo intramolecular electron transfer and decompose to carbon-centered nitrobenzyl radicals, which can be spin-trapped with t-nitrosobutane. The p-nitrobenzyl (o-nitrobenzyl) radical adduct was characterized by a nitrogen hyperfine splitting of 16.5 G (17.1 G) and two equivalent beta-hydrogen hyperfine splittings of 10.6 G (14.4 G). The spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide also yields adducts characteristic of carbon-centered free radicals. This unimolecular decomposition is much faster than the disproportionation decay, which is characteristic of most nitro anion radicals, and the primary o- and p-nitrobenzyl chloride anion radicals never achieve detectable concentrations. The nitrobenzyl radical trapping is not inhibited by metyrapone or CO. In contrast, the m-nitrobenzyl anion radical does achieve a detectable steady-state concentration, which is increased 20% by either metyrapone or a CO atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1590816720,"When partially reduced cytochrome c oxidase samples are reoxidized with dioxygen, an EPR-silent dioxygen intermediate, which is at the three-electron level of dioxygen reduction, is trapped at the dioxygen reduction site. The intermediate has novel spectral features at 580 and 537 nm. Combined optical and EPR results reveal that this intermediate reacts rapidly with CO at 277-298 K causing the abolition of the 580/537 mm features and the appearance of a rhombic CuB EPR signal. A ferryl Fea3, or an intermediate at the same formal level of oxidation, is proposed to oxidize CO to CO2 producing an EPR-detectable CuB adjacent to a low-spin ferrous Fea3-dioxygen (or carbon monoxide) adduct."
https://openalex.org/W1659629111,"The lambda O and P gene products are required for the initiation of lambda DNA replication. In order to study the biochemistry of this process, we have constructed plasmids that carry the lambda O gene, P gene, and half of the O gene coding for the amino-terminal half of the O protein. Each is under the control of the inducible lambda promoter, PL. We have purified these three proteins from induced cells carrying the plasmids. Our results show that the amino-terminal portion of the O protein binds to the lambda origin of replication in a manner similar to the intact lambda O protein, demonstrating that the amino-terminal portion of O protein contains the DNA binding domain. Using chromatographic procedures, we have isolated a complex of lambda O and P proteins with lambda dv DNA. The amino-terminal portion of the O protein does not complex with P protein under the same conditions. This suggests that the specificity of the lambda O protein for P protein resides in the carboxyl-terminal half of the lambda O protein. Our results also show that, while the intact O protein is active in in vitro replication of lambda dv plasmid DNA, the amino-terminal portion of the O protein is inactive and is a competitive inhibitor of the lambda O protein in this reaction. These results confirm previous genetic observations that were interpreted as indicating a bifunctional structure for the lambda O protein with the amino-terminal domain recognizing the lambda origin of replication and the carboxyl-terminal domain interacting with the lambda P protein."
https://openalex.org/W1645915423,"Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTCase) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the 2nd step in the mammalian urea cycle. The gene encoding OTCase is located on the X chromosome and expression of OTCase is limited almost exclusively to hepatocytes. We have characterized a lambda phage recombinant, isolated from a mouse genomic library, that spans the first two exons of the mouse OTCase gene. Nuclease S1 mapping and primer extension analysis of this clone allowed us to determine that the transcription start site is 136 base pairs (bp) upstream from the translation initiation codon. Two TATA-like sequences were found 25 and 153 bp from the transcription initiation point. An 800-bp fragment containing the 5' flanking region of the OTCase gene was fused upstream to the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene to assay promoter activity. This plasmid was introduced into mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells and human hepatoma Hep G2 cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. After DNA transfection chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was observed only in Hep G2 cells. We conclude that this 800-bp fragment contains sufficient information to control OTCase gene expression in a tissue-specific manner, probably by interacting with trans-acting factor(s) which are not present in the other cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1510596518,"Release of 3H2O from regiospecifically labeled estradiol was measured during 2-hydroxylation of this estrogen by rat liver microsomes. The amount of tritium remaining in the isolated catechol estrogen was also determined. Virtually all the tritium was removed from C-2 during the reaction confirming the absence of an NIH shift. About 20% of the tritium at C-1 was also lost without any such change occurring at C-4 or C-6,7 of the steroid molecule. These findings provide evidence for the formation of an arene oxide or o-semiquinone intermediate during the conversion of estradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol. No indication of adduct formation at either C-1 or C-4 during this biotransformation was obtained although the 2-hydroxylated product was able to react with a nucleophile such as glutathione. The different regiospecificity of tritium loss in the generation of catechol estrogens and in their subsequent reaction leads to the important conclusion that the reactive intermediates in the two processes must be different. The possible role of catechol estrogens in neoplastic transformation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575592040,"Herpesvirus infection has been shown to alter the cholesteryl ester cycle in avian arterial smooth muscle cells, resulting in cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester accumulation (Hajjar, D. P., Falcone, D. J., Fabricant, C. G., and Fabricant, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6124-6128). In this study, we attempted to define some of the regulatory mechanisms associated with the control of cytoplasmic cholesteryl esterase in Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDV)-infected cells. We found that cholesteryl esterase activity in MDV-infected cells could not be activated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP added together with protein kinase, or agonists of adenylate cyclase. Activation of cytoplasmic cholesteryl esterase activity occurred in uninfected cells and in cells infected with a control virus, turkey herpesvirus. Furthermore, the rate of cholesterol efflux from arterial smooth muscle cells challenged with dibutyryl cyclic AMP was unchanged in MDV-infected cells as compared to uninfected or turkey herpesvirus-infected cells in which efflux was increased. We propose that the reduced cytoplasmic cholesteryl esterase activity in lipid-laden, herpesvirus-infected cells is due partly to its inability to be activated by the cyclic AMP-protein kinase mechanism. This may contribute to the pathologic changes seen in MDV-infected arterial cells, including accumulation of intracellular cholesteryl esters."
https://openalex.org/W1561182102,"The stoichiometry of vectorial H+ translocation coupled to oxidation of added ferrocytochrome c by O2 via cytochrome-c oxidase of rat liver mitoplasts was determined employing a fast-responding O2 electrode. Electron flow was initiated by addition of either ferrocytochrome c or O2. When the rates were extrapolated to level flow, the H+/O ratios in both cases were less than but closely approached 4; the directly observed H+/O ratios significantly exceeded 3.0. The mechanistic H+/O ratio was then more closely fixed by a kinetic approach that eliminates the necessity for measuring energy leaks and is independent of any particular model of the mechanism of energy transduction. From two sets of kinetic measurements, an overestimate and an underestimate and thus the upper and lower limits of the mechanistic H+/O ratio could be obtained. In the first set, the utilization of respiratory energy was systematically varied through changes in the concentrations of valinomycin or K+. From the slope of a plot of the initial rates of H+ ejection (JH) and O2 uptake (JO) obtained in such experiments, the upper limit of the H+/O ratio was in the range 4.12-4.19. In the second set of measurements, the rate of respiratory energy production was varied by inhibiting electron transport. From the slope of a plot of JH versus JO, the lower limit of the H+/O ratio, equivalent to that at level flow, was in the range 3.83-3.96. These data fix the mechanistic H+/O ratio for the cytochrome oxidase reaction of mitoplasts at 4.0, thus confirming our earlier measurements (Reynafarje, B., Alexandre, A., Davies, P., and Lehninger, A. L. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 7218-7222). Possible reasons for discrepancies in published reports on the H+/O ratio of cytochrome oxidase in various mitochondrial and reconstituted systems are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529634815,"A protein phosphatase has been isolated from brain using, as assay substrate throughout the purification, microtubule-associated protein-2 which had been phospho-labeled by its associated kinase. In contrast to other protein phosphatases, this phosphatase can effectively release phosphate from both the microtubule-binding and projection domains of microtubule-associated-protein-2. This enzyme appears to be a distinct, specific phosphatase that does not readily fit into previous classification schemes and is possibly the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating microtubule-associated protein-2 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1499672867,"Affinity cross-linking of the lutropin receptor with 125I-human choriogonadotropin (hCG) on porcine granulosa cells produced four distinct homone-receptor complexes under reducing conditions. They contain 18-, 24-, 28-, and 34-kDa components (Ji, I., Bock, J. H., and Ji, T. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12815-12821). Photoaffinity labeling and cross-linking produced 136-, 102-, and 74-kDa hCG-receptor complexes under reducing conditions and the 136-kDa complex under nonreducing conditions. In addition, the unreduced 102-kDa complex was seen in photoaffinity labeling but not in cross-linking. When the unreduced 136-kDa complex was reduced, the 102- and 74-kDa complexes were generated, indicating release of the 34- and the 28-kDa components in two steps. When the unreduced 102-kDa complex was reduced, the 74-kDa complex was produced, indicating the release of a 28-kDa component. The 74-kDa complex could not be reduced but was cleaved by alkaline treatment to produce the hCG alpha beta dimer. The results indicate that the 24-kDa component is released from the 74-kDa complex, since the apparent mass of the hCG alpha beta dimer on gels is 50 kDa. The 24-kDa component appears to be the initial site for photoaffinity labeling or cross-linking and to be disulfide linked to the 28-kDa component which is in turn disulfide linked to the 34-kDa component. These intercomponent disulfides exist in some receptors but not all. Formation of the disulfide-linked 136-kDa band required the presence of a sulfhydryl-blocking agent, N-ethylmaleimide. In particular, the 34-kDa component was vulnerable to reduction. There was no significant evidence of disulfides between the hormone and any of the receptor components."
