https://openalex.org/W1995605620,"Knowledge of regional cerebral hemodynamics has widespread application for both physiological research and clinical assessment because of the well-established interrelation between physiological function, energy metabolism, and localized blood supply. A magnetic resonance technique was developed for quantitative imaging of cerebral hemodynamics, allowing for measurement of regional cerebral blood volume during resting and activated cognitive states. This technique was used to generate the first functional magnetic resonance maps of human task activation, by using a visual stimulus paradigm. During photic stimulation, localized increases in blood volume (32 +/- 10 percent, n = 7 subjects) were detected in the primary visual cortex. Center-of-mass coordinates and linear extents of brain activation within the plane of the calcarine fissure are reported."

https://openalex.org/W1997531619,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes the growth and differentiation of many hematopoietic cells in vitro; in particular, it directs the immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch to IgG1 and IgE. Mice homozygous for a mutation that inactivates the IL-4 gene were generated to test the requirement for IL-4 in vivo. In the mutant mice T and B cell development was normal, but the serum levels of IgG1 and IgE were strongly reduced. The IgG1 dominance in a T cell-dependent immune response was lost, and IgE was not detectable upon nematode infection. Thus, some but not all of the in vitro properties of IL-4 are critical for the physiology of the immune system in vivo."

In vitro, NO deaminated deoxynucleosides, deoxynucleotides, and intact DNA at physiological pH. That similar DNA damage can also occur in vivo was tested by treating Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 with three NO-releasing compounds, including nitroglycerin. All proved mutagenic. Observed DNA sequence changes were greater than 99% C----T transitions in the hisG46 (CCC) target codon, consistent with a cytosine-deamination mechanism. Because exposure to endogenously and exogenously produced NO is extensive, this mechanism may contribute to the incidence of deamination-related genetic disease and cancer."

These and other experiments with protein engineered variants of hGH have led to the identification of the binding determinants for two distinct but adjacent sites on hGH for the hGHbp, and the data indicated that there are two overlapping binding sites on the hGHbp for hGH. Furthermore, the binding of hGH to the hGHbp occurred sequentially; a first hGHbp molecule bound to site 1 on hGH and then a second hGHbp bound to site 2. Hormone-induced receptor dimerization is proposed to be relevant to the signal transduction mechanism for the hGH receptor and other related cytokine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2069298274,"High-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies of protein hydration in aqueous solution show that there are two qualitatively different types of hydration sites. A well-defined, small number of water molecules in the interior of the protein are in identical locations in the crystal structure and in solution, and their residence times are in the range from about 10(-2) to 10(-8) second. Hydration of the protein surface in solution is by water molecules with residence times in the subnanosecond range, even when they are located in hydration sites that contain well-ordered water in the x-ray structures of protein single crystals."

https://openalex.org/W2091691801,"The generation of antigen-specific antitumor immunity is the ultimate goal in cancer immunotherapy. When cells from a spontaneously arising murine renal cell tumor were engineered to secrete large doses of interleukin-4 (IL-4) locally, they were rejected in a predominantly T cell-independent manner. However, animals that rejected the IL-4-transfected tumors developed T cell-dependent systemic immunity to the parental tumor. This systemic immunity was tumor-specific and primarily mediated by CD8+ T cells. Established parental tumors could be cured by the systemic immune response generated by injection of the genetically engineered tumors. These results provide a rationale for the use of lymphokine gene-transfected tumor cells as a modality for cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1991442236,A rat dopamine (DA) transporter complementary DNA has been isolated with combined complementary DNA homology and expression approaches. The DA transporter is a 619-amino acid protein with 12 hydrophobic putative membrane-spanning domains and homology to the norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters. The expressed complementary DNA confers transport of [3H]DA in Xenopus oocytes and in COS cells. Binding of the cocaine analog [3H]CFT ([3H]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane) to transfected COS cell membranes yields a pharmacological profile similar to that in striatal membranes.
https://openalex.org/W2079507733,"A complementary DNA clone for a serotonin (5HT) transporter has been isolated from rat basophilic leukemia cells. The complementary DNA sequence predicts a 653-amino acid protein with 12 to 13 putative transmembrane domains. The 5HT transporter has significant homology to the gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, and norepinephrine transporters. Uptake by CV-1 cells expressing the transporter complementary DNA resembles 5HT uptake by platelets and brain synaptosomes; it is sensitive to antidepressants, amphetamine derivatives, and cocaine."

https://openalex.org/W2084247271,"The rate of net hepatic glycogenolysis was assessed in humans by serially measuring hepatic glycogen concentration at 3- to 12-hour intervals during a 68-hour fast with 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The net rate of gluconeogenesis was calculated by subtracting the rate of net hepatic glycogenolysis from the rate of glucose production in the whole body measured with tritiated glucose. Gluconeogenesis accounted for 64 +/- 5% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) of total glucose production during the first 22 hours of fasting. In the subsequent 14-hour and 18-hour periods of the fast, gluconeogenesis accounted for 82 +/- 5% and 96 +/- 1% of total glucose production, respectively. These data show that gluconeogenesis accounts for a substantial fraction of total glucose production even during the first 22 hours of a fast in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1989560823,"B LYMPHOCYTES are key participants in the immune response because of their specificity, their ability to take up and present antigens to T cells, and their capacity to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. To limit reactivity to self antigens, autospecific B cells can be functionally inactivated or deleted. Developing B cells that react with membrane antigens expressed in the bone marrow are deleted from the peripheral lymphocyte pool. It is important to ascertain the fate of B cells that recognize membrane autoantigens expressed exclusively on peripheral tissues because B cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs are phenotypically and functionally distinct from bone-marrow B cells. Here we show that in immunoglobulin-transgenic mice, B cells specific for major histocompatibility complex class I antigen can be deleted if they encounter membrane-bound antigen at a post-bone-marrow stage of development. This deletion may be necessary to prevent organ-specific autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2000980350,"The mechanism of T cell depletion during infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is unclear. Examination of the repertoire of T cell receptor V (variable) regions in persons infected with HIV revealed the absence of a common set of V beta regions, whereas V alpha usage was normal. The lack of these V beta segments did not appear to correlate with opportunistic infections. The selective elimination of T cells that express a defined set of V beta sequences may indicate the presence of an HIV-encoded superantigen, similar to those encoded by the long terminal repeat of the mouse mammary tumor virus."
https://openalex.org/W2069575222,"Intracellular signaling alters integrin adhesive functions in inflammation, immune responses, hemostasis, thrombosis, and retinal development. By truncating the cytoplasmic domain of alpha IIb, the affinity of integrin alpha IIb beta 3 for ligand was increased. Reconstitution with the cytoplasmic domain from integrin alpha 5 did not reverse the increased affinity. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha subunit of GPIIb-IIIa controls ligand binding affinity, which suggests mechanisms for inside-out transmembrane signaling through integrins. These findings imply the existence of hitherto unappreciated hereditary and acquired thrombotic disorders in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2075569239,"The concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in polarized eosinophils was imaged during chemotaxis by monitoring fluorescence of the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2 with a modified digital imaging microscope. Chemotactic stimuli caused [Ca2+]i to increase in a nonuniform manner that was related to cell activity. In cells moving persistently in one direction, [Ca2+]i was highest at the rear and lowest at the front of the cell. Before cells turned, [Ca2+]i transiently increased. The region of the cell that became the new leading edge had the lowest [Ca2+]i. These changes in [Ca2+]i provide a basis for understanding the organization and local activity of cytoskeletal proteins thought to underlie the directed migration of many cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035646744,"The three-dimensional structure of the lactose complex of the Erythrina corallodendron lectin (EcorL), a dimer of N-glycosylated subunits, was determined crystallographically and refined at 2.0 angstrom resolution to an R value of 0.19. The tertiary structure of the subunit is similar to that of other legume lectins, but interference by the bulky N-linked heptasaccharide, which is exceptionally well ordered in the crystal, forces the EcorL dimer into a drastically different quaternary structure. Only the galactose moiety of the lactose ligand resides within the combining site. The galactose moiety is oriented differently from ligands in the mannose-glucose specific legume lectins and is held by hydrophobic interactions with Ala88, Tyr106, Phe131, and Ala218 and by seven hydrogen bonds, four of which are to the conserved Asp89, Asn133, and NH of Gly107. The specificity of legume lectins toward the different C-4 epimers appears to be associated with extensive variations in the outline of the variable parts of the binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2059084665,"Voltage-dependent ion channels respond to changes in the membrane potential by means of charged voltage sensors intrinsic to the channel protein. Changes in transmembrane potential cause movement of these charged residues, which results in conformational changes in the channel. Movements of the charged sensors can be detected as currents known as gating currents. Measurement of the gating currents of the Drosophila Shaker potassium channel indicates that the charge on the voltage sensor of the channels is progressively immobilized by prolonged depolarizations. The charge is not immobilized in a mutant of the channel that lacks inactivation. These results show that the region of the molecule responsible for inactivation interacts, directly or indirectly, with the voltage sensor to prevent the return of the charge to its original position. The gating transitions between closed states of the channel appear not to be independent, suggesting that the channel subunits interact during activation."

https://openalex.org/W2085686817,"Early in the process of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis a septum is formed that partitions the sporangium into daughter cells called the forespore and the mother cell. The daughter cells each have their own chromosome but follow dissimilar programs of gene expression. Differential gene expression in the forespore is now shown to be established by the compartmentalized activity of the transcription factor sigma F. The sigma F factor is produced prior to septation, but is active only in the forespore compartment of the post-septation sporangium. The sigma F factor is controlled by the products of sporulation operons spoIIA and spoIIE, which may be responsible for confining its activity to one of the daughter cells."

https://openalex.org/W2007612979,"The cerebellum has many properties that make it a useful model for investigating neural development. Purkinje cells, the major output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, have drawn special attention because of the availability of biochemical markers and mutants that affect their development. The spatial expression of L7, a protein specific for Purkinje cells, and L7 beta Gal, a gene expressed in transgenic mice that was constructed from the L7 promoter and the marker beta-galactosidase, delineated bands of Purkinje cells that increased in number during early postnatal development. Expression of the transgene in adult reeler mutant mice, which show inverted cortical lamination, and in primary culture showed that the initial expression of L7 is intrinsic to Purkinje cells and does not depend on extracellular signals. This may reflect an underlying developmental map in cerebellum."

https://openalex.org/W1996607454,"A laterally located sound source stimulates the two ears at slightly different times, generating interaural phase disparities (IPDs) that are used for sound localization. Under natural conditions, such interaural cues are likely to be constantly changing, or dynamic. In the inferior colliculus of gerbils and cats, the nonlinearities in the coding of dynamic interaural phase cues are demonstrated. Responses to ecologically realistic phase cues are more reflective of the change of IPD than of the absolute IPDs over which that change occurs. This observation is inconsistent with the established view that directional information is coded in terms of absolute IPD."
https://openalex.org/W2027822231,"In acinar cells from rat salivary glands, cholinergic agonists cause oscillations in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration, which then drive oscillations of cell volume that reflect oscillating cell solute content and fluid secretion. By quantitative fluorescence ratio microscopy of an intracellular indicator dye for sodium, it has now been shown that large amplitude oscillations of sodium concentration were associated with the calcium and cell volume oscillations. Both calcium and sodium oscillations were dependent on the continued presence of calcium in the extracellular medium and were abolished by the specific sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor ouabain. Thus, calcium oscillations in salivary acinar cells, by modulating the activities of ion transport pathways in the plasma membrane, can cause significant oscillations of monovalent ions that may in turn feed back to regulate calcium oscillations and fluid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1991209235,"Crystallization of macromolecules for structural studies has long been a hit-or-miss process. The crystallization of hexanucleotides as Z-DNA was studied, and it was shown that the cation concentration for crystal formation could be predicted from solvation free energy (SFE) calculations. Solution studies on the conformation and solubilities of the hexanucleotides showed that a critical concentration of the DNA in the Z-conformation must be present in solution to effect crystallization. The SFE calculations therefore predict the propensity of the hexanucleotides to adopt the left-handed conformation and the driving force required to reach this critical concentration relative to the intrinsic solubility of Z-DNA for crystallization."
