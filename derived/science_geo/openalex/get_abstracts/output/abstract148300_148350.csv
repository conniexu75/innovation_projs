https://openalex.org/W1989986502,"Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, of which 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-<i>p</i>-dioxin (TCDD) is the prototype compound, elicit a variety of toxic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic responses in exposed animals and in humans. In cultured cells, TCDD shows marked effects on the regulation of cell cycle progression, including thymocyte apoptosis, induction of keratinocyte proliferation and terminal differentiation, and inhibition of estrogen-dependent proliferation in breast cancer cells. The presence of an L<i>X</i>C<i>X</i>E domain in the dioxin aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), suggested that the effects of TCDD on cell cycle regulation might be mediated by protein-protein interactions between AHR and the retinoblastoma protein (RB). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, AHR and RB were in fact shown to bind to each other. <i>In vitro</i> pull-down experiments with truncated AHR peptides indicated that at least two separate AHR domains form independent complexes with hypophosphorylated RB. Coimmunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates from human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, which express both proteins endogenously, revealed that AHR associates with RB <i>in vivo</i> only after receptor transformation and nuclear translocation. However, the AHR nuclear translocator and transcriptional heterodimerization partner, is not required for (nor is it a part of) the AHR·RB complexes detected <i>in vitro</i>. Ectopic expression of AHR and RB in human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, which lack endogenous expression of both proteins, showed that AHR synergizes with RB to repress E2F-dependent transcription and to induce cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, AHR partly blocked T-antigen-mediated reversal of RB-dependent transcriptional repression. These results uncover a potential function for the AHR in cell cycle regulation and suggest that this function may be that of serving as an environmental sensor that signals cell cycle arrest when cells are exposed to certain environmental toxicants."

BCP showed a thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase activity. BCP preferentially reduced linoleic acid hydroperoxide rather than H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide with the use of thioredoxin as an in vivo immediate electron donor. The value of V max/K mof BCP for linoleic acid hydroperoxide was calculated to be 5-fold higher than that for H2O2, implying that BCP has a selective capability to reduce linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Replacement of Cys-45 with serine resulted in the complete loss of thiol peroxidase activity, suggesting that BCP is a new bacterial member of TSA/AhpC family having a conserved cysteine as the primary site of catalysis. BCP exists as a monomer, and its functional Cys-45 appeared to exist as cysteine sulfenic acid. The expression level of BCP gradually elevated during exponential growth until mid-log phase growth, beyond which the expression level was decreased. BCP was induced 3-fold by the oxidative stress given by changing the growth conditions from the anaerobic to aerobic culture. Bcp null mutant grew more slowly than its wild type in aerobic culture and showed the hypersensitivity toward various oxidants such as H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide. The peroxide hypersensitivity of the null mutant could be complemented by the expression of bcp gene. Taken together, these data suggest that BCP is a new member of thioredoxin-dependent TSA/AhpC family, acting as a general hydroperoxide peroxidase.

The alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC)/TSA family is a new type of peroxidase that has a conserved cysteine as the primary site of catalysis instead of the selenocysteine of glutathione peroxidase. The new type of peroxidase that has been discovered from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (3.Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar,4.Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G.

Only two bacterial member of the new peroxidase family have been reported, although at least five types of thiol peroxidase exist in eukaryotic cell. In Escherichia coli, AhpC was reported to preferentially reduce alkyl hydroperoxide with electrons provided by either NADH or NADPH via the AhpF52 (8.Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported a novel type of peroxidase, p20, that acts as an antioxidant to remove peroxides such as H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxide in the periplasmic space of E. coli (9.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The similarity of primary structure between bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) and the TSA/AhpC family suggested that BCP could be another new member of the family. However, the function of BCP has not yet been clarified despite of the wide distribution of BCP in most pathogenic bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae,Helicobactor pylori, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as p20. In this paper, we first showed that BCP is a new bacterial member of the TSA/AhpC family, acting as a general hydroperoxide peroxidase. The DNA sequence corresponding to BCP was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from E. coli genomic DNA using the forward primer (5′-G GAA TTC CAT ATG AAT CCA CTG AAA GCC GGT GAT ATC-3′) containing an NdeI (underlined) site and the initiation codon (boldface) and the reverse primer (5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GGC GTG TTC TTT CAG CCA GTT CAG-3′) containing the BamHI site (underlined) and the stop codon (boldface). The amplified products were purified and digested withNdeI/BamHI. The digested fragments were subcloned into the T7 expression vector, pT7–7 digested withNdeI/BamHI, and the resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Three mutant proteins, C45S, C50S, and C99S, in which Cys-45, Cys-50, and Cys-99 were individually replace by serine, were generated by the standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with complementary primers containing a 1-base pair mismatch, which converts the codon for cysteine to one for serine. The mutated PCR products were ligated into pT7–7 digested with NdeI/BamHI. Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C overnight in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and then transferred to fresh medium to the ratio of 1 to 200. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After induction for 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C until use. Frozen cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 2 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA and disrupted by sonication. The supernatants clarified by centrifugation were loaded to Q-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 mover 100 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the peak of BCP were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.0). After dialysis, samples were applied to SP-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 50 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.0). The samples eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and stored at −70 °C. The antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the activity to protect the inactivation of E. coli glutamine synthetase (GS) by a thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system (DTT/Fe3+/O2) (thiol MCO system) (10.Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (11.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of DTT, ascorbate was included as a non-thiol-reducing equivalent (non-thiol MCO system). The 30-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1.0 μg of GS, 3 μm FeCl3, various concentration of BCP and either 10 mm DTT or 10 mm ascorbate, was incubated at 37 °C, and then 0.5 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the remaining activity of GS was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. To determine the thioredoxin (Trx)-linked antioxidant activity of BCP, the GS activity was measured in the reaction mixture containing 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1.0 μg of GS, 3 μm FeCl3, various concentrations of BCP, 10 mm ascorbate, 10.8 μm Trx, 3.9 μm thioredoxin reductase (TR), and 1 mmNADPH. A peroxidase reaction was performed in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.8 μmTrx, 0.3 μm TR, 0.26 mm NADPH, various concentrations of BCP, and 0.1 mmH2O2 or 0.1 mm t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) or 0.04 mm linoleic acid hydroperoxide at room temperature. Linoleic acid hydroperoxide was generated by incubating 0.1 mm linoleic acid with 10 μg/ml soybean lipoxygenase in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) at room temperature for 10 min (12.Roveri A. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The concentration of linoleic acid hydroperoxide was determined spectrophotometrically (ε234= 25,000 m−1 cm−1). At the appropriate time, 20 μl of reaction mixture was added to 1 ml of FOX1 reagent and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, at which time color development was virtually complete (13.Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The remaining amount of peroxide was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm. The peroxidase activity of BCP linked to NADPH oxidation via Trx system was monitored as the decrease of A 340 in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.8 μm Trx, 0.3 μm TR, 0.2 mm NADPH, and various concentrations of either H2O2 or t-butyl hydroperoxide. BCP was preincubated in the absence or presence of 2.5 mm DTT at 30 °C for 30 min, and then chemical modification was carried out in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.2 mg BCP, and 20 mmNEM or iodoacetamide at 30 °C for overnight as described previously (14.Lundblad R.L. Noyes C.M. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 55-93Google Scholar). For the modification of BCP with NBD-Cl, 75 nmol of BCP was reacted with 450 nmol of NBD-Cl in 50 mm potassium phosphate with 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 7.0 at 30 °C for 2 h as described previously (15.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) at 4 °C. The NBD-treated BCP protein was denaturated by 200 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 3 m guanidine-HCl. The resulting protein was washed with acetone, and the precipitate was suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and the protein was digested with trypsin for 3 h at 30 °C. The additional digestion with fresh trypsin was carried out overnight. The tryptic peptides were separated by a reversed phase C18 column (Kromasil, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) with a linear gradient of 10–45% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 45 min at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The peptides were simultaneously detected using a photodiode array detector (Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp) and a fluorescence detector (Shimadzu RF-10AXL). To construct the BCP promoter-lacZ fusion, the upstream sequence of the initiation codon of the BCP gene was prepared by PCR. The forward primer (5′-CCG GAA TTC AAA AGC AAG CAG ACA GAA CCG-3′) contains an EcoRI site (underlined), and the reverse primer (5′-CGC GGA TCC TAC TTA ACT CCA TCC TGT TCA TC-3′) contains a BamHII site (underlined). TheEcoRI/BamHI-digested PCR products were subcloned into EcoRI/BamHI-cut pRS415, and the resulting plasmid was used for transforming E. coli MC1061. Transformed cells were cultured aerobically or anaerobically in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. At mid-log phase or indicated culture time, the optical density at 600 nm was measured, and cells were harvested. The cells were resuspended in 700 μl of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 32 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, adjusted to pH 7.0) and were mixed with 35 μl of 0.1% SDS and 35 μl of chloroform by vortexing for 10 s. The reactions were started by adding 140 μl of 13 μm o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 350 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and then β-galactosidase activity was measured in terms of the increase of absorbance at 420 nm because of the production ofo-nitrophenol production. The activity was expressed as β-galactosidase units (16.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992Google Scholar). The null mutants were generated by the integrative disruption method. To construct the vector containing the bcp gene and its own promoter, PCR was carried out using the forward primer (5′-CCGGAA TTC AAA AGC AAG CAG ACA GAA CCG-3′), containing anEcoRI site (underlined), and the reverse primer (5′-CGCGGA TCC TCA GGC GTG TTC TTT CAG CCA GTT CAG-3′), containing the BamHI site (underlined), and then the PCR product was cloned into EcoRI/BamHI site of pT7–7. The resulting plasmid named pBCP. In the case of ahpC gene, the PCR product amplified using the forward primer (5′-GGAA TTC CAT ATG CAG GCA GGC ACT GAA GAT ACC-3′), containing a NdeI site (underlined), and the reverse primer (5′-CCC AAG CTTAGA TTT TAC CAA CCA GGT CCA GAG-3′), containing a HindIII site (underlined), was inserted into NdeI/HindIII site of pT7–7. The resulting plasmid was designated as pAhpC. To insert the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene into the bcp gene, PCR was performed using the forward primer (5′-GCAG GAT ATC ACC CGA CGC ACT TTG CGCC-3′), containing an EcoRV site (underlined), and the reverse primer (5′-GAAGG CCT GAA CCG ACG ACC GGG TCG-3′), containing aStuI site (underlined). For the disruption ofahpC gene, the reverse primer (5′-CCC AAG CTTAGA TTT TAC CAA CCA GGT CCA GAG-3′), containing PstI site (underlined), was used. Each PCR product was inserted into theEcoRV/StuI site of pBCP and Klenow-filledEcoRI/PstI site of pAhpC. The resulting plasmids were used as a template in PCR to produce 2.0- and 1.6-kilobase pair DNA fragments containing the bcp and ahpC genes disrupted by insertion of cat gene, respectively. These PCR products were used for transforming E. coli strain JC7623, and chloramphenicol-resistant cells were isolated. The amino acid sequence identity among the BCP homologous proteins is >35%. The consensus sequence surrounding the unique conserved Cys among the BCP homologues (GCT) (Fig. 1) suggested that the BCP homologue would be a new member of the TSA/AhpC family. The BCP homologue is distributed in most bacteria includingH. influenzae, H. pylori, and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1). To examine our speculation, E. coli BCP, a putative bacterial member of TSA/AhpC, was characterized. BCP was homogeneously purified from the E. coli recombinant highly overexpressing BCP (Fig.2 A). The homogeneous purity of the purified BCP was confirmed on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2 B). The BCP was detected at the molecular mass corresponding to that of monomer (18 kDa) regardless of the presence or absence of DTT. This result suggested that unlike E. coli AhpC, BCP exists as monomer even though it is in an oxidized state.Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of BCP protein.

Gutterridge J.M.C. Free Radical in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). It has been well known that the replacement of a thiol-containing electron donor with a non-thiol electron donor such as ascorbate (i.e. non-thiol MCO system) resulted in the complete loss of the antioxidant activity, because of the lack of a thiol-containing electron donor to the TSA/AhpC protein (9.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated such a thiol-dependent antioxidant activity exerted by BCP. Like TSA/AhpC protein, BCP prevented GS from the inactivation by a thiol MCO system, not by a non-thiol MCO system (Fig.3 A). The antioxidant activity of BCP in non-thiol MCO system was fully recovered by the addition of a Trx system comprised of NADPH, Trx, and Trx reductase (Fig.3 A). Taken together, these results suggested that BCP is a new member of TSA/AhpC family and also that the immediate electron donor to BCP is Trx. To investigate the peroxidase activity of BCP, we directly measured the peroxidase activity of BCP toward H2O2,t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide in terms of the removal of peroxides in the presence of Trx system. The removal rates of all these peroxides increased as the concentration of BCP was increased (Fig. 3, B–D). It is worth noting that among the peroxides as the substrate, linoleic acid hydroperoxide was most rapidly removed at an equivalent concentration of BCP. To examine the substrate selectivity of BCP among various peroxides, the peroxide-dependent peroxidase activities were examined in the presence of the Trx system. The NADPH consumption rate increased as a function of BCP concentration (data not shown). This result indicated that the peroxidase activity of BCP should be supported by the Trx system. The initial rate of peroxide consumption by BCP was directly measured at the various concentrations of H2O2,t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide in the presence of the Trx system. The analysis of each Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 4) showed that theK m values of BCP for H2O2,t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide were 47.8, 37.4, and 11.7 μm, respectively, andV max values for H2O2,t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide were 7.01, 1.93, and 8.23 μmol/min/μmol (i.e. 400, 110, 469 nmol/min/mg of protein), respectively. The value ofV max/K m of BCP for H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide were calculated to be 0.147, 0.052 and 0.703 μmol/min/μmol, respectively. The higher value ofV max/K m of BCP fort-butyl hydroperoxide than those of for H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide implied that BCP has a general hydroperoxidase activity. Thus, we suggest that BCP acts as a thioredoxin-dependent hydroperoxidase showing the substrate selectivity toward fatty acid hydroperoxide. Although most of TSA/AhpC proteins exist in an intermolecular disulfide-linked homodimer, several TSA/AhpC enzymes such as mammalian ORF6 (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and E. coli p20 proteins (9.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21.Kim H.K. Kim S.J. Lee J.W. Lee J.W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) exist in a monomer. BCP contains three cysteine residues (Cys-45, Cys-50, and Cys-99) as shown in Fig. 1. To gain the information about the catalytic cysteine of BCP, each cysteine residue was replaced with serine. The resulting recombinant (C45S, C50S and C99S) and wild-type proteins were homogeneously purified from the corresponding recombinants (data not shown). To determine the catalytic cysteine residue among the three putative cysteines, we examined the antioxidant activity of each recombinant protein to protect the inactivation of GS by thiol MCO system. Only C45S protein among three mutant proteins resulted in the complete loss of the antioxidant activity (Fig.5 A). In the presence of the Trx system, the peroxidase activities of mutant proteins were also determined directly by measuring the remaining amount of H2O2 (Fig. 5 B) or indirectly by monitoring the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm owing to the H2O2-dependent oxidation of NADPH (Fig. 5 C). As expected, only C45S protein did not show the Trx-dependent peroxidase activity. The activity analysis of three mutant proteins (C45S, C50S, and C99S) revealed that the Cys-45 is a primary catalytic site for the antioxidant reaction. Members of the TSA/AhpC family can be divided into two subgroups such as 1-Cys and 2-Cys groups according to the number of the conserved cysteines within the protein (3.Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-Cys protein exists as a homodimer. One mammalian member of the TSA/AhpC family, ORF6, as a 1-Cys protein contains one conserved Cys and thereby exists in monomer (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the nature of a functional cysteine residue (Cys-45), we reacted BCP with a thiol-specific modification reagent, iodoacetate or NEM, in the absence or presence of DTT (Fig.6). The modification of BCP, regardless of the presence or absence of DTT, resulted in the considerable loss of the antioxidant activity, which suggested that the SH group of the functional Cys-45 did not form the disulfide bond during the reduction reaction as did 2-Cys protein (6.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously reported that the functional Cys of 1-Cys TSA/AhpC, as in ORF6, exists in the form of sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) as a catalytic intermediate, which can be easily reduced to Cys-SH by DTT (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 18.Cho H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The functional Cys of NADH peroxidase also exists as Cys-SOH (19.Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that the functional Cys-45 of BCP may exist in the form of sulfenic acid like those of ORF6 and NADH peroxidase, we reacted BCP with an electrophilic reagent, NBD-Cl, as a trapping agent for Cys-SOH. The reagent can react with Cys-S-OH and Cys-SH groups and form the corresponding thiol adducts, which have their own characteristic absorbance maxima (347 nm for Cys-S(O)-NBD and 422 nm for Cys-S-NBD) (15.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The spectral analysis of NBD-Cl-treated BCP protein without DTT showed an absorbance maximum at 347 nm (data not shown), suggesting the existence of Cys-SOH in BCP. The NBD-Cl-treated BCP without DTT resulted in the complete loss of the antioxidant activity (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results could be taken as evidence supporting the existence of the functional Cys-45 as Cys-S-OH. In our attempt to identify the Cys-S(O)-NBD adducts within BCP, we analyzed the peptide(s) containing the Cys-S(O)-NBD adduct(s) by spectral analysis of tryptic digest derived from the NBD-Cl-treated BCP at the absorbance maximum (347 nm). The analysis of the tryptic peptide profiles (Fig. 7) suggested that at least two different Cys residues within BCP were reacted with NBD-Cl and resulted in the formation of the Cys-S(O)-NBD adduct. The peptide peaks (Fig. 7, a and b) were identified as the peptides containing Cys-45/Cys-50 and Cys-99, respectively, using the C99S mutant (data not shown). The fluorescence analysis of the tryptic digest at 527 nm (excitation at 422 nm) showed that unlike the peptide eluting at 37 min (peptide b), the peptide eluting at 24 min (peptide a) did not emit the fluorescence, which indicted that the peptide a contained only the Cys-S(O)-NBD adduct, not Cys-S-NBD adducts, which emit the fluorescence at 527 nm, a characteristic fluorescence of the Cys-S-NBD adduct (15.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results collectively suggested that the functional Cys-45 of BCP (located within the peptide a) probably exists in the form of sulfenic acid (in its oxidation state). Most thiol peroxidase genes, including E. coli p20, are inducible by oxidative stress (20.Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21.Kim H.K. Kim S.J. Lee J.W. Lee J.W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To investigate the inducibility ofbcp gene by oxygen stress, we fused the bcppromoter region to lacZ gene and measured the β-galactosidase activities expressed in the cells cultured aerobically and anaerobically. As shown in Fig.8 A, the fused lacZ activity was increased 3-fold in response to the oxygen stress. Also, the expression level of the fused lacZ gene gradually elevated during exponential growth until mid-log phase growth, beyond which the expression level was decreased (Fig. 8 B). The higher expression level of β-galactosidase in the exponentially growing cells could be explained in terms of rapid oxygen metabolism during the growth in which ROS would be relatively highly produced. Taken together, these results suggested that BCP acting as an in vivo antioxidant is an inducible protein in response to oxygen stress. To investigate the in vivo antioxidant function of BCP, we made bcp null mutant (Δbcp) by an integrative disruption method. We also constructedahpC null mutant (ΔahpC) with the same method as a control experiment. The disruption of each gene was confirmed by the colony PCR. As expected, the PCR products obtained from Δbcp and ΔahpC cells (2.0 and 1.6 kilobase pairs, respectively) were longer than those obtained from wild-type cells (1.15 and 0.78 kilobase pair, respectively) (data not shown), implying that the bcp andahpC genes were disrupted by the insertion of catgene. The Δbcp, ΔahpC, and their isogenic wild-type strain were cultured aerobically on LB media. The growth rates of null mutants were slower than that of the wild-type cells (Fig.9). The viabilities of null mutant cells were also lower than that of wild-type cells (Fig.10 A). The sensitivities of each null mutation toward the various oxidants were examined. The null mutants showed hypersensitivity toward H2O2 andt-butyl hydroperoxide (Fig. 10, B andC, respectively). The low viability and the peroxide hypersensitivity of the Δbcp mutant could be complemented by the expression of bcp gene (Fig. 10, D–F). These results collectively suggest that BCP acts as an antioxidant in vivo.Figure 10Sensitivity of E. coli BCP (Δbcp) and AhpC (ΔahpC) null mutants toward various oxidants (B and C) and the complementation by expression of their own genes (E and F). Wild-type strain (E. coli JC7623), Δbcp, and ΔahpCwere compared for their ability to grow on LB plates without H2O2 (A), with H2O2 (B), with t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) (C).

These data are the first demonstration that BCP is a new bacterial member of the TSA/AhpC family, which catalyzes the Trx-dependent reduction of hydroperoxide. Assay with H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide as substrates indicated activity similar to that with selenium GSH peroxidase (i.e. several hundred nmol/min/mg of protein). In mammals, GSH peroxidase acts as a general hydroperoxide peroxidase to remove H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides, including fatty acid hydroperoxides (1.Halliwell B. Gutterridge J.M.C. Free Radical in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 2.Michiels C. Raes M. Taussaint O. Remacle J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of BCP toward linoleic acid hydroperoxide (469 nmol/min/mg) is comparable with that of mammalian liver GSH peroxidase toward linoleic acid hydroperoxide (23.Mosialou E. Andersson C. Lundqvist G. Andersson G. Bergman T. Jornvall H. Morgenstern R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24.Forstrom J.W. Stults F.H. Tappel A.L. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1979; 193: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the basis of our results, we propose the reaction mechanism of BCP, which catalyzes the reduction of peroxides via cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). The cysteinyl sulfenic acid is reduced to Cys-SH by the catalyzing action of Trx. The reaction mechanism is similar to those of mammalian ORF6 (a 1-Cys TSA/AhpC) and selenium (Se)-dependent GSH peroxidase, which catalyze the reduction of peroxides via Cys-SOH and Cys-SeOH, respectively (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 25.Ladenstein R. Epp O. Bartels K. Jones A. Huber R. Wendel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 199-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The sulfenic acid form of GSH peroxidase is reduced to Cys-SeH by GSH. However, an immediate electron donor to ORF6 remains unsolved. There are several experimental evidence, supporting our proposed reaction mechanism of BCP. We have suggested that the functional Cys-45 of BCP, which is involved in the reduction reaction as a primary catalysis with the use of Trx as its immediate electron donor, could exist in the form of sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). C50S and C99S mutant proteins still exert strong activity, but C45S does not, excluding the possibility of the formation of an intradisulfide bond between Cys-45 and other Cys residues within BCP as a part of the catalytic cycle. BCP, one-Cys TSA/AhpC protein, exists in the form of a monomer in oxidation conditions, which also eliminates the involvement of an interdisulfide linkage in the catalytic cycle as does 2-Cys TSA/AhpC (6.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence surrounding the unique conserved Cys among the bacterial BCP subfamily (GCT) (Fig. 1) lessened the possibility that the other Cys residues such as Cys-50 and Cys-99 might be involved in the catalysis. The proposed mechanism is summarized as follows. Tpx­SH45+H2O2→Tpx­Cys­S­OH+H2O Tpx­S­OH+HS­Trx­SH→Tpx­S­S­Trx­SH→ Tpx­SH45+oxidized Trx REACTIONSwhere Tpx is thiol peroxidase. In conclusion, bacterial BCP as a TSA/AhpC subfamily is a novel type of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase exerting a general hydrogen peroxide peroxidase activity. It has been known that E. coli contains two members of the TSA/AhpC family (p20 and AhpC). One TSA/AhpC member, p20, exists in the periplasmic space, and the other member exists in the cytoplasm of E. coli (9.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both types (p20 and AhpC) catalyze the reduction of peroxides supported by Trx and AhpF52, respectively (8.Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Unlike AhpC, BCP and p20 utilizes the Trx system as an immediate electron donor to the reduction reaction. In addition to the peroxidase activity to remove H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide, BCP showed fatty acid hydroperoxide-selective peroxidase activity. These different kinetic properties among three TSA/AhpC members may imply their physiological significance in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2076131352,"Autotaxin (ATX), an exo-nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase, was originally isolated as a potent stimulator of tumor cell motility. In order to study whether ATX expression affects motility-dependent processes such as invasion and metastasis, we stably transfected full-length ATX cDNA into two non-expressing cell lines, parental and ras-transformed NIH3T3 (clone7) cells. The effect of ATX secretion on in vitro cell motility was variable. The ras-transformed, ATX-secreting subclones had enhanced motility to ATX as chemoattractant, but there was little difference in the motility responses of NIH3T3 cells transfected with atx, an inactive mutant gene, or empty vector. In MatrigelTM invasion assays, all subclones, which secreted enzymatically active ATX, demonstrated greater spontaneous and ATX-stimulated invasion than appropriate controls. This difference in invasiveness was not caused by differences in gelatinase production, which was constant within each group of transfectants. In vivo studies with athymic nude mice demonstrated that injection of atx-transfected NIH3T3 cells resulted in a weak tumorigenic capacity with few experimental metastases. Combination of ATX expression with ras transformation produced cells with greatly amplified tumorigenesis and metastatic potential compared to ras-transformed controls. Thus, ATX appears to augment cellular characteristics necessary for tumor aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2327039151,"Germ-line mutations of the LKB1 gene cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation, predisposition to benign hamartomas of the gastrointestinal tract and also to several types of tumors. However, somatic mutations of this gene are very rare. To examine inactivation of LKB1 by epigenetic mechanisms, we investigated a series of primary tumors and cancer cell lines, for hypermethylation affecting the CpG island located in the 5' region of the LKB1 gene using Methylation-specific PCR (MSP). First, we screened 51 cancer cell lines. Only three colorectal and one cervical carcinoma cell lines were methylated at LKB1, and loss of the LKB1 transcript was demonstrated. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored LKB1 expression. To address the incidence of LKB1 epigenetic inactivation in primary tumors, we analysed colorectal, breast, gastric, pancreatic, thyroid, bladder and testicular carcinomas (n=195). Normal tissues from the mentioned organs were unmethylated in this region. Among the described tumors, only one colorectal carcinoma and three testicular tumors displayed LKB1 promoter hypermethylation. Further study of those histological types more commonly associated with PJS, demonstrated that LKB1 promoter hypermethylation was present in five of 11 (45%) papillary breast carcinomas. Finally, in three patients with a strong family story suggestive of PJS disease, abnormal LKB1 methylation was found in four of 22 (18%) hamartomatous polyps lesions. Our findings provide an alternative pathway for inactivation of the LKB1 tumor suppressor gene involving promoter hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2035821927,"The MDR1 promoter is subject to control by various internal and external stimuli. We have previously shown that the CCAAT box-binding protein, NF-Y, mediates MDR1 activation by the histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A and sodium butyrate, through the recruitment of the co-activator, P/CAF. We have now extended our investigation to the activation of MDR1 by genotoxic stress. We show that activation of the MDR1 promoter by UV irradiation is also dependent on the CCAAT box (−82 to −73) as well as on a proximal GC element (−56 to −42). Gel shift and supershift analyses with nuclear extracts prepared from human KB-3-1 cells identified NF-Y as the transcription factor interacting with the CCAAT box, while Sp1 was the predominant factor binding to the GC element. Mutations that abrogated binding of either of these factors reduced or abolished activation by ultraviolet irradiation; moreover, co-expression of a dominant-negative NF-Y protein (NF-YA29) reduced UV-activated transcription. Interestingly, YB-1, a transcription factor that also recognizes the CCAAT motif and had been reported to mediate induction of the MDR1 promoter by ultraviolet light, was incapable of interacting with the double-stranded MDR1 CCAAT box oligonucleotide in nuclear extracts, although it did interact with a single-stranded oligonucleotide. Furthermore, a mutation that abolished activation of MDR1 by UV-irradiation had no effect on YB-1 binding and co-transfection of a YB-1 expression plasmid had arepressive effect on UV-inducible transcription. Taken together, these results indicate a role for both NF-Y and Sp1 in the transcriptional activation of the MDR1 gene by genotoxic stress, and indicate that YB-1, if involved, is not sufficient to mediate this activation."

Based on the nucleotide sequence, the SCC-S2 open reading frame contains a sequence in the amino terminus that shows a significant homology to death effector domain II of cell death regulatory protein, Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (FLIP). Unlike FLIP, the SCC-S2 open reading frame contains only one death effector domain and lacks the carboxyl-terminal caspase-like homology domain, raising the possibility that SCC-S2 may be a novel member of the FLIP family. SCC-S2 mRNA expression is found in most normal tissues and malignant cells. The steady state level ofSCC-S2 mRNA is significantly induced by TNF-α in different tumor cells (TNF-α at 20 ng/ml for 3 h: A549, ∼2–9-fold; SKOV-3, ∼3-fold; PCI-04A, ∼3–6-fold). TNF-α treatment (100 ng/ml, 4 h) of HeLa cells transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged SCC-S2 cDNA or expression vector alone led to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells as compared with the untreated counterpart. Interestingly, however,SCC-S2 transfectants revealed a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells as compared with the vector transfectants (p < 0.001).

The caspase activation appears to be triggered by some members of the TNFR1 superfamily, including TNFR1 (p55/CD120a) and TNFR2 (p75/CD120b), and Fas/Apo-1 (CD95). TNF binds to TNFR1, and FasL binds to Fas. TNFR1 and Fas, also known as death receptors, are characterized by the presence of a cytoplasmic sequence motif called the death domain, which interacts with the death domain of the adaptor molecules FADD and TNFR-associated death domain, recruiting them to the membrane. TNFR-associated death domain interacts with FADD, and FADD, in turn, associates with an apical caspase, FLICE (caspase 8/MACH/Mch5), through death effector domains (DEDs) present at the carboxyl terminus of FADD and the amino terminus of FLICE, resulting in the assembly of a receptor-associated death-inducing signaling complex. Death-inducing signaling complex-associated FLICE signals proteolytic activation of downstream caspases, ultimately leading to apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Because ligand activation of a death receptor does not lead to apoptosis in all cell types, it has been suggested that natural cell death inhibitory molecules may exist in certain cells.

FLIPs contain two DEDs in the amino terminus and are represented by two splice variants: FLIP(L), the long form, and FLIP(S), the short form. Carboxyl-terminal extension of the longer variant shows homology to the caspase-like protease homology domain but lacks active site cysteine, suggesting that it is devoid of proteolytic activity. These proteins bind to FLICE through DEDs, blocking the binding and proteolytic activation of effector caspases. Consistent with these findings, a viral homologue of cellular FLIP (v-FLIP) identified in herpes and Molluscum contagiosumviruses exhibits antiapoptotic activity, and overexpression of cellular FLIP suppresses FasL and TNF-α-induced apoptosis (5.Thome M.

During the course of a search for genes differentially expressed in human tumor cell lines established from primary and matched (from the same patient) metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we identified a ∼2.0-kb transcript, corresponding to a partial cDNA clone SCC-S2, amplified in a metastatic and radioresistant HNSCC-derived cell line (PCI-06B) as compared with its matched primary tumor-derived cell line (PCI-06A) (17.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Eur. J. Cancer Oral Oncol. 1997; 33: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PCI-06B cells are also resistant to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity (18.Sacchi M. Klapan I. Johnson J.T. Whiteside T.L. Arch. Otolaryngol.

The present studies were undertaken to isolate the full-length SCC-S2cDNA, determine the effect of TNF-α on SCC-S2 mRNA level in cancer cells, and examine the possible antiapoptotic function of SCC-S2. Our data suggest that SCC-S2 cDNA encodes a novel protein. The putative open reading frame (ORF) of SCC-S2 revealed significant homology with DED II of mouse and human FLIP proteins.SCC-S2 mRNA was expressed in most human normal tissues and cancer cell lines. We have confirmed the previous observation of a relatively higher steady state level ofSCC-S2 mRNA in PCI-06B cells compared with PCI-06A cells and demonstrated a significant TNF-α-inducible expression ofSCC-S2 mRNA in different tumor cell types. In addition, transient expression of FLAG epitope-tagged SCC-S2 protein in HeLa cells led to a decrease in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in the presence or absence of TNF-α as compared with the vector transfectants. HNSCC cell lines PCI-06A, PCI-06B, and PCI-04A (19.Heo D.S. Snyderman C. Gollin S.M. Pan S. Walker E. Deka R. Barnes E.L. Johnson J.T. Herberman R.B. Whiteside T.L.

The other human tumor cell lines were grown in improved minimal essential medium (Cellgro) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. A human heart cDNA library in λZapII vector (Stratagene) was screened using a 32P-labeledSCC-S2 partial cDNA fragment as probe (17.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Eur. J.

The filters were hybridized at 42 °C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and 200 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washings at 55 °C, three times in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and three times in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The filters were rinsed twice in 2× SSC, damp dried, and autoradiographed. The positive clones were isolated after five cycles of amplification and screening. The cDNA insert (1519 bp) from a positive clone (ID DK721) was subcloned into pBluescript (+) vector by in vivo excision according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Both strands of theSCC-S2 cDNA (1519 bp) were sequenced by automated sequencing using Applied Biosystems Prism 377 DNA sequencer and an Applied Biosystems Prism Dye terminator cycle reaction kit. Raw data files from the ABI 377 sequencer were imported into the Auto Assembler program (ABI). Contigs were generated by comparing all fragments in one project with the parameters of at least 50 bp of overlap and at least a 75% level of homology. The assembled sequence was used to find a matching IMAGE consortium EST clone AA 406630 from the human EST data base (20.Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression EST clone AA 406630 was purchased from Genome Systems and sequenced as above. The sequences were assembled using the Auto Assembler program, and the complete sequence was then subjected to data base search. Sequence data base search and ORF prediction were done using the National Center for Biotechnological Information BLAST and ORF finder programs on the World Wide Web (21.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the MultiAlign program (22.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). A search for the presence of different motifs and signature sequences was conducted. The prediction of the possible nature of putative protein based on structural characteristics was done by Reinhardt's method (23.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). 2During the preparation of this report, a GenBankTM data base search revealed that theSCC-S2 sequence reported in this study matched withGG2–1 mRNA (accession number AF070671; Ref. 43.Horrevoets A.J.G. Fontijn R.D. Zonneveld A.J.V. De Vries C.J.M. Cate J.W.T. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3418-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andMDC-3.13 isoform 1 mRNA (accession number AF099936). In addition, expressed sequence tags representing potential mouse andDrosophila homologues of human SCC-S2 cDNA were identified (accession numbers AA116718 and AA817594). Logarithmically growing cells were switched to serum-free medium for 2 h prior to the addition of the indicated amounts of TNF-α (R & D Systems), followed by incubations for various times as described before (24.Kasid U. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 173: 193-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Acta Oncol. 1998; 37: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications (Life Technologies, Inc.). For Northern analysis, total RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred overnight to nylon membrane (Qiagen), and fixed by UV cross-linking, and the membrane was baked at 80 °C for 2 h. The multitissue blots H, H2, H3, F, and C, containing poly(A)+ RNA from adult and fetal tissues and various cancer cell lines, were purchased fromCLONTECH. 106 cpm/ml32P-labeled SCC-S2 cDNA (∼1.5 kb, ID DK721) was used as probe, and hybridizations were performed at 68 °C using ExpressHyb (CLONTECH), followed by washings with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 68 °C as described before (17.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Eur. J. Cancer Oral Oncol. 1997; 33: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 674-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were reprobed with radiolabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or β-actin probe as an internal control. The autoradiographs were scanned and bands quantified using ImageQuant software, version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer). cDNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of SCC-S2 (nucleotides 1–697, Fig. 1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using human placental cDNA (CLONTECH). The 5′- and 3′-primers used for amplification were 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCCCGCCGGCTCTAACC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGAATTCTCA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC TATGTTCTCTTCATCCAAC-3′, respectively. The sequence underlined in the 3′-primer corresponds to the FLAG octapeptide (Sigma). The amplified product (734 bp) was verified by automated sequence analysis of both strands and cloned into the mammalian expression vector PCR 3.1 according to the instruction manual (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were seeded in six-well plates (1–2 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with the expression vector PCR 3.1 or recombinant vector containing FLAG-tagged SCC-S2 cDNA (2 μg/well) using the LipofectAMINETM method (Life Technologies, Inc.). 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin), followed by microcentrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie G250 protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates (25–50 μg) were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma). Enhanced chemiluminescence method (Luminol, NEN Life Science Products) was used to detect the signal. The blot was reprobed with human polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (Trevigen) Hela cells were transiently transfected with vector or FLAG epitope-tagged SCC-S2 cDNA as described above. 30 h after transfection, cells were switched to medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 1 h and then treated with TNF-α (100 ng/ml) for an additional 4 h. After treatment, floating cells were pooled with the adherent cells collected by trypsinization and fixed in 2 ml of 75% ethanol for at least 30 min at 4 °C. For the FACS analysis of sub-G1 cells, the fixed cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 50 μg/ml each of RNase A (Sigma) and propidium iodide (Sigma). The stained cells were analyzed using a FACsort (Becton Dickinson), and Reproman computer software. The percentage of cells containing sub-G1 DNA content was used as an index of apoptosis as described (27.Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar, 28.Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The screening of a human heart cDNA library with a partialSCC-S2 cDNA probe (259 bp; Ref. 17.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Eur. J. Cancer Oral Oncol. 1997; 33: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) led to the identification of a clone containing 1519-bp cDNA insert (ID DK721). A BLAST search of the EST data base with this sequence resulted in the identification of a 5′-overlapping EST clone (AA 406630). The assembled nucleotide sequence was 1915 bp, with a predicted ORF of 188 amino acids and an in-frame stop codon 5′ to the first ATG (Fig.1). The sequence contained 133 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and 1215 bp of the 3′-untranslated region. The polyadenylation signal sequence could be located in the 3′-untranslated region. SCC-S2 cDNA encoded a putative cytosolic protein with predicted relative molecular mass of 21 kDa. A search for the known motifs and protein family signature sequences revealed three putative casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and one protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Fig. 1). A BLAST search of the ORF suggested that SCC-S2 is a novel protein. The sequence contained a putative DED that showed significant homology with DED II of the FLIP family of cell death regulatory proteins. The putative DED domain in SCC-S2 showed identities (similarities) as follows: mouse CASH α/β, 35% (58%); human CASH α/β, 27% (50%); mouse FLIP(L), 32% (53%); and human FLIP(L), 27% (58%) (Figs. 1 and 2 A). Identity higher than 25% is considered significant (29.Blundel T.L. Sibanda B.L. Sternberg M.J.E. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The death domains and/or DEDs are important protein-protein interaction domains in death receptors, including TNFR1, and adaptor molecules such as TNFR-associated death domain, FADD, FLICE, and receptor-interacting protein. Based on the known structure-function relationships of FLIP proteins, the presence of a putative DED domain in the amino terminus and the absence of a caspase catalytic domain in the carboxyl terminus suggest that SCC-S2 may serve as a dominant negative inhibitor of the DED containing molecules such as FLICE. Interestingly, the SCC-S2 DED shared only 9 and 11% identity with DED in mouse FLICE and human FLICE (32 and 38% similarity), respectively (Fig. 2). It is not known as yet whether SCC-S2 interacts with and/or inhibits FLICE. Viral genomes are known to code for apoptosis inhibitory proteins, allowing increased viral replication to combat the host's apoptotic defense mechanism (5.Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

These inhibitors interact with Fas, TNF-receptor-related apoptosis-mediated protein, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor, and TNFR1 and block apoptotic signaling events. The poxvirus-encoded serpin CrmA and baculovirus gene product p35 exert inhibitory effects by binding directly to FLICE (36.Tewari M. Telford W.G. Miller R.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22705-22708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The putative SCC-S2 DED showed significant homology to the corresponding domains present in some viral proteins, sharing 30 and 46% identity (58 and 66% similarity) to human poliovirus coat proteins and canine adenovirus DNA polymerase, respectively (Fig.2 B). Relatively week identity (21%) and similarity (54%) of the SCC-S2 DED to vaccinia virus DNA polymerase were observed (Fig.2). Other features of the SCC-S2 ORF included the signature sequence for vinculin family talin binding region proteins (Fig. 2 C). This sequence indicated 20% identity (44% similarity) to human α1(E)- and α2(E)-catenins, a class of proteins known to play a role in epithelial cell-cell contacts (37.Oda T. Kanai Y. Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SCC-S2 transcript (∼2.0 kb) was detectable in most human normal tissues, with relatively higher levels in spleen, lymph node, thymus, thyroid, bone marrow, and placenta and lower levels in spinal cord, ovary, lung, adrenal glands, heart, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3). Among the fetal tissues examined, a prominent signal was seen in liver, lung, and kidney, whereas expression could not be detected in brain (Fig. 3).SCC-S2 mRNA was expressed in all cancer cell lines tested, with relatively higher levels in K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, MOLT 4 lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and A549 lung carcinoma cells and lower levels in SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 4). Consistent with our original findings (17.Patel S. Wang F.-H. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Eur. J. Cancer Oral Oncol. 1997; 33: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a 2.0-kb transcript was detected in PCI-06B cells, and SCC-S2 mRNA expression was reproducibly higher in PCI-06B cells than in PCI-06A cells (>2-fold) (Fig. 4).Figure 4Expression of SCC-S2transcript in human cancer cell lines.

We asked whether TNF-α treatment of cells results in the induction of SCC-S2mRNA. Data shown in Fig. 5 indicate a significant increase in the steady state level of SCC-S2mRNA in A549 lung carcinoma cells, SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells, and PCI-04A HNSCC cells (TNF-α at 20 ng/ml for 3 h: A549, ∼2–9-fold; SKOV-3, ∼3-fold; PCI-04A, ∼3–6-fold). It should be noted that A549 cells and SKOV-3 cells are resistant to TNF-α (38.Han S.K. Brody S.L. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,39.Morimoto H. Safrit J.T. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2609-2616PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced SCC-S2 mRNA was also noted in U373MG cells and human hepatoma HepG2 cells (data not shown). TNF-α-inducible gene expression has been associated with the presence of binding motifs of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 in the promoter region of several genes. Whether SCC-S2 promoter contains a TNF-α-responsive element(s) remains to be determined. To address the possibility of an antiapoptotic function of SCC-S2, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-taggedSCC-S2 cDNA expression vector (Fig.6, left panel). The efficiency of transient transfection was initially determined by co-transfection with pCMV β-galactosidase expression vector (CLONTECH), and the percentage of blue cells was reproducibly comparable in vector and SCC-S2 transfectants (data not shown). The increase in number of cells in sub-G1phase has been used as an indicator of apoptosis (40.Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our data show that TNF-α treatment of vector or SCC-S2 transfectants led to an increase in the number of cells in sub-G1 as compared with the untreated counterpart (Fig. 6, right panel). Interestingly, however, expression of exogenous SCC-S2 resulted in a significant decrease in number of cells in sub-G1 phase, in the presence or absence of TNF-α, as compared with vector transfectants (p < 0.001). These data suggest that SCC-S2 overexpression per se is a negative mediator of apoptosis. The molecular genetic factors that negate cell death and contribute to tumor progression can be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention (41.Kasid U. Pfeifer A.M. Brennan T. Beckett M.

Current investigations in our laboratory are designed to examine the functional significance of SCC-S2 in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2090937576,"APCL, a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, can deplete cytoplasmic beta-catenin like APC. However, as its biological function remains unclear, we have been using a yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that associate with its carboxyl region. Among several cDNA clones we isolated from a fetal-brain cDNA library as candidates, six included an identical sequence with significant homology to EB1, a protein known to bind to APC. The full-length cDNA of this novel homologue of EB1, named EB3, encoded a protein of 282 amino acids with 54% identity to EB1, and it was expressed preferentially in brain tissue on Northern blots. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that exogenous EB3, like EB1, is associated with the cytoplasmic microtubule network. Moreover, in these experiments EB3 and APCL appeared together in the perinucleus and the cytoplasmic microtubule network. Since APCL is also expressed highly and specifically in the central nervous system, APCL-EB3 interaction may be specific to the CNS, possibly involving stability and/or extension of microtubules during neuritogenesis."

The latter is governed by distinct sets of transcriptional regulators. Here we report the characterization of epithelium-specific Ets factor, family member 3 (ESE-3), a novel member of the ESE subfamily of Ets transcription factors. ESE-3 shows highest homology to two other epithelium restricted Ets factors, ESE-1 and ESE-2. ESE-3, like ESE-1 and ESE-2, is exclusively expressed in a subset of epithelial cells with highest expression in glandular epithelium such as prostate, pancreas, salivary gland, and trachea. A potential role in branching morphogenesis is suggested, since ESE-3 transactivates the c-MET promoter via three high affinity binding sites. Additionally, ESE-3 binding to DNA sequences in the promoters of several glandular epithelium-specific genes suggests a role for ESE-3 in later stages of glandular epithelium differentiation. Although ESE-3 and ESE-1 bind with similar affinity to various Ets binding sites, ESE-3 and ESE-1 differ significantly in their ability to transactivate the promoters containing these sites.

Several members of the Ets family, including ets-1 and E1-AF, have also been directly implicated in tumor invasiveness (25.Wernert N. Raes M.B. Lassalle P. Dehouck M.P. Gosselin B. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 85% of cancers (carcinomas and adenomas) originate as a result of aberrant gene expression in mainly glandular epithelial tissues, leading to defects in epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. Although many aspects of epithelium-specific gene expression have been determined, only a few epithelial cell-restricted transcriptional regulators are characterized to date. Because many Ets factors have been implicated in the development of cancer, epithelium-specific Ets factors may be prime candidates for being involved in certain epithelial tumors. We and others have recently discovered ESE-11 (also called ESX, jen, ELF3, and ERT), the prototype of an epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor subfamily (26.Oettgen P. Alani R.M.

ESE-1 is expressed in a variety of simple and stratified epithelia with particularly high expression in the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract and in fetal lung. ESE-1 expression is highly inducible upon differentiation of keratinocytes correlating with induction of the terminal differentiation gene SPRR2A (26.Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L.

Finally, in mouse mammary gland, ESE-1 expression increases during first pregnancy in association with ductal budding, branching and the emergence of lobuloalveolar structures. Weaning also induces a dramatic increase in expression in association with glandular involution, suggesting that ESE-1 has a primary role in directing mammary gland remodeling and the early differentiation of ductal epithelium. As maximal induction of ESE-1 occurs during involution of mammary and prostate gland, this suggests an association with epithelial apoptosis (32.Neve R. Chang C.-H. Scott G.K. Wong A. Friis R.R.

Using computer-assisted EST library screening, we have identified two additional highly tissue-restricted members of the novel epithelium-specific Ets factor ESE subfamily: ESE-2 (epithelium-specific Ets factor, family member 2) (33.Oettgen P. Kas K. Dube A. Gu X. Grall F. Thamrongsak U. Akbarali Y. Finger E. Boltax J. Endress G. Munger K. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. J. Biol.

A novel human expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA fragment with significant homology to the Ets domain of human ESE-1 (26.Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) was identified in the Millennium EST data base using the tBLASTN program (NCBI, Ref. 34.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70703) Google Scholar). The corresponding sequence was chosen for further study. The 575-bp cDNA clone contained a putative open reading frame up to the 5′ end of this clone, suggesting that part of the 5′ end was missing. To determine the 5′ end of ESE-3, we performed the 5′ RACE method using human adult prostate cDNA ready for RACE (Marathon ready cDNA,CLONTECH) and nested primers specific for the partial ESE-3 cDNA, N1 (5′-CCCTCGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATA-3′) and N2 (5′-GGCTCTTGCTGGGGTCAAGAGGAT-3′) as described (35.Oettgen P.

Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned and sequenced as described (35.Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 5′ end sequence of the ESE-3 cDNA was confirmed by repeating 5′-RACE PCR amplification using primers specific for the 5′ end of the longest 5′-RACE products obtained in the first two rounds of PCR amplification. Nucleotide sequences were determined at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center DNA sequencing facility using an Applied Biosystems Automatic DNA Sequencer model 377 using the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis utilized DNA Strider, Lasergene (DNASTAR), and BLAST, BEAUTY and Clustal W searches (NCBI). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Expression of ESE-3 was examined by Northern blot hybridization using the 1.2-kb ESE-3b prostate cDNA clone as a probe. Human tissue RNA blots (2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA loaded/lane) and a master Northern blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from 49 different sources were purchased from CLONTECH, hybridized, and analyzed by autoradiography according to standard procedures as described (35.Oettgen P.

Each PCR reaction used equivalent amounts of 0.1 ng of cDNA, 4 ng/μl amounts of each primer, 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 150 μm amounts of each dNTP, 3 mmMgCl2, reaction buffer, and water to a final volume of 25 μl and were covered with mineral oil. The sequences of the ESE-3 primers were: sense (5′-CCTGGACACCAACCAGCTGGATGC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCTGAAGACGCCCTCAGATCGGTC-3′), with an expected amplification product of 309 bp. The sequences of the primers for GAPDH were: sense (5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′), with an expected amplification product of 200 bp. RT-PCR amplifications were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler 480 as follows: 20–30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Lower numbers of cycles were used to verify linearity of the amplification signal. 10 μl of the amplification product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. In vitrotranscription-translation was performed in TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) as described (36.Lopez M. Oettgen P.

The full-length ESE-3 cDNAs were inserted into theEcoRI site of the pCI (Promega) eukaryotic expression vector downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The MET promoter (GenBank accession no. Z26936), was amplified from human chromosome 7 DNA using the Advantage-GC cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH) with the following primers: sense (5′-CCCGGGGTGACACTCGCCTCCCAA-3′) and antisense (5′-TTTTACCTTTCGGTGCCCAGGAACC-3′). PCR amplifications were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler 480 as follows: 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C followed by 3 min at 68 °C. 10 μl of the 697-bp amplification product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, shuttled via the PCRII vector (Invitrogen) and blunt end cloned into the MluI site of the basic pGL2 luciferase vector (Promega). PSA and PSMA promoter reporter constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Gary Quinn. The SPRR2A and EndoA enhancer reporter constructs were described before (26.Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Five mutants of the MET promoter luciferase construct, MET Mut A (−125), MET Mut B (−83), MET Mut C (−65), MET Mut F (+378), and MET Mut A+B+C (−125, −83, and −65), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), converting the different ETS binding sites from GGAA to TTAA. The following primer sets were used: MET Mut A, A Mut UP (5′-GGGGCAGAGGCGGGATTAAACGCGACCCCCGC-3′) and A Mut LOW (5′-GCGGGGGTCGCGTTTAATCCCGCCTCTGCCCC-3′); MET Mut B, B Mut UP (5′-CGGCGCGGACGGCATTAAGGGCGGGGGCCG-3′) and B Mut LOW (5′-CGGCCCCCGCCCTTAATGCCGTCCGCGCCG-3′); MET Mut C, C Mut UP (5′-GGCGGGGGCCGATTTAACTCTGGGTGGTGCCA-3′) and C Mut LOW (5′-TGGCACCACCCAGAGTTAAATCGGCCCCCGCC-3′); MET Mut F, MET Mut F-UP (5′-GACTTCTCCACTGGTTAATGGGCACCGAAAG-3′) and MET Mut F-LOW (5′-CTTTCGGTGCCCATTAACCAGTGGAGAAGTC-3′). MET Mut A+C was generated using MET Mut A and the primers for MET Mut C. MET Mut A+B+C was generated using MET Mut A+C and the primers for MET Mut B. The cycling conditions consisted of 95 °C for 30 s and 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min. Constructs were sequenced to confirm the site-specific mutagenesis. Co-transfections of 3 × 105 cells were carried out with 2 μg of reporter gene construct DNA and 3 μg of expression vector DNA using 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (35.Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 16 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Transfections for every construct were performed independently in duplicates and repeated three to four times with two different plasmid preparations with similar results. Co-transfection of a second plasmid for determination of transfection efficiency was omitted because potential artifacts with this technique have been reported (39.Shirasuna K. Sato M. Miyazaki T. Cancer. 1981; 48: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and because many commonly used viral promoters contain potential binding sites for Ets factors. Homology searches of the Millennium EST data base revealed one human 575-bp EST with noticeable sequence similarity to the Ets domain of human ESE-1 (26.Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This cDNA clone, isolated from a human prostate cDNA library, contained an open reading frame up to the 5′ of this clone and a termination codon at the 3′ end, suggesting that part of the 5′ was missing. No poly(A) tail or polyadenylation sequence were present. The 5′ end was determined by the RACE method, as described under “Materials and Methods,” using RACE-ready human prostate cDNA. A composite cDNA, encoding the full-length open reading frame, was generated using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, which also confirmed the nature of the 5′ end. This novel member of the Ets gene family, and close homolog of ESE-1, was called ESE-3 (for epithelium-specific Ets factor, family member 3). Our RT-PCR analysis identified two different cDNA clones, representing alternative splice forms of ESE-3; ESE-3b contains an in-frame insertion of 69 nucleotides in the central region of ESE-3a. Using computer-assisted EST library screening, we discovered one human colon cDNA clone (clone 566368), the 5′ end of which (AA149006) overlapped with the partial 3′-UTR sequence of ESE-3. The insert of this cDNA clone was sequenced and extended our 3′-UTR sequence by 1140 bp. RT-PCR was used to confirm the colinearity of both sequences. Since the major transcript seen on Northern blots is 5.9 kb, we still lack a part of the 5′-UTR and/or the 3′-UTR of full-length ESE-3. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 277 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 32.3 kDa for ESE-3a and an open reading frame encoding a 300-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 34.9 kDa for ESE-3b (Fig. 1). ESE-3a lacks amino acids 159–181 (DLLDSKTFCRAQISMTTTSH-LPV), a region without homology to any known sequence in the public data bases. The ATG initiation codon only partially conforms to the consensus eukaryotic translation initiation sequence (GCC(A/G)CCATGG). An in-frame termination codon is present 12 bp upstream of the ATG. Three ATTTA motifs, associated with rapid mRNA turnover (40.Savant B.S. Cleveland D.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1927-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), are found in the 3′-UTR. A hydropathicity plot of the predicted amino acid sequences of ESE-3a and ESE-3b reveals primarily hydrophilic proteins through the entire sequence. The deduced amino acid sequences of ESE-3a and ESE-3b predict proteins rich in asparagine (8%), serine (7%), and leucine (11%). The amino-terminal half of ESE-3 is characterized by a high abundance of acidic residues (Fig. 1), whereas the carboxyl-terminal half contains many basic residues. The central portion of the protein contains a leucine- and serine-rich domain. Several potential phosphorylation sites are present in ESE-3b including two potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and one potential JNK/p38/ERK kinase phosphorylation sites ((S/T)P) in the central region of ESE-3, just behind the alternatively spliced exon (41.Marin O. Meggio F. Draetta G. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 42.Songyang Z.S. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica W.H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). One remarkable feature is the presence of two stretches of glutamine residues between amino acids 42 and 123, interspersed with 5 or 6 amino acids. The significance of this signature (if any) is presently unclear. Protein sequence homology and conservation between various Ets family members has proven useful in identifying functional domains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of ESE-3 with those of other members of the Ets family revealed that ESE-3, together with ESE-1 and ESE-2, constitute a new, separate subfamily (Fig.2). Indeed, alignment of the carboxyl-terminal Ets domain of ESE-3 with that of other members of the Ets family reveals ESE-3 is 84% and 65% identical to the ESE-1 and ESE-2 Ets domains, respectively. Alignment of the Ets domain of ESE-3 with that of other members of the Ets family, besides ESE-1 and ESE-2, reveals highest homology to E74 (51%), NERF (49%), MEF (48%), ELF-1 (48%), and ERP (46%) (Fig.3 A). This degree of homology, however, is far below the homologies that are characteristic among known members of the Ets family. Sequence identity to other members of the Ets family is in the range of 36–51%. ESE-3 is least related to Spi-B (36%). Besides the highly conserved Ets DNA binding domain (amino acids 206–288), the amino terminus of ESE-3 contains a region (amino acids 42–112) with significant homology to the Pointed domain present in ESE-2. The identity of the Pointed domain does not exceed 30% with several other members of the Ets family including TEL, YAN, POINTED, ETS-1, ETS-2, ERG, FLI-1/ERG-B, and GABP-α/E4TF1–60 (Fig.4 A). The conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site found in the Pointed domain of ets-1, ets-2, and Drosophila Pointed, however, is lacking in the ESE family members (43.Brunner D. Ducker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klambt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the 26 known mammalian and 7 Drosophila Ets family members were aligned with the Clustal W program (44.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibso"

To evaluate gain-of-function NOTCH-4/INT-3 activity in human cancers we have surveyed human breast, lung, and colon carcinoma tissue culture cell lines for evidence of increased NOTCH-4/INT-3 RNA expression. High levels of a 1.8 Kb NOTCH-4/INT-3 RNA species are detected in normal human testis but not in other tissues where a 6.5 Kb species is prevalent. Transformed human cancer cell lines express the 1.8 Kb NOTCH-4/INT-3 RNA species. We show that this RNA species encodes a truncated form of the NOTCH-4/INT-3 intracellular domain (ICD). This novel NOTCH-4/INT-3 protein includes the CDC10 repeats and amino acid residues C-terminal to them, but is missing the CBF-1 binding region of the NOTCH-4/INT-3 ICD. This suggests that it has a different mode of action. Furthermore, we show that a transgene which expresses the 1.8 Kb NOTCH-4/INT-3 RNA species in the 'normal' human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A enables these cells to grow in soft agar."
https://openalex.org/W2325332983,"SHP-2, a SRC homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, mediates activation of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase by various mitogens and cell adhesion. Inhibition of endogenous SHP-2 by overexpression of a catalytically inactive (dominant negative) mutant in Chinese hamster ovary cells or Rat-1 fibroblasts has now been shown to induce a marked change in cell morphology (from elongated to less polarized) that is accompanied by substantial increases in the numbers of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion contacts. Overexpression of the SHP-2 mutant also increased the strength of cell-substratum adhesion and resulted in hyperphosphorylation of SHPS-1, a substrate of SHP-2 that contributes to cell adhesion-induced signaling. Inhibition of SHP-2 also markedly increased the rate of cell attachment to and cell spreading on extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and vitronectin, effects that were accompanied by enhancement of adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130Cas. In addition, cell migration mediated by fibronectin or vitronectin, but not that induced by insulin, was impaired by overexpression of the SHP-2 mutant. These results suggest that SHP-2 plays an important role in the control of cell shape by contributing to cytoskeletal organization, and that it is an important regulator of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, spreading, and migration as well as of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion contact-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1977039418,"Wild type p53 accumulates in the cytoplasm in a subset of tumors such as neuroblastomas and breast carcinomas through an unknown mechanism. Exclusion of p53 from the nucleus may lead to inactivation of p53 during tumor development. We present evidence that MDM2 plays a significant role in promoting the degradation of nuclear p53 in tumor cells with a cytoplasmic p53 phenotype. Inhibition of MDM2 expression using antisense oligonucleotide, inhibition of MDM2 function by the tumor suppressor ARF or a MDM2 deletion mutant result in the accumulation of nuclear p53. p53 point mutants deficient in MDM2 binding have increased nuclear localization. Inhibition of nuclear export by leptomycin B also results in retention of nascent p53 in the nucleus, suggesting that cytoplasmic distribution of p53 results from efficient export of nuclear p53 in combination with MDM2-mediated degradation. These results suggest that MDM2 is an important determinant of p53 subcellular distribution and may contribute to p53 inactivation without overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2090495738,"The docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane require the interaction of the vesicle-associated membrane protein VAMP with the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25. Both of these proteins behave as integral membrane proteins, although they are unusual in that they insert into membranes post-translationally. Whereas VAMP and syntaxin possess hydrophobic transmembrane domains, SNAP-25 does not, and it is widely believed that SNAP-25 traffics to and inserts into membranes by post-translational palmitoylation. In pulse-chase biosynthesis studies, we now show that SNAP-25 and syntaxin rapidly bind to each other while still in the cytosol of neuroendocrine and transfected heterologous cells. Cell fractionation studies revealed that cytosolic SNAP-25·syntaxin complexes then traffic to and insert into membranes. Furthermore, the association of SNAP-25 with membranes is dramatically enhanced by syntaxin, and the transmembrane domain of syntaxin is essential for this effect. Surprisingly, despite the importance of the SNAP-25 palmitoylation domain for membrane anchoring at steady state, removal of this domain did not inhibit the initial association of newly synthesized SNAP-25 with membranes in the presence of syntaxin. These data demonstrate that the initial attachment of newly synthesized SNAP-25 to membranes is a consequence of its association with syntaxin and that it is only after syntaxin-mediated membrane tethering that SNAP-25 is palmitoylated. The docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane require the interaction of the vesicle-associated membrane protein VAMP with the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25. Both of these proteins behave as integral membrane proteins, although they are unusual in that they insert into membranes post-translationally.

For this reason, investigation of the proteins regulating synaptic vesicle docking and fusion with presynaptic plasma membranes is essential for a complete understanding of the mechanisms regulating this complex process. Through a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, members of the SNARE family of proteins have been strongly implicated in the processes of vesicle docking and fusion (reviewed in Refs. 1.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 2.Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3.Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niemann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the synaptic vesicle itself is a member of the vesicle SNARE family of VAMP-like proteins, whereas on the presynaptic plasma membrane, there are the target SNARE (t-SNARE)1 proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25. To form a functional t-SNARE complex, syntaxin must first associate with SNAP-25 (4.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The binding of syntaxin to SNAP-25 induces a conformational change in SNAP-25 (5.Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that a preformed t-SNARE complex is necessary for the subsequent formation of the complete vesicle SNARE·t-SNARE complex (6.Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Following SNARE complex assembly, a poorly understood series of protein-protein, protein-lipid, and lipid-lipid interactions occur, with the net result of all of these interactions being the fusion of the opposing membranes and the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The t-SNARE syntaxin and the vesicle SNARE VAMP are carboxyl terminus-anchored transmembrane proteins with typical hydrophobic transmembrane domains. However, these proteins are unusual in that unlike most transmembrane proteins, they lack the signal sequence required for cotranslational insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and associate with membranes post-translationally (7.Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the t-SNARE SNAP-25 does not possess a hydrophobic transmembrane domain like syntaxin or VAMP, it does possess a central cysteine-rich “palmitoylation domain,” and the association of SNAP-25 with cellular membranes has been largely attributed to acylation of the molecule (9.Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or mutagenesis of individual cysteine palmitate acceptor sites (11.Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) almost completely prevents membrane association of mutant SNAP-25 at steady state. Syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 each post-translationally insert into membranes in the early secretory pathway, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum. From there, these molecules are believed to traffic through the Golgi to their site of action. At least for VAMP, insertion in proteoliposome membranes is ATP-dependent, but does not require the signal recognition particle receptor or the Sec61p complex (8.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), highlighting the novel mechanism of membrane insertion of this class of proteins. The trafficking of SNAP-25 to the plasma membrane of PC12 cells also follows the secretory pathway, as treatment of these cells with brefeldin A prevents plasma membrane targeting of SNAP-25 (12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Most important, this treatment almost completely prevents palmitoylation of SNAP-25, strongly suggesting that SNAP-25 must traffic to the plasma membrane before it can be palmitoylated (12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that palmitoylation alone can immobilize proteins onto membranes, it is likely that palmitoylation substrates must first associate (either transiently or stably) with membranes by a mechanism independent of palmitoylation (14.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436 (and references therein): 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For example, members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases are cotranslationally myristoylated, and this modification is essential for rapid membrane association and palmitoylation of the Src family member p59 fyn (15.van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, palmitoylation and membrane association of the G protein αi1 subunit require either myristoylation or, in the case of a myristoylation-defective mutant of Gαi1, binding to membrane-associated G protein β and γ subunits (16.Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these examples, the initial association with membranes is essential for subsequent palmitoylation of the substrate, as cellular palmitoyltransferases are not cytosolic and have been exclusively localized to intracellular membranes (17.Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18.Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23269-23276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unlike Src or G protein family members, SNAP-25 is not myristoylated, leaving unresolved the mechanism by which SNAP-25 initially associates with membranes, traffics through the secretory pathway, and is expressed on the plasma membrane, where it is subsequently palmitoylated. Since syntaxin efficiently inserts into membranes even in the absence of SNAP-25 (20.Jantti J. Keranen S. Toikkanen J. Kuismanen E. Ehnholm C. Soderlund H. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the biosynthesis and membrane association of the SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complex in the rat neuroendocrine PC12 cell line and in transfected heterologous cells. Using pulse-chase biosynthesis studies, we now show that newly synthesized SNAP-25 associates with syntaxin almost immediately after translation while the molecule still resides in the cytosol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the initial association of SNAP-25 with membranes does not require palmitoylation, as a palmitoylation mutant of SNAP-25 associates with cell membranes as efficiently as does wild-type (palmitoylated) SNAP-25. Rather, it is the binding of SNAP-25 to syntaxin that initially anchors SNAP-25 to membranes, and the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the syntaxin molecule is essential for membrane localization of the SNAP-25·syntaxin heterodimer. Human SNAP-25b in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 has been described previously (21.Low S.H. Roche P.A. Anderson H.A. van Ijzendoorn S.C.D. Zhang M. Mostov K.E. Weimbs T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3422-3430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding rat syntaxin 1A was obtained from Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and was subcloned into theHindIII/XbaI sites of pcDNA3. The palmitoylation mutant of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25Δ) (10.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Michael Veit (Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany) and was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. The transmembrane mutant of syntaxin 1A (encoding amino acids 1–266, termed syntaxin Δ) was generated using the polymerase chain reaction by the introduction of a stop codon in the reverse primer. The sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The cDNA encoding Tac in the vector pCDM8 and the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody 7G7 were obtained from Dr. Juan Bonifacino (NICHD, National Institutes of Health). The anti-SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals (Baltimore, MD), and the anti-syntaxin 1A monoclonal antibody was from Wako Bioproducts (Richmond, VA). The anti-calnexin antibody was the generous gift of Dr. Robert Wenthold (NIDCD, National Institutes of Health). The anti-VAMP monoclonal antibody C1 10.1 was obtained from Dr. Reinhard Jahn (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum and 10% fetal calf serum, and the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. Subconfluent HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated cDNAs using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were metabolically labeled 18–24 h after transfection. Mock transfections were performed using the empty pcDNA3 expression vector. PC12 cells and transiently transfected HeLa cells, each cultured in 10-cm tissue culture dishes, were washed with methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and pulse-labeled with 0.25 mCi of [35S]methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for either 15 min or 1 h and chased for up to 3 h (as indicated in the figure legends) at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline on ice; nuclei and other debris were removed by centrifugation; and specific immunoprecipitations using antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose were performed as described (22.Anderson H.A. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4850-4858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; either the proteins were then immunoblotted using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, NEN Life Science Products), or the gels were impregnated with Enlightening (NEN Life Science Products) and analyzed by fluorography. Band intensities from metabolic radiolabeling studies were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, whereas those of immunoblots were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. X-ray films were digitally scanned, and composite figures were generated using Adobe Photoshop. Adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, and ∼1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) and homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer (clearance of 10 μm) at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. This post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic) and pellet (membrane) fractions were then brought to equal volumes in a final buffer containing a 1:1 mixture of hypotonic buffer and Triton lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations using the specific antibodies described above were performed on equivalent fractions of each pool, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or by immunoblotting. At steady state, both SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1 are associated almost exclusively with neuronal membranes (23.Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 24.Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In addition, SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complexes have been detected not only at the presynaptic membrane, but also in transport vesicles undergoing fast axonal transport (25.Li J.Y. Jahn R. Dahlstrom A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 12-22PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Shiff G. Morel N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), demonstrating that t-SNARE complex assembly can occur prior to the arrival of these proteins at the plasma membrane. Since each of these proteins associates with membranes post-translationally, we examined the kinetics of t-SNARE assembly in vivo to determine if the components of the t-SNARE heterodimer come to reside on cellular membranes independently or as pre-assembled complexes. Pulse radiolabeling of the rat neuroendocrine PC12 cell line with [35S]methionine followed by cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with t-SNARE-specific antibodies revealed that syntaxin associated with SNAP-25 within 15 min of synthesis of the35S-labeled SNAP-25 polypeptide (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, we found that the amount of complex assembly observed after the pulse labeling was similar to that observed after a 3-h chase period in complete medium, demonstrating that t-SNARE complex assembly is rapid in PC12 cells. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that each antibody removed the majority of its ligand from the cell extract, and quantitative analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed that ∼20% of the pool of newly synthesized SNAP-25 was bound to syntaxin (data not shown). In addition, SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complexes were not observed when heterologous cells expressing SNAP-25 alone and syntaxin alone were mixed prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation (data not shown), indicating that the t-SNARE complexes observed above were not a post-solubilization artifact. Both syntaxin and SNAP-25 begin to associate with membranes ∼20 min after the completion of protein synthesis (12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20.Jantti J. Keranen S. Toikkanen J. Kuismanen E. Ehnholm C. Soderlund H. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since t-SNARE complex formation was essentially complete after our 15-min pulse labeling, we investigated the possibility that the t-SNARE complex resided in the cytosol prior to the insertion of the complex into membranes. PC12 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, and isolated subcellular fractions were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using control, anti-syntaxin, or anti-SNAP-25 antibodies. In agreement with previous studies, the anti-SNAP-25 immunoprecipitate revealed the presence of newly synthesized SNAP-25 in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions of these cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the anti-syntaxin immunoprecipitate revealed that t-SNARE complexes containing syntaxin and 35S-labeled SNAP-25 were present in both the cytosolic and membrane fraction of these cells after pulse labeling (Fig.1 B), clearly demonstrating that newly synthesized t-SNARE complexes are present in the cytosol of PC12 cells. Quantitative immunoblotting confirmed that intracellular membranes did not contaminate our cytosolic preparations. The isolated cytosolic fraction of PC12 cells contained barely detectable levels of the integral membrane protein calnexin, undetectable levels of syntaxin, and 12% of the total pool of SNAP-25 (Fig. 1 C). In addition, the cytosolic fraction did not contain detectable levels of the vesicle protein VAMP (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these results strongly argue against the possibility that endoplasmic reticulum membranes, plasma membranes, or synaptic-like microvesicle membranes contaminated our cytosol. The small amount of SNAP-25 present in the cytosol of PC12 cells is in agreement with previous results and represents the non-palmitoylated pool of SNAP-25 (10.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, these data confirm that our isolated cytosol was not significantly contaminated with membranes. To more precisely address the mechanism by which SNAP-25 and syntaxin associate with membranes in neuronal cells in vivo, we adopted a transfection system in heterologous cells using a variety of wild-type and mutant t-SNARE proteins. The HeLa cell line chosen for these studies does not express endogenous SNAP-25 or syntaxin 1 (data not shown) and therefore afforded us a means to assess the role of each of these proteins in membrane anchoring of t-SNARE complexes. We have previously demonstrated efficient palmitoylation of SNAP-25 in these cells under our experimental conditions, and the degree of palmitoylation of SNAP-25 correlated with the extent of membrane binding (27.Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase biosynthesis studies in transfected HeLa cells revealed that when expressed alone, 35S-labeled SNAP-25 was originally present in the cytosol, and even after a 3-h chase, only a small fraction of the pool of 35S-labeled SNAP-25 was associated with membranes (Fig.2 A). In agreement with the results obtained in PC12 cells, coexpression with syntaxin resulted in the detection of complexes of 35S-labeled SNAP-25 with35S-labeled syntaxin in the cytosolic fraction from pulse-labeled cells (Fig. 2 B). In addition, coexpression with syntaxin dramatically increased the association of35S-labeled SNAP-25 with the membrane fraction after a 3-h chase, and much of the 35S-labeled SNAP-25 present in the membranes was associated with 35S-labeled syntaxin (Fig.2 B), demonstrating that SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complexes formed in the cytosol trafficked to the membrane fraction during the chase period. During the course of these studies, we routinely observed that coexpression with syntaxin protected SNAP-25 from degradation. Whereas35S-labeled SNAP-25, when expressed alone, was rapidly degraded during a 3-h chase (Fig. 2 A), under identical culture conditions, there was essentially a complete recovery of35S-labeled SNAP-25 in cells expressing syntaxin (Fig.2 B). This argues that binding to syntaxin, a process known to alter the conformation of SNAP-25 (5.Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), also stabilizes SNAP-25 from (presumably cytosolic) degradation. To confirm the integrity of our cytosolic and membrane preparations in our transfection system, HeLa cells transiently expressing Tac, the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain, were subjected to the same pulse-chase and subcellular fractionation analyses described above. Unlike the t-SNARE proteins described above, 35S-labeled Tac was found exclusively in the membrane fraction of transfected HeLa cells both after the pulse labeling as well as after a 3-h chase (data not shown). Since Tac is an integral membrane protein like syntaxin and was not detected in the cytosolic fraction, these data demonstrate that the isolation of cytosolic SNARE complexes was not an artifact of transfection. We performed quantitative PhosphorImager analysis to assess the contribution of syntaxin to the membrane association of SNAP-25. Whereas only 14% of the total pool of 35S-labeled SNAP-25 was membrane-associated after a 3-h chase in the absence of syntaxin, coexpression with syntaxin resulted in the association of 47% of35S-labeled SNAP-25 with membranes (Fig.3). Furthermore, under these conditions, a sizable fraction (22%) of 35S-labeled SNAP-25 was membrane-associated even after the short pulse labeling, clearly showing that coexpression of syntaxin significantly enhances the association of newly synthesized SNAP-25 with membranes. Since syntaxin rapidly binds to SNAP-25 and also significantly enhances the association of SNAP-25 with membranes, we investigated the possibility that the syntaxin transmembrane domain contributed to the enhanced binding of SNAP-25 to membranes. We therefore generated a syntaxin mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain, and pulse-chase biosynthesis studies confirmed that whereas wild-type syntaxin resided exclusively in the membrane fraction, the transmembrane mutant of syntaxin (syntaxin Δ) resided exclusively in the cytosol (Fig.4). Identical results were obtained in anti-syntaxin immunoblot analysis of the isolated fractions (data not shown). When coexpressed, wild-type syntaxin and wild-type SNAP-25 formed complexes that were present in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 5 A). Since SNAP-25 was synthesized in excess of syntaxin in these studies, the anti-syntaxin immunoprecipitate indicates the status of the SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complex, and analysis of this immunoprecipitate revealed that most t-SNARE complexes were present in the membrane after the 3-h chase (Fig. 5 A). Coexpression of syntaxin Δ with a mutant of SNAP-25 that lacked all potential palmitoylation sites (SNAP-25Δ) resulted in efficient assembly of the t-SNARE complex (Fig. 5 B); however, in this case, the SNAP-25·syntaxin complexes were exclusively cytosolic and were not present in the membranes even after a 3-h chase. These data demonstrate that efficient assembly of t-SNARE complexes in vivo does not require the presence of the syntaxin transmembrane domain. Furthermore, these data show that the transmembrane domain of syntaxin and/or the palmitoylation domain of SNAP-25 is required for the association of t-SNARE complexes with membranes. Since SNAP-25 association with membranes has been attributed to fatty acylation in the central palmitoylation domain of SNAP-25 (9.Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11.Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13.Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we assumed that wild-type SNAP-25 would bring syntaxin Δ-containing t-SNARE complexes to membranes. Surprisingly, although t-SNARE complex assembly proceeded normally, the t-SNARE complexes remained exclusively in the cytosol (Fig. 5 C). This study also demonstrated that the ability of syntaxin to enhance SNAP-25 association with membranes was not merely a consequence of its binding to SNAP-25. The extent of SNAP-25 association with membranes under each condition described above was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and is shown in Fig.6. Since wild-type SNAP-25 efficiently associated with membranes in cells expressing wild-type syntaxin, but did not associate with membranes in cells expressing syntaxin Δ, we conclude that the palmitoylation domain of SNAP-25 alone is not sufficient to serve as the primary targeting signal for the initial association of SNAP-25 with membranes. Since the palmitoylation domain of SNAP-25 is insufficient to tether SNAP-25 to membranes in the presence of syntaxin Δ, we reasoned that the intact transmembrane domain of syntaxin may be required for the efficient association of newly synthesized SNAP-25 with membranes. To test this directly, we coexpressed wild-type syntaxin with the SNAP-25 palmitoylation mutant SNAP-25Δ. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that t-SNARE complexes containing SNAP-25Δ associated with membranes equally well as wild-type SNAP-25 after a 3-h chase (Fig.7). These data demonstrate that the presence of the palmitoylation domain of SNAP-25 is not necessary for SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complex association with membranes and show that the initial membrane anchoring of the complex is dependent on the transmembrane domain of syntaxin. It is widely believed that a preformed t-SNARE complex composed of SNAP-25 with syntaxin is essential for synaptic vesicles to dock and ultimately fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Many investigators have used the pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the association of neuronal SNARE proteins with membranes (7.Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A.

However, to our knowledge, the biosynthesis of SNAP-25·syntaxin complexes in vivo has not been addressed in this or any other cell type. We have recently found that syntaxin and SNAP-25 bind to each other very efficiently in transfected heterologous cells (27.Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and we have now examined the assembly and membrane association of newly synthesized endogenous t-SNARE complexes in PC12 cells. Using pulse-chase biosynthesis studies, we have found that SNAP-25 and the transmembrane t-SNARE syntaxin rapidly associate in these cells. In addition, subcellular fractionation studies confirmed that a significant pool of these t-SNARE complexes resides in the cytosol after a short pulse radiolabeling and traffics to membranes during a 3-h chase period, demonstrating that the t-SNARE complex of syntaxin and SNAP-25 forms in the cytosol prior to its translocation to membranes. To more completely study the mechanism of t-SNARE assembly, pulse-chase metabolic labeling studies in transfected heterologous cells were used to follow the trafficking of newly synthesized t-SNARE proteins to membranes. In addition to confirming our PC12 data revealing the presence of newly synthesized t-SNARE complexes in the cytosol, this approach revealed that the association of SNAP-25 with membranes was dramatically enhanced when SNAP-25 was coexpressed with wild-type syntaxin. Surprisingly, membrane association of wild-type SNAP-25 was almost completely blocked when SNAP-25 was coexpressed with a cytosolic transmembrane mutant of syntaxin, demonstrating that the transmembrane domain of syntaxin is responsible for the initial association of SNAP-25 with membranes. As further evidence for the importance of the transmembrane domain of syntaxin in SNAP-25 targeting, we found that even a palmitoylation mutant of SNAP-25 associated with membranes when coexpressed with wild-type syntaxin, and in this case, the extent of initial membrane association was comparable to that of wild-type SNAP-25. It is important to emphasize that, in this work, we have specifically addressed the mechanism of membrane targeting of newly synthesized SNAP-25 and not the palmitoylation of membrane-bound SNAP-25, an event that occurs later in the lifetime of the molecule. Numerous studies have demonstrated that palmitoylation of SNAP-25 is required for its stable association with membranes at steady state and that SNAP-25 palmitoylation mutants reside in the cytosol (9.Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have obtained similar results by Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant SNAP-25 (data not shown). However, in this study, we have concerned ourselves with the initial interaction of newly synthesized SNAP-25 with membranes, and our data clearly show that membrane association of either wild-type SNAP-25 or a palmitoylation mutant of SNAP-25 is dramatically enhanced by its binding to newly synthesized syntaxin. One of the most surprising findings of this study was our isolation of newly synthesized SNAP-25·syntaxin complexes in the cytosol of PC12 cells or transfected heterologous cells. It is highly unlikely that this result is a consequence of membrane contamination of our cytosol, as the cytosolic fraction contained undetectable levels of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein VAMP and only ∼6% of the total pool of syntaxin. This is important since ∼15% of all SNAP-25 and syntaxin are present on synaptic vesicles (29.Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and synaptic-like microvesicle contamination of our cytosol would significantly compromise our results. Like many C-terminal anchored membrane proteins, syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and associate with membranes only after the completion of protein synthesis using a novel “post-translational” mechanism of membrane insertion (7.Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising to find a small pool of newly translated protein in the cytosol en route to membranes. Since the association of newly synthesized syntaxin with membranes is rapid (20.Jantti J. Keranen S. Toikkanen J. Kuismanen E. Ehnholm C. Soderlund H. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3623-3633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and membrane-associated syntaxin is quite stable, the vast majority of syntaxin resides in the membrane fraction at steady state. Despite the fact that the kinetics of SNAP-25 trafficking to membranes are relatively slow, we and others have found that the half-life of the total pool of SNAP-25 in PC12 cells is ∼8 h (11.Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that the half-life of syntaxin-associated (and presumably palmitoylated) SNAP-25 in these same cells is ∼15 h. 2P. A. Roche, unpublished observations. Therefore, like syntaxin, SNAP-25 is also relatively stable, which favors the distribution of SNAP-25 into the membrane fraction at steady state. Newly synthesized SNAP-25 inserts into membranes only poorly in the absence of wild-type syntaxin or in the presence of a syntaxin transmembrane mutant; and thus, syntaxin appears to be functioning as a true molecular chaperone, escorting SNAP-25 into the secretory pathway, where it will ultimately be palmitoylated. This also suggests that the palmitoylation domain alone does not efficiently target SNAP-25 to membranes. In agreement with this, Gonzalo et al. (13.Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) recently showed that a SNAP-25/green fluorescent protein chimera containing the central region of SNAP-25 could traffic to membranes. However, mutagenesis of Gln116, Pro117, and Arg119, which reside outside of the palmitoylation domain, prevented membrane attachment and palmitoylation, leading the authors to propose that this mutation prevented protein-protein interactions necessary for membrane tethering of SNAP-25 (13.Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since the chimera used in their study presumably trafficked to membranes independently of syntaxin, it is likely that other molecular chaperones can usurp the role of syntaxin in escorting SNAP-25 to the secretory pathway. Thus, even their study supports our hypothesis that the mere presence of the palmitoylation domain does not guarantee that SNAP-25 will efficiently insert into membranes. Our finding that the palmitoylation domain of SNAP-25 is not required for its initial association with membranes is indeed novel. Clearly, palmitoylation is required for the steady-state accumulation of SNAP-25 on internal membranes, as we and others (9.Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11.Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13.Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have routinely observed that at steady state, wild-type SNAP-25 is membrane-associated, whereas SNAP-25 palmitoylation mutants are cytosolic. To reconcile these steady-state data with our kinetic data examining the initial association of SNAP-25 with membranes, we propose the following model (Fig. 8). Following the post-translational assembly of the SNAP-25·syntaxin t-SNARE complex in the cytosol, the complex is targeted to membranes and is tethered there by the transmembrane domain of syntaxin (Fig. 8, step 1). Our data showing that newly synthesized wild-type SNAP-25 and the SNAP-25 palmitoylation mutant traffic to membranes equally well in the presence of syntaxin are in excellent agreement with this model. Once on the membrane, syntaxin-associated SNAP-25 is accessible to palmitoylacyltransferase and is palmitoylated (Fig. 8, step 2), a process that begins ∼20 min after the synthesis of the SNAP-25 polypeptide (12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In much the same way that the initial membrane association of SNAP-25 is mediated by its binding to syntaxin, the initial association of the non-myristoylated G protein αi1 with membranes is mediated by its binding to membrane-anchored G protein β and γ subunits (16.Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like SNAP-25, Gαi1 is palmitoylated only after membrane tethering (16.Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, palmitoylation of GAD65 requires prior targeting to intracellular membranes, leading Solimenaet al. (30.Solimena M. Dirkx Jr., R. Radzynski M. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to propose that for GAD65 and other palmitoylation substrates, palmitoylation alone may not be the primary membrane targeting signal. Furthermore, palmitoylation of SNAP-25 requires an intact secretory pathway (12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that like other palmitoyltransferase substrates, SNAP-25 is palmitoylated following arrival at the plasma membrane. Since all palmitoylacyltransferase activity has been localized to intracellular membranes and most of this activity is thought to reside at the plasma membrane (14.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436 (and references therein): 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17.Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18.Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19.Liu L. Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23269-23276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), our model offers a mechanism by which newly synthesized, non-palmitoylated SNAP-25 would be brought into the proximity of this membrane-bound enzyme. Steady-state metabolic radiolabeling studies have revealed that most SNAP-25 in PC12 cells is not bound to any syntaxin.2 Since most SNAP-25 is palmitoylated and membrane-associated in these cells at steady state (Refs. 11.Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and 12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and this study), it is likely that SNAP-25·syntaxin complexes dissociate on membranes. This process may either occur spontaneously or be catalyzed by the action of an unfolding enzyme such as the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein. Therefore, even if palmitoylated SNAP-25 dissociates from syntaxin, it will remain stably associated with membranes (Fig. 8, step 3). If, on the other hand, SNAP-25 in the complex was not previously palmitoylated (as in cells expressing the palmitoylation mutant of SNAP-25), dissociation from syntaxin may result in the liberation of SNAP-25 into the cytosol (Fig. 8,step 4). The data presented in this study and in the numerous cited studies are in excellent agreement with this kinetic model of SNAP-25 trafficking to membranes. Although endogenous SNAP-25 is usually palmitoylated and membrane-associated, there are other members of the SNAP-25 family that are membrane-associated despite the lack of demonstrated palmitoylation or a putative palmitoylation domain. The SNAP-25 homolog in yeast, Sec9p, is not fatty-acylated, yet is still found tightly associated with membranes (31.Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Similarly, the recently described mammalian SNAP-25 homolog SNAP-29 does not possess a palmitoylation domain, yet >50% of the molecule is associated with membranes (32.Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M., Yu, S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33.Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Griffiths G. Lowe S.L. Subramaniam V.N. Seow K.T. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In characterizing SNAP-29, a possible role of syntaxin in the membrane association of SNAP-29 was proposed. Finally, even after chemical deacylation, SNAP-25 remains tightly associated with membranes, and deacylated SNAP-25 remains bound to syntaxin (12.Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that syntaxin binding alone is sufficient to tether SNAP-25 to membranes. In conclusion, we have shown that the initial association of SNAP-25 with intracellular membranes is mediated by its association with syntaxin. It is the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of syntaxin that brings SNAP-25 to membranes, and we propose that it is only after syntaxin-mediated tethering to membranes that SNAP-25 is palmitoylated by palmitoyltransferase.

As a result, two putative fusion proteins are formed: PRCCTFE3, which contains all known domains for DNA binding, dimerization, and transactivation of the TFE3 protein, and the reciprocal product TFE3PRCC. Upon transfection into COS cells, both wild type and fusion proteins were found to be located in the nucleus. When comparing the transactivating capacities of these (fusion) proteins, significant differences were noted. PRCCTFE3 acted as a threefold better transactivator than wild type TFE3 both in a TFE3-specific and in a general (Zebra) reporter assay. In addition, PRCC and the two fusion proteins were found to be potent transactivators in the Zebra reporter assay. We propose that, as a result of the (X;1) translocation, fusion of the N-terminal PRCC sequences to TFE3 alters the transactivation capacity of the transcription factor thus leading to aberrant gene regulation and, ultimately, tumor formation."

The precise intranuclear localization of latent p53 protein in non-stressed cells is unknown. Such information is essential in order to understand how relatively few molecules of p53 can detect and respond to DNA damage. Here we present the first detailed supramolecular localization of p53 in the nuclei of cells under normal conditions of growth. We show that soluble, non-bound p53 is released by permeabilization, leaving structurally bound p53 in both the nucleus and nucleolus. In situ biochemical studies reveal (i) that nuclear-bound p53 is tethered by RNA (directly or indirectly) and (ii) that a sub-population of nuclear-bound p53 co-localizes with sites of RNA synthesis. Transcriptional co-localization appeared to be independent of p53 conformation but dependent upon its quaternary structure. In the nucleolus p53 was observed at sites of rRNA synthesis and also adjacent to such sites. In contrast, nucleolar hdm-2 (shown by others to complex p53 and 5S RNA) was excluded from sites of rRNA synthesis. Our discovery that p53 is physically linked with sites of transcription may explain how relatively few p53 protein molecules can monitor genetic stress and respond preferentially to damage of actively transcribed genes."

The major effector of Ras, the serine/threonine kinase Raf exists as three isoforms with different tissue distributions. We demonstrate that transient transfection of oncogenic Ha-Ras leads to a preferential activation of endogenous c-Raf-1 in HEK 293 cells as opposed to A-Raf. In vitro binding studies using purified Ras binding domains of Raf as well as in vivo bindings tests with full length molecules reveals significantly lower binding affinities of A-Raf to Ha-Ras as compared to other Raf isoforms. The Ras-binding interface of c-Raf differs from A-Raf by a conservative Arg to Lys exchange at residue 59 or 22 respectively. Mutational analysis reveals that this residue represents a point of isozyme discrimination: c-Raf-R59K binds Ha-Ras weaker than the wildtype, likewise A-Raf-K22R increases its affinity to Ha-Ras in vivo and in vitro. Differential binding affinities are reflected in downstream signaling. Immunecomplex kinase assays reveal that Ha-Ras mediated Raf activation is decreased for c-Raf-R59K and increased for A-Raf-K22R when compared to the respective wildtype forms. Thus our observations introduce a new level of isoform discrimination in Ras/Raf signaling as a functional consequence of a conservative amino acid exchange in the Ras binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W2330448769,"The Ewing family of tumors is characterized by recurrent reciprocal translocations that generate chimeric proteins, either EWS - FLI-1 or EWS - ERG. These proteins are potent transcriptional activators and are responsible for maintaining the oncogenic properties of tumor cells. Since apoptosis appears to be the main mechanism whereby chemotherapy and radiation kill tumor cells, identification of events that can antagonize apoptosis in Ewing tumors is essential for improving their response to conventional therapies. Here, we report that the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB is a survival factor for Ewing tumor-derived cells. In fact, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation as a consequence of the overexpression of a degradation-resistant form of IkappaBalpha, IkappaBalpha (A32/36), sensitized these cells to TNFalpha-induced killing. Although treatment with TNFalpha did not modify the cellular expression of Bcl-2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, p53 and EWS - FLI-1 proteins, it increased p21Waf1/Cip1 levels. This induction required NF-kappaB activation since it was not observed in the IkappaBalpha (A32/36) expressing cells. Moreover, overexpression of p21Waf1/Cip1 in these IkappaBalpha (A32/36)-expressing cells, in which NF-kappaB and consequently p21Waf1/Cip1 are no longer inducible by TNFalpha, decreased their susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced killing. Our results therefore identify p21Waf1/Cip1 as a mediator of the antiapoptotic effect of TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB in Ewing tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2317554834,"Interferons (IFNs α, β and γ) and all trans retinoic acid (RA) have the ability to activate genes with GAS sites. We have found that the promoter of CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) contains a consensus GAS site TTCnnnGAA located at bp-35 to -27, and computer analysis confirmed this sequence to be a putative Stat binding site. Consistent with this finding, we show that IFNs and RA rapidly enhanced CD26 gene and protein expression in chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Immunoblot analyses revealed that unstimulated B-CLL cells expressed detectable levels of serine/tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1α, and RA and IFN-γ treatment led to increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1α and its nuclear accumulation. As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, RA and IFN-γ increased the binding of a nuclear protein to the GAS-CD26 element. Shift-Western blotting identified Stat1α as the GAS-CD26 binding factor. Augmented levels of CD26 protein in malignant B cells cultured with IFNs or RA coincided with the enhancement of DPPIV activity. Taken together, our results are in favor of the IFN-/RA-mediated upregulation of CD26/DPPIV in B-CLL through the signaling pathway involving Stat1α and the GAS response element of CD26 promoter."

GRIP and ABP are composed of seven and six PDZ domains, respectively, and form a heteromultimer via PDZ domains. We have initially identified synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) as a protein interacting with SAPAP (17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C.

S-SCAM has six PDZ, two WW, and one GK domains, and we have numbered six PDZ domains, PDZ-0 to -5. S-SCAM interacts with NMDA receptors via the C-terminal PDZ-5 domain and induces the clustering of NMDA receptors when coexpressed in transfected cells. In our previous study, the antibody against S-SCAM recognized multiple signals with various sizes in the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) fraction, suggesting that S-SCAM has isoforms (17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We have searched for the isoforms and obtained two isoforms, S-SCAMβ and-γ. In this paper, we have characterized these isoforms to show that these short isoforms of S-SCAM induce the clustering of NMDA receptors and interact with SAPAP, and revealed the interaction among the isoforms of S-SCAM via PDZ domains. We have also indicated that S-SCAM interacts with PSD-95/SAP90.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody against PDZ-0 was raised using glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-S-SCAM-22 as an antigen. For simplicity, in this paper we describe the former and latter antibodies as the anti-WW and the anti-PDZ-0 antibodies, respectively. A rabbit polyclonal anti-PSD-95 antibody was described (17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol.

A rabbit polyclonal anti-NMDAR2A and a mouse monoclonal anti-PSD-95 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Rhodamine-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies for dual labeling were purchased from Chemicon. COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum under 10% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with various Myc-tagged constructs using the DEAE-dextran method (10.Takeuchi M.

COS cells of two 10-cm dishes were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, and used as COS cell extracts. CHO cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μg/ml proline under 10% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with various constructs using TransFast Transfection Reagent (Promega). The subcellular fractionation of CHO cells was performed as described (19.Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells of one 10-cm dish were collected after 48 h culture and homogenized by sonication in 0.3 ml of 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. 0.1 ml of the homogenate was kept for analysis, and the remaining samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min to separate the supernatant and the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.05 ml was kept as the first pellet. The remaining sample was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min to separate the supernatant and the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 0.15 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Each 0.5-ml aliquot of the extracts of COS cells transfected with pClneo Myc S-SCAMβ and various Myc-tagged constructs of S-SCAMα was incubated with 2.5 μl of anti-Myc ascites fixed on 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads. After the beads were washed three times with 50 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 33 mm NaCl and 0.33% (w/v) Triton X-100, the proteins on the beads were detected by the immunoblotting using the anti-Myc or the anti-WW antibody. Immunoprecipitation from rat crude synaptosomes was performed (20.Yao I. Hata Y. Hirao K. Deguchi M. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, the urea/detergent extracts of rat crude synaptosomes were prepared using 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 6m urea, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min.

The aliquots of the extracts were incubated with various antibodies fixed on 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads. After the beads were washed three times with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 33 mm NaCl and 0.33% (w/v) Triton X-100, the proteins on the beads were detected by the immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. The overlay assay was performed as described (17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, [35S]methionine-labeled probes were prepared using TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) with pClneo Myc S-SCAM-1, -4, -β, or TA S-SCAMγ as a template. The extracts of COS cells transfected with the mock or pCMV SAPAP1 were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane, prehybridized with Buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (w/v) skim milk), and then hybridized with Buffer A containing each probe at 4 °C for 4 h. After the membranes were rinsed with Buffer A twice and then Buffer A without skim milk three times, the images were obtained using Fuji image analyzing system, BAS2000. Each 0.5-ml aliquot of the extracts of COS cells expressing various Myc-tagged constructs of S-SCAM was incubated with 1 nmol of various GST fusion proteins fixed on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After the beads were washed with 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 33 mm NaCl and 0.33% (w/v) Triton X-100, the proteins on the beads were detected with the immunoblotting using the anti-Myc antibody. COS cells were transfected with 5 μg/3.5-cm dish of various pClneo Myc S-SCAM constructs in the combination of 0.5 μg/3.5-cm dish of pCMV NMDAR1 and 4 μg/3.5-cm of pCMV NMDAR2A and cultured in the presence of 0.5 mmketamine (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). After 48 h culture, cells were fixed and immunostained. The images were obtained by a confocal microscopy Bio-Rad MRC1024 (Bio-Rad). Gel filtration was performed using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 nmol of the product of pGex4T-1 S-SCAM-17 (GST-PDZ-(4 + 5)) was treated of 20 units/ml thrombin in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmCaCl2 to remove GST. 500 pmol of the cleaved product was charged to a Sephadex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (0.32 × 30 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Elution was performed with the same buffer for the equilibration at a flow rate of 50 ml/min, and 48 fractions were collected. The immunofluorescence microscopy of adult rat neural tissue was done as described (21.Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Their tissues were sectioned in a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, and then air-dried. The samples were incubated for 12 h with either the rabbit anti-WW, the anti-SAPAP, or the mouse anti-PSD-95 antibody, followed by incubation for 12 h with the Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody. The anti-WW antibody recognized signals with molecular masses of 180 and 140 kDa and a very faint signal with a molecular mass of 155 kDa in the SPM fraction (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). The calculated molecular weight of S-SCAM is 141,068, but the product of the eukaryotic expression construct containing full-length S-SCAM migrated in SDS-PAGE at the same position as the largest signal detected in the SPM fraction (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Therefore, we discussed in the previous report of S-SCAM (17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) that the smaller proteins might be degradation products or isoforms. Among 74 clones from the original screening, we detected two independent clones, p3205–4 and -32, which started at the 164th methionine of S-SCAM preceded by the stopping codon and terminated at the same site as the original S-SCAM (Fig. 1 B). We named the original S-SCAM, S-SCAMα, and the shorter isoform, S-SCAMβ. We also found two independent clones, p3205–25 and -27, starting at the methionine at the 224th methionine preceded by the stopping codon, although these clones did not contain the termination codon. We named this shortest isoform, S-SCAMγ (Fig. 1 B). The anti-WW antibody recognized proteins with molecular masses of 155 and 140 kDa in COS cells transfected with pClneo S-SCAMβ and-γ, respectively, in support that S-SCAMβ and -γ actually encode proteins in vivo (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4). COS cells transfected with pClneo S-SCAMβ also expressed a protein with a molecular mass of 140 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), suggesting the 224th methionine functions as an initiation site in S-SCAMβ, too. The anti-PDZ-0 antibody recognized the protein with a molecular mass of 180 kDa but not the proteins with molecular masses of 155 and 140 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). Therefore, the proteins with molecular masses of 155 and 140 kDa in the SPM fraction lack PDZ-0 and may be S-SCAMβ and-γ, respectively. Because S-SCAMβ and -γ started in the middle of the GK domain, we tested whether S-SCAMβ and -γ interacted with SAPAP. SAPAP is resistant to the extraction with Triton X-100 from either the SPM fraction or CHO cells. S-SCAMα was Triton X-100-soluble in CHO cells, but became partially Triton X-100-insoluble, when coexpressed with SAPAP1 (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, S-SCAMβ was Triton X-100-soluble and became partially Triton X-100-insoluble in the presence of SAPAP1 in CHO cells (Fig.2 B). The similar result was obtained for S-SCAMγ (data not shown). To confirm further the interaction of S-SCAMβ and -γ with SAPAP1, we performed the overlay assay using [35S]methionine-labeled S-SCAMβ and -γ. S-SCAMα, -β, and -γ bound to SAPAP1 expressed in COS cells, whereas the probe prepared from pClneo Myc S-SCAM-4 did not (Fig.3). These findings suggest that the N-terminal portion of the GK domain, which S-SCAMβ and -γ did not contain, was not necessary for the interaction with SAPAP1.Figure 3Interaction between the isoforms of S-SCAM and SAPAP1. The extracts of COS cells transfected with the mock or pCMV SAPAP1 were overlaid with the [35S]methionine-labeled probe prepared from either pClneo Myc S-SCAMα, pClneo Myc S-SCAMβ, TA S-SCAMγ, or pClneo Myc S-SCAM-4.

Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). GRIP and ABP also form a heteromultimer (15.Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C. DeSouza S. Abagyan R. Valtschannoff J.G. Weinberg R.J. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1998; 22: 179-187Google Scholar). We tested whether the isoforms of S-SCAM formed multimers. The anti-PDZ-0 antibody recognized only S-SCAMα, but the immunoprecipitate with the anti-PDZ-0 antibody contained not only S-SCAMα but also S-SCAMβ and -γ (Fig.4 A), in support that S-SCAMα interacted with S-SCAMβ and -γ in vivo. Next, to determine the region involved in the interaction, COS cells were transfected with pClneo S-SCAMβ and various Myc-tagged constructs of S-SCAMα. We immunoprecipitated each Myc-tagged product with the anti-Myc antibody, and we checked whether S-SCAMβ was coimmunoprecipitated. S-SCAMβ bound the product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-4 or -10 but not the product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-2 or -3 (Fig.4 B), suggesting that S-SCAMβ interacts with the region containing PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAMα. The GST fusion protein containing PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAMα also interacted with the product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-1, -4, or -10 (Fig.5 A). Therefore, S-SCAM is likely to form multimers via the self-association between PDZ-(4 + 5). We next tested which of PDZ-4 or -5 was involved in this interaction. PDZ-5 interacted with the product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-10 containing PDZ-(4 + 5), whereas PDZ-4 did not (Fig. 5 B). However, the interaction of GST-PDZ-5 with the product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-12 containing only PDZ-5 was not detected under the same conditions (data not shown).Figure 5Interaction between the PDZ domains of S-SCAM. A, interaction between PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM. The extracts of COS cells transfected with various pClneo Myc constructs of S-SCAM were incubated with either GST or GST-PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM which are fixed on glutathione beads, and the proteins on the beads were detected with the anti-Myc antibody.

The calculated molecular weight of PDZ-(4 + 5) is approximately 33,000. In gel filtration, PDZ-(4 + 5) appeared in fraction 30, which corresponded to 78 kDa, and estimated to be a dimer (Fig. 6). Another peak was detected in fraction 38, corresponding to 17 kDa. This peak contained a degradation product. PDZ-(3 + 4), whose molecular weight was 26,000 appeared in fraction 35, which corresponded to 30 kDa. We tested whether S-SCAMβ and -γ had the ability to form clusters of NMDA receptors. S-SCAMβ and -γ induced the clustering of NMDA receptors, when coexpressed in COS cells (Fig.7 B and data not shown). We tested which region of S-SCAM was required for the clustering of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors formed clusters in COS cells, when cotransfected with pClneo Myc S-SCAM-4 or -10 (Fig. 7 C and data not shown) but not with either pClneo Myc S-SCAM-2, -3, or -12 (Fig. 7 D and data not shown). The product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-8 lacking PDZ-5 did not induce the clustering of NMDA (Fig.7 E). These findings suggest that the region containing PDZ-(4 + 5) is necessary and sufficient for the clustering of NMDA receptors. The presence of SAPAP1 did not show any effect on the S-SCAM-dependent clustering of NMDA receptors (data not shown). A recent study has revealed that the region containing three PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 intramolecularly interacts with the GK domain (22.Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first confirmed this interaction using the product of pGex4T-1 PSD-95–24 containing 52 amino acids from the GK domain (Fig.8 A). PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM did not bind the product of pClneo Myc S-SCAM-2 containing the GK domain of S-SCAM (data not shown). Unexpectedly, PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM interacted with the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig. 8 B). To detect the interaction of S-SCAM with PSD-95/SAP90 in vivo, we performed the immunoprecipitation of PSD-95/SAP90. S-SCAM were coimmunoprecipitated with PSD-95/SAP90 from rat brain (Fig.8 C). In the previous studies, we showed the colocalization of S-SCAM, PSD-95/SAP90, and SAPAP in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons (10.Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and here we examined whether S-SCAM, PSD-95/SAP90, and SAPAP were colocalized in vivo. In rat retina, these proteins were localized at inner and outer plexiform layers. In cerebellum, although the localizations of these proteins were not identical, all of S-SCAM, PSD-95/SAP90, and SAPAP were localized at the glomerulus in the granular layer (Fig. 9). Therefore, these three proteins were colocalized at least in some part. In this paper, we have identified smaller isoforms of S-SCAM, S-SCAMβ, and -γ. S-SCAMβ and -γ start at the 164th and 224th methionines, respectively. We previously reported that the region of amino acids 138–185 was the domain involved in the interaction with SAPAP (17.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although S-SCAMβ starts in the middle of this region and S-SCAMγ starts after this region, both of them interact with SAPAP1. The recent version of the simple modular architecture research tool predicts that the region of amino acids 107–291 of S-SCAM is the GK domain (23.Scultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2991) Google Scholar). Among them, the N-terminal 48 amino acids are rather conserved between the GK domains of PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM, whereas the middle and C-terminal regions are diverged (Fig.10), but the interaction of S-SCAMγ with SAPAP suggests that the SAPAP-interacting region of S-SCAM is mapped to the C-terminal region of the GK domain. The GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 is reported to interact with the PDZ domains intramolecularly (22.Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We prepared the GST fusion protein containing only 52 amino acids from the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig.10, shaded), and we confirmed that this short GK domain still bound the PDZ domains. Interestingly, the putative SAPAP-interacting region of S-SCAM does not contain the amino acids corresponding to these amino acids (Fig. 10, underlined). Although the SAPAP-interacting region of PSD-95/SAP90 needs to be determined, the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 may include distinct PDZ-interacting and SAPAP-interacting subdomains. The physiological significance of the presence of the isoforms of S-SCAM is currently unknown. An unidentified ligand for PDZ-0 could bind only to S-SCAMα. Thus, when S-SCAMα is dominant, such a ligand is assembled with components interacting with other PDZ domains, and when the expression of S-SCAMβ or -γ is enhanced, such a ligand is switched off from other components. Such a mechanism might be involved in synaptic plasticity. The consensus motif for the interaction with PDZ domain was originally known to be the C-terminal sequence Ser/Thr-X-Val (whereX is any amino acid). Later, numerous exceptions for the binding motif have been reported (23.Scultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2991) Google Scholar, 24.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C.

The PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 and syntrophin (25.Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase in complex with that of syntrophin have been studied (26.Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The β finger that extends beyond the PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase docks into the carboxyl groove of the PDZ domain of syntrophin. In this case, the interaction between the PDZ domains of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and syntrophin conceivably competes with the binding of the C-terminal peptide to the PDZ domain of syntrophin. GRIP and ABP form a heteromultimer via the PDZ domains (15.Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C. DeSouza S. Abagyan R. Valtschannoff J.G. Weinberg R.J. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1998; 22: 179-187Google Scholar). It has not been concluded whether the interaction between GRIP and ABP simultaneously occurs with the binding of AMPA receptors to GRIP and ABP. PSD-95/SAP90 has two cysteine residues at the N terminus and forms a tetramer via the disulfide linkage (12.Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We have found that PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM also forms a dimer via the PDZ domains. NMDA receptors form clusters when coexpressed with PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM but not when coexpressed with PDZ-5, suggesting that both of PDZ-4 and -5 are necessary in the interaction or that the insert between PDZ-4 and PDZ-5 is involved in the interaction. S-SCAM also uses PDZ-5 to bind NMDA receptors. We have not yet determined whether a PDZ-(4 + 5) that binds NMDA receptors can still interact with the other PDZ-(4 + 5). The dimerization of S-SCAM may not be sufficient to induce the clustering of NMDA receptors, because no more than two molecules of NMDA receptors are assembled. In this study, we have detected that PDZ-(4 + 5) of S-SCAM binds the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 in vitro and that S-SCAM interacts with PSD-95/SAP90 in vivo. The interaction between S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 may be involved in the clustering of NMDA receptors as well as that between the isoforms of S-SCAM. S-SCAM, PSD-95/SAP90, and SAPAP are colocalized at least in some part in brain, and these proteins are coimmunoprecipitated from rat brain, suggesting that these proteins interact in vivo. We summarize the interactions proposed in this study (Fig. 11). Although it remains to be clarified whether these interactions take place simultaneously, these interactions may be important to sustain the architecture of the PSD.

Interactions between γ complex and primer/template DNA are investigated using fluorescence depolarization to measure binding of γ complex to different DNA substrates under steady-state and presteady-state conditions. Surprisingly, γ complex has a much higher affinity for single-stranded DNA (K d in the nmrange) than for a primed template (K d in the μm range) under steady-state conditions.

Pol III HE contains pol III core along with accessory proteins. Pol III core is made up of three subunits, α, ε, and θ. The α subunit possesses 5′ → 3′ polymerase activity (4.Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ε subunit contains 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity (5.DiFrancesco R. Bhatnagar S.K. Brown A.

Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis by pol III core is extremely inefficient owing to its low intrinsic processivity ∼10 to 20 nt (9.Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of accessory proteins dramatically increases pol III core processivity to several thousand nt, thereby providing a high replication efficiency necessary for genome duplication (4.Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accessory proteins enhance pol III core processivity by tethering it to a primed DNA template. Tethering of pol III core to DNA is accomplished by β protein, functioning as a sliding clamp, and by γ complex, required for loading β onto p/t DNA. X-ray data show that β sliding clamp is a ring-shaped homodimer with an inner diameter of about 35 Å, large enough to encircle duplex DNA (11.Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). By encircling DNA, β dimer effectively clamps pol III core to the template through direct protein-protein interactions with the α subunit. Biochemical evidence suggests that β exists as a dimer when free in solution (12.Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The β dimer must be assembled onto DNA by the activity of the γ complex clamp loader which is composed of 5 different polypeptides having a stoichiometry of γ2δδ'χψ (13.Maki S. Kornberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Xiao H. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13378-13383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to its clamp loading activity, γ complex also possesses DNA-dependent ATPase activity (16.Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis provides the energy required to complete the assembly reaction which involves loading β onto DNA followed by dissociation of γ complex (17.Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,18.Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The overall efficiency of DNA replication depends in part on the efficiency of loading the β sliding clamp onto DNA and forming a processive replication complex. On the leading strand, where DNA is synthesized in one continuous strand, loading may be performed just once on an undamaged DNA template. However, on the lagging strand, where DNA is synthesized in relatively short Okazaki fragments of 1000–2000 nt, loading takes place at each primer site where synthesis of an Okazaki fragment begins. Thus, on the lagging strand, β dimers must be loaded and unloaded many times. Kinetic studies have shown that the half-life for loading is on the order of 60 ms (19.Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rapid enough to support in vivo Okazaki fragment synthesis occurring about every 1 to 2 s. Not only is the rate of loading β important to the overall efficiency of synthesis of Okazaki fragments, but the orientation of the β ring on DNA and the site on DNA where the β clamp is placed is also critical. The β sliding clamp has two distinct faces, one that interacts directly with pol III core (20.Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In order for a loading reaction to result in formation of a replication competent core·β complex, the β ring must be oriented on DNA so that the face that binds the core is oriented in the proper direction along the DNA axis. If loading were random, half the loading reactions would be unproductive because half the β rings loaded onto DNA would face in the wrong direction. In addition to proper orientation of β rings on DNA, the overall efficiency of DNA synthesis should be enhanced by placing β clamp on DNA at or near a primer 3′-end in anticipation of binding pol III core. Once β sliding clamp is loaded onto DNA, pol III core requires unimpeded access for binding β. Protein footprinting experiments show that γ complex interacts with the same face of the β sliding clamp required for binding pol III core (20.Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, if both γ complex and pol III core compete for binding with β, then mutual interference of both binding events is likely to diminish the efficiency of assembling a processive replication complex on DNA. Naktinis et al.(20.Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have shown that the relative affinities of γ complex and pol III core for β are different when β is free in solution and when it is bound to DNA. In the absence of DNA, γ complex has a higher affinity for β than does pol III core. However, the affinity of pol III core for β clamp is much greater when β has been assembled onto DNA. Indeed, once pol III core binds β, then γ complex is prevented from binding. Structural features at a replication fork, reflecting interactions between pol III HE and other proteins, clearly play an important role in assembling a replication complex. DNA properties, such as the ss/double-stranded DNA junction formed by a primed template, may play a role in directing the assembly of the pol III HE on DNA. Assembly of sliding clamps specifically at p/t DNA junctions would allow for the greatest overall efficiency of DNA synthesis particularly on the lagging strand where clamps must be assembled for synthesis of each Okazaki fragment. In this paper, we report on the presteady-state and steady-state interactions occurring between γ complex and p/t DNA and between γ complex and primer and template DNA molecules individually, enabling us to propose a model to account for pol III HE assembly at p/t DNA ends. All DNA polymerase III proteins were purified and γ complex was reconstituted as described (11.Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 21.Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Assay buffers for all experiments contained 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml BSA. Two different DNA substrates were used in these experiments, a ss 50-mer covalently labeled on the 5′-end with X-rhodamine and a 30/105-mer primer/template covalently labeled on the 5′ template end with X-rhodamine. The sequences of the ss 50-mer and primed template were as follows: 5′­GAG CGT CAA AAT GTA GGT ATT TCC ATG AGC GTT TTT CCT GTT GCA ATG GC­3′ ss50­mer 5′­CT GGT AAT ATC CAG AAC AAT ATT 3′­TCT TCT TGA GTT TGA TAG CCG GAA CGA CCA TTA TAG GTC TTG TTA TAA ACC GCC A­3′ TGG CGG TCG GTA ACG TTG TCC TTT TTG CGA GTA CCT TTA TGG ATG TAA AAC TGC GAG­5′ 30/105­mer p/tDNAAll oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and stored in deionized H2O. A 5′-C6 amino linker (Glen Research) was added to the 5′-end of the 50-mer during synthesis. Following synthesis and purification, this 5′-amino group was covalently labeled by addition of X-rhodamine isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, catalog number X-491) as described (19.Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22.Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 105-nt template, labeled on the 5′-end with X-rhodamine, was made by ligating a 55-mer that was chemically phosphorylated during synthesis to the X-rhodamine-labeled 50-mer. For the ligation reaction, a 30-nt oligonucleotide complementary to both the phosphorylated 55-mer and the X-rhodamine labeled 50-mer was used as a scaffold. When the 30-mer was annealed to both the 50- and 55-mer, a nicked substrate was formed where 15 nt on the 3′-end of the 50-mer and 15 nt on the 5′-end of the 55-mer were annealed to the 30-mer scaffold. Typical ligation reactions contained 20–30 μm (80–120 nmol) DNA, 1 mm ATP, and 50 units (1 units/μl) of T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies) in 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 25 μg/ml BSA and were incubated overnight at 14–16 °C. Single-stranded 105-mer was purified from unreacted 50- and 55-mer as well as the 30-mer scaffold by denaturing PAGE. For control experiments, a second 105-nt template covalently labeled with an RhX probe at a site 26 nt from the 5′-end was made as above by ligating a 65-mer to a 40-mer that was covalently labeled with RhX. A commercially available dU phosphoramidite modified with an amino linker at the 5 position (Amino-Modifier C2 dT, Glen Research) was incorporated into the 40-mer during synthesis at the 26thnt from the 5′-end. This amino linker was labeled with X-rhodamine isothiocyanate as above. Primer/template DNA consisted of a 30-nt primer annealed the RhX-labeled 105-nt template to create a substrate with 30 nt of duplex DNA near the center flanked by 50 nt of ssDNA on the 3′ end of the primer and 25 nt of DNA on the 5′-end of the primer (refer to sequences above). The p/t DNA was annealed by incubating 1.2 mol eq of 30 nt primer with 1 mol eq of 105 nt X-rhodamine-labeled template in a water bath that was initially at 80 °C and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. Excess single-stranded DNA was removed by nondenaturing PAGE. Gel-purified p/t DNA was used in experiments where indicated since the presence of the excess ss 30-mer did not affect assays. DNA concentrations were determined using calculated extinction coefficients for ssDNA. Duplex DNAs were heat denatured in a UV spectrophotometer to determine the absorbance of ssDNAs. Steady-state anisotropy measurements were taken using a QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75 W xenon arc lamp, an excitation monochromator, dual emission monochro mators, photon-counting detectors with Hamamatsu R928 PMTs, and Glan-Thompson polarizers. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light at 580 nm (5 nm band pass) and both vertically and horizontally polarized emission at 610 nm (5 nm band pass) were simultaneously measured (T-format). Typical sample volumes of 80–100 μl were used in a microcuvette (internal dimensions 3 × 3 × 5-mm, Starna Cells). Titration experiments were performed by addition of a constant volume of γ complex solution to a cuvette containing a solution of RhX-labeled DNA and assay buffer. Concentrations of γ complex were varied while each assay contained 50 nm RhX-labeled DNA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml BSA. Titration experiments that included β were per formed as above except 1.4 μl of 62 μm β was added to 80 μl of γcomplex-DNA solution to obtain a 1 μm β final concentration without significantly changing the concentrations of the other species in solution. Titration experiments using the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS were done under identical conditions replacing 0.5 mm ATP with 0.5 mm ATPγS. For each sample, vertically and horizontally polarized emission intensities were measured. Background intensities were measured for solutions containing assay buffer only. Intensities were corrected by subtracting background intensities. The polarization bias (G-factor) of the fluorometer was determined by measuring vertical and horizontal emission intensities when samples were excited with horizontally polarized light (23.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 145-147Google Scholar). Anisotropy values (r) were calculated using background corrected intensity values and the equation,r = (I VV −gI VH)/(I VV + 2gI VH), where I VV andI VH are the intensities of vertically and horizontally polarized emission, respectively, measured when samples are excited with vertically polarized light and g is the G-factor. Multiple anisotropy values were determined at each concentration of γ complex and sample standard deviations were calculated from the raw anisotropy data. Labeled phosphate-binding protein was prepared by overexpression of a mutated phoSgene from E. coli and by purifying and labeling the protein with a fluorescent probe as described in Ref. 24.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar. The plasmid carrying the mutated phoS gene was a gracious gift from Martin Webb. The accretion of phosphate, following ATP hydrolysis, was measured on a QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology) by monitoring the increase in intensity of a fluorescent probe bound to the phosphate-binding protein. Steady-state ATPase assays for both ss 50-mer and p/t DNA were measured in 200-μl reaction volumes. A 190-μl sample of enzyme buffer, 50 nm DNA, 25 nm γ complex, 500 μm ATP, 10 μm PBP-MDCC, 0.05 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 50 μm 7-methylguanosine was placed in a cuvette. The sample was excited at 430 nm and emission data were collected at 474 nm. After 1 min of data accumulation, a 10-μl aliquot of 10 mm ATP was added to the cuvette and an additional 14 min of data was collected. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 7-methylguanosine were included in the reaction to remove phosphate contamination prior to ATP hydrolysis. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed throughout the reaction was calculated from the direct measurement of phosphate released and bound by the phosphate-binding protein over time. A Biologic SFM-4 stopped-flow (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) equipped with four independently driven reagent syringes and a 31-μl cuvette (model number FC-15) with a 1.5-mm path length were used. Dichroic sheet polarizers (380–770 nm, Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) were mounted directly onto the cuvette. A QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer, described above, was used as an excitation source by focusing the output from the excitation monochromator (580 nm, 1.25–1.5 nm band pass) onto a fused silica fiber optic consisting of a bundle with dimensions of 0.25 × 2.56 mm containing 9 250-μm fibers (Fiberguide Industries, Stirling, NJ). The excitation fiber was mounted against the stopped-flow cuvette. Vertically and horizontally polarized emission were collected simultaneously in a “T-format” through UV/VIS liquid light guides with a 5-mm core diameter (Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) mounted directly against the stopped-flow cuvette. Fluorescence emission was detected with a photon-counting detection system consisting of two channels each with a filter holder containing a 610-nm cut-on filter (CVI Laser Corp., Albuquerque, NM), mounted onto an ambient PMT housing (Products for Research, Inc., Danvers, MA) with an R4457P PMT (Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ). Signals from both PMTs were detected via a 5X SR455 preamplifier, a SR400 gated photon counter (Stanford Research, Sunnyvale, CA), and MCS-II multichannel scalar cards (Oxford Research, Oakridge, TN). The external synch from the SFM-4 stopped-flow unit triggered data acquisition by the MCS-II cards. For presteady-state assays measuring binding of γ complex to p/t DNA, one stopped-flow syringe was loaded with either 200, 400, 600, or 800 nm γ complex and 0.5 mm ATP in assay buffer and the second syringe was loaded with 100 nm DNA and 0.5 mm ATP in assay buffer. Reactions were initiated by mixing 100 μl of γ complex solution with 100 μl of DNA solution at a flow rate of 10 ml/s. Two different mixing schemes were used in presteady-state reactions with β. In the first, 100 μl of a solution of 600 nm γ complex and 1 mm ATP was added to 100 μl of a solution of 1 μm β dimer, 100 nm p/t DNA, and 1 mm ATP. In the second, 100 μl of a solution of 600 nm γ complex, 100 nm p/t DNA, and 1 mm ATP was added to 100 μl of a solution of 1 μm β dimer and 1 mm ATP. Each of the four syringes contained assay buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml BSA. Assays were performed at 20 °C. For each assay, vertically and horizontally polarized emission intensities were measured at 1-ms intervals and 16 to 24 stopped-flow runs were signal averaged. Between runs, reagents were flushed out of the cuvette using assay buffer. Raw anisotropy data were fit to sums of exponentials and used in kinetics simulations. Data shown in figures has been smoothed over 3 data points. General experimental procedures were the same as for steady-state binding assays but with the following modifications. For each concentration of competitor DNA, a solution (90 μl) of unlabeled competitor DNA and γ complex in assay buffer was placed in a cuvette and background intensities were measured. A 5-μl aliquot of 1 μm X-rhodamine-labeled ss 50-mer was added and intensities were measured to determine the G-factor and anisotropy of free DNA. Binding of γ complex to the mixture of labeled and unlabeled DNA was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 10 mm ATP and intensities were measured to determine the anisotropy. After addition of ATP, solutions contained 50 nm RhX-labeled ss 50-mer, 400 nm γ complex, and 0–500 nm competitor DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml BSA. The principal goal of these experiments is to analyze interactions occurring between γ complex and its p/t DNA substrate. We use fluorescence depolarization of an X-rhodamine (RhX) probe covalently attached to DNA to measure the binding kinetics of γ complex and β + γ complex to DNA on presteady-state and steady-state time scales. The fluorescence anisotropy of the RhX probe, which is a measure of depolarization of the probe, reports on the rate of rotational motion of the DNA molecule. A DNA molecule free in solution is relatively small and rotates rapidly giving rise to a small steady-state anisotropy value. When a protein binds to the labeled DNA molecule, a larger complex forms that rotates slower, giving rise to a larger steady-state anisotropy value. The RhX probe that we use on DNA largely reflects the motion of the entire DNA molecule (19.Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We measured the association of γ complex and β + γ complex with two different DNA substrates, a p/t DNA and a ss 50-mer DNA. The template portion of the p/t DNA and the ss 50-mer are 5′-end labeled with RhX (“Experimental Procedures”). The p/t DNA substrate consists of a 30-nt primer annealed close to the center of a 105-nt template to create a single-stranded region 50 nt in length on the 5′ template end (see sequence under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.1, sketch at top). The sequence of the ss 50-nt region of the template is identical to the ss 50-mer substrate. In replication assays, the 30/105-mer p/t DNA substrate supports processive DNA synthesis by the pol III core in the presence of β, γ complex, and SSB (19.Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M.

Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (data not shown). DNA binding assays were performed by measuring the steady-state anisotropy of the RhX probe on DNA as a function of γ complex concentration (Fig. 1). The observed anisotropy of the probe on DNA is a population-weighted average of the anisotropies for free DNA and for bound DNA thereby reflecting the fraction of protein-bound DNA. Thus, anisotropy increases as the population of protein-bound DNA increases. Control experiments were done with each of the DNA substrates to demonstrate that the RhX probe was sensitive to proteins binding DNA. For these control experiments, DNA was titrated with single stranded-binding protein (SSB). The anisotropy for the RhX probe increased and reached a maximum value of about 0.34 when each DNA substrate was saturated with SSB (data not shown). Binding assays contain 50 nm DNA and γ complex in concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 μm in assay buffer. Since γ complex possesses DNA-dependent ATPase activity which hydrolyzes ATP throughout the binding experiments, sufficient ATP (0.5 mm) is included to ensure that it is not depleted during the course of the assays. ATP is required for binding γ complex to DNA (19.Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that γ complex appears to have a much greater affinity for ss 50-mer DNA compared with p/t DNA, when steady-state binding measurements are performed (Fig. 1 A). Upon increasing the concentration of γ complex from 0 to 1 μm, the anisotropy for p/t DNA increases by only 0.012 while the anisotropy for the ss 50-mer increases to a much greater extent, by 0.091. This difference in affinity cannot be attributed to a small amount of single-stranded DNA present in p/t DNA since both gel purified p/t DNA and p/t DNA containing a small excess (0.2 mol eq) of 30 nt primer yield similar results (Fig. 1 A and “Experimental Procedures”). Binding to the ss 50-mer occurs with an apparent K d of 280 nm based on titration data containing up to 2.5 μm γ complex (data above 1 μm γ complex is not shown). This result is unexpected because the affinity of γ complex for ss 50-mer exceeds that of the p/t DNA even though the p/t DNA contains a 50-nt single-stranded region of DNA identical in sequence to the ss 50-mer. Therefore, γ complex seemingly has a much greater affinity for the ss 50-mer when it is free in solution than when it is present as part of a primed template. DNA binding assays were also performed in reactions containing both β and γ complex. These assays contain 1 μm β dimer + 0.5 mm ATP with increasing concentrations of γ complex (Fig. 1 B). Much lower concentrations of γ complex in the presence of β are required to saturate each DNA substrate with bound protein compared with binding assays with γ complex alone. This difference is most striking for p/t DNA. In assays with γ complex alone, very little p/t DNA remains bound at steady-state, even at 1 μm γ complex, while in assays with γ complex + β, the p/t DNA is essentially saturated with protein at concentrations exceeding 1 μm γ complex. In addition to the overall increase in protein binding to DNA in reactions with β + γ complex, there is a much smaller difference in the apparent affinities of these proteins for the ss 50-mer and p/t DNA. Apparent K dvalues for protein binding to DNA are 45 nm for the ss 50-mer and 210 nm for p/t DNA. These results suggest that β may increase the affinity of γ complex for DNA so that a complex between β and γ complex (β·γ complex) has a higher affinity for DNA than γ complex alone. One possible explanation for the apparent higher affinity of γ complex for ss 50-mer than p/t DNA is that γ complex may bind the larger p/t DNA at a site that is farther removed from the RhX probe so that it affects the anisotropy of the probe to a lesser degree. To rule out this possibility, we measured binding of γ complex to four p/t DNA substrates that differed in the site of attachment of the RhX probe and location of the primer. Two of the 30/105-mer p/t substrates were identical to the p/t used in Fig. 1, A and B,except for the position of the RhX probe. In one case, it was placed on the 5′ primer end, and in the other, it was covalently attached to an amino linker on the 5 position of a template dU located 26 nt from the 5′ template end (Fig. 1 C, sketch). Binding of γ complex to each of these p/ts was measured under steady-state conditions. Observed anisotrop"

We have shown previously that the activity of B-Myb is stimulated by cyclin A/Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminus of B-Myb. We have now investigated in more detail the effect of other cyclins on B-Myb. Here, we show that cyclin D1, in contrast to cyclin A, strongly inhibits the activity of B-Myb. This inhibitory effect does not involve increased phosphorylation of B-Myb but seems to rely on the formation of a specific complex of B-Myb and cyclin D1. Our work identifies B-Myb as an interacting partner for cyclin D1 and suggest that the activity of B-Myb during the cell cycle is controlled by the antagonistic effects of cyclin D1 and A. The results presented here suggest a more general role of cyclin D1 as regulator of transcription in addition to the known effect on RB phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2053629525,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the major hematopoietic factor which controls the production and differentiation of granulocytes. The G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) belongs to the superfamily of the cytokine receptors, which transduce signals via the activation of cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases (PTK). To determine the role of specific PTK in G-CSF signaling we expressed the human G-CSFR in cell lines derived from DT40 B cells, which lack either the Src-related Lyn or Syk. Wild-type (wt) and syk-deficient cells underwent increased DNA synthesis in response to G-CSF; lyn-deficient cells did not. The purpose of these studies is to identify Lyn's downstream effectors in mediating DNA synthesis. While G-CSF stimulated Ras activity in all cell lines, G-CSF failed to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in lyn-deficient cells. G-CSF induced a statistically significant activation of Erk1/Erk2 Kinase or p90Rsk only in the wt cells. G-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and increased activity of PI 3-kinase in wild-type and syk-deficient, but non in lyn-deficient, cells. Inhibition of Shc by over-expression of its SH2 or PTB domains or PI 3-kinase by either treatment with wortmannin or expression of the CblY731F mutant decreased G-CSF-induced DNA synthesis. Thus, the Lyn, Cbl-PI 3-kinase, and Shc/non-Ras-dependent pathways correlate with the ability of cells to respond to G-CSF with increased DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2078562739,"Collagenase-3 (MMP-13) is characterized by an exceptionally wide substrate specificity and restricted expression. MMP-13 is specifically expressed by transformed human keratinocytes in squamous cell carcinomas in vivo and its expression correlates with their invasion capacity. Here, we show, that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) markedly inhibits expression of MMP-13 by human cutaneous SCC cells (UT-SCC-7) and by ras-transformed human epidermal keratinocytes (A-5 cells) at the transcriptional level. In addition, IFN-gamma inhibits collagenase-1 (MMP-1) expression in these cells. IFN-gamma abolished the enhancement of MMP-13 and MMP-1 expression by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and inhibited invasion of A-5 cells through type I collagen. IFN-gamma also rapidly and transiently activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1,2 (ERK1,2) and blocking ERK1,2 pathway (Raf/MEK1,2/ERK1,2) by specific MEK1,2 inhibitor PD98059 partially (by 50%) prevents Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 and suppression of MMP-13 expression by IFN-gamma. Furthermore, Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 by ERK1,2, or independently of ERK1,2 activation is associated with marked reduction in MMP-13 expression. These observations identify a novel role for IFN-gamma as a potent inhibitor of collagenolytic activity and invasion of transformed squamous epithelial cells, and show that inhibition of MMP-13 expression by IFN-gamma involves activation of ERK1,2 and STAT1."

https://openalex.org/W2329079762,"Gene targeting experiments have revealed that transcription factors such as c-Myb and GATA-1 play crucial roles during hematopoietic differentiation. c-Myb is necessary in the immature cells of almost every hematopoietic lineage and GATA-1 is essential for the development of the erythroid lineage. In addition, CREB-binding protein (CBP) acts as a transcriptional adapter for various transcription factors, including c-Myb and GATA-1. In this paper, we show that the transcription factors c-Myb and GATA-1 each inhibit the transcriptional activity of the other and that any possible bipartite complexes c-Myb, GATA-1, and CBP could be formed, but the tripartite complex was hardly formed. The exclusive binding of GATA-1 and c-Myb to CBP is probably the molecular basis for the mutual inhibition of their transcriptional activity. Our data suggest that cross-talk between these three factors might be important for hematopoietic differentiation and that CBP functions as a key molecule during the process."
https://openalex.org/W2031658944,"The differentiation and maintenance of a neurotransmitter phenotype is guided by the interaction of exogenous cues with intrinsic genetic machinery. For the noradrenergic phenotype, these influences combine to activate the expression of the catecholaminergic biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH). In this study, we evaluate the molecular mechanisms by which the transcription factor Arix/Phox2a contributes to DBH gene transcription. We have evaluated the contribution of individual homeodomain binding sites in the rat DBH promoter region and find that all are essential for both basal and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulated transcription. Using mammalian one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, we demonstrate that recruitment of Arix to the positions of homeodomain core recognition sites 1 and 2 at −153 to −166 of the DBH gene restores complete responsiveness of the promoter to PKA in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma and HepG2 hepatoma cells. Intracellular Arix-Arix interactions are evident and may contribute to the interdependence of homeodomain binding sites. Analysis of functional domains of Arix reveals an N-terminal activation domain and a C-terminal repression domain. The N terminus of Arix contains an amino acid motif similar to a region in Brachyury and Pax9 transcription factors. The N-terminal activation domain of Arix interacts with the transcriptional co-activator, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein, which potentiates transcription from the DBH promoter in a PKA-dependent manner.

At the foundation of this issue are the functional mechanisms that mediate phenotype-specific regulation of genes. Environmental cues along the path of migrating neural crest cells are thought to induce the expression of proneural transcription factors that govern genetic pathways responsible for the coordinate regulation of pan-neuronal and phenotype-specific markers (1.Ernsberger U. Patzke H. Tissier-Seta J.P. Reh T. Rohrer H. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2.Groves A.K. George K.M. Tissier-Seta J-P. Engel D. Brunet J-F. Anderson D.J.

Members of the Arix/Phox2 family of paired-like homeodomain transcription factors are thought to be critical components of the genetic pathways involved in the differentiation of noradrenergic characteristics in neurons (4.Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsch M-R. Kapur R.P. Goridis C. Brunet J-F. Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5.Lo L. Tiveron M-C. Anderson D.J.

Brunet J-F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The noradrenergic phenotype is typified by the coexpression of the enzymes critical for noradrenaline synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine-β hydroxylase (DBH).1 Mice with null mutations of Phox2a or Phox2b exhibit the conspicuous failure of central or peripheral noradrenergic populations to differentiate (4.Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsch M-R. Kapur R.P. Goridis C. Brunet J-F. Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In cultured neural crest cells, bone morphogenetic protein 2 was shown to induce Arix/Phox2a and to eventually express markers of panneuronal differentiation (5.Lo L. Tiveron M-C. Anderson D.J. Development. 1998; 125: 609-620PubMed Google Scholar), but co-stimulation of the cAMP/PKA system is required to induce the coexpression of tyrosine hydroxylase and DBH expression at detectable levels (7.Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J-F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that phases of the genetic programs regulating neurotransmitter phenotype may require additional instructional cues to push differentiation toward a specific fate and drive sustained expression phenotype-specific genes. A deeper understanding of the role genetic pathways in regulating cellular phenotype is limited by our knowledge of how these transcription networks function to directly regulate phenotype-specific target genes. Although genetic manipulation studies strongly implicate the Arix/Phox2 family in the regulation of the noradrenergic phenotype, they have not demonstrated whether these proteins are directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of the DBH or tyrosine hydroxylase genes. Cell transfection of DNAs into cultured cells and biochemical analyses of DNA-protein interactions have shown that Arix/Phox2 family members regulate the noradrenergic phenotype by direct activation of the promoters of both tyrosine hydroxylase and DBH genes (8.Zellmer E.

Adachi, D. J. Swanson, and E. J. Lewis, submitted for publication. 2M. Adachi, D. J. Swanson, and E. J. Lewis, submitted for publication. Furthermore, activation of the DBH promoter by Arix is synergistically stimulated by the cAMP/PKA pathway (9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with findings of Loet al. (7.Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J-F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), where bone morphogenetic protein 2 induction of DBH gene expression in neural crest cells requires not only the function of Arix/Phox2 proteins but also stimulation of the PKA pathway. Thus, it appears that Arix functions as a node for integration of multiple cues within the genetic pathway regulating expression of noradrenergic specific genes. It is evident that Arix/Phox2a is a necessary factor for the selective expression of the DBH gene in noradrenergic neurons. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) that underlie Arix/Phox2a-mediated transcription from the DBH promoter. The goal of this study was to elucidate the functional action of Arix at the DBH promoter as it regulates the DBH gene. We have defined an enhancer element, the DB1 enhancer, within the rat DBH promoter that is essential for tissue-specific regulation, Arix-dependent activation, and PKA-induced modulation (9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13.Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this enhancer is found a CRE/AP1-like element located adjacent to two homeodomain core recognition (HD) sites, displaying a characteristic central ATTA motif. The two HD sites of the DB1 enhancer (HD1/2) and a third, more proximally located HD site (HD3) can serve as binding sites for members of the Arix/Phox2 family (8.Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these Arix/Phox2 proteins bind to these sites in nuclear extracts from catecholaminergic cells. The CRE/AP1 site binds PKA-induced AP1 transcription factors, c-Fos and c-Jun, and is also necessary for the synergistic promoter activation by PKA and Arix (9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24065-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Arix and PKA-induced AP1 proteins synergistically drive DBH transcription by directly activating the DBH promoter in a combinatorial fashion. The precise role of Arix and how it functions through the HD sites in the promoter is still uncertain. An emerging theme in transcriptional activation is the assembly of multiprotein regulatory complexes at enhancers and promoters of target genes (14.Tijan R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These complexes are formed through multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The mechanisms that underlie transcriptional synergy through multiple transcription factors may then rely on either the cooperative binding of these factors to the DNA or the stable co-recruitment of coactivators or components of the general transcription machinery (reviewed by Tijan and Maniatis (14.Tijan R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar)). The transcriptional coactivators, CBP/p300, are large, multifunctional proteins, containing histone acetyltransferase activity (reviewed by Goldman et al. (15.Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-119PubMed Google Scholar)). These transcriptional activators are believed to facilitate transcription by remodeling chromatin structure (16.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar, 17.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar) and by recruiting components of the general transcription machinery to the promoter (18.Kwok R, P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C.

CBP/p300 contain several domains necessary for interaction with transcriptional activators including CREB (20.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar), c-Fos (21.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and c-Jun (22.Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17746-17750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The recruitment of CBP/p300 proteins to the promoter may then be stabilized through multiple contacts with transcriptional activators distributed at different sites along the promoter. A stable coactivator complex could then greatly facilitate transcription and would be manifest as a much stronger synergistic response. To understand the mechanism by which Arix regulates transcription of the DBH and tyrosine hydroxylase promoters, it is necessary to define the transcriptional activation domains and interacting coactivator proteins that participate in Arix function. We have shown that Arix possesses an activation domain that functions in a DBH promoter context-dependent manner. Intracellular Arix-Arix interactions are evident and may influence binding to the three homeodomain recognition sites in the DBH promoter-proximal region. It appears that the functional synergism of Arix with PKA involves the coactivator, CBP, which interacts with the Arix activation domain. These results demonstrate that Arix is a tissue-specific transcriptional activator, which regulates DBH promoter responsiveness by combining with other factors to recruit coactivators and the general transcription machinery directly to the DBH promoter, thereby facilitating basal and activated transcription of the DBH gene. Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% nonessential amino acids, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate. Human SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in a 1:1 ratio of F-12 nutrient mixture and minimum Eagle's medium including 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified air containing 5% CO2. The construction of the reporter plasmid containing the promoter and 5′-flanking sequence of DBH gene cloned adjacent to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) transcription unit (DBH(−232)-CAT) was described previously (13.Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DBH(−232)-Luc reporter plasmid was constructed by insertion of a HindIII–MluI fragment from DBH(−232)-CAT into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega). This reporter construct contains the proximal DBH promoter (−232/+12) including the DB1 enhancer region, TATA-like sequence, and the transcription start site (23.Lewis E.J. Herringbone C. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), linked upstream of the coding sequence of firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (FL). Mutations of the DBH(−232) reporter were made in the DBH(−232)Luc reporter by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Quick Change, Promega). The HD3m reporter construct was made using the complementary oligonucleotide pair CACCAGACAAATGTctagAGGTACAGCC (base pair substitutions in lowercase type) derived from the proximal HD3 and flanking sequences (−80 to −52; see Fig. 1 A) in which the core ATTA site was disrupted. The 2HDm reporter construct was made using the complementary oligonucleotide pair ATGTCCATGCGTCATacGTGTCAccTAGGG (base pair substitutions in lowercase) derived from the DB1 enhancer sequence (−180 to −151; see Fig.1 A) in which both homeodomain core ATTA sites were disrupted. The 2HDgal reporter construct was made using the complementary oligonucleotide pair CCATGCGTCATTcggagtactgtcctccgGATCGGAGC (derived from bp −176 to −139) containing the pMH100 Gal4-UAS (in lowercase) (24.Carey M. Kakidani H Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Patashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which acts as a high affinity binding site for the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal-DBD). This mutation disrupts the sequence containing the HD1 and HD2 sites within the DB1 enhancer leaving the CRE/AP1 site intact. The 3HDm and 3HDgal reporters were made by insertion of anEcoRI/BglII fragment containing the HD3m mutation into similarly digested 2HDm and 2HDgal constructs respectively, resulting in constructs containing all three HD core mutations. All reporter constructs were subjected to automated sequencing to confirm the accuracy of polymerase chain reaction amplification throughout the wild-type and mutated promoter sequences. To construct 5Gal-DBH(−125)-Luc and 5Gal-DBH(−62)-Luc constructs, a fragment containing five tandem copies of the Gal4-UAS site was transferred from the plasmid vector 5×Gal4-TATA-Luciferase (25.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) to the DBH reporter vectors. For the 5Gal-DBH(−125)-Luc and 5Gal-DBH(−62)-Luc constructs, an XbaI site was engineered in the DBH proximal promoter, and the Gal4-UAS sites from 5×Gal4-TATA-luciferase were inserted intoKpnI/XbaI-digested reporter vectors at −125 and −62 bases upstream of the transcription start site, respectively. Thus, these reporter constructs contain the 5Gal-UAS sites and the DBH proximal promoter sequence including the DBH-TATA box and other respective upstream elements necessary to drive the luciferase-reporter transcription unit (illustrated in Fig. 2 A). The functions of these constructs were verified by activation by a Gal-DBD:VP16-AD fusion construct (a gift from Dr. Richard Maurer), which recruits the strong VP16 activation domain to the promoter through the Gal4-UAS sites. The RSV-PKA expression construct was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University; previously described in Ref. 26.Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pCBP-HA expression plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University; previously described in Ref. 27.Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The construction of RSV-Arix has been previously described (9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human NBPhox was constructed by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and genomic cloning techniques. DNA encoding the N-terminal and homeodomain portion of NBPhox were cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of RNA from SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, using primers 5′-TGCTCTAGAGACCTCAGACAAGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGTCAGACTTTTTGCCCG-3′, encompassing bases 174–896 of the original NBPhox cDNA (28.Yokoyama M. Nishi Y. Yoshii J. Okubo K. Matsubara K. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal and 3′-untranslated segments are encoded within one exon and were identified by isolation of a genomic clone of human NBPhox. The two segments were recombined by cloning techniques, generating an NBPhox cDNA corresponding to bases 177–1831 of the original cDNA. This cDNA contains the entire coding sequence, 185 bases of 5′-untranslated and 533 bases of 3′-untranslated regions, and is cloned into vector pcDNA3. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged expression constructs for wild-type and truncated Arix were made using the HA6.1 expression vector developed and generously provided by Dr. Paul Shapiro. HA6.1 consists of a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) backbone with an N-terminal HA epitope tag and MCS for in-frame fusion with target proteins. The precise construction of HA-tagged wild-type Arix (aa 1–280) and ArΔC (aa 1–151), ArΔN (aa 84–280), and ArHD (aa 84–151) has been described elsewhere.2 Each construct was created with anEcoRI site 3′ to the HA epitope that was used to create in-frame Gal-DBD fusions described below. The vectors Gal-DBD and VP16-AD (gifts from Dr. Richard Maurer) were used as the parent for making Gal-DBD fusion constructs with full-length and truncated Arix expression constructs. The Gal-DBD vector consists of a backbone pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) using the cytomegalovirus promoter to drive an expression cassette containing the zinc finger DNA binding domain of GAL4 (aa 1–147), derived from the plasmid pSG424 (25.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 29.Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), as an N-terminal fusion with target proteins. The VP16-AD vector also consisted of a pcDNA3 backbone containing the herpes simplex VP16-activation domain (AD, aa 402–479) as an N-terminal fusion with target proteins. Full-length Arix-VP16 was created by insertion of an EcoRI–NotI fragment from HA-Arix into the VP16-AD parent vector. Full-length Gal-Arix (aa 1–281), Gal-ArΔC (aa 1–150), and Gal-ArHD (aa 84–150) constructs were made by insertion of EcoRI–NotI fragments from HA-Arix, HA-ArΔC, and HA-ArHD, respectively, into the Gal-DBD vector. Gal-NAr (aa 1–101) was created by insertion of a linker between the Bpu1102 and XbaI sites of full-length Gal-Arix, creating a stop codon after residue Lys101 and removing much of the 3′-untranslated region of Arix. Gal-ArC (aa 148–281) was created by insertion of a linker between theEcoRI and BssHII sites of full-length Arix, creating an in-frame fusion of the Gal-DBD with residue Gln148. Gal-ΔnAr (aa 26–281) was created by insertion of a linker between the EcoRI and NarI sites of full-length Arix, resulting in the insertion of a proline residue between the Gal-DBD and residue Ala26 of Arix. All expression constructs producedin vitro translated proteins of the appropriate predicted sizes. DNA constructs used for transfection were purified using the Promega Wizard kit. Following purification according to the manufacturer's procedures, DNA was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of ammonium acetate and then resuspended in sterile water. SHSY-5Y and HepG2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (13.Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 0.5–1 × 106 cells/well and transfected with a total of 3–4 μg of plasmid DNA (as indicated in each figure). All transfections using the DBH-Luc based reporters included 0.5 μg of the pRL-null reporter construct (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. This vector is a promoterless reporter containing the transcription unit ofRenilla luciferase (RL). We have found that the pRL-null reporter gives measurable levels of RL expression that are consistent across experiments, and expression is not stimulated by cotransfection with PKA. 3D. J. Swanson, M. Adachi, and E. J. Lewis, unpublished observations. Thus, the use of this promoterless reporter is ideal for normalization in experiments measuring the effects of PKA stimulation. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in passive lysis buffer. 20 μl of cleared lysates were sequentially assayed for firefly luciferase andRenilla luciferase using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter activities are calculated as the ratio of light units of firefly luciferase to light units of Renilla luciferase (FL/RL). For CBP experiments, HepG2 cells were plated in 100-mm plates at a density of 3 × 106 cells/plate. Transient transfections were performed using calcium phosphate with a total of 20 μg of plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for protein content and CAT activity (3.Goridis C. Brunet J-F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized to total lysate protein, since previous experimental results indicated a stimulatory effect of cAMP and PKA on the RSV promoter of RSV-luciferase (9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion constructs of fragments of CBP, GST-CBP-(1–450), GST-CBP-(450–682), GST-CBP-(1091–1330), GST-CBP-(1679–1874), were a generous gift from Drs. Hua Lu (Oregon Health Sciences University) and Dick Goodman (Vollum Institute). GST-CBP fusion proteins were prepared and bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) following the procedure described by Ausbel et al.(32.Ausbel Fredrick M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 20.2.1-20.2.10Google Scholar). Each preparation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to verify protein integrity and estimate the concentration of protein load on beads. Agarose beads containing approximately equal amounts of GST fusion protein were resuspended in binding buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Test proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturer's procedure. Equal amounts of labeled protein were incubated with the fusion protein-bead complexes for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C. Affinity complexes were washed five times in binding buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactively labeled proteins were then visualized by autoradiography. The rat DBH promoter region contains multiple HD sites (see Fig.1 A). Two HD sites are found within the previously identified DB1 enhancer region (13.Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), approximately 160 bp from the transcriptional start site. This pair of HD sites, designated HD1/2, is positioned adjacent to the functionally critical CRE/AP1-like site (9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A third, more proximally located HD (HD3) is found 60 bp upstream of the start site. We have previously demonstrated that mutations within the DB1 enhancer that disrupted HD1/2 sites decreased basal and stimulated transcription from the DBH promoter (8.Zellmer E. Zhang A. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27382-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These mutations, however, also disrupted the adjacent AP1-like site. To evaluate the distinct contribution of the HD1/2 pair and the HD3 site to cell type-specific DBH promoter regulation, small (3–4-bp) mutations were used to disrupt the ATTA core sequence of each of these HD elements. The noradrenergic neuroblastoma cell line, SHSY-5Y, and the hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2, served as models to compare cell type specificity of DBH transcription in transient transfection analyses. SHSY-5Y cells express the DBH gene as well as Arix and NBPhox. HepG2 cells are negative for neuronal markers, including Arix and NBPhox,"

https://openalex.org/W2063080038,"The epithelium-specific transcription factor, ERT/ESX/ESE-1/ELF3, binds to the TGF-beta RII promoter in a sequence specific manner and regulates its expression. In this study, we investigated whether ERT could regulate endogenous TGF-beta RII expression in Hs578t breast cancer cells. Analyses of the Hs578t parental cell line revealed low RII mRNA expression and resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Infection of this cell line with a retroviral construct expressing ERT induced higher levels of endogenous RII mRNA expression and protein expression relative to cells infected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CATneo) as a control. Relative to control cells, the ERTneo-expressing Hs578t cells show approximately a 50% reduction in cell growth in the presence of exogenous TGF-beta1, as well as a fourfold higher induction of activation in transient transfection assays using the 3TP-luciferase reporter construct. When transplanted into athymic mice, ERT-expressing Hs578t cells showed decreased and delayed tumorigenicity compared with control cells. This data strongly suggests that ERT plays an important role as a transcriptional activator of TGF-beta RII expression, and that deregulated ERT expression may play a critical role in rendering Hs578t human breast cancer cells insensitive to TGF-beta's growth inhibitory effects."

https://openalex.org/W2085180155,"In vitro studies in model cell lines have implicated the GTPase Rho in the control of diverse cellular responses including the control of the actin cytoskeleton and the regulation of cell cycle progression. It is also reported that the transformation of fibroblasts via oncogenic Ras requires intact Rho signalling. An invaluable tool used to investigate Rho function is the bacterial toxin C3 transferase derived from Clostridium botulinum. C3 transferase ribosylates Rho in its effector domain thereby abolishing interaction with downstream effectors. We have previously reported the use of C3 transferase under the control of the thymocyte specific lck promoter to explore the role of Rho in T cell biology. Strikingly, lck-C3 mice develop aggressive malignant thymic lymphoblastic lymphomas between 4 and 8 months of age. These studies reveal that loss of Rho function is associated with prediposition to lymphoid cell transformation. Inhibition of Rho function has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy for treatment of Ras-transformed tumours. The development of lymphomas in mice devoid of functional Rho in their T cell compartment shows that such a strategy would need to be used with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2085371283,"PSM/SH2-B has been described as a cellular partner of the FcepsilonRI receptor, insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR), and nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA). A function has been proposed in neuronal differentiation and development but its role in other signaling pathways is still unclear. To further elucidate the physiologic role of PSM we have identified additional mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases as putative PSM partners including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) beta, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met), and fibroblast growth factor receptor. We have mapped Y740 as a site of PDGFR beta that is involved in the association with PSM. We have further investigated the putative role of PSM in mitogenesis with three independent experimental strategies and found that all consistently suggested a role as a positive, stimulatory signaling adapter in normal NIH3T3 and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts. (1) PSM expression from cDNA using an ecdysone-regulated transient expression system stimulated PDGF-BB-, IGF-I-, and insulin- but not EGF-induced DNA synthesis in an ecdysone dose-responsive fashion; (2) Microinjection of the (dominant negative) PSM SH2 domain interfered with PDGF-BB- and insulin-induced DNA synthesis; and (3) A peptide mimetic of the PSM Pro-rich putative SH3 domain-binding region interfered with PDGF-BB-, IGF-I-, and insulin- but not with EGF-induced DNA synthesis in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. This experiment was based on cell-permeable fusion peptides with the Drosophila antennapedia homeodomain which effectively traverse the plasma membrane of cultured cells. These experimental strategies independently suggest that PSM functions as a positive, stimulatory, mitogenic signaling mediator in PDGF-BB, IGF-I, and insulin but not in EGF action. This function appears to involve the PSM SH2 domain as well as the Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding region. Our findings support the model that PSM participates as an adapter in various mitogenic signaling mechanisms by linking an activated (receptor) phospho-tyrosine to the SH3 domain of an unknown cellular partner."
https://openalex.org/W2335295484,"Control of cell growth and division by the p53 tumor suppressor protein requires its abilities to transactivate and repress specific target genes and to associate in complex with other proteins. Here we demonstrate that p53 binds to the E1A-regulated transcription factor p120E4F, a transcriptional repressor of the adenovirus E4 promoter. The interaction involves carboxy-terminal half of p120E4F and sequences located at the end of the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of p53. Ectopic expression of p120E4F leads to a block of cell proliferation in several human and murine cell lines and this effect requires the association with wild-type (wt) p53. Although p120E4F can also bind to mutant p53, the growth suppression induced by overexpression of the protein is severely reduced in a cell line that contains mutant p53. These data suggest that p120E4F may represent an important element within the complex network of p53 checkpoint functions."

Here, we report a novel mutation identified in a recessive myotonia congenita family. This mutation, Gly-499 to Arg (G499R) is located in the putative transmembrane domain 10 of the ClC-1 protein. In contrast to normal ClC-1 channels that deactivate upon hyperpolarization, functional expression of G499R ClC-1 yielded a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current when measured in the presence of a high (134 mm) intracellular chloride concentration. Current was abolished when measured with a physiological chloride transmembrane gradient. Electrophysiological analysis of other Gly-499 mutants (G499K, G499Q, and G499E) suggests that the positive charge introduced by the G499R mutation may be responsible for this unique gating behavior.

There are two models to account for the voltage-dependent gating of ClC channels. According to one model, the voltage-dependent opening of the ClC channel depends on the binding of chloride ions to the channel and the movement of these ions through the conduction pathway (33.Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34.Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35.Chen T.Y. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The second model proposed the existence of an intrinsic voltage sensor (36.Fahlke C. Rudel R. Mitrovic N. Zhou M. George Jr., A.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which bound anions interact with a voltage-dependent gate. However, in either model, the domains involved with voltage sensing or anion binding remain unclear. In contrast to WT ClC-1 channels that normally deactivate in response to hyperpolarization under physiologic conditions, one ClC-1 mutant (D136G) has been shown to activate upon hyperpolarization (36.Fahlke C. Rudel R. Mitrovic N. Zhou M. George Jr., A.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37.Pusch M. Jordt S.E. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A similar behavior of activation with hyperpolarization was observed for WT channels when studied at low extracellular pH (38.Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this behavior is unknown. In this study, a novel Gly-499 → Arg (G499R) mutation was identified in a recessive MC (Becker's disease) patient. Functional analysis revealed that G499R ClC-1 channels activate upon hyperpolarization, similar to D136G ClC-1 channels. Site-directed mutagenesis at several sites in putative transmembrane domain 10 (D10) revealed the importance of electrostatic effects in this unique gating behavior and suggested an important role for D10 in the voltage-dependent gating of the ClC-1 channel. A Polish kindred (Fig.1 A; father, mother, and son) was evaluated, and the son was diagnosed with Becker's MC. The proband and his parents underwent a complete neurological exam, with particular attention directed toward the neuromuscular system, including a standard electromyographic examination. A blood sample was drawn from each member of the family for DNA extraction. Intronic sequence was used to design primers (19.Lehmann-Horn F. Mailander V. Heine R. George A.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1397-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that allowed amplification ofCLCN1 exons from genomic DNA. The 10-μl PCR mixture contained 50 ng of genomic DNA, 6.7 μl of dH2O, 0.6 μl of dNTP (125 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate), 0.3 μl (25 pmol/μl) of forward and reverse primer, 1 μl of reaction buffer (500 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin), 0.25 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl, Perkin-Elmer Corp.), and 0.1 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixtures were initially denatured at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles each of 30 s for denaturing at 94 °C, 30 s for annealing at temperature, and 30 s for extension at 72 °C. SSCP was carried out using previously described methods (23.Zhang J. George Jr., A.L. Griggs R.C. Fouad G.T. Roberts J. Kwiecinski H. Connolly A.M. Ptacek L.J. Neurology. 1996; 47: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PCR products were diluted and denatured in 50 μl of 0.1% SDS/10 mm EDTA. After the addition of loading dye, the mixtures were heated at 94 °C for 3 min. The denatured mixture (2 μl) was separated by electrophoresis through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 40 W for 3–7 h. The gels were run under the following two conditions: room temperature with glycerol, and 4 °C without glycerol. Gels were transferred to filter paper, dried on a vacuum slab dryer for 1 h at 85 °C, and then exposed to x-ray film at −20 °C for 12–24 h. Eluted DNA (10 μl) from the aberrant bands was reamplified using both the original PCR primers pair with additional M13 sequencing primer tails. Samples were purified by a centrifugation wash with a Centricon-100 column (Amicon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and then sequenced on an Applied BioSystems model 373A DNA sequencer using the dideoxy termination method. Two missense mutations, G499R and G482R (21.Meyer-Kleine C. Steinmeyer K. Ricker K. Jentsch T.J. Koch M.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1325-1334PubMed Google Scholar), and seven point mutations (see under “Results”) were introduced into the pRc/CMV-ClC-1 vector by standard two-step PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All PCRs were conducted using PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for high fidelity amplifications. Two fragments were amplified in the first step, using either primer pair A/B or pair C/D, which contained the desired mutations, and pRc/CMV-ClC-1 as a template. In the second step, the two partial overlapping fragments were joined by annealing and extended by polymerization. These full-length templates were amplified using primer pair A/D. The final products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (HindIII (Promega, Madison, WI) andEco47 III (Stratagene)) and ligated into the pRc/CMV-ClC-1 vector. All PCRs were carried out in a DNA Engine Tetrad (M.J. Research, Waltham, MA). The inserts were sequenced to exclude any polymerase errors. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1573) were grown on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.); and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. One day after the cultures were split, the calcium/phosphate precipitation technique (39.Graham R. Van Der EB AJ. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) was used for cell transfection. About 0.4 μg of the appropriate pRc/CMV-ClC-1 plasmid DNA was used for each transfection in 35-mm culture dishes. To allow identification of transfected cells during patch clamp experiments, cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein plasmid cDNA (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Approximately 15 h after transfection, cells were split again, and the medium was changed. Currents were recorded from 36 to 48 h after transfection by the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (40.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch 200 B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Data were acquired on-line by a personal computer with pClamp6 software and a Digidata 1200 A/D interface (Axon Instruments Inc.). Currents were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. The external solution contained 140 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. The standard internal pipette solution contained 130 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. A lower internal Cl−concentration was achieved by equimolar substitution with sodium glutamic acid. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimax, Kimble Glass Inc. Vineland, NJ) by a Sutter P-87 puller (Novato, CA) and were heat-polished with an MF-83 microforge (Narishige Scientific Instruments, Japan). Pipettes had a resistance of between 0.8 and 1.5 MΩ when filled with standard internal solution. The junction potential was adjusted to zero for each experiment, and series resistance was compensated 80–90% by analog circuitry. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship for ClC-1 channels was determined from a holding potential of −35 mV. Currents were elicited by 180-ms test pulses ranging from −190 to +170 mV. Instantaneous currents were determined by extrapolation of fitted current traces to the beginning of each test potential. The isochronal I-V relationship was obtained by measuring current at the end of each test potential. The voltage dependence of relative open probability (P o), was obtained by measuring the instantaneous current, or the peak of tail current (I V) at −135 mV after 1.4-s prepulses ranging from −130 to +170 mV. Tail currents were fitted by a two-exponential function, and the peaks of tail currents obtained by extrapolation were plotted as a function of test voltage and then fitted to a Boltzmann function, IV=Io+(Imax−Io)/(1+exp(V1/2−V)/dx))Equation 1 where I max is the maximal current,I o is a constant offset, V 12 is the half-maximal activation voltage, and dx is the slope factor. The relative P o was obtained by the normalization P o =I V/I max. Current deactivation was determined using a 2-pulse protocol. Cells were held at −35 mV, and then the voltage was stepped to +45 mV for 500 ms. Tail currents were measured during a subsequent 180-ms test pulse to potentials ranging from −135 to +45 mV, applied in 20-mV incremental steps. The time courses of current deactivation and activation were determined by fitting current traces with a two-exponential function, I(t) =A 1exp(−t/τ1) +A 2exp(−t/τ2) +C, where τ1 and A 1 are the time constant and the amplitude of the slow component, respectively; τ2 and A 2 are the time constant and the amplitude of the fast component, respectively; and C is a constant. Data were analyzed with pClamp6 (Axon Instruments, Inc.), Origin (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA), and SigmaStat (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software. All data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was performed using Student'st test and two-way analysis of variance. Two different aberrant conformers were observed in SSCP analysis from DNA samples in this MC kindred (Fig.1 A). DNA sequencing revealed both a novel C-1495-T (antisense strand) transition in exon 14 (Fig.1 B) and a previously identified nonsense mutation (C-2680-T) in exon 23 of the CLCN1 gene. When read in-frame, these mutations predict a Gly to Arg change at amino acid position 499 and an Arg to Stop change at amino acid position 894 in the ClC-1 protein, respectively. Additionally, both mutations were found in the son diagnosed with Becker's MC (Fig. 1 A). Two hundred unrelated normal alleles have been screened for this C-1495-T conformer by SSCP analysis, and no similar aberrant pattern has been observed (data not shown). According to the putative channel topology, this G499R mutation is located at the end of the putative transmembrane D10 segment (Fig.2 A). Sequence alignment shows that Gly-499 is highly conserved among the different ClC homologues (Fig. 2 B). In order to understand the functional consequence of this novel ClC-1 mutation and its role in MC, we characterized the biophysical properties of the G499R ClC-1 channels expressed in HEK-293 cells. Currents recorded from HEK-293 cells expressing either WT ClC-1 or G499R ClC-1 are shown in Fig. 3. Membrane hyperpolarization (from +45 mV) of cells expressing WT ClC-1 channels elicited a large inward current that rapidly deactivated. At steady state, the maximum inward current saturated near −100 mV (Fig. 3A, left). Upon depolarization (from −135 mV), WT channels activated and reached saturation near +100 mV (Fig. 3 A, right). In contrast, the G499R mutant channels activated upon hyperpolarization did not deactivate nor saturate, even at −220 mV (Fig. 3 B, left). Unlike WT ClC-1 channels, mutant channels closed upon depolarization (Fig. 3 B, right). The amplitude of G499R ClC-1 current was smaller than that of WT ClC-1 channel (Fig. 4, A andB). For example, at −130 mV, the mean instantaneous current amplitude for WT was 3.0 ± 0.7 nA, and for G499R was 0.4 ± 0.03 nA. G499R ClC-1 also exhibited more pronounced inward rectification than WT channels, and effects were notable in both instantaneous and isochronal I-V relationships (Fig. 4, Cand D). In addition to the decrease in current amplitude, the voltage dependence of the relative open probability (P o) of G499R ClC-1 channels was dramatically altered. In the voltage range from −200 to +100 mV, theP o-voltage curve for WT ClC-1 could be described by a single Boltzmann function (V 12 = −64.1 ± 3.0 mV; slope factor, 24.3 ± 0.8 mV). In contrast to WT, the voltage dependence of P o for G499R ClC-1 channels was completely reversed (Fig. 4 E). In the voltage range from −200 to +50 mV, the V 12 was −56.6 ± 2.4 mV, with a slope factor of −22.2 ± 2.2 mV. To further investigate the pathogenic role of the G499R mutant channel in MC, we also studied its function using a physiological transmembrane gradient of chloride concentration. Current traces recorded with 5 mm intracellular (pipette) chloride from both the WT ClC-1 and the G499R ClC-1 channels are shown in Fig.5, A and B. The G499R mutation caused a dramatic reduction in chloride conductance (Fig. 5, C and D). For example, at −105 mV, the average instantaneous current amplitude for WT ClC-1 was 0.7 ± 0.1 nA, but it was only 0.01 ± 0.004 nA for the G499R mutant. The dramatic reduction of G499R current at a physiological chloride concentration fully explains its pathogenic role in MC. In order to understand how the G499R mutation causes such a dramatic change in the gating of the ClC-1 channels, we constructed several missense mutations of Gly-499 in the ClC-1 protein. First, to investigate whether or not Arg is necessary for this unique voltage-dependent gating, we replaced the Gly at position 499 with Lys, which is similar to Arg in both size and charge. If the unusual gating of G499R ClC-1 channels was only charge-related, then the properties of G499K should be similar to G499R. Fig.6, A and B, shows current traces recorded from HEK-293 cells transfected with G499K ClC-1 cDNA. As predicted, these currents were similar to G499R ClC-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). TheP o-voltage curve for G499K ClC-1 was also similar to G499R ClC-1 (Fig. 6C, V 12 = −56.9 ± 4.6 mV; slope factor, −17.4 ± 2.3 mV; for G499K). In the voltage range of −130 to +50 mV, the V 12 of theP o-voltage curve was the same as that for G499R (p > 0.05). This hyperpolarization-activated gating of the G499R and G499K mutants could result from either electrostatic or structure changes (or both) at this residue. To distinguish among these possibilities, we then introduced a Gln at position 499. This residue is similar in size to Arg and Lys but neutral in charge. The gating of G499Q ClC-1 channels (Fig.7, A and B) was similar to WT ClC-1 channels (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the hyperpolarization activation is an electrostatic effect of the G499R mutant. However, unlike WT ClC-1 channels, theP o-voltage curve of G499Q ClC-1 channel currents could not be simply fitted by single Boltzmann function (Fig.7 C). To further evaluate the importance of the electostatic forces at this position, we mutated this residue to Glu, which is similar in size to Arg but negatively charged. The G499E channels did not exhibit the inverted-gating property of G499(R/K). Instead, G499E ClC-1 channels deactivated slowly upon hyperpolarization from a holding potential of +45 mV and exhibited much slower deactivation kinetics (Fig.8, A and B). In contrast to the WT deactivation requiring a fit with two exponential functions, only a single time constant was needed to describe the deactivation of G499E ClC-1 channels (Fig. 8 C). Furthermore, the P o-voltage relationship of G499E ClC-1 channels was very different from that of the WT ClC-1 channels (Fig.8 D). In response to voltage steps from negative prepulse potentials (−130 to −10 mV) to the test potential (−135mV), the tail current remained constant (P o = 0.3) even though the conductance (gCl) decreased throughout this range. That is, conductance decreased with decreasing driving force, but channel gating was not voltage-dependent in this range of potentials (Fig. 8 D). The P o of G499E increased over the range of positive potentials and could be described by a single Boltzmann function with a V 12 of 89.7 ± 4.9 mV and a slope factor of 48.2 ± 3.2 mV (Fig.8 D). These data indicate that substituting a negative residue for Gly-499 not only abolished the inverted voltage-dependent gating property of G499R but also impaired the closing of ClC-1 channels at negative potentials. Due to the importance of charged residues at position 499 in D10, we also examined Arg-496, the only charged residue in D10 of the WT channel (Fig. 2). Expression of channels with Arg-499 changed to a neutral residue (Gln) did not yield any detectable chloride current (data not shown). Because Arg-496 and Gly-499 are in close proximity in the putative α-helical structure for D10, we hypothesized that G499R might compensate for the charge loss of the R496Q mutation. However, the double mutant (R496Q/G499R) did not functionally express (data not shown). We replaced Arg-496 with Lys (R496K) and showed that channel current was similar to that of WT (Fig. 9, A and B). However, the P o-voltage curve was shifted to more negative potentials when compared with WT (Fig. 9 C, V 12 = −97.8 ± 5.2 mV; p < 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that a positive charge at position 496 is essential for normal channel function. Another naturally occurring MC mutation is known to introduce an additional charged residue in D10. The G482R mutation was originally identified in a Becker's MC family (21.Meyer-Kleine C. Steinmeyer K. Ricker K. Jentsch T.J. Koch M.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1325-1334PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). As with the R496Q mutant, expression of G482R ClC-1 channels did not yield detectable current (data not shown). To further investigate the importance of charge in this region of ClC-1, we also mutated Glu-500, the first charged residue in the putative loop between D10 and D11 (Fig. 2), to Gln (E500Q). Expression of E500Q ClC-1 channels yielded a current similar to WT (Fig.10, A and B) without having significant effects on the voltage dependence ofP o (p > 0.05; Fig.10 C). These data indicate that electrostatic effects due to charge alterations at position 500 are not as important for ClC-1 function as changes at position 482, 496, or 499. MC has been recognized for over a century (41.Thomsen J. Arch. Psychiatr. Nervenkr. 1876; 6: 702-718Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The muscle stiffness and delayed relaxation observed in MC are the result of repetitive electrical discharges and hyperexcitability of muscles that is known to result from decreased Cl− conductance of sarcolemma (1.Bryant S.H. Morales-Aguilera A. J. Physiol. 1971; 219: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 2.Palade P.T. Barchi R.L. J. Gen.

Lehmann-Horn F. Rudel R. Muscle Nerve. 1988; 11: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, elucidation of the molecular basis of this disease was not possible until the cloning of CLCN1 gene. Although mutational analysis and functional characterization of ClC-1 channels have provided some insights into MC, the mechanisms of disease need to be further defined and may shed light on the function of WT channels. In the present study, we identified a novel G499R mutation and a previously known nonsense R894X mutation (14.George Jr., A.L. Sloan-Brown K. Fenichel G.M. Mitchell G.A. Spiegel R. Pascuzzi R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2071-2072PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Zhang J. George Jr., A.L. Griggs R.C. Fouad G.T. Roberts J. Kwiecinski H. Connolly A.M. Ptacek L.J. Neurology. 1996; 47: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in a Becker's MC family. Our genetic analysis indicates that G499R and R894X are transmitted as recessive alleles. Under physiological ionic conditions, the conductance of the G499R ClC-1 channel was undetectable. Thus, G499R ClC-1 channels are unlikely to contribute any chloride conductance in muscle membranes. A similar phenomenon has also been described for the D136G mutation (36.Fahlke C. Rudel R. Mitrovic N. Zhou M. George Jr., A.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that R894X mutation produces a truncated protein, expression of mutant channels was reported to cause a reduction but not a complete abolition of chloride conductance (21.Meyer-Kleine C. Steinmeyer K. Ricker K. Jentsch T.J. Koch M.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1325-1334PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that any muscle membrane chloride conductance in our patient results from channels encoded by the R894X allele. Hyperpolarization-activated gating behavior of ClC-1 observed in the G499(R/K) mutants has been noted previously in a naturally occurring Becker's mutation, D136G (36.Fahlke C. Rudel R. Mitrovic N.

https://openalex.org/W1996410410,"Previous studies have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) synergizes with various extracellular matrix components in promoting the migration of B82L fibroblasts expressing wild-type EGF receptors and that functional EGF receptors are critical for the conversion of B82L fibroblasts to a migratory cell type (1.Li J. Lin M. Wiepz G.W. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on the motility of B82L fibroblasts using a microchemotaxis chamber. We found that PDGF can enhance fibronectin-induced migration of B82L fibroblasts expressing wild-type EGF receptors (B82L-clone B3). However, B82L cells that lack the EGF receptor (B82L-parental) or that express an EGF receptor that is kinase-inactive (B82L-K721M) or C-terminally truncated (B82L-c′973) exhibit little PDGF-stimulated migration. In addition, none of these three cell lines exhibit the capacity to migrate to fibronectin alone. These observations indicate that, similar to cell migration toward fibronectin, PDGF-induced cell migration of B82L fibroblasts is augmented by the expression of an intact EGF receptor kinase. The loss of PDGF-stimulated motility in B82L cells that do not express an intact EGF receptor does not appear to result from a gross dysfunction of PDGF receptors, because ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-β receptor and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases are readily detectable in these cells. Moreover, an interaction between EGF and PDGF receptor systems is supported by the observation that the EGF receptor exhibits an increase in phosphotyrosine content in a time-dependent fashion upon the addition of PDGF. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that the expression of EGF receptor is critical for PDGF-stimulated migration of murine B82L fibroblasts and suggest a role for the EGF receptor downstream of PDGF receptor activation in the signaling events that lead to PDGF-stimulated cell motility. Previous studies have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) synergizes with various extracellular matrix components in promoting the migration of B82L fibroblasts expressing wild-type EGF receptors and that functional EGF receptors are critical for the conversion of B82L fibroblasts to a migratory cell type (1.Li J.

Both receptor isoforms can mediate mitogenic signals, yet they exhibit a differential capacity to mediate chemotactic signals (8.Hayashi N. Takehara K. Soma Y. Arch. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 545-550Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase leads to receptor autophosphorylation and the regulation of various cellular substrates containing Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains including phospholipase-Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GTPase-activating protein for Ras, Src family kinases, and several adaptor proteins such as Grb2, Shc, and Nck (2.Williams L.T.

These events initiate diverse signal transduction cascades that culminate in growth factor-stimulated end points such as cell proliferation and migration. Emerging evidence supports the concept that PDGF-induced cell motility is associated with the activation of phospholipase-Cγ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the suppression of Ras GTPase-activating protein (10.Kundra V.

Ross R. Hunter T. Cell. 1982; 31: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), certain cell types respond differently to these two growth factors (14.Rani C.S. Wang F. Fuior E.

Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Considerable progress has been made recently toward an understanding of how cell migration occurs and the linkages that are needed between PDGF receptor signaling and the modulation of the cell migration machinery (19.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 20.Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Cell motility is a process requiring the temporal and spatial coordination of cellular events such as actin assembly/disassembly and adhesion formation/detachment. PDGF appears to stimulate actin filament reorganization through activation of the small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42, Rho, and Rac (19.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 20.Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Similarly, several proteins localized at focal adhesions such as focal adhesion kinase, paxillin (22.Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and talin (24.Tidball J.G. Spencer M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) are tyrosine-phosphorylated following PDGF treatment, whereas another cytoskeletal protein, vinculin, has been found to redistribute from focal adhesions to the perinuclear regions upon PDGF administration. In addition, activated PDGF-β receptors have been found to associate with the αvβ3 integrin, and this association potentiates both mitogenic and chemotactic responses induced by PDGF (25.Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Conversely, the activation of integrins can also lead to the modulation of PDGF receptors. For example, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, either alone (26.Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or together with PDGF (27.Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), can promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-β receptors. Moreover, PDGF-induced phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization have been found to induce actin filament disassembly (28.Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), consistent with the ability of PDGF to relax stress fibers and to induce edge membrane ruffles (23.Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29.Mellstrom K. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Another member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, the EGF receptor, has been shown to share many structural and functional similarities with the PDGF receptor. In a previous study from our laboratory, we reported that EGF can stimulate integrin-mediated migration toward various ECM components in mouse B82L fibroblasts transfected with the human EGF receptor (1.Li J. Lin M. Wiepz G.W. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Co-presentation (co-positioning) of EGF with laminin or fibronectin is essential for EGF-stimulated migration (1.Li J. Lin M. Wiepz G.W. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The expression of functional EGF receptors, including an intact kinase domain, C terminus, and the intracellular juxtamembrane region, is necessary not only for the EGF-stimulated enhancement of cell migration but also for cell migration toward fibronectin alone (1.Li J. Lin M. Wiepz G.W. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 2J. Li, H. M. Poppleton, A. J. Barbier, P. J. Bertics, and T. B. Patel, submitted for publication. 2J. Li, H. M. Poppleton, A. J. Barbier, P. J. Bertics, and T. B. Patel, submitted for publication. The importance of the EGF receptor for conferring B82L cell motility is further revealed by the inhibition of fibronectin- and laminin-induced cell migration by the addition of neutralizing anti-EGF receptor antibodies, suggesting that the EGF receptor may act downstream of integrin activation and may be engaged in the signal transduction events leading to cell motility (1.Li J. Lin M. Wiepz G.W. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30.Lin M. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Because PDGF initiates many of the same signal transduction events as EGF (2.Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 7.Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to be chemotactic for a number of cell types (15.Seppa H. Grotendorst G. Seppa S. Schiffmann E. Martin G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 16.Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Huang J.S. Walz D.A. Deuel T.F. J.

Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), together with the observation that the EGF receptor appears essential for integrin-mediated cell migration in certain fibroblasts (1.Li J. Lin M. Wiepz G.W. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11209-11219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effects of PDGF on fibronectin-induced migration using mouse B82L fibroblasts transfected with various EGF receptor constructs. We observed that PDGF can enhance fibronectin-induced cell migration to the same extent as EGF, but that this enhancement of cell migration occurs only in cells expressing wild-type EGF receptors. PDGF did not stimulate the migration of B82L cells that either do not express EGF receptors or that express EGF receptors that are kinase-inactive or C-terminally truncated. However, PDGF can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-β receptor and can result in MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) activation in all of these cells, indicating that they are responsive to PDGF in the absence of an intact EGF receptor. Furthermore, the critical role of the EGF receptor in PDGF stimulation of cell motility is supported by the observation that the EGF receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon PDGF treatment in B82L cells expressing wild-type EGF receptors.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have observed that the stimulatory effect of PDGF on the fibronectin-induced migration of B82L fibroblasts is dependent on the expression of an intact EGF receptor and that the EGF receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF treatment. It has been well documented that PDGF is a potent chemoattractant for several cell types (15.Seppa H. Grotendorst G. Seppa S. Schiffmann E. Martin G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 16.Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Huang J.S. Walz D.A. Deuel T.F. J.

Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and our finding that cell migration in response to PDGF treatment requires an intact EGF receptor provides further evidence for cross-regulation between these two growth factor receptors.Previous investigations have revealed a functional interaction between EGF and PDGF receptor action with regard to the mitogenesis of several cell types. In BALB/c-3T3 cells, different phases of the cell cycle can be regulated by various growth factors (39.Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 25: 2839-2843Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 40.Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 41.Olashaw N.E. Harrington M. Pledger W.J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1983; 7: 489-491Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For example, a brief exposure of cells to PDGF induces BALB/c-3T3 cells to leave G0 and enter the cell cycle, whereas EGF facilitates progression through G0/G1 and entry into S phase (42.Wharton W. Leof E. Pledger W.J. O'Keefe E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, PDGF stimulates porcine theca cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, but although EGF alone is not mitogenic for these cells, it can markedly enhance the proliferative capacity of PDGF (43.May J.V. Bridge A.J. Gotcher E.D. Gangrade B.K. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Conversely, in granulosa cells, EGF- or transforming growth factor-α-stimulated proliferation is enhanced by PDGF (42.Wharton W. Leof E. Pledger W.J. O'Keefe E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43.May J.V. Bridge A.J. Gotcher E.D. Gangrade B.K. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44.May J.V. Frost J.P. Bridge A.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2896-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a synergistic action between EGF and PDGF is not limited to mitogenesis, i.e. PDGF sensitizes BALB/c-3T3 fibroblasts to EGF action with regard to the redistribution of vinculin from focal contacts to the perinuclear region of the cells, whereas EGF alone cannot induce vinculin loss from focal adhesions. In comparison, exposure of these cells to PDGF at concentrations that do not induce vinculin redistribution allows for EGF to induce vinculin redistribution (45.Herman B. Pledger W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, as shown in the present studies via the use of both purified porcine PDGF-BB and recombinant rat PDGF-BB, may provide one potential mechanism by which PDGF and EGF receptors cooperate to promote cell motility in B82L fibroblasts. Because PDGF does not appear to bind to the EGF receptor and because ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-β receptors is observed in B82L-clone B3 cells, it appears that PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor can be initiated by the activated PDGF-β receptor. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that both PDGF and EGF receptors are co-localized in the highly specialized plasma membrane fraction, caveolae (46.Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 47.Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, Habib et al. (48.Habib A.A. Hognason T. Ren J. Stefansson K. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6885-6891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) show that the PDGF receptor and the EGF receptor form a constitutive physical complex in several cell types (48.Habib A.A. Hognason T. Ren J. Stefansson K. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6885-6891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although we were unable to detect complex formation between these two receptors in our systems using immunoprecipitation approach. In these earlier studies (48.Habib A.A. Hognason T. Ren J. Stefansson K. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6885-6891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it was also demonstrated that the addition of EGF results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-β receptors and the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the PDGF-β receptor. However, the authors did not observe any increase in EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PDGF (48.Habib A.A. Hognason T. Ren J. Stefansson K. Ratan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6885-6891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), perhaps due to the different cell types that were used or because of issues related to assay sensitivity. Nonetheless, the present investigations suggest that the EGF receptor may either be a direct substrate of the PDGF-β receptor in B82L cells or that other signaling molecules, such as Src-related kinases or phosphotyrosine phosphatases such as phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B, may contribute to the PDGF-stimulated increase in EGF receptor phosphotyrosine content.Several models may explain why EGF receptor expression can convert a nonmigratory cell type to a migratory one (whereas the PDGF receptor cannot) as well as why PDGF relies on the EGF receptor to induce cell migration. One feature of the EGF receptor that may be linked to this process is the capacity of the receptor to associate with intracellular actin microfilaments. The EGF receptor co-purifies with F-actin from A431 cells (49.van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. den Hartigh J.C. Romeyn P. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and binds to both G- and F-actin directly in in vitro studies. 3X. Li, G. J. Wiepz, and P. J. Bertics, manuscript in preparation. Moreover, EGF treatment shifts a population of EGF receptors with high affinity for EGF from the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction to the detergent-insoluble actin-containing cytoskeleton fraction (50.Gronowski A.M. Bertics P.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 51.Gronowski A.M. Bertics P.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the EGF receptor contains an actin binding motif (DDVVDADEYLIPQ) at its C-terminal region (52.den Hartigh J.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whereas neither PDGF receptor isoform appears to have such a sequence (53.Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 54.Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Given that cell migration is a process involving dynamic and coordinated actin polymerization and depolymerization, the direct association between F-actin and the EGF receptor may in part account for the dependence of B82L cell migration on the EGF receptor but not the PDGF receptor. Additionally, it has been shown that the EGF receptor can be activated by stimulating the receptors for ECM components, namely the integrins (55.Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Several of the integrin-elicited intracellular signaling events are regulated by the EGF receptor through mechanisms that are dependent on PKC, Src, and PTP1B (56.Miranti C.K. Ohno S. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10571-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 57.Miranti C.K. Klaman L. Neel B. Brugge J.S. FASEB Summer Conference on Protein Kinases and Phosphorylation, July 24–29, 1999. FASEB, Bethesda, MD1999Google Scholar), suggesting a role for the EGF receptor in the modulation of cell motility.Another possibility for the differential capacity of EGF and PDGF receptors to confer cell motility may come from the existence of two similar yet distinct PDGF receptors, i.e. the α and β receptor isoforms. It has been shown that only cells expressing the β receptor, but not the α receptor, are able to migrate chemotactically toward a concentration gradient of PDGF and form circular membrane ruffles, although both receptors are able to induce a loss of stress fibers and appearance of edge ruffles (9.Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 545-550Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29.Mellstrom K. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that the α receptor is capable of mediating chemotaxis as well as the β receptor but that the chemotactic response induced by ligand binding to PDGF-β receptor may be different from that induced by the ligand binding to the α receptor form (8.Hayashi N. Takehara K. Soma Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because PDGF-BB, which binds and activates both the α and β receptor (5.Seifert R.A. Harts C.E. Phillips P.E. Forstrom J.W. Ross R. Murray M.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8771-8778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used in our study, we cannot determine whether both receptor isoforms are expressed in B82L fibroblasts and involved in the signaling events that lead to cell motility. It is possible that a particular isoform of the PDGF receptor may require the EGF receptor whereas the other does not. Lastly, it is conceivable that differences in structure or substrate specificity between the EGF receptor and the PDGF receptor can account for their distinct ability in conferring cell mobility.Our finding that B82L fibroblasts require the expression of an intact EGF receptor to respond to PDGF with respect to fibronectin-induced cell motility is likely to be important in physiological processes such as wound healing (4.Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Upon injury, platelets and subsequently monocytes/lymphocytes are deposited at the site of injury. PDGF secreted by platelets, monocytes/macrophages, and possibly injured endothelial cells, initiate the repair process by stimulating chemotaxis and proliferation of fibroblasts at the fibronectin-fibrin wound interface where granulation tissue forms (4.Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). In addition, the locally increased PDGF may also stimulate the synthesis of a new collagen-containing matrix, and expression of other growth factors such as transforming growth factor-β (4.Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 31.Pierce G.E. Mustoe T.A. Lingelbach K. Masakowski V.R. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Deuel T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The requirement for the presence of the EGF receptor for fibroblast migration in response to PDGF may thus provide an additional control on the mechanisms associated with the wound-healing process by preferentially promoting the attraction of fibroblasts to the sites of injury. In addition to wound healing, interaction between the EGF receptor and the PDGF receptor in the control of cell motility may have a broad impact on other physiological and pathological events, where regulation of cell migration is a key element. Such events may include organ development, tumor metastasis, arteriosclerosis, and inflammatory responses. PDGF1 plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration-associated processes such as wound healing and tumor cell metastasis (2.Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 3.Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4.Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Binding of PDGF induces receptor dimerization and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (2.Wil"
https://openalex.org/W2326831456,"Cooperation of myc and activated ras has been suggested to cause malignant cell transformation but the mechanism is still unknown. Here we isolated a transformed cell line in which activation of c-Myc and Ras are independently controllable, and show that after establishment of the transformed state by c-myc and activated ras, removal of activated Ras initiates apoptosis that is dependent on c-Myc activity. Apoptosis is also initiated by an inhibitor of MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase), a kinase downstream of Ras, and apoptosis is blocked by activated Mek1. These results suggest that one of the conditions required for establishment of the transformed state is a block of apoptosis involving MEK activity. We tested the effect of MEK inhibition on cells transformed by various oncogenes. Suppression of apoptosis by MEK is not critical in general, but in cells transformed by c-myc plus a gene that activates the MAPK cascade it is necessary to avoid cell death. Activated Ras/MEK did not suppress c-myc-dependent apoptosis due to serum-limitation. Overexpression of chicken bcl-xL suppressed apoptosis under serum-limiting conditions, but not apoptosis initiated by Ras/MEK inhibition in cells transformed by myc and activated ras. Altogether, these results suggest the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism for myc-dependent apoptosis in certain transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2332804977,"Defects of the 'Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway' have been shown to play a critical role in the development of virtually all human malignancies assessed. To determine the contribution of G1 phase cell cycle defects to ovarian tumorigenesis, we have examined a panel of normal and tumor ovarian tissues and ovarian cancer cell lines for the expression of Rb, p16 and cyclin D1 proteins. Unlike most types of human cancer whose development involves the loss of either Rb or p16 expression, we observed the coexpression of Rb, p16 and cyclin D1 in 82% of ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the growth and cell cycle distribution profiles of three ovarian cancer cell lines (ES-2, PA-1 and NIH OVCAR-3) that coexpressed Rb and p16, were found to be unaffected by adenoviral-mediated overexpression of functional p16 protein, indicating the existence of a defect(s) downstream from p16 in these cells. By contrast overexpression of ectopic p16 in the one ovarian cancer cell line (SK-OV-3) that expressed Rb but lacked p16 protein, resulted in a G1 growth arrest. These data suggest that defects of the 'Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway', other than the loss of Rb or p16, may play a major role in the development of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1983491625,"In a systematic study to elucidate the involvement of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in alkylating drug resistance of tumor cells, we utilized the A2780(100) line, that was selected by repeated exposure of A2780 cell line (human ovarian carcinoma line) to chlorambucil (CBL). A2780(100) was 5–10-fold more resistant to nitrogen mustards (IC50 of 50–60 μM) and other DNA crosslinking agents, e.g., cisplatin, and also to DNA topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide (ETO) than A2780. CBL (125 μM) induced extensive apoptosis in A2780 associated with mitochondrial damage but not in A2780(100). No significant differences were observed between A2780 and A2780(100) cells in the basal levels, or the enhanced levels in some cases after CBL treatment, of DNA repair proteins involved in repair of alkyl base adducts or in repair of DNA crosslinks or double strand break repair. However, the basal levels of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 were 4–8-fold higher in A2780(100) than in A2780 neither of which expressed Bcl-2. In contrast, the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak were 3–5-fold higher in the CBL-treated A2780 but not in A2780(100). ETO (5 μM) induced apoptosis in A2780 without altering the levels of Bax and Bak in these cells. At the same time, neither overexpression of Bcl-xL in A2780, nor its antisense expression in A2780(100), and nor overexpression of Bax in A2780(100), significantly affected drug sensitivity of either line. Our results suggest that a change in an early step in DNA damage processing which affects intracellular signaling, such as enhanced DNA double-strand break repair, could be the primary cause for development of resistance in A2780(100) cells to drugs which induce DNA crosslinks or double strand-breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2074224195,"Angiogenesis is a highly controlled event which depends on the proper equilibrium of activators and inhibitors present within the microenvironment. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) activates migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and is angiogenic, acting through the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the Met protooncogene. To get insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in HGF-induced angiogenesis, we searched for cDNAs differentially expressed in human endothelial cells exposed to HGF, a potent angiogenic factor. We found that HGF-treated endothelial cells upregulated the expression of Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) beta2. To understand the significance of this finding, we cultured endothelial cells with HGF and TGF beta2 simultaneously. We found that TGF beta2 impairs HGF-dependent proliferative and migratory responses. TGF beta2 did not prevent the tyrosine phosphorylation of Met, but it inhibited some signalling pathways activated by HGF. We show that endothelial proliferation induced by HGF required the activation of the MAPK cascade, while HGF-induced endothelial migration was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src. Indeed, TGF beta2 inhibited HGF effects because it prevented HGF-induced MAP kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Src. We suggest that the induction of TGF beta2 by HGF in endothelial cells may represent a physiologic mechanism to counterbalance HGF angiogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2316563275,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a central role in the cellular defence against agents which cause genetic damage. The induction and activation of p53 upon stress has been shown at post-transcription level by multiple mechanisms, while the regulatory role of p53 gene transcription is still poorly understood. Here we show that the causative mechanisms underlying this activation are attributed in part to the promoter function of p53. In various normal human cells, p53 gene expression is induced transcriptionally by ultraviolet (UV) but not X-ray irradiation. We determined that, by p53 promoter dissection, the 21 bp element (PE21) responsible for this UV activation resides adjacent to, and upstream to the putative NFkappaB binding site. Moreover, the PE21 sequence was found to be a primary determinant for human p53 gene basal expression carrying bi-directional transcriptional initiation activity, which controls the initiation of RNA synthesis about 50 bases downstream, indicating that the sequence plays a critical role in both basal and inducible transcription. Finally, we detected the putative PE21 binding factor(s) in nuclear extracts from non-irradiated and irradiated cells. Since the PE21 sequence does not show any homologies to the conventional TATA or GC box, or to an 'initiatior', all of which determine the initiation site for transcription, the PE21 sequence appears to be a new class in eukaryotic promoter elements. Our results indicate that the mechanism of PE21-directed p53 mRNA transcription has an important role in the cellular stress response as well as tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2327707625,"The c-src and c-yes proto-oncogenes encode 60 000 and 62 000 Dalton non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family, pp60c-src and pp62c-yes, respectively. These kinases are over 80% homologous outside of their unique amino termini, yet several studies suggest that differences exist in the regulation, activation, and function of cSrc and cYes. The determinants of specificity in signaling between these proteins, however, remain unclear. In order to investigate the roles of the Src Homology (SH) 3 and 2 domains in mediating signaling specificity between cSrc and cYes, chimeras were created in which the SH3 and/or SH2 domains of cSrc or the fully activated variant Src527F were replaced by the corresponding domains of cYes. These constructs were used to assess the effects of the Yes SH3 and SH2 domains on the ability of Src to form stable complexes with and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Src SH3 and SH2 domain binding partners in vivo. Both the Yes SH3 and SH2 domains were found to alter the capacity of Src to form stable associations with heterologous proteins. The Yes SH3 domain was unable to affinity absorb the Src SH3/SH2 binding partner AFAP-110 from COS-1 cell lysates, and chimeric constructs of Src527F containing the cYes SH3 domain were unable to efficiently co-immunoprecipitate with AFAP-110 from chicken embryo fibroblasts. Interactions with the Src SH2 domain binding partner pp130cas were unaffected. Additionally, only chimeras containing the cYes SH2 domain were able to co-immunoprecipitate with an unidentified 87 kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. These results indicate that the SH3 and SH2 domains are capable of directing specificity in substrate binding between Src and Yes, suggesting potential mechanisms for generating specificity in signaling between these two highly related non-receptor tyrosine kinases."

Biochemical and genetic analyses have identified integral protein components of the vesicle and the plasma membrane along with additional regulatory factors that are hypothesized to be involved in the exocytotic process (2.Robinson L.J.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The ternary complex, recently crystallized, has a structural arrangement consisting of four entwined coiled-coils (15.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 16.Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J. Biol.

SNAP-25 contributes two coiled-coils to the complex, while syntaxin and VAMP contribute one coiled-coil each. Although otherwise quite stable when packed together as a four-helix bundle, complex integrity is compromised when SNAP-25 is cleaved with either botulinum neurotoxin type A or E prior to complex formation (17.Pellegrini L.L. O'Connor V. Lottspeich F. Betz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18.Washbourne P. Pellizzari R. Baldini G. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such cleavage effectively abolishes neurotransmitter release (13.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and suggests that the integrity of the four helical bundle is essential for exocytosis. We previously identified a novel protein, Hrs-2, that interacts with SNAP-25 (19.Bean A.J. Seifert R Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The interaction of Hrs-2 with SNAP-25 is inhibited by calcium at concentrations (≥100 μm) thought to be essential for neurotransmitter release. Moreover, recombinant Hrs-2 inhibits 3H-labeled norepinephrine release from permeabilized PC12 cells (19.Bean A.J. Seifert R Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, Hrs-2 interacts with a known component of the vesicular trafficking machinery in a calcium-sensitive manner and inhibits calcium-triggered exocytosis, suggesting a role for Hrs-2 in the exocytic machinery. The 7 S complex (SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP) has been argued to constitute the minimal machinery necessary for membrane fusion (20.Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,21.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate complex assembly remain unresolved. Because SNAP-25 is a core constituent of the 7 S complex, we explored the role that Hrs-2 may play in 7 S complex assembly. We identified the sites of interaction between Hrs-2 and SNAP-25 and examined the effects of Hrs-2 on the ability of SNAP-25 to associate with syntaxin or VAMP and the effect of Hrs-2 on 7 S complex assembly. Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were from Promega and Stratagene. Media reagents were from Difco. Materials for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad.

A plasmid encoding an carboxyl-terminal truncation of the rat GST-Hrs-2 fusion protein (amino acids 1–478) was prepared by digesting the full-length clone withNheI and BamHI followed by Klenow treatment (30 °C incubation for 10 min) and religation. Two plasmids encoding short and long carboxyl-terminal truncations of the GST-SNAP-25 fusion protein were prepared. The shorter construct, GST-SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–31) was generated by partial restriction digest of the full-length clone with PstI followed by religation. The longer construct, GST-SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–95), was prepared as described (16.Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J. Biol.

Under these conditions, Hrs-2 is 100% monomeric. 2S. Tsujimoto and A.J. Bean, unpublished observations. Recombinant SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A11, and VAMP were cleaved from the GST moiety using thrombin (7.5 units/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The cleavage reaction was stopped following end-over-end incubation at room temperature for 1 h (syntaxin 1A11), 2 h (VAMP2), or 8 h (SNAP-25) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm). In some cases, solublized proteins were concentrated using Centricon concentrators (Millipore Corp.). All soluble proteins were precleared with glutathione-agarose prior to quantitation and binding. Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of protein bands following SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12–17% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were stained with Ponceau S in order to ensure accuracy of protein loading, blocked in blotto (5% dry milk in PBST), and incubated with primary antibody diluted in blotto.

Following an end-over-end incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, samples were washed three times with 150 μl of binding buffer, solublized in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence.Figure 2Identification of the domain of SNAP-25 necessary for binding to Hrs-2.

Hrs-2 binds to both full-length SNAP-25 and a SNAP-25 truncation mutant that contains the first two coiled-coil regions (lanes 2 and3). Neither GST control beads (lane 1) nor the SNAP-25 truncation mutants containing the first or the third coiled-coil regions (lanes 4 and 5) were able to bind Hrs-2.

VAMP2 was added to the GST-SNAP-25/Hrs-2 reactions in a final concentration of 4 μm, and 2 μmHrs-2 was added to the GST-SNAP-25/syntaxin 1A11 reactions. As a control, a second set of GST-SNAP-25/syntaxin 1A11 reactions to which no Hrs-2 was added was processed simultaneously.

Samples were processed, and immunoblots were visualized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For VAMP binding in the presence of GST-SNAP-25·Hrs-2 (Fig. 5), the pixel values (× 1000) for the six concentrations of Hrs-2 were 0, 1.4, 7.4, 82.9, 108.6, and 102.3. The corresponding pixel values (× 1000) for VAMP were 5.8, 4.9, 5.0, 0.7, 2.0, and 0.9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the effect of Hrs-2 on the efficiency of 7 S complex formation (Fig. 6), GST-syntaxin (1.5 μm, glutathione-agarose-immobilized), SNAP-25 (1.5 μm, soluble), and excess VAMP (5.5 μm, soluble) were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of soluble Hrs-2 (0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 μm). The reactants were mixed together in binding buffer (25-μl final reaction volume), incubated end-over-end at 4 °C for 1.5 h, and then processed for quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis as described above. Initial attempts at forming the 7 S complex on glutathione-immobilized SNAP-25 were unsuccessful; therefore, glutathione-immobilized syntaxin was used in all subsequent reactions requiring 7 S complex formation. Ponceau S stain of the GST-syntaxin (bottom panel) was used to determine accuracy of protein loading. Quantitation of antibody-detected protein binding is reported in optical density units. To determine the domain of Hrs-2 that binds to SNAP-25, we constructed a set of GST fusion proteins containing regions of Hrs-2 predicted to form structural motifs (Fig. 1, top). These truncation mutants were expressed, bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and then examined for interaction with full-length soluble SNAP-25 during an in vitro binding assay. As shown in Fig. 1(bottom), SNAP-25 bound to Hrs-2 truncations that contained the second of two coiled-coil regions and not to GST beads alone or to an Hrs-2 truncation mutant missing the second coiled-coil region. Since SNAP-25 was able to bind to the Hrs-2 truncation containing only the second coiled-coil, we conclude that the second coiled-coil of Hrs-2 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to SNAP-25. In a similar manner, we determined the domain of SNAP-25 that binds to Hrs-2. GST fusion proteins containing coiled-coil regions of SNAP-25 were constructed, expressed, immobilized on glutathione-agarose, and then assayed for interaction with full-length soluble Hrs-2. Both full-length SNAP-25 and an amino-terminal truncation construct containing the first two coiled-coils were able to bind Hrs-2. Neither a construct containing the first nor one containing the third coiled-coil was able to interact with Hrs-2. Thus, we conclude that the SNAP-25 binding domain necessary for interaction with Hrs-2 contains residues 32–95, the region encompassing the second coiled-coil motif. Since SNAP-25 has been previously shown to interact with both syntaxin 1A and VAMP, we examined whether Hrs-2, when in complex with SNAP-25, might affect the ability of SNAP-25 to interact with either syntaxin or VAMP. Hrs-2 did not physically interact with either syntaxin or VAMP (Fig. 3). Therefore, any effect Hrs-2 might have on the ability of SNAP-25 to interact with syntaxin 1A or VAMP would be consequent to the interaction of Hrs-2 with SNAP-25. We first examined the ability of syntaxin 1A to associate with GST-SNAP-25 when Hrs-2 was present. As a control, we examined the association of GST-SNAP-25 with Hrs-2 in the absence of syntaxin 1A. At all concentrations, Hrs-2 did not affect the amount of syntaxin able to bind to SNAP-25 (Fig. 4). However, we observed that the amount of Hrs-2 bound to SNAP-25 in the presence of syntaxin was greater than the amount bound in its absence, suggesting that syntaxin facilitates the binding of Hrs-2 to SNAP-25 (data not shown). To understand whether this facilitation was dependent on syntaxin, a constant concentration of Hrs-2 was incubated with GST-SNAP-25 in the presence of increasing concentrations of syntaxin (Fig. 4). As the concentration of syntaxin was increased, we observed more Hrs-2 binding. These data demonstrate that syntaxin binding to SNAP-25 enhances the ability of Hrs-2 to associate with SNAP-25. The effect of Hrs-2 on VAMP binding to SNAP-25 was examined by incubating increasing concentrations of Hrs-2 in a reaction containing VAMP and GST-SNAP-25 (Fig. 5). As the concentration of Hrs-2 was increased, the ability of VAMP to bind to GST-SNAP-25 was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner. Since Hrs-2 has a lower EC50 for SNAP-25 than VAMP, even in the presence of syntaxin (Table I), these data suggest that Hrs-2 may interfere with VAMP assembly into the 7 S core complex.Table IRelative binding affinities for combinations of Hrs-2, SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMPImmobilized proteinSoluble proteinEC50aThe binding affinities are reported as the 50% effective concentration (EC50), the concentration of protein at which half-maximal binding occurs, instead of K d, since the washing phase of these in vitro binding assays is conducted under nonequilibrium conditions.

Open table in a new tab We next examined the effect of Hrs-2 on 7 S complex assembly (Fig. 6). The trimeric reaction involving Hrs-2, SNAP-25, and VAMP demonstrated that Hrs-2 interferes with the ability of VAMP to bind to SNAP-25. The quaternary reaction involving Hrs-2 and the three 7 S complex binding partners (GST-SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP) reveals that when Hrs-2 is added to the 7 S complex in increasing concentrations, the amount of VAMP incorporated into the 7 S complex decreases. When the concentration of Hrs-2 reaches binding saturation, VAMP incorporation is reduced by 80%. It is possible that the 7 S complex still forms despite the presence of Hrs-2, albeit with greatly reduced efficiency. Alternatively, the 7 S complex may not form at all, and the small amount of VAMP we detect is only associated with syntaxin. Additional studies will be needed to clarify the precise structural impact of Hrs-2 on the 7 S complex. Recent evidence suggests a role for Hrs-2 in the secretory machinery. Hrs-2 physically interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with SNAP-25, a component of a core protein complex thought to be essential for neurotransmitter release. (19.Bean A.J. Seifert R Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Additionally, both Hrs-2 and SNAP-25 are present in nerve terminals as demonstrated by light (24.Tsujimoto S. Pelto-Huikko M. Aitola M. Meister B. Vik-Mo E.O. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Bean A.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3047-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and electron microscopic studies 3S. Davanger and A.J. Bean, unpublished observations. as well as biochemical fractionation studies. 4A. J. Bean, unpublished observations. Moreover, recombinant Hrs-2 inhibits secretion in permeabilized PC-12 cells (19.Bean A.J. Seifert R Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the protein domains mediating the interaction between SNAP-25 and Hrs-2. We show that Hrs-2 and SNAP-25 interact through regions that are predicted to form α-helical coiled-coils on both proteins. We have also examined the effect of Hrs-2 on other SNAP-25-interacting proteins. The interaction of Hrs-2 with SNAP-25 is enhanced in the presence of syntaxin. Furthermore, either Hrs-2 or VAMP may bind to SNAP-25; however, they cannot bind simultaneously. Additionally, increasing amounts of Hrs-2 added to the 7S complex results in a disassociation of VAMP from that complex. These data suggest that Hrs-2 may be involved in regulating the formation of the 7 S protein complex through interactions with SNAP-25. α-Helical coiled-coils are a common structural motif through which protein-protein interactions can occur (26.Kohn W.D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2583-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27.Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Hrs-2 contains two regions predicted to form coiled-coils (19.Bean A.J. Seifert R Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and we show that SNAP-25 binds to the second coiled-coil of Hrs-2 (Fig. 1). SNAP-25 is predicted to form three coiled-coils (10.Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An ordered coiled-coil structure over the first two coiled-coils of SNAP-25 is induced when syntaxin interacts with the amino terminus of SNAP-25 (11.Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12.Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition, the carboxyl-terminal region of SNAP-25 also becomes structured, most likely forming a third coiled-coil (11.Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Like syntaxin, Hrs-2 may also transform the structure of SNAP-25 such that the ability of SNAP-25 to associate with other proteins is altered. Within the context of the 7 S complex, VAMP interacts with the third coiled-coil of SNAP-25. Thus, although VAMP and Hrs-2 are not competing for the same binding site on SNAP-25, the presence of Hrs-2 inhibits VAMP binding. The inhibition of VAMP binding may result from Hrs-2 binding to SNAP-25. The interaction of Hrs-2 with SNAP-25 may fail to promote an ordered structure in the third coiled-coil region of SNAP-25 where VAMP binds (12.Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that steric hindrance due to the binding of Hrs-2 prevents VAMP binding. Our results show that formation of the SNAP-25·syntaxin complex enhances the binding of Hrs-2 to SNAP-25. The binding of Hrs-2 to the syntaxin·SNAP-25 complex may be favored over VAMP binding, since Hrs-2 has a higher binding EC50 for this complex. The presence of Hrs-2 effectively blocks VAMP from interacting with SNAP-25. Moreover, Hrs-2 appears to prevent the formation of the 7 S complex by competing with VAMP for entry into the complex. It is possible that the 7 S complex still forms despite the presence of Hrs-2, albeit with greatly reduced efficiency. Alternatively, under these conditions the 7 S complex may not form at all, although a small amount of VAMP remains able to associate with the syntaxin that is not present in the 7 S complex. Additional studies will be needed to clarify the precise structural impact of Hrs-2 on the 7 S complex. The present data indicate that Hrs-2 has a regulatory role on the exocytic machinery and suggest a heuristic model whereby following an influx of calcium, a conformational change in Hrs-2 may dissociate Hrs-2 from SNAP-25, allowing VAMP to bind and the 7 S complex to assemble. This model predicts that Hrs-2 would inhibit secretion when present prior to formation of the 7 S complex. In permeabilized PC12 cells, Hrs-2 inhibits secretion of 3H-labeled norepinephrine when added during the Mg-ATP-dependent “priming” step (19.Bean A.J. Seifert R Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This step precedes Ca2+-dependent fusion and has been shown to correlate with an ATP-dependent catalysis of the 20 S complex that leaves only the SNAP-25/syntaxin interaction intact (28.Banerjee A. Barry V.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous Hrs-2 at this stage in the assay may compete for VAMP binding and inhibit 3H-labeled norepinephrine release. Thus, Hrs-2 appears to act prior to the “priming” step in the vesicle life cycle, which may correspond to the movement of vesicles from an endocytic/sorting/recycling phase to a releasable state.

We have identified a line of transgenic mice which spontaneously and heritably develop thymomas at a very high penetrance. The available data suggest that thymoma formation in these mice results as a consequence of transgene insertional mutagenesis. Immune histologic analyses indicate that the thymomas are of epithelial cell origin. Survival studies indicate that tumor progression is more aggressive in females as compared to males (73.9 vs 41.7% mortality at 20 weeks of age, respectively). Fluorescent in situ hybridizations have localized the transgene integration site to the F2-G region of mouse chromosome 2. Translocation encompassing the syntenic region in humans has been implicated in lympho-epithelial thymoma. These animals may constitute a useful resource for the identification of gene(s) which participate in thymoma progression, as well as a model system for screening anti-thymoma therapeutic agents."

The ATPase and DNA helicase activities as well as a distinct ssDNA-binding activity localize to the N-terminal two-thirds of the UL9 protein (residues 1–534) (23.Abbotts A.P. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ATP-binding site or the conserved DNA helicase motifs of the UL9 protein abolish origin-dependent replication in a transient system (24.Stow N.D. Hammarsten O. Arbuckle M.I. Elias P. Virology. 1993; 196: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25.Martinez R. Shao L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6735-6746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the UL9 protein is to initiate replication by unwinding the DNA at the origins (26.Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27.Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This function is probably performed in conjunction with the HSV-1 single strand DNA-binding protein (ICP8) which interacts with the C-terminal domain of the UL9 protein (28.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This interaction is important for origin-dependent replication and has been shown to stimulate the DNA helicase activity of the UL9 protein by preventing its dissociation from the DNA substrate (29.Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Presumably, the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of the UL9 protein targets a complex of UL9 protein and ICP8 to the origins to promote efficient DNA unwinding (1.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27.Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The UL9 protein contains a remarkably high content of cysteines (24 out of 851 amino acids) that are randomly distributed throughout the primary sequence (7.McGeoch D.J. Dalrymple M.A. Dolan A. McNab D. Perry L.J. Taylor P. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 444-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these cysteines are arranged into motifs that are involved in metal binding such as zinc fingers or RING fingers. Thus far there have been no reports on the importance of cysteines for the activities of the UL9 protein. In this study, we show that the UL9 protein contains N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive cysteines that overlap with the ssDNA-binding site and are involved in signal transduction between ssDNA-binding and ATP hydrolysis and movement of the UL9 protein along DNA. The inability to identify a specific cysteine that is modified by NEM prompted us to use site-directed mutagenesis to identify the cysteine that is responsible for the inhibitory effect of NEM. Since the ATPase and DNA helicase activities of the UL9 protein reside in the N-terminal domain (23.Abbotts A.P. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the susceptible cysteine(s) must be in this region. Although this part of the UL9 protein contains 17 cysteines, only four of these are perfectly conserved in the origin-binding proteins of at least 10 different herpesviruses. Since amino acids that perform critical tasks are likely to be conserved, these cysteines may be responsible for NEM-induced inactivation of the UL9 protein. One of these cysteines (cysteine 111) is located in the vicinity of the “Walker” type A adenine nucleotide-binding site and DNA helicase motif I (Fig.1) (31.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 32.Hodgman T.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 33.Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and may therefore represent the cysteine responsible for NEM-induced inactivation of the UL9 protein. Our results indicate that cysteine 111 is an essential residue that is involved in coupling ssDNA-binding to ATP hydrolysis, which represents a key step in the mechanism of action of a DNA helicase. ATP (disodium salt), phosphoenolpyruvate (potassium salt), NADH, malachite green, and ammonium molybdate were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN.N-Ethylmaleimide was purchased from Pierce. Its concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 620m−1 cm−1 at 305 nm in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0.N-[ethyl-1,2-3H]maleimide (60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine 111 to alanine was performed with a modification of the QuickChange procedure from Stratagene. The template for the mutagenesis reaction was pSL1180UL9, which contains the 3.4-kilobase pairNdeI–SspI UL9-encoding fragment from pET-3a/OBP (10.Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inserted into the NdeI and StuI sites of pSL1180 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mutagenesis reaction contained 25 ng of pSL1180UL9, 0.5 μm (molecules) mutagenic primers PB-83 (5′-CGTCGTCTCCGCTCGTCGGAGT) and PB-84 (5′-ACTCCGACGAGCGGAGACGACG), 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2.5 units ofPfuTurbo DNA polymerase. Following denaturation of the template at 95 °C for 4 min, the primers were extended for 16 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 5 min). After an additional 10 min at 72 °C, the reaction mixture was treated with 10 units of DpnI for 105 min to digest the parental DNA. The digested DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli JM109 cells. Progeny plasmids were screened for the presence of the mutation by DNA sequencing. Progeny plasmid with the desired mutation was designated pSL1180UL9C111A. S. frugiperda Sf9 and Sf21 cells were maintained at 27 °C in Sf900 II-serum free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) expressing theUL9C111A gene was generated using the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system from Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, pSL1180UL9C111A was digested with NotI and XbaI. The 3.4-kilobase pair UL9C111A-encoding fragment was inserted into theNotI and XbaI sites of pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate pFastBacUL9C111A. pFastBacUL9C111A was transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and colonies harboring recombinant bacmids were selected. Purified bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, the cell culture media containing recombinant A. californica NPV were collected. Following a round of amplification, recombinantA. californica NPV isolates were used to screen for expression of UL9C111A protein in Sf9 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10. A clone of A. californica NPV that expressed high levels of UL9C111A protein was selected for further studies. Bovine serum albumin (DNase-free) andPfuTurbo DNA polymerase were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Stratagene, respectively. The Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I and T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Promega, respectively. Rabbit muscle l-lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, as solutions in 50% glycerol, were obtained from Sigma. UL9C111A protein was purified from Sf21 cells infected with A. californica NPV recombinant for the UL9C111Agene. One liter of Sf21 cells at 2 × 106cells/ml in Sf900 II serum-free medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum was infected at a m.o.i. of 5. Sixty hours postinfection, the cells were harvested. UL9C111A protein was purified from nuclear extracts essentially as described for UL9 protein (28.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. UL9C111A protein, eluting from heparin agarose at ∼650 mm NaCl, was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of 10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 0.1m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) prior to chromatography on hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite chromatography was performed as described for UL9 protein (28.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except that the gradient was from 10 to 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. UL9C111A protein, eluting at ∼100 mm sodium phosphate, was subsequently purified on a 1-ml Resource S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described for UL9 protein on a MonoS HR 5/5 column (28.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except that DTT was omitted from the buffer. The peak of UL9C111A protein, containing nearly homogenous (>95% pure) protein, eluted at the same position as UL9 protein, corresponding to ∼370 mm NaCl. Fig.2 A shows the elution of UL9C111A protein from the Resource S column. The yield of purified UL9C111A protein was ∼0.2 mg. UL9 protein was purified from Sf21 cells infected with A. californicaNPV recombinant for the UL9 gene as described for UL9C111A protein above. Protein concentrations, expressed in mol of monomeric protein, were determined using extinction coefficients of 89,220 and 89,100 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for UL9 and UL9C111A proteins, respectively. M13 mp18 virion DNA was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. The 22-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide PB-9 and (dT)60were as described (20.Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The DNA helicase substrate was constructed by annealing 5′-32P-labeled PB-9 to M13 mp18 ssDNA (20.Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its concentration was based on the specific radioactivity of the 5′-32P-labeled PB-9. The DNA substrate for the origin-binding assay was a 176-base pair EcoRI fragment that contains a copy of wild-type HSV-1 oriS and was 3′-32P-labeled with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. TheoriS-containing plasmid pGEM822 was constructed by inserting the 822-base pair BamHI oriS fragment from pOS-822 (34.Wong S.W. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pGEMEX (Promega). Unless otherwise stated, UL9 or UL9C111A proteins (8–23 pmol) were modified with the indicated concentrations of NEM in 20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, for 10 min at room temperature. In reactions containing ssDNA, UL9 protein was preincubated with 16 μm(nucleotide) (dT)60 for 5 min on ice prior to modification with NEM. The reactions were quenched by the addition of DTT to 5 mm followed by 5 min at room temperature. Similar reactions lacking UL9 protein were performed in parallel to neutralize the NEM. The activities of UL9 protein were examined with neutralized NEM to control for any inhibitory impurities in the preparation of NEM. NEM modification had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the UL9 protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). To determine the stoichiometry of NEM modification, 1 nmol of UL9 protein was incubated with 1 mm N-[ethyl-1,2-3H]maleimide (74.2 mCi/mmol) in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 0.1m NaCl for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of DTT to 10 mm followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature. NEM-modified UL9 protein was dialyzed three times against 2 liters of 0.1 m(NH4)HCO3. The stoichiometry of NEM modification was calculated based on the specific radioactivity of NEM and the radioactivity associated with the UL9 protein following dialysis. ATP hydrolysis was measured with two different assays. The effect of DTT on the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL9 protein was measured in reactions (25 μl) containing increasing concentrations of DTT (0–10 mm) and 20 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.3, 50 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 μm (nucleotide) (dT)60, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of 100 nm UL9 protein. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 750 μl of acidic ammonium molybdate solution containing malachite green to measure the formation of inorganic phosphate (35.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). After 5 min of color development at room temperature, the absorbance at 650 nm was determined. Rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined using an enzyme-linked assay as described (30.Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2676-2683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, reactions were performed at 37 °C and contained 20 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.3, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 200 μm NADH, 1.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 40 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase, 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 μm (nucleotide) (dT)60, 100 nm UL9 or UL9C111A proteins, and DTT as indicated. Rates of ATP hydrolysis were calculated by converting the absorbance change at 340 nm to mol of ATP hydrolyzed using an extinction coefficient of 6,220 m−1cm−1 for NADH at 340 nm. Kinetic constants were determined using the nonlinear regression Michaelis-Menten kinetics curve-fitting program of Leatherbarrow (36.Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter. Biosoft, Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). DNA helicase assays were performed as described (20.Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, reactions were performed at 37 °C and contained 25 mm EPPS-NaOH, pH 8.3, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 nm (molecules) M13:PB-9 DNA, and 150 nm UL9 or UL9C111A proteins. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.3 volumes of 90 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis through nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide-TBE gels. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman) and DNA unwinding was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The ssDNA-binding activity of the UL9 protein was measured by a gel mobility shift assay essentially as described (23.Abbotts A.P. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Five picomoles of UL9 protein, UL9 protein with neutralized NEM, or NEM-modified UL9 protein were incubated with 60 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled PB-9 DNA in 21 μl containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT for 10 min on ice. The reactions were mixed with 4 μl of 80% glycerol containing 0.25% bromphenol blue and resolved by electrophoresis through nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide-TBE gels at 100 V and 4 °C. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman), and the fraction of bound DNA was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Origin binding activity was measured by nitrocellulose filter binding essentially as described (8.Elias P. O'Donnell M.E. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6322-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). UL9 and UL9C111A proteins were incubated with 15 fmol of32P-labeled oriS DNA in 25 μl containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 5 min at room temperature followed by 10 min on ice. The reactions were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol and immediately filtered through 0.45-μm Millipore type HA filters that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. Filtration was complete within 10 s. The filters were dried and counted in 4 ml of ScintiSafe 30% liquid scintillant (Fisher). The results were corrected for background binding observed in the absence of origin-binding protein and quantitated based on the specific radioactivity of the32P-labeled oriS DNA. oriS-dependent DNA replication in Sf9 cells was determined essentially as described (5.Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29.Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3 × 105 Sf9 cells were seeded in 24-well Linbro plates (2 cm2) and transfected with 150 ng of pGEM822 using a Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated protocol. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and either mock-infected or infected with recombinant A. californica NPV that encoded the HSV-1 UL5 (37.Dodson M.S. Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Lehman I.R. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or UL9C111A gene at a m.o.i. of 5. Sixty-five hours postinfection, the cells were harvested, and total cellular DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue kit from Qiagen. 4.5 μg of DNA was digested with 7.5 units ofHindIII for 16 h to linearize pGEM822. Half of the sample was further digested with 7.5 units of DpnI for 16 h to digest unreplicated DNA. The DNA samples were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose-TAE gels followed by transfer of the DNA to a Trans-blot 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). pGEM822 DNA was detected by Southern blot hybridization using random-primed (Life Technologies, Inc.) 32P-labeled pGEM822 as a probe. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. DTT stimulated the DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of UL9 protein up to a maximum of 5- and 2-fold, respectively (TableI). Incubation of UL9 protein with 1 mm NEM rapidly (within 30 s) inactivated its DNA helicase activity (Fig. 3). Similarly, NEM inactivated the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of UL9 protein but had no significant effect on its DNA-independent ATPase, ssDNA-binding, and origin binding activities (Table I). Inactivation of the DNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities required excess concentrations of NEM (IC50 ∼ 200 μm NEM) (data not shown). Incubation of UL9 protein with ssDNA ((dT)60) fully protected its DNA-dependent ATPase activity from NEM inactivation (Fig.4). In addition, both ATP (5 mm) and duplex DNA (15 μm nucleotide) also provided partial protection from NEM inactivation (data not shown). Using N-[ethyl-1,2-3H]maleimide, the stoichiometry of modification was determined as 14:1 NEM:UL9 protein, indicating that the majority (14 out of 24) of cysteines in the UL9 protein are susceptible to modification by NEM. In the presence of (dT)60, this ratio was decreased to 2:1 NEM:UL9 protein, indicating that the majority (12 out of 14) of the NEM-susceptible cysteines are protected by ssDNA.Table IEffects of dithiothreitol and N-ethylmaleimide on the UL9 proteinEffectActivityEffect of dithiothreitol DNA helicaseaDNA helicase activity was determined after 15 min at 37 °C and is expressed as percentage of DNA unwound.Without DTT6.9With 1 mm DTT28.4With 15 mm DTT35.5 DNA-dependent ATPasebActivity is expressed in absorbance units at 650 nm.Without DTT0.0265With 1 mm DTT0.038With 10 mm DTT0.05Effect of N-ethylmaleimide DNA-dependent ATPasecActivity is expressed as pmol of ATP hydrolyzed s−1.Without NEM1.68With neutralized NEM2.11With NEM0.15 DNA-independent ATPasecActivity is expressed as pmol of ATP hydrolyzed s−1.Without NEM0.21 ± 0.07With neutralized NEM0.24 ± 0.03With NEM0.14 ± 0.04 ssDNA-bindingdActivity is expressed as fmol of DNA bound.Without NEM32.2With neutralized NEM35.5With NEM23.3 Origin-bindingeActivity is expressed as fmol of DNA bound at 200 nm UL9 protein.Without NEM3.56With neutralized NEM3.31With NEM3.17Reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effects of NEM were determined after modification with 1 mm NEM.a DNA helicase activity was determined after 15 min at 37 °C and is expressed as percentage of DNA unwound.b Activity is expressed in absorbance units at 650 nm.c Activity is expressed as pmol of ATP hydrolyzed s−1.d Activity is expressed as fmol of DNA bound.e Activity is expressed as fmol of DNA bound at 200 nm UL9 protein.

A UL9 protein variant, designated UL9C111A protein, in which cysteine 111 is substituted with alanine, was expressed and purified to near homogeneity fromA. californica NPV-infected Sf21 cells. The purity of the final protein preparation, eluting from a Resource S column, is shown in Fig. 2 A. The identity of purified UL9C111A protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-UL9 protein rabbit serum (Fig. 2 B). The rate of ATP hydrolysis by UL9C111A protein was compared with that of UL9 protein both in the absence and presence of a ssDNA cofactor, (dT)60. Fig.5 A shows that the rate of DNA-independent ATP hydrolysis by UL9C111A protein did not significantly differ from that of UL9 protein. In contrast, UL9C111A protein exhibited <50% of the rate of DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis observed with UL9 protein (Fig. 5 B). The rate of DNA unwinding exhibited by UL9C111A protein was also reduced to ∼50% of that of UL9 protein (Fig.6 A). Likewise, the sp"
