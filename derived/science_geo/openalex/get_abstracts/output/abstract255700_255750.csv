https://openalex.org/W1992865536,"A recently published theory has suggested that a cloak of invisibility is in principle possible, at least over a narrow frequency band. We describe here the first practical realization of such a cloak; in our demonstration, a copper cylinder was “hidden” inside a cloak constructed according to the previous theoretical prescription. The cloak was constructed with the use of artificially structured metamaterials, designed for operation over a band of microwave frequencies. The cloak decreased scattering from the hidden object while at the same time reducing its shadow, so that the cloak and object combined began to resemble empty space."
https://openalex.org/W2018427433,"PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Since the mitochondrial electron transport chain is the main producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most cells, we examined the effect of PGC-1alpha on the metabolism of ROS. PGC-1alpha is coinduced with several key ROS-detoxifying enzymes upon treatment of cells with an oxidative stressor; studies with RNAi or null cells indicate that PGC-1alpha is required for the induction of many ROS-detoxifying enzymes, including GPx1 and SOD2. PGC-1alpha null mice are much more sensitive to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP and kainic acid, oxidative stressors affecting the substantia nigra and hippocampus, respectively. Increasing PGC-1alpha levels dramatically protects neural cells in culture from oxidative-stressor-mediated death. These studies reveal that PGC-1alpha is a broad and powerful regulator of ROS metabolism, providing a potential target for the therapeutic manipulation of these important endogenous toxins."

https://openalex.org/W1991801420,"We generated single-cycle isolated attosecond pulses around ∼36 electron volts using phase-stabilized 5-femtosecond driving pulses with a modulated polarization state. Using a complete temporal characterization technique, we demonstrated the compression of the generated pulses for as low as 130 attoseconds, corresponding to less than 1.2 optical cycles. Numerical simulations of the generation process show that the carrier-envelope phase of the attosecond pulses is stable. The availability of single-cycle isolated attosecond pulses opens the way to a new regime in ultrafast physics, in which the strong-field electron dynamics in atoms and molecules is driven by the electric field of the attosecond pulses rather than by their intensity profile."
https://openalex.org/W2160429819,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in individuals aged older than 50 years, is classified as either wet (neovascular) or dry (nonneovascular). Inherited variation in the complement factor H gene is a major risk factor for drusen in dry AMD. Here we report that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of HTRA1 , a serine protease gene on chromosome 10q26, is a major genetic risk factor for wet AMD. A whole-genome association mapping strategy was applied to a Chinese population, yielding a P value of &lt;10 –11 . Individuals with the risk-associated genotype were estimated to have a likelihood of developing wet AMD 10 times that of individuals with the wild-type genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2106901733,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world and has a strong genetic predisposition. A locus at human chromosome 10q26 affects the risk of AMD, but the precise gene(s) have not been identified. We genotyped 581 AMD cases and 309 normal controls in a Caucasian cohort in Utah. We demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs11200638, in the promoter region of HTRA1 is the most likely causal variant for AMD at 10q26 and is estimated to confer a population attributable risk of 49.3%. The HTRA1 gene encodes a secreted serine protease. Preliminary analysis of lymphocytes and retinal pigment epithelium from four AMD patients revealed that the risk allele was associated with elevated expression levels of HTRA1 mRNA and protein. We also found that drusen in the eyes of AMD patients were strongly immunolabeled with HTRA1 antibody. Together, these findings support a key role for HTRA1 in AMD susceptibility and identify a potential new pathway for AMD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970111367,"The tumor suppressor programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) inhibits the translation initiation factor eIF4A, an RNA helicase that catalyzes the unwinding of secondary structure at the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly phosphorylated on Ser 67 by the protein kinase S6K1 and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase SCF βTRCP . Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4 mutant that is unable to bind βTRCP inhibited translation of an mRNA with a structured 5′UTR, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression. We propose that regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to mitogens allows efficient protein synthesis and consequently cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2126064727,"Mud volcanism is an important natural source of the greenhouse gas methane to the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Recent investigations show that the number of active submarine mud volcanoes might be much higher than anticipated (for example, see refs 3-5), and that gas emitted from deep-sea seeps might reach the upper mixed ocean. Unfortunately, global methane emission from active submarine mud volcanoes cannot be quantified because their number and gas release are unknown. It is also unclear how efficiently methane-oxidizing microorganisms remove methane. Here we investigate the methane-emitting Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV, Barents Sea, 72 degrees N, 14 degrees 44' E; 1,250 m water depth) to provide quantitative estimates of the in situ composition, distribution and activity of methanotrophs in relation to gas emission. The HMMV hosts three key communities: aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Methylococcales), anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) thriving below siboglinid tubeworms, and a previously undescribed clade of archaea (ANME-3) associated with bacterial mats. We found that the upward flow of sulphate- and oxygen-free mud volcano fluids restricts the availability of these electron acceptors for methane oxidation, and hence the habitat range of methanotrophs. This mechanism limits the capacity of the microbial methane filter at active marine mud volcanoes to <40% of the total flux."
https://openalex.org/W2078577861,"The auditory inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapse operates with an exceptional temporal precision and maintains a high level of neurotransmitter release. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IHC synaptic exocytosis are largely unknown. We studied otoferlin, a predicted C2-domain transmembrane protein, which is defective in a recessive form of human deafness. We show that otoferlin expression in the hair cells correlates with afferent synaptogenesis and find that otoferlin localizes to ribbon-associated synaptic vesicles. Otoferlin binds Ca2+ and displays Ca2+-dependent interactions with the SNARE proteins syntaxin1 and SNAP25. Otoferlin deficient mice (Otof−/−) are profoundly deaf. Exocytosis in Otof−/− IHCs is almost completely abolished, despite normal ribbon synapse morphogenesis and Ca2+ current. Thus, otoferlin is essential for a late step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and may act as the major Ca2+ sensor triggering membrane fusion at the IHC ribbon synapse."

https://openalex.org/W1969051840,"Prolyl hydroxylation is a critical posttranslational modification that affects structure, function, and turnover of target proteins. Prolyl 3-hydroxylation occurs at only one position in the triple-helical domain of fibrillar collagen chains, and its biological significance is unknown. CRTAP shares homology with a family of putative prolyl 3-hydroxylases (P3Hs), but it does not contain their common dioxygenase domain. Loss of Crtap in mice causes an osteochondrodysplasia characterized by severe osteoporosis and decreased osteoid production. CRTAP can form a complex with P3H1 and cyclophilin B (CYPB), and Crtap-/- bone and cartilage collagens show decreased prolyl 3-hydroxylation. Moreover, mutant collagen shows evidence of overmodification, and collagen fibrils in mutant skin have increased diameter consistent with altered fibrillogenesis. In humans, CRTAP mutations are associated with the clinical spectrum of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, including the type II and VII forms. Hence, dysregulation of prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a mechanism for connective tissue disease."
https://openalex.org/W2040799793,"A magnetic resonance approach is presented that enables high-sensitivity, high-contrast molecular imaging by exploiting xenon biosensors. These sensors link xenon atoms to specific biomolecular targets, coupling the high sensitivity of hyperpolarized nuclei with the specificity of biochemical interactions. We demonstrated spatial resolution of a specific target protein in vitro at micromolar concentration, with a readout scheme that reduces the required acquisition time by >3300-fold relative to direct detection. This technique uses the signal of free hyperpolarized xenon to dramatically amplify the sensor signal via chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). Because it is approximately 10,000 times more sensitive than previous CEST methods and other molecular magnetic resonance imaging techniques, it marks a critical step toward the application of xenon biosensors as selective contrast agents in biomedical applications."

Here we describe the effects of nucleotides on the structure of full-length HtpG, the Escherichia coli hsp90 ortholog. By electron microscopy, the nucleotide-free, AMPPNP bound, and ADP bound states of HtpG adopt completely distinct conformations. Structural characterization of nucleotide-free and ADP bound HtpG was extended to higher resolution by X-ray crystallography. In the absence of nucleotide, HtpG exhibits an “open” conformation in which the three domains of each monomer present hydrophobic elements into the large cleft formed by the dimer. By contrast, ADP binding drives dramatic conformational changes that allow these hydrophobic elements to converge and shield each other from solvent, suggesting a mechanism by which nucleotides could control client protein binding and release.

By contrast, ADP binding drives dramatic conformational changes that allow these hydrophobic elements to converge and shield each other from solvent, suggesting a mechanism by which nucleotides could control client protein binding and release. Several families of heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that assist protein folding in vivo. These enzymes bind to exposed hydrophobic surfaces of their client proteins, thereby preventing nonspecific intermolecular interactions that could lead to aggregation. Subsequent ATP-mediated dissociation provides client proteins the opportunity to proceed down their folding pathways (Young et al., 2004Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Pathways of chaperone-mediated protein folding in the cytosol.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Different heat shock proteins are required at different stages of folding. Members of the 70 kilodalton (hsp70) and the 60 kilodalton (GroEL) families facilitate the early stages of polypeptide folding, binding linear chains (Zhu et al., 1996Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F.

In contrast, members of the ubiquitous and abundant 90 kilodalton heat-shock protein (hsp90) family appear to associate with client proteins at their latest stages of folding (Freeman and Yamamoto, 2002Freeman B.C.

In mammalian cells, hsp90 forms complexes with the quiescent forms of a wide array of cellular signaling proteins and chaperones the conformational changes essential for their signaling-dependent activities, including ligand binding and association with partner proteins. Hence, hsp90 plays a unique role in cellular physiology by preferentially stabilizing near-native state structures and aiding the dynamic assembly and disassembly of signaling complexes. Since many hsp90 client proteins play critical roles in cellular proliferation and survival, pharmacologic suppression of hsp90 activity, and hence the many hsp90-dependent signaling pathways, blocks growth of cancerous cells (Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. HSP90 and the chaperoning of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). As a consequence, hsp90 inhibitors such as certain analogs of geldanamycin are currently in clinical trials for treatment of numerous malignancies (Chiosis et al., 2003Chiosis G. Lucas B. Huezo H.

Structure/function studies of hsp70 and GroEL have established a common mechanistic theme in which ATP binding and hydrolysis trigger conformational changes that alter the hydrophobicity of domains used to engage client proteins (Feltham and Gierasch, 2000Feltham J.L.

Further, structures of inhibitor complexes of the yeast and human hsp90 NTDs have indicated that these compounds block ATPase activity, and hence hsp90 function, at least in part by occupying the nucleotide binding site contained within the NTD and preventing ATP access (Dymock et al., 2005Dymock B.W.

Finally, a recent structure of a full-length yeast hsp90, hsc82, bound to AMPPNP and the cochaperone p23 (Ali et al., 2006Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Crystal structure of an Hsp90-nucleotide-p23/Sba1 closed chaperone complex.Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) confirms that ATP hydrolysis requires NTD dimerization and the presence of an NTD/MD composite active site. However, a unified, structurally validated mechanism linking hsp90 ATPase activity and client protein binding is lacking. To address this issue, we have examined the impact of nucleotide binding on HtpG via electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. In electron micrographs, HtpG adopts three different conformational states in the absence of nucleotide and when bound to AMPPNP and ADP. The size and shape of AMPPNP bound HtpG is consistent with the structure of the AMPPNP bound yeast hsc82:p23 complex (Ali et al., 2006Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Crystal structure of an Hsp90-nucleotide-p23/Sba1 closed chaperone complex.Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), indicating a conserved structural role for ATP binding. To further characterize the remaining two states, for which there is no high-resolution structural information, we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of intact HtpG with and without ADP. Our refinement and interpretation of these medium resolution structures (∼3.5–3.6 Å) has been enabled by our new high-resolution structure determinations of the NTD (1.65 Å) and the MD (1.90 Å) and our previously reported CTD structure (Harris et al., 2004Harris S.F. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. The crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal dimerization domain of htpG, the Escherichia coli Hsp90, reveals a potential substrate binding site.Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1087-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In agreement with the data from electron microscopy, the HtpG dimer in the absence of nucleotide adopts an “open” conformation in which the positioning of the two monomers creates a large central cleft lined by hydrophobic elements from each of the three domains. In contrast, ADP binding stabilizes a radically different domain organization within each monomer that leads to a narrowing of the cleft. The effect of these motions on the dimer, coupled with modeling, suggests a mechanism by which ADP binding could bring together and bury the hydrophobic regions exposed in the apo state, leading to client protein release. These concepts lead us to propose a structurally based model for the hsp90 chemomechanical cycle. Given the high degree of sequence and structural conservation among family members, these mechanisms should apply to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hsp90s. The general picture that has emerged from structural studies of the hsp60 and hsp70 molecular chaperones as well as other GHKL family members (a superfamily composed of gyrase, hsp90, histidine kinases, and MutL; Dutta and Inouye, 2000Dutta R. Inouye M. GHKL, an emergent ATPase/kinase superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) is that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis drives an interconversion between two stable conformational states. Previously, low-angle rotary-shadowing electron microscopy (EM) has provided evidence for ATP-dependent conformational changes in human hsp90 (Maruya et al., 1999Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. Monomer arrangement in HSP90 dimer as determined by decoration with N and C-terminal region specific antibodies.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, we have used negative-stain EM combined with single-particle class averaging to examine nucleotide-dependent conformational states in HtpG. Class averaging allows the identification and averaging of two-dimensional projection images from large numbers of individual particles, resulting in a much more reliable view of molecular shape. From fields of single particles (Figure S1) HtpG clearly assumes at least three distinct states. Representative single particle images and class averages reveal that in the absence of nucleotide HtpG predominantly adopts an open “V” shape (Figure 1a). From the particle images, it is readily apparent that the opening angle is quite variable, indicating that the apo conformation is flexible. By contrast, AMPPNP and ADP binding stabilize two very different and far more discrete states. AMPPNP bound HtpG forms a closed, elongated shape. Using reference-free class averaging and projection matching methods, AMPPNP bound HtpG is similar in both size and detailed shape to the yeast hsc82:p23:AMPPNP crystal structure (Ali et al., 2006Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Crystal structure of an Hsp90-nucleotide-p23/Sba1 closed chaperone complex.Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) (Figure 1b). HtpG apparently does not require cochaperone binding to stabilize this conformation. Unexpectedly, in the presence of ADP, HtpG adopts a significantly more compact, globular conformation (Figure 1c). This novel conformation is suggestive of a third unanticipated state in the hsp90 nucleotide-dependent chaperone cycle. To extend the EM analysis, the structure of full-length unliganded HtpG was solved at 3.5 Å resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement phasing techniques. Model building (current R/Rfree = 32.9%/37.0%, Tables S1 and S2) was greatly facilitated by heavy atom sequence markers (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and the high-resolution structures of the individual domains (Table S1, Figures S2 and S3; Harris et al., 2004Harris S.F. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. The crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal dimerization domain of htpG, the Escherichia coli Hsp90, reveals a potential substrate binding site.Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1087-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consistent with solution studies, intact HtpG forms a dimer in the crystal. Viewed from one angle, this dimer resembles a twisted, two-bladed propeller ∼70 Å tall and ∼150 Å wide (Figure 2). The overall shape and dimensions are consistent with those derived from our HtpG electron micrographs and those of human hsp90 (Maruya et al., 1999Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. Monomer arrangement in HSP90 dimer as determined by decoration with N and C-terminal region specific antibodies.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like other members of the hsp90 family, each HtpG monomer can be divided into three domains, the NTD (residues 1–227), MD (residues 233–489), and CTD (residues 501–624). The NTD is composed of an eight-stranded β sheet (strands S2–S9) flanked by eight α helices (H1–H8) (Figure 3A). The MD forms an elongated structure comprised of three subdomains, two αβα sandwiches (residues 233–366; S10–S13 and H9–H11 and residues 401–489; S14–S15 and H15–H19) connected via a small domain consisting of a spiral of three helices (residues 367–400; H12–H14) (Figure S3). The CTD possesses a unique mixed αβ fold (S16–S18 and H20–H24). As suggested by a previously described low-resolution electron-density map (Harris et al., 2004Harris S.F. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. The crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal dimerization domain of htpG, the Escherichia coli Hsp90, reveals a potential substrate binding site.Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1087-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), one NTD is located at the outer tip of each blade, and the MDs form the bulk of the body of the blades.

The buried surface area in the full-length dimer 1280 Å2 is larger than that of the isolated CTD dimer (930 Å2), primarily due to interactions between H16 from the third subdomain of the MD with H24 of the CTD from the partner monomer.Figure 3Four Different Conformational States of the NTD; Key Elements Are Strand S1 and Helix H1 (Red) and the Lid (Helices H4 and H5) (Blue)Show full caption(A) Ribbon diagram of the NTD in the apo full-length dimer.

The lid has folded over the nucleotide, while the amino terminus of the protein (S1) is extended to interact with the partner monomer for a strap that stabilizes NTD-NTD dimerization. Overall, the structures of the three domains in the context of the intact protein are highly similar to those determined in isolation (1.50, 0.73, and 0.83 Å rmsd for the NTD, MD, and CTD respectively; Table S1, Figures 3B and S3, and Harris et al., 2004Harris S.F. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A.

Only two regions of the protein exhibit significant differences, one in the vicinity of helices H1, H3, H4 in the NTD and H21 in the CTD. The deviations in the NTD are related to nucleotide binding and will be discussed in the subsequent section. H21 (H2 of the isolated domain) is an exposed amphipathic helix that is ordered in the isolated CTD dimer but disordered in the full-length structure. However, because unambiguous electron density is present for the residues (541–543 and 565–566) that connect H21 to the second and third strands of the CTD β sheet, the positioning of H21 can be predicted; the linking regions are arranged such that H21 from each monomer would clearly project into the a large cleft formed by the dimer (Figure 2). Because of the positioning of its exposed hydrophobic face, H21 has been proposed to be a potential client protein binding site (Harris et al., 2004Harris S.F. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. The crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal dimerization domain of htpG, the Escherichia coli Hsp90, reveals a potential substrate binding site.Structure (Camb). 2004; 12: 1087-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Another region, centered on a surface loop (residues 281–296) in the MD, has been previously ascribed a similar function. Large, hydrophobic residues important for v-src maturation are on or near the equivalent loop (residues 324–340) in hsp82 (Meyer et al., 2003Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Structural and functional analysis of the middle segment of hsp90: implications for ATP hydrolysis and client protein and cochaperone interactions.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This loop in HtpG (referred to as the src loop) exhibits poor sequence conservation but has a similar pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. Despite its exposed nature, the structure of this loop is surprisingly invariant across all MD structures (Figure S3), suggesting it may serve a common role in client protein interaction. Consistent with this idea, the src loop, like H21, extends into the dimeric cleft (Figure 2) HtpG, like other hsp90s, exhibits significant structural flexibility in the absence of nucleotides (Figure 1). In Grp94, the hsp90 endoplasmic reticulum paralog, and hsp82, a long, repetitive, charged sequence once thought to loosely tether the NTD and MD is actually located within the turn sequence of a β hairpin that completes the central NTD β sheet. Consistent with the NTD/MD HtpG fragment structure, our full-length HtpG structure shows a very similar feature, two β strands (S8 and S9) stabilized by a type I′ turn (Figure 2). As a consequence, the true NTD/MD interdomain linker is only seven residues in length (residues 227–233). This observation, combined with the fact that the NTD/MD interface buries a significant amount of surface area (1060 Å2), suggests that these domains are not free to move independently. By contrast, the features of the MD/CTD boundary are strongly suggestive of a dynamic relationship. These two domains are linked by a long, highly mobile tether (residues 490–500, with residues 492–499 being disordered; Figure 2). In addition, the interface between these domains is quite small (320 Å2) and resembles a ball-and-socket joint (Figure 2). Thus, we believe that the structural flexibility of the apo-state observed by EM (Figures 1a and S1a) is largely due to rigid body motions between the NTD/MD segment and the CTD. This plasticity may be important for the accommodation of structurally diverse client proteins. Structures of the isolated eukaryotic hsp90 NTDs reveal that the domain contains a conserved structural element, known as the “active site lid,” composed of two helices and the intervening loop that is located immediately adjacent to the ATP binding site (Jez et al., 2003Jez J.M.

Interestingly, this potentially functionally important region of htpG (residues 100–126) shares little sequence homology beyond a well-conserved IGQFGVG motif (htpG residues 120–126) to the eukaryotic hsp90s. However, these residues do form a lid-like element in the structure of the HtpG Mg2+ADP NTD complex (1.65 Å; R factor = 16.3%; free R factor = 19.8%; Table S1). As in the yeast and human hsp90 NTDs, the lid is positioned proximal to the ADP binding site with the two lid helices lying in a plane parallel to that of the NTD β sheet (Figure 3B). However, due to its dissimilar sequence, the HtpG lid helices are longer and shifted relative to their eukaryotic counterparts.

https://openalex.org/W2053684471,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a Zn2+-metalloprotease, is involved in the clearance of insulin and amyloid-beta (refs 1-3). Loss-of-function mutations of IDE in rodents cause glucose intolerance and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta, whereas enhanced IDE activity effectively reduces brain amyloid-beta (refs 4-7). Here we report structures of human IDE in complex with four substrates (insulin B chain, amyloid-beta peptide (1-40), amylin and glucagon). The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of IDE (IDE-N and IDE-C, respectively) form an enclosed cage just large enough to encapsulate insulin. Extensive contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C keep the degradation chamber of IDE inaccessible to substrates. Repositioning of the IDE domains enables substrate access to the catalytic cavity. IDE uses size and charge distribution of the substrate-binding cavity selectively to entrap structurally diverse polypeptides. The enclosed substrate undergoes conformational changes to form beta-sheets with two discrete regions of IDE for its degradation. Consistent with this model, mutations disrupting the contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C increase IDE catalytic activity 40-fold. The molecular basis for substrate recognition and allosteric regulation of IDE could aid in designing IDE-based therapies to control cerebral amyloid-beta and blood sugar concentrations."

Dentin is an anisotropic composite possessing superior mechanical properties that is assembled by cell-mediated processes.

Deciphering the biological basis of biomineralization using tooth as a paradigm might unveil the mechanisms by which protein assemblies can determine the biomineral structure in vertebrates. In this study, we discuss the hierarchical assembly of hydroxyapatite at the nanoscale level by demonstrating the formation of de novo amorphous calcium phosphate as an intermediate phase in the presence of an organic matrix, namely type I collagen and DMP1. Subsequently the precipitates transformed into crystalline HAP structures with outstanding mechanical properties. We investigated the process of HAP nucleation using both recombinant and native DMP1 in the presence and absence of type I collagen, native and recombinant C-terminal DMP1 with and without type I collagen, and recombinant N-terminal DMP1 with and without type I collagen. We compared our in vitro data with the HAP crystal growth pattern in a rat incisor model. Published reports demonstrate the use of two different crystal growth techniques, namely solution and gel techniques, for in vitro nucleation assays (20Jiang H. Liu X.-Y. J. Biol.

Among these two methods, artificially formed gels and fibrous networks are excellent systems for studying crystallization because of the control they afford over local supersaturation and diffusion rates, and the physicochemical nature of this process more realistically mimics the mineralized tissue matrix environment (23Estroff L.A.

(b) The deposits are harvested with ease from the medium without contamination of sodium metasilicate. (c) The chemical reaction can be easily controlled. (d) The reaction medium is highly transparent so that the reaction can be easily observed. Type I collagen was isolated and purified as published earlier (25Payne K.J. Veis A.

Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To identify the functional domain in DMP1 that was responsible for HAP nucleation, the coding sequence of rat DMP1 was subamplified into two parts by PCR with a set of primers flanking the required sequence region: 1) N term-S, G GAT CCC ATG AAG ACT GTT ATC CTC CTT ACG; 2) N term-AS, GC GGC CGC TTC CTG GGA TCC CTC ACC AGC; 3) C-term-S, G GAT CCC AGC AGC AGC GAG TCT CAG GAA; 4) C-term-AS, GC GGC CGC GTA GCC ATC TTG GCA ATC ATT. The amplified fragments were sequence-verified and then inserted into the PGEX-4T3 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells (Invitrogen). The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein induced and purified by the standard procedure was cleaved by thrombin at 4 °C. The corresponding peptides were termed NDMP1 (residues 1–334) and CDMP1 (residues 334–489). Native DMP1 and CDMP1 used in in vitro nucleation experiments were isolated from rat bone and were kind gifts from Dr. Chunlin Qin (27Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A.

Calcium phosphates were crystallized by the slow and controlled chemical reaction between the calcium and phosphate ions (with or without organic matrix) in a semisolid medium at physiological pH and temperature. The semisolid crystallizing medium was prepared by using 10 ml of sodium metasilicate solution of specific gravity 1.06 g/ml, 2.7 ml of 60 mm KH2PO4, 1 ml of HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and 87.3 ml of deionized water. The final composition of the medium was 1.03 g/ml sodium metasilicate, 1.61 mm KH2PO4,10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Protein solutions were prepared in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 buffer and then mixed with the sodium metasilicate solution (SMS). The SMS solution was then allowed to polymerize incorporating the protein in the crystallizing medium. After gelation, the second reactant (100 mm Ca2+ in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) was added over the crystallizing medium. Due to the diffusion process, the calcium ion concentration reaches 2.61 ± 0.09 mm at the end of day 10; therefore, the top solution was replaced with 2 ml of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. The concentration of calcium ions that diffused into the crystallizing medium with respect to time and also the influence of specific gravity on the stability of the gel are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. Twelve sets of experiments were conducted to elucidate the influence of type I collagen and either recombinant or native DMP1, native or recombinant CDMP1, or recombinant NDMP1 on the nucleation, phase transformation, morphology, and microstructure of the precipitated calcium phosphate minerals.

The intact mineral deposits were directly used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. For all other studies, the material was ground into fine crystal-lites and used for further analysis. The following methods were used to characterize the mineral deposits. Scanning Electron Microscopy—The morphology and micro-structure of the calcium phosphates (with or without the organic matrix) were examined at different time intervals using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi 3000). The samples were mounted on an aluminum stub using double sticky tape and then coated with gold (JEOL JFC-1200 fine coater) by a sputtering technique at a vacuum of 10-5 torr. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Studies—The XRD patterns of the powdered samples obtained from experiments 1–4 at different time intervals were recorded from 10° 2θ to 42° 2θ with a Rigaku D Max 2200 diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, producing CuKα radiation with wavelength λ = 1.5418 Å, and at a scan speed of 0.02°/min. The relative intensities were determined as diffraction line heights relative to the most intense line normalized to the intensity of the (100) plane with the Materials Data Inc. JADE 6.1 XRD patterns processing software (MDI JADE 6.1). For crystallite size and crystallinity determinations, the spectra were recorded at an interval 25° ≤ 2θ ≤ 27° to obtain the single diffraction peak along the (002) plane. The scan speed was 0.02°/min, and the step size was 0.01°. Raman Spectroscopic Analysis— Raman spectra were recorded with a Renishaw 2000 spectrometer in the range from 1500 to 500 cm-1 using 514.5 nm wavelength excitation from an air-cooled argon ion laser with a power of 30 milliwatts. A holographic notch filter was used to filter out the Rayleigh radiation. The Raman radiation was dispersed using an 1800 groove/mm grating and detected by a Peltier cooled charge-coupled device array. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis—JEOL 3010 transmission electron microscope was used to analyze the calcium phosphates mediated by (a) native full-length DMP1, (b) native full-length DMP1 + type I collagen, (c) recombinant and native CDMP1, (d) recombinant CDMP1 + type I collagen, (e) native CDMP1 + type I collagen, (f) recombinant NDMP1, and (g) recombinant NDMP1 + type I collagen. For TEM studies, the calcium phosphate precipitates were separated by ultrasonic vibration in an ethanol medium and then placed on carbon Formvar-coated nickel grids. TEM was also performed on rat incisor, and the morphology and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were determined for each of the regions marked A, B, and C. The elements present in the mineral deposits (experimental setups 1–4) were determined using an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) apparatus attached to a scanning electron microscope. EDX (Vista model, Thermo Noran) coupled with TEM was used for samples from experimental setups 5–12 and also for rat teeth sections A, B, and C. The calcium to phosphate (Ca/P) ratio was calculated from the intensity of the peaks present in the EDX pattern, and these values were compared with the values obtained from ICPAES analysis (Varian inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer). For ICPAES analysis, 250 mg of calcium phosphates were dissolved in 10 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid (0.1%). The crystallinity (1/β) and crystallite size (LC) of the spherulitic HAP crystals at the end of the maximum growth period mediated by DMP1 was calculated using Scherrer's equation, LC=kλ/βCOSθ,(Eq. 1) where k is the shape coefficient (approximately 0.9–1.0), λ is the wave length, B is the full width at half-maximum of each plane, and θ is the diffraction angle. The corrected value of angular width (β) was calculated from β = (B2 - b2)1/2 where “b” is the instrumental broadening (b = 0.087°) calculated from a well crystallized apatite (28Milenko M. Bruce O.F. Ming S.T. J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. 2004; 109: 553-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For mechanical studies, the protein mediated (rDMP1/rDMP1 + type I collagen) hydroxyapatite crystals were ground into fine crystallites, and then the “dry powder press method” was used to prepare a thin HAP pellet of 2-mm thickness. Young's modulus and hardness of the HAP crystalline pellets were measured using the nanoindenter (TriboIndenter, Hysitron Inc., Minneapolis, MN). A loading/unloading rate of 0.0002 newton and an applied load of 0.001 newton were used. The nanoindenter software (TriboScan, version 6.0.0.31, Hysitron Inc.) calculates the hardness by dividing the load by the surface area. The elastic modulus of the composite biomineral was calculated from the following equation, 1/Er=(1-n2)/E+(1-no2)/Eo(Eq. 2) where Er is the reduced modulus from the nanoindenter, E is the modulus of the Berkovich diamond indenter (1141 GPa), Eo is the modulus of the HAP material, n is Poisson's ratio for the indenter (0.07), and no is Poisson's ratio for the composite (0.28). The reduced modulus (Er) was determined from the corrected contact stiffness, Sc. The contact areas for each indentation (A) were obtained from a tip shape calibration procedure. Er=((π)1/2/2A1/2)Sc(Eq. 3) Sc is the contact stiffness obtained from the derivative of the uploading curve evaluated at peak force. Characterization of the Calcium Phosphate Deposits Obtained in the Absence of an Organic Matrix—The first phase that precipitated in the absence of an organic matrix from the controlled and slow chemical reaction between the calcium and phosphate ions after 7 days did not have a distinct morphology. The polymorph (Fig. 1a) was confirmed to be amorphous by powder x-ray diffraction (Fig. 1f) and the diffused ring pattern from the SAED pattern (Fig. 1a). Elemental analysis by EDX (Fig. 1e) and ICPAES (Table 4) determined the Ca/P ratio to be 1.48 ± 0.03, and this was found to be in good agreement with the theoretical stoichiometric molar ratio of 1.5 for Ca3(PO4)2. After 28 days of growth, SEM analysis depicted the formation of spherulites of size 240 ± 4.3 μm. The number of spherulites increased by the 42nd day, and the microstructure of these spherulites showed that they were aggregates of well defined, elongated, platy crystals (Fig. 1c). XRD analysis confirmed that the polymorph of the platy crystals was DCPD (Fig. 1g), and the calculated d values were found to be in good agreement with the standard ASTM data for DCPD. 3ASTM powder diffraction file compiled by Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Studies, 1983 [00-011-0293]. Composition studies by ICPAES and EDX (Fig. 1e) determined the Ca/P ratio (0.98 ± 0.05) (Table 4) for the spherulites, and the value was found to be in good agreement with the theoretical stoichiometric molar ratio (Ca/P = 1) for DCPD crystals. DCPD also known as brush-ite is a hydrated calcium phosphate mineral and is the most soluble of the sparingly soluble calcium phosphate minerals.TABLE 4Elemental analysis by EDX and ICPAESCalculated Ca/P ratioExperiment serial numberEDX analysisICPAES analysisDay 7Day 60Day 7Day 6011.48 ± 0.030.98 ± 0.051.521.0221.48 ± 0.031.01 ± 0.031.511.0531.48 ± 0.031.62 ± 0.011.471.6241.49 ± 0.021.65 ± 0.021.501.6451.46 ± 0.051.61 ± 0.021.481.6361.46 ± 0.051.67 ± 0.021.471.6771.51 ± 0.031.64 ± 0.031.481.6381.51 ± 0.031.66 ± 0.021.471.6691.51 ± 0.031.63 ± 0.021.491.64101.51 ± 0.031.69 ± 0.041.511.71111.47 ± 0.021.49 ± 0.021.531.53121.47 ± 0.021.47 ± 0.011.521.49 Open table in a new tab Characterization of the Calcium Phosphate Deposits Obtained Only in the Presence of Type I Collagen—Micrometer-sized calcium phosphate crystals having a platy morphology were precipitated in the presence of type I collagen (Fig. 1d). The number of nucleation sites was found to increase gradually after day 7 predominantly in the area where amorphous calcium phosphate was first deposited (Fig. 1a). At the end of 20th day the amorphous structures were completely replaced by platy calcium phosphate crystals, confirmed as DCPD by XRD (Fig. 1h), as the major reflection peak at 2θ = 11.9° corresponds to (010) plane and indicates growth along the b axis. Elemental analysis confirmed the composition (Ca/P, 1.01 ± 0.03) to be DCPD (Fig. 1e). These results demonstrate that although collagen is the major organic component of the mineralized matrix of bone and dentin, it could not initiate nucleation of HAP. These data correlate well with our earlier published data (30Bradt J. Mertig M. Teresiak A. Pompe W. Chem. Mater. 1999; 11: 2694-2701Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Characterization of Spherulitic Apatite Formed Only in the Presence of rDMP1—In the presence of rDMP1, precipitates of amorphous calcium phosphate was observed after 7 days of growth, and the x-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated a broad peak in the region between 2θ = 15° and 2θ = 32° confirming that the harvested material was amorphous in nature (Fig. 2j). Furthermore the diffused ring pattern from electron diffraction (Fig. 2a, top left), a predominant band at 950 cm-1 (v1(PO43-)) in the Raman spectra (Fig. 2k), and the Ca/P ratio of 1.48 ± 0.03 additively confirmed the amorphous nature of the polymorph (Fig. 2i). After 14 days, the precipitate gradually transformed into spherulites of size 90 ± 6.1 μm (Fig. 2, a–f). SEM analysis on the microstructure of the spherulites revealed the presence of a radially arranged aggregation of single fibrous crystals of ∼70 nm in size (Fig. 2, g and h). With further crystal maturation, XRD analysis demonstrated an increase in the intensity of the 2θ peak at 25.6° and 31.6° indicative of growth along the (002) plane and the (211) plane, respectively. The d values calculated from the XRD pattern at day 60 (Fig. 2j) and electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 2g, top left) confirmed that the spherulitic material was HAP and were in good agreement with the standard ASTM values. 4ASTM powder diffraction file compiled by Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Studies [00-009-0432]. An increase in the intensity of the 960 cm-1 band in the Raman spectra with crystal maturation confirmed the transformation from poorly crystalline to highly crystalline HAP (Fig. 2k). The crystalline lattice of spherulitic HAP was confirmed by EDX (Fig. 2i), and the Ca/P ratio calculated from ICPAES and EDX was found to be nearly equal to the theoretical Ca/P ratio (1.67) for HAP (Table 4). Fig. 4a shows the calculated crystallinity (1/β), and the corresponding calculated crystallite size along the c axis of spherulitic HAP (at the end of 60 days) are presented in Table 5. After an initial critical size attained within 7 days, the values increased steadily until a steady state was reached with crystal maturation attained after the 49th day. Further maturation did not yield any apparent increase in crystallinity or increase in crystallite size along the c axis.FIGURE 4a, crystallinity (along c axis) at various growth periods. b, Ca/P ratio as calculated from EDX at different growth periods. c, change in the intensity of peak (211) from XRD data for calcium phosphate deposits obtained at different time periods.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 5Calculated crystallite size of the spherulitic and platy hydroxyapatite crystals grown in the presence of DMP1 and collagen + DMP1 (along c axis direction (002))Growth timeCrystallite size (LC) (002) planeDMP1DMP1 + collagendaysA°000700143.694.08214.0484.92284.575.31354.935.95425.458.11496.278.11606.278.11 Open table in a new tab Effect of rDMP1 and Type I Collagen on Apatite Formation—Combination of type I collagen and rDMP1 had the most profound effect on HAP nucleation and growth. SEM analysis in Fig. 3a demonstrated that the calcium phosphate deposits at the end of 7 days of growth had a unique coiled morphology, and such spherical shapes are known to minimize the area of inter-facial tension with the surrounding solution. The spontaneous formation of ACP in the presence of the organic matrix is a kinetically driven process. Symmetric stretch of the phosphate at 950 cm-1 in the Raman spectra (data not shown) confirmed that these unique structures were amorphous in nature.

https://openalex.org/W2026175377,"Many neural progenitors, including Drosophila mushroom body (MB) and projection neuron (PN) neuroblasts, sequentially give rise to different subtypes of neurons throughout development. We identified a novel BTB-zinc finger protein, named Chinmo (Chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis), that governs neuronal temporal identity during postembryonic development of the Drosophila brain. In both MB and PN lineages, loss of Chinmo autonomously causes early-born neurons to adopt the fates of late-born neurons from the same lineages. Interestingly, primarily due to a posttranscriptional control, MB neurons born at early developmental stages contain more abundant Chinmo than their later-born siblings. Further, the temporal identity of MB progeny can be transformed toward earlier or later fates by reducing or increasing Chinmo levels, respectively. Taken together, we suggest that a temporal gradient of Chinmo (Chinmohigh → Chinmolow) helps specify distinct birth order-dependent cell fates in an extended neuronal lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1998758244,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) is a co-receptor for Wnt proteins and a major regulator in bone homeostasis. Human genetic studies have shown that recessive loss-of-function mutations in LRP5 are linked to osteoporosis, while on the contrary, dominant missense LRP5 mutations are associated with high bone mass (HBM) diseases. All LRP5 HBM mutations are clustered in a single region in the LRP5 extracellular domain and presumably result in elevated Wnt signaling in bone forming cells. Here we show that LRP5 HBM mutant proteins exhibit reduced binding to a secreted bone-specific LRP5 antagonist, SOST, and consequently are more refractory to inhibition by SOST. As loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene are associated with Sclerosteosis, another disorder of excessive bone growth, our study suggests that the SOST-LRP5 antagonistic interaction plays a central role in bone mass regulation and may represent a nodal point for therapeutic intervention for osteoporosis and other bone diseases."

Here, we present two-dimensional high-precision anisotropy measurement for energies from a few to several hundred teraelectronvolts (TeV), using the large data sample of the Tibet Air Shower Arrays. Besides revealing finer details of the known anisotropies, a new component of Galactic cosmic ray anisotropy in sidereal time is uncovered around the Cygnus region direction. For cosmic-ray energies up to a few hundred TeV, all components of anisotropies fade away, showing a corotation of Galactic cosmic rays with the local Galactic magnetic environment. These results have broad implications for a comprehensive understanding of cosmic rays, supernovae, magnetic fields, and heliospheric and Galactic dynamic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2131553403,"The T cell receptor (TCR) αβ heterodimer communicates ligand binding to the cell interior via noncovalently associated CD3γɛ, CD3δɛ, and ζζ dimers. While structures of extracellular components of the TCR-CD3 complex are known, the transmembrane (TM) domains that mediate assembly have eluded structural characterization. Incorporation of the ζζ signaling module is known to require one basic TCRα and two ζζ aspartic acid TM residues. We report the NMR structure of the ζζTM dimer, a left-handed coiled coil with substantial polar contacts. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that three polar positions are critical for ζζ dimerization and assembly with TCR. The two aspartic acids create a single structural unit at the ζζ interface stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding, and there is evidence for a structural water molecule (or molecules) within close proximity. This structural unit, representing only the second transmembrane dimer interface solved to date, serves as a paradigm for the assembly of all modules involved in TCR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1964995688,"The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70) are essential members of the cellular chaperone machinery that assists protein-folding processes. To perform their functions Hsp70 chaperones toggle between two nucleotide-controlled conformational states. ATP binding to the ATPase domain triggers the transition to the low affinity state of the substrate-binding domain, while substrate binding to the substrate-binding domain in synergism with the action of a J-domain-containing cochaperone stimulates ATP hydrolysis and thereby transition to the high affinity state. Thus, ATPase and substrate-binding domains mutually affect each other through an allosteric control mechanism, the basis of which is largely unknown. In this study we identified two positively charged, surface-exposed residues in the ATPase domain and a negatively charged residue in the linker connecting both domains that are important for interdomain communication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linker alone is sufficient to stimulate the ATPase activity, an ability that is lost upon amino acid replacement. The linker therefore is most likely the lever that is wielded by the substrate-binding domain and the cochaperone onto the ATPase domain to induce a conformation favorable for ATP hydrolysis. Based on our results we propose a mechanism of interdomain communication."

Here, we describe a pathogenic mechanism for promoting dynamic actin assembly in the nucleus to enable viral replication. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus induced nuclear actin polymerization by translocating the host actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex into the nucleus, where it was activated by p78/83, a viral Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-like protein. Nuclear actin assembly by p78/83 and Arp2/3 complex was essential for viral progeny production. Recompartmentalizing dynamic host actin may represent a conserved mode of pathogenesis and reflect viral manipulation of normal functions of nuclear actin."

Constitutive overexpression of mycobacterial heat shock protein (myHsp70) is associated with impaired bacterial persistence, but the immune-mediated mechanisms are unknown. We found that myHsp70, in addition to enhancing antigen delivery to human dendritic cells, signaled through the CCR5 chemokine receptor, promoting dendritic cell aggregation, immune synapse formation between dendritic cells and T cells, and the generation of effector immune responses. Thus, CCR5 acts as a pattern-recognition receptor for myHsp70, which may have implications for both the pathophysiology of tuberculosis and the use of myHsps in tumor-directed immunotherapy."

The mechanism by which MHC class I molecules select optimal peptides against a background of prevailing suboptimal peptides and in a considerably proteolytic ER environment remained unknown. Here, we identify protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme critical to the formation of correct disulfide bonds in proteins, as a component of the peptide-loading complex. We show that PDI stabilizes a peptide-receptive site by regulating the oxidation state of the disulfide bond in the MHC peptide-binding groove, a function that is essential for selecting optimal peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human cytomegalovirus US3 protein inhibits CD8(+) T cell recognition by mediating PDI degradation, verifying the functional relevance of PDI-catalyzed peptide editing in controlling intracellular pathogens. These results establish a link between thiol-based redox regulation and antigen processing."

While varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus.

https://openalex.org/W2027409743,"Based on recent data showing that overexpression of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit increased cell-cell adhesion of nonpolarized cells, we hypothesized that the β1 subunit can also be involved in the formation of cell-cell contacts in highly polarized epithelial cells. In support of this hypothesis, in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 subunits were detected as precisely co-localized with adherens junctions in all stages of the monolayer formation starting from the initiation of cell-cell contact. The Na,K-ATPase and adherens junction protein, β-catenin, stayed partially co-localized even after their internalization upon disruption of intercellular contacts by Ca2+ depletion of the medium. The Na,K-ATPase subunits remained co-localized with the adherens junctions after detergent treatment of the cells. In contrast, the heterodimer formed by expressed unglycosylated Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit and the endogenous α1 subunit was easily dissociated from the adherens junctions and cytoskeleton by the detergent extraction. The MDCK cell line in which half of the endogenous β1 subunits in the lateral membrane were substituted by unglycosylated β1 subunits displayed a decreased ability to form cell-to-cell contacts. Incubation of surface-attached MDCK cells with an antibody against the extracellular domain of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit specifically inhibited cell-cell contact formation. We conclude that the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit is involved in the process of intercellular adhesion and is necessary for association of the heterodimeric Na,K-ATPase with the adherens junctions.

Specialized tight epithelia of multicellular organisms function as barriers that maintain the distinct molecular composition of apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains. Individual cells within the monolayer are linked with each other to maintain its structural integrity and to retard or prevent the diffusion of solutes through the intercellular space. The junctional complex in epithelial cells consists of tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions and desmosomes mechanically link adjacent cells, whereas tight junctions are responsible for intercellular sealing (2Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E.

Gap junctions are important for communication between cells of the monolayer by allowing passage of small water-soluble molecules and ions from cell to cell. Development of cell junctions is a key step in the evolution from individual cells to a functional epithelium. Moreover, disruption of these junctions and structural contacts between cells is the key event in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the process in which cells change from a highly polarized epithelial phenotype to a motile, fibroblast-like phenotype (4Huber M.A. Kraut N.

Physiol. 2006; 290: F20-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This transition occurs with inflammation, fibrosis, and malignant transformation of tissues (6Popov Z. Gil-Diez de Medina S. Lefrere-Belda M.A. Hoznek A. Bastuji-Garin S. Abbou C.C. Thiery J.P. Radvanyi F. Chopin D.K. Br J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Eddy A.A. J. Am. Soc.

Many of the factors essential for the development or maintenance of cell junctions remain undefined. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity by exposure to ouabain or by K+ depletion resulted in cell detachment in mature monolayers (11Contreras R.G. Shoshani L.

Inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase also increased permeability of polarized monolayers of human retinal pigment epithelial cells and pancreatic polarized cell line to both ions and nonionic molecules (16Rajasekaran S.A.

These results were interpreted as showing that activity of the Na,K-ATPase is important for formation and maintenance of cell-cell contacts. How the Na,K-ATPase activity contributes to intercellular adhesion is not clear. It was suggested that the pump stimulates activity of the RhoA GTPase that is involved in F-actin stress fiber formation (14Rajasekaran S.A. Palmer L.G. Moon S.Y. Peralta Soler A. Apodaca G.L. Harper J.F. Zheng Y. Rajasekaran A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3717-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Rajasekaran A.K. Rajasekaran S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F388-F396Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since the Na,K-ATPase is important for establishment of transepithelial transport, maintenance of the normal membrane potential, and normal intracellular concentrations of K+,Na+,Ca2+, and other ions and neutral molecules, cell adhesion could depend on any of these factors. The observations that ouabain-dependent effects on cell adhesion were similar to the effects detected upon incubation of cells at low K+ concentration or in the presence of the Na+ ionophore gramicidin that increased intracellular concentration of Na+ (12Contreras R.G. Flores-Maldonado C. Lazaro A. Shoshani L. Flores-Benitez D. Larre I. Cereijido M. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Rajasekaran S.A. Palmer L.G.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3717-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) suggest that the maintenance of the ion balance by the Na,K-ATPase is crucial for cell-cell adhesion. Overexpression of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit in nonpolarized CHO cells and MDCK cells transformed by Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV-MDCK) increased cell-cell adhesion in these cell lines (18Shoshani L. Contreras R.G. Roldan M.L. Moreno J. Lazaro A. Balda M.S. Matter K. Cereijido M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Rajasekaran S.A. Palmer L.G. Quan K.

These data could suggest that the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit acts as an adhesive protein. However, since in both cell lines overexpression of the β1 subunit increased expression of the endogenous α1 subunit (18Shoshani L. Contreras R.G. Roldan M.L. Moreno J. Lazaro A. Balda M.S. Matter K. Cereijido M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Rajasekaran S.A. Gopal J. Willis D. Espineda C. Twiss J.L. Rajasekaran A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these data might be interpreted differently. It is possible that gain of adhesiveness by these two cell lines is a result of contribution of the increased Na,K-ATPase activity to cell adhesion or a signaling role of the α1 subunit. Recent results suggested that overexpression of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit in MSV-MDCK cells suppressed cell motility due to the signaling mechanism involving both subunits of the Na,K-ATPase, annexin-II, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (21Barwe S.P. Anilkumar G. Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Whitelegge J.P. Rajasekaran S.A. Rajasekaran A.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1082-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit is directly involved in cell-cell adhesion by providing a structural link between neighboring cells, we studied association of the pump with constituents of the junctional complex during maturation of the monolayer and after disruption of cell to cell contacts. In addition, we analyzed the impact of removal of N-glycosylation sites from the β1 subunit on its attachment to adherens junctions. Finally, we determined the effect of exposure of MDCK cells to a β1 subunit-specific antibody and to ouabain on cell contact formation. The results of these studies showed that the Na,K-ATPase associates with the adherens junctions upon the inception of cell junction formation. Upon disruption of cell contacts, the Na,K-ATPase is retrieved from the sites of cell contact together with adherens junction proteins. Furthermore, removal of N-glycosylation sites from the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit loosens association of the enzyme with the adherens junctions and impairs the initial step of cell-cell adhesion. Finally, attachment of a specific antibody to the extracellular domain of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit inhibits cell-cell contact formation, whereas exposure to ouabain has no effect. These novel data indicate that the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit plays an important role in the establishment of contacts between MDCK cells, an important step in the maturation of a tight epithelium. Construction of cDNAs Encoding YFP-linked Constructs of the Na,K-ATPase β1 Subunit and Its Mutants Lacking N-Glycosylation Sites—The vector pEYFP-β1 encoding the fusion protein of YFP linked to the amino terminus of the rat Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (YFP-β1) was constructed as described previously (22Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43159-43167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutated YFP-β1 fusion proteins lacking one, two, or three N-glycosylation sites were generated by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The vector encoding a fusion protein of the bile acid transporter, NTCP, and YFP (23Hallen S. Mareninova O. Branden M. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7253-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Olga Mareninova. Stable Transfection—MDCK cells were purchased from ATCC. In order to obtain cell lines stably expressing NTCP-YFP, wild type YFP-β1, or mutated YFP-β1 fusion proteins, MDCK cells were grown on 10-cm plates until 20% confluence and transfected with NTCP-YFP, the wild type or mutated pEYFP-β1 using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Stable cell lines were selected by adding, 24 h after transfection, the eukaryotic selection marker G-418 at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. This concentration of G-418 was maintained until single colonies appeared. 15-20 colonies were isolated, expanded, and grown in the presence of 0.25 mg of G-418 per ml of medium in 24-well plates. Two clones with the highest expression of YFP-β or NTCP-YFP were selected and expanded for further studies. Confocal Microscopy Identification of the Site of Expression of YFP-linked Proteins—Cells stably expressing NTCP-YFP or wild type or mutated YFP-β1 were grown for at least 5 days after becoming confluent on collagen-coated glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp.) or Corning Costar polyester transwell inserts (Corning Glass). Confocal microscopic images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope using LSM 510 software, version 3.2. Primary Antibodies—The following antibodies were used for immunostaining, Western blot analysis, and in cell-cell adhesion assay: TRITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody against β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), a monoclonal antibody C464.6 against the Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), a monoclonal antibody against occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), a monoclonal antibody against spectrin (Chemicon), a monoclonal antibody against E-cadherin (Sigma), a polyclonal antibody against EEA1, the marker of early endosomes (Abcam), a monoclonal antibody against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit, clone M17-P5-F11 (Affinity Bioreagents), and the monoclonal antibody against GFP, clones 7.1 and 13.1, that also recognized YFP (Roche Applied Science) and a monoclonal antibody against transferrin receptor, clone OX-26 (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescent Staining of Cell Monolayers—Cells were fixed by incubation with 3.75% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C (before or after treatment with 0.25% Triton X-100 as indicated) and permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Then cells were incubated with Dako protein block serum-free solution (Dako Corp.) for 30 min. F-actin was stained by using Alexa633-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). The β-catenin was visualized using TRITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody against β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories). Immunostaining of other proteins was performed by a 1-h incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies followed by a 1-h incubation with one of the following secondary antibodies: Alexa633-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies or Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen) or TRITC-conjugated anti-rat antibodies (MP Biomedicals). Triton X-100 Treatment of MDCK Cells—Triton X-100 treatment of MDCK cells was performed by a previously described procedure (24Sawada Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass bottom microwell dishes or Corning Costar polyester transwell inserts (Corning Glass) were washed with PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ twice and incubated with the PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Then cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed by incubation with 3.75% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed twice by PBS, and subjected to the confocal microscopy studies or to further immunostaining procedures. Analysis of Cellular Distribution and Detergent Resistance of the Na,K-ATPase Subunits Using Surface-specific Biotinylation and Western Blot Analysis—Nontransfected MDCK cells or MDCK cells stably expressing wild type or mutated YFP-linked β1 subunits were maintained for at least 5 days after becoming confluent in Corning Costar polyester transwell inserts (Corning Glass) in 6-well plates. Biotinylation of the apical or baso-lateral membrane proteins was performed by previously described procedures (25Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kroepfl J.F. Gardinier M.V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were biotinylated with EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate) (Pierce) that was added from either the apical or basolateral side. After quenching the biotinylation reaction, cells were washed and then lysed by incubation with 200 μl of 0.15 m NaCl in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 1% Triton X-100 and 4 mm EGTA. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. Samples containing 20 μl of supernatant mixed with 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels to analyze proteins extracted from the whole cells by 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer. To isolate apical or basolateral biotinylated proteins, the rest of the cell extract (180 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) in a total volume of 1 ml of 0.15 m NaCl in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 4mm EGTA at 4 °C with continuous rotation for 60 min. The bead-adherent complexes were washed three times on the beads, and then proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 80 °C and loaded onto SDS-PAGE side by side with the corresponding extracts from the whole cells. Where indicated, cells on the transwell inserts were treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature after quenching biotinylation reaction and before cell lysis. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by the Western blot analysis using the appropriate primary antibody and the anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) as a secondary antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using Eastman Kodak Co. 1D 3.6 software. Cell-Cell Adhesion Assay—Nontransfected MDCK cells or cells expressing a YFP-linked protein (NTCP-YFP, wild type YFP-β1 or mutant YFP-β1) were trypsinized and sparsely plated on collagen-coated glass bottom microwell dishes. After a 1-h incubation in the regular culture medium, nonadherent cells were removed by rinsing. The areas having similar densities of the cells of ∼300 cells/mm2 on the plates were selected. Confocal microscopy (for cells expressing YFP-linked proteins) or light microscopy (for nontransfected cells) images of these fields were acquired. At this stage, antibodies, a blocking peptide, or ouabain were added into the culture medium where indicated. Cells were placed back into the tissue culture incubator. Intercellular adhesion was controlled by acquiring images of the same fields on microwell dishes at certain time points of cell incubation with or without the antibodies, the peptide, or ouabain. Cell-cell adhesion was quantified by calculating the percentage of cells that did not form contacts with the neighboring cells at the indicated time intervals of incubation. The monoclonal antibodies against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit, E-cadherin, transferrin receptor, or GFP were purified from sodium azide and other low molecular mass contaminants using Amicon Ultra-4 30K centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) and transferred to PBS, pH 7.2, at 4 °C prior to their use in a cell-cell adhesion assay. Protein concentration before and after purification of the antibodies was determined using NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. The antibody against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit was added at final concentrations of 5, 15, 25, or 35 μg/ml in the regular cell culture medium. The peptide KNESLETYPVM (Biopeptide Co., Inc.) containing amino acids 195-199 (shown in boldface type) of the sheep Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit was added to the culture medium at a final concentration 2.5 μg/ml alone or together with 25 μg/ml of the antibody against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit after a 1-h preincubation of the peptide and antibody in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The antibodies against E-cadherin, transferrin receptor, and GFP were added at the final concentration of 25 μg/ml. To compensate for a possible internalization of the antibody against transferrin receptor, fresh additions of the antibody (25 μg/ml) were made after 2 and 4 h of cell incubation. Ouabain was added at concentrations of 1, 5, or 10 μm. Na,K-ATPase Is Resistant to Triton X-100 Extraction—The endogenous Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 subunits were detected by surface-selective biotinylation almost exclusively in the basolateral plasma membrane domain of MDCK cells (Fig. 1A, lanes Ap and BL). To assure that biotinylated samples were not contaminated by intracellular proteins, the blot was stained by an antibody against a cytoskeletal protein, spectrin. The band corresponding to spectrin was not detected in the lanes containing surface biotinylated proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes Ap, BL, and BL*), but it was detected in the lanes containing intracellular proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes Ext and Ext*). Therefore, biotinylated proteins were not contaminated by intracellular proteins. It has been shown previously that treatment of adherent cells with 0.25-0.5% Triton X-100 leaves the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-associated proteins attached to the surface but removes all soluble and most membrane proteins that are not linked to the cytoskeleton (24Sawada Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, treatment of MDCK cells with 0.25% Triton X-100 similar to the procedures described previously (24Sawada Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) significantly reduced the total protein content in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 1B), indicating that many proteins were extracted from cells by the detergent. In contrast, Triton X-100 did not remove α1 and β1 subunits from the basolateral membranes (Fig. 1A, lanes BL*). Therefore, the Na,K-ATPase subunits residing in the basolateral plasma membrane domain are resistant to detergent extraction, suggesting that the enzyme is directly or indirectly associated with the cytoskeleton at the basolateral membrane. In contrast, the intracellular fraction of the Na,K-ATPase subunits was sensitive to the detergent treatment. The whole cell extract contained both Na,K-ATPase subunits (Fig. 1A, lane Ext). The β1 subunit was represented by two bands in the extract. Only one of these two bands, the upper one, was present in the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1A, lanes BL and BL*). Therefore, the upper band corresponds to the fully glycosylated form of the β1 subunit, whereas the lower band (marked by round brackets on Fig. 1A, lane Ext) presumably represents a high mannose fraction of the protein that resides in the ER. The extract obtained from the cells treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 also contained both subunits. However, the amounts of both the α1 and β1 subunits were slightly decreased, and the β1 subunit was detected as a single upper band (Fig. 1A, lane Ext*). This suggests that the intracellular fraction of the pump consisting mostly of the α1 subunit assembled with the high mannose fraction of the β1 subunit (Fig. 1A, lane Ext, round brackets) was removed by 0.25% Triton X-100. Similarly, the lower bands detected by anti-spectrin antibody in the whole cell extract (Fig. 1A, lane Ext, square brackets) disappeared in the lane corresponding to the cell extract after 0.25% Triton X-100 treatment of cells (Fig. 1A, lane Ext*). This observation suggests that some soluble proteins cross-reacting with the anti-spectrin antibody were removed by 0.25% Triton X-100. Similar to the endogenous Na,K-ATPase subunits, the expressed YFP-β1 was also detected predominantly on the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1C). The basolateral fraction of YFP-β1 was also resistant to 0.25% Triton X-100. Expression of YFP-β1 did not change the detergent resistance of the endogenous Na,K-ATPase α1 or β1 subunits, as detected by immunostaining the lower part of the blot using the antibody against the β1 subunit and the middle part of the blot with the antibody against the α1 subunit (Fig. 1D). As expected, spectrin was not detected in the apical and basolateral fractions. Resistance of YFP-β1 to the extraction by 0.25% Triton X-100 was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. Treatment of MDCK cells expressing YFP-β1 with Triton X-100 did not remove YFP-β1 from the lateral membranes (Fig. 2, D and E). This resistance of the Na,K-ATPase to detergent extraction suggests that the enzyme is directly or indirectly associated with the cytoskeleton at the basolateral membrane. It has been shown that the Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit interacts with the membrane cytoskeletal protein, spectrin, via a cytoplasmic anchoring protein, ankyrin, in various cell types (28Nelson W.J. Veshnock P.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that this interaction is responsible for the polar distribution of the Na,K-ATPase in MDCK cells due to stabilization of the pump at the basolateral plasma membrane domain (29Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 30Morrow J.S. Cianci C.D. Ardito T. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, immunostaining of the tight monolayer of MDCK cells expressing YFP-β1 using antibodies against spectrin showed co-localization of YFP-β1 with spectrin in the lateral membrane (Fig. 2, A-C). However, spectrin was also detected as a meshlike network inside the cells in contrast to YFP-β1 that was absent from the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A-C). This suggests that mechanisms other than spectrin association are involved in the specific localization of the Na,K-ATPase on the lateral membranes in MDCK cells. The Na,K-ATPase Is Located at the Sites of Cell Contact in the Tight Monolayers of MDCK Cells—As seen from the vertical sections of MDCK cells, YFP-β1 is located predominantly in the lateral membranes and is virtually absent from the basal membrane (Fig. 3). This might suggest that the contacts with the neighboring cells are important for stable expression of the protein in the lateral membrane. As seen from the high resolution confocal microscopy images of horizontal sections of the cell monolayer, distribution of YFP-β1 in the lateral membranes is not uniform but has the appearance of a string of beads (Fig. 2D). The beaded appearance is also evident in a three-dimensional image of the cells (supplemental Video 1). This beaded appearance was retained after treatment of cells with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Fig. 2E). To test whether this appearance is a result of membrane junctions of the two neighboring cells, we incubated cells in Ca2+-free buffer. It is known that Ca2+ is required for formation and maintenance of cell-cell contacts. As expected, removal of Ca2+ from the medium resulted in separation of the lateral membranes of neighboring cells (Fig. 2F, white circle, and Supplemental Video 2). As a consequence, YFP-β1 now appeared evenly distributed in a single lateral membrane as a thin line and not as"

(2006) Nucleic Acids Res., in press). Here we show that TRF2 binds to model replication forks and four-way junctions in vitro in a structure-specific but sequence-independent manner. A synthetic peptide encompassing the TRF2 basic domain also binds to DNA four-way junctions, whereas the TRF2 truncation mutant (TRF2(DeltaB)) and a mutant basic domain peptide do not. In the absence of the basic domain, the ability of TRF2 to localize to model telomere ends and facilitate t-loop formation in vitro is diminished. We propose that TRF2 plays a key role during telomere replication in binding chickenfoot intermediates of telomere replication fork regression. Junction-specific binding would also allow TRF2 to stabilize a strand invasion structure that is thought to exist at the strand invasion site of the t-loop."

WNV has subsequently been found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Russia, western Asia, and Australia (less severe subtype Kunjin) and most recently in North America (1van der Pensaert M.B. Meulen K.M. Nauwynck H.J. Arch Virol. 2005; 150: 637-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). WNV is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes from avian reservoir hosts to vertebrate dead end hosts, including humans and horses (2Hayes C.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 951: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Human infection is generally asymptomatic or causes a mild febrile disease, West Nile fever. However, more recent infections of WNV have also been associated with higher rates of severe neurological disease and fatalities, particularly among the elderly (2Hayes C.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 951: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Since the introduction of WNV into New York in 1999, the virus has spread rapidly throughout North America, infecting over 19,000 people and causing more than 700 fatalities (see the Center for Disease Control and Prevention site on the World Wide Web at www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm). Currently there is no vaccine or antiviral therapy for the prevention or treatment of human WNV infection (1van der Pensaert M.B. Meulen K.M. Nauwynck H.J. Arch Virol. 2005; 150: 637-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). WNV is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive sense 11-kb RNA genome, which encodes a single polyprotein precursor. This polyprotein must be cleaved co- and post-translationally to produce 10 functional proteins: three structural (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Translation of the viral polyprotein is membrane-associated with host proteases cleaving junctions within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi, whereas a viral protease encoded within NS3 cleaves at the junctions NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, and NS4B/NS5 and also internal sites within C, NS3, and NS4A (Fig. 1) (3Brinton M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 371-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cleavage at these sites by the NS3 protease is essential for viral replication, so the protease is a potential therapeutic target (4Tyndall J.D. Nall T. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 973-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 7Nall T.A. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NS3 is a multifunctional protein, the protease comprising the N-terminal third and nucleotide triphosphatase, RNA triphosphatase, and helicase components comprising the remainder (8Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Koonin E.V. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Li H. Clum S. You S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS3 is a trypsin-like serine protease with a classical catalytic triad (His-51, Asp-75, Ser-135) (11Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Virology. 1989; 171: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and is highly specific for substrates with dibasic P1 and P2 components and a small amino acid at P1′. This recognition sequence is highly conserved throughout flaviruses (12Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar); however, different flaviviruses prefer either Lys or Arg at P2. Although Den and YF NS3 proteases predominantly recognize Arg at P2, WNV protease recognizes Lys at P2 (Table 1). The activity of flavivirus NS3 proteases is dependent on an NS2B cofactor, with truncation studies in Den2 having shown that a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain is sufficient for activity (13Falgout B. Miller R.H. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flanking hydrophobic domains within NS2B are likely to function in promoting membrane association of NS2B-NS3 (14Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Flavivirus cleavage sequences and cofactor homology Mosquito-borne flaviviruses include West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV), dengue virus subtypes 1-4 (Den1, Den2, Den3, Den4), yellow fever virus (YF), Japanese encephalitis virus (JE), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Bussuquara virus (BSQV). Tick-borne flaviviruses include Langat virus (LGTV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE). The first column shows the alignment of the region of NS2B involved in substrate binding, whereas the next four columns show the native flavivirus cleavage sequences (P4-P1′). The final column shows the degree of homology between the various flaviviruses and the WNV NS2B 40-amino acid cofactor domain and the NS3 protease domain. Residues shown in green and yellow designate homology. The residue shown in boldface type and designated by the asterisk is believed to interact with P2. A P2 arginine residue is shown in blue, and a P2 lysine is shown in red. Due to their pivotal roles in both normal physiology and disease, proteases are increasingly attracting interest as pharmaceutical targets (15Leung D. Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 305-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Since early successes in human immunodeficiency virus chemotherapy (human immunodeficiency virus-protease inhibitors) and in the treatment of high blood pressure (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors), a large number of new protease inhibitors have entered clinical trials (16Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. Med. Chem. 2005; 1: 71-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). One reason for the drug potential of proteases is the relatively predictable way in which they recognize their substrates and inhibitors in extended (β-strand) conformations (4Tyndall J.D. Nall T. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 973-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Fairlie D.P. Tyndall J.D.A. Reid R.C. Wong A.K. Abbenante G. Scanlon M.J. March D.R. Bergman D.A. Chai C.L.L. Burkett B.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There are no known examples of proteolytic processing of peptide α-helices, β-sheets, or β-turns. Greater access to three-dimensional structures for proteases (over 1500 in the Protein Data Bank) has also facilitated hybrid structure/substrate-based drug design (5Loughlin W.A. Tyndall J.D.A. Glenn M.P. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 6085-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recently reported crystal structures for NS2B/NS3 proteases of both WNV and Den2 (6D'Arcy A. Chaillet M. Schiering N. Villard F. Pheng Lim S. Lefeuvre P. Erbel P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) provide new structural insights to flaviviral proteases in ligand-bound conformations. An earlier homology model of the WNV protease (7Nall T.A. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), derived from the crystal structures of a highly homologous dengue NS3 protease without NS2B cofactor (18Murthy H.M. Judge K. DeLucas L. Padmanabhan R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and a less homologous hepatitis NS3 with bound NS4A cofactor (19Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Lin C. Fox T. Dwyer M.D. Landro J.A. Chambers S.P. Markland W. Lepre C.A. O'Malley E.T. Harbeson S.L. Rice C.M. Murcko M.A. Caron P.R. Thomson J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), differs significantly from the crystal structure of WNV NS2B-NS3. This has prompted a reexamination now of some of the previous mutagenesis data (20Chappell K.J. Nall T.A. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Fairlie D.P. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2896-2903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reported WNV protease crystal structure shows an N-capped tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor bound in the substrate-binding cleft as a loop (instead of the commonly observed β-strand conformation) with the “P5” capping benzoyl residue sitting on top of the P1 residue. It therefore seemed unlikely that this ligand had the same binding mode as substrates beyond P1 and P2. In previous kinetic studies using short hexapeptide p-nitroanilide substrates derived from endogenous polypeptide cleavage sites, we found no preference of WNV protease for specific residues except at P1 and P2 (7Nall T.A. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies using nonnative dengue hexapeptide and decapeptide 5L. Juliano, personal communication. 5L. Juliano, personal communication. and tetrapeptide and octapeptide (21Li J. Lim S.P. Beer D. Patel V. Wen D. Tumanut C. Tully D.C. Williams J.A. Jiricek J. Priestle J.P. Harris J.L. Vasudevan S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28766-28774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) substrate sequences have suggested opportunities for enhancing substrate affinity for flaviviral proteases using nonnative or nonproteinogenic amino acids with hydrophobic (Nle, Leu) residues at P4 and a basic (Lys > Arg) residue at P3, a feature not seen in suboptimal native sequences. Using a combination of computer docking of substrates into the enzyme crystal structure, site-directed mutagenesis of the protease (Fig. 1), and kinetic studies of the processing of tetrapeptide substrates, we have focused the present study on increasing substrate affinity and processing efficiency, identifying the enzyme residues likely to be involved in binding to the P2-P4 positions of substrates, and taking early steps toward potent substrate-based nonpeptidic inhibitors by incorporating unnatural amino acids in tetrapeptide substrates. para-Nitroanilide (pNA) Substrate Synthesis—pNA substrates were synthesized according to the general method of Abbenante et al. (22Abbenante G. Leung D. Bond T. Fairlie D.P. LIPS. 2001; 7: 347-351Google Scholar) and characterized by analytical high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and NMR (see supplemental material). Modeling of Substrates into the NS3 Crystal Structure—The crystal structure of West Nile virus NS2B/NS3 protease (Protein Data Bank code 2fp7) was prepared for docking by adding protons using InsightII (version 2000; Accelrys Inc.). Substrates were assembled using the Biopolymer and Sketcher modules within InsightII and minimized using Discover. All substrate docking experiments were conducted using GOLD version 2.1.2 (23Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding and distance constraints were used to align the substrate within the active site as follows. The P1 Arg residue was positioned as observed for the corresponding residue in the aldehyde inhibitor complex (Protein Data Bank code 2fp7) (24Erbel P. Schiering N. D'Arcy A. Renatus M. Kroemer M. Lim S.P. Yin Z. Keller T.H. Vasudevan S.G. Hommel U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), using a distance constraint of 3.5 ± 1.5 Å between the Arg ζ-carbon and the aromatic γ-carbon of Tyr-161 in the S1 pocket. This positions the positive charge of the arginine optimally for a π-cation interaction but also enables a charge-charge interaction with Asp129. A hydrogen bond between the P2 Lys z-NH3+ and the Asn-152 side-chain carbonyl oxygen was used to anchor P2 in the shallow solvent-exposed S2 pocket, as predicted in earlier modeling work (7Nall T.A. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and later verified experimentally (24Erbel P. Schiering N. D'Arcy A. Renatus M. Kroemer M. Lim S.P. Yin Z. Keller T.H. Vasudevan S.G. Hommel U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond constraints for critical substrate backbone-enzyme interactions between NS3-Gly-153 carbonyl oxygen and substrate P3 NH, Gly-153 NH and substrate P3 carbonyls, and Gly-151 carbonyl oxygen and Arg P1 αNH were also used. No constraints on the position of P3 and P4 side chains were used. For the larger 2-naphthoyl residue in 2-naphthoyl-KKR-pNA, the docking (Fig. 2) produced poses with a high degree of steric clash in the vicinity of S4. In these cases, the docking poses were minimized with the enzyme backbone either fixed or tethered and the enzyme side chains and the entire substrate allowed to move using Discover (Accelrys). Plasmid Construction—The expression plasmid pQE9 WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro, previously generated from WNV (strain NY99-4132) (10Li H. Clum S. You S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. The site-directed mutations in NS2B (V75A, V75F, N84A, N84D, N84E, N84L, N84S, Q86A, Q86E, Q86L, L87A, and L87F) and NS3 (T111F, T111L, V154F, V154L, I155F, M156A, I162F, A164S, A164V, and V166L) were inserted by amplifying the entire plasmid with PCR using Phusion™ polymerase (Finnzymes) together with a pair of partially overlapping primers (supplemental material). The template plasmid was digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. The PCR-amplified plasmid was then used to transform Escherichia coli strain XL10 Gold competent cells, which were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, the expression plasmid was purified, and sequences were confirmed by automated analysis. Enzyme Expression and Purification—The pQE9 vector was used to allow high level, inducible expression of N-terminal His6-tagged recombinant proteins. Cultures of E. coli strain SG13009 transformed with the expression plasmids containing the site-directed mutations were grown in 2 × 25 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and incubated for an additional 3 h at 22°C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 10 min and stored at -20 °C. For protein purification, the cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol). To prevent proteolytic cleavage of protein during lysis and purification, the following protease inhibitors were added to give the final concentrations of 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication, and insoluble products were pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The recombinant proteases were purified by affinity chromatography using an N-terminal His6 tag on Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Resin (0.5 ml) was pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of column buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol), and then the resin was removed and mixed with the supernatant of the cell lysates. These mixtures were incubated at 4 °C on a shaker for 30 min to allow the His-tagged protein to bind to the Ni2+ column. Resin was pelleted at low speed (100 × g), and the buffer was removed. The resin was washed with 3 × 5 ml of column buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted into a single 300-μl fraction with column buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Purification was confirmed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic Characterization and Substrate Analysis—Purified recombinant protease, WNV CF40.Gly. NS3pro, and site-directed mutants were assayed against tetrapeptide (Ac-LKKR-pNA) and hexapeptide (Ac-LQYTKR-pNA) substrates corresponding to P6-P1 of cleavage sites in the endogenous substrates but with a chromogenic pNA group at the P1′ position. Cleavage of pNA from the peptides by WNV protease produced a yellow color that allowed monitoring at 405 nm. The assay was conducted in a 96-well plate, with a final reaction volume of 200 μl containing 0.25 or 0.5 μm recombinant protease, using optimized conditions (final concentration of 50 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.5, 30% glycerol, and 1 mm CHAPS) (7Nall T.A. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Eight different substrate concentrations, each in triplicate, were used for determining kinetic constants. After preincubation in separate wells (10 min, 37 °C), catalysis was initiated by mixing substrate with enzyme-buffer solution by automatic shaking for 5 s. The optical density was measured at 405 nm every 11-30 s for 210 s to 30 min (depending on activity) in a SpectraMax 250 reader, and the average change in millioptical density/min was calculated. For low substrate concentration, where there was a visible loss in activity over time, only the first five points were used to calculate the average change in millioptical density/min. Kinetic parameters were calculated from weighted nonlinear regression of the initial velocities as a function of the eight substrate concentrations using Graphpad Prism 4® software. The parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were calculated assuming Michaelis-Menten equilibrium kinetics, v = Vmax[S]/([S] + Km). Triplicate measurements were taken for each data point, and means ± S.E. are reported. Predicted Substrate-Enzyme Interactions—The reported crystal structure of WNV NS3 protease in association with the cofactor domain of NS2B has increased the understanding of the mechanism of substrate binding and protease activity. Since the enzyme was also bound to a tetrapeptide-aldehyde inhibitor, it was possible to observe enzyme residues that interact with P1 and P2 side chains. However, because the inhibitor was not bound in the extended β-strand conformation typical of substrate-protease interactions (4Tyndall J.D. Nall T. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 973-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Fairlie D.P. Tyndall J.D.A. Reid R.C. Wong A.K. Abbenante G. Scanlon M.J. March D.R. Bergman D.A. Chai C.L.L. Burkett B.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), enzyme contacts with substrate beyond P1 and P2 positions could not be deduced from that crystal structure. In this work, we sought to dissect critical substrate interactions with enzyme at S2, S3, and S4. Cleavage sites for WNV protease vary considerably between P6 and P3 in native polypeptide substrates (e.g. DPNRKR ↓ GW (NS2A-NS2B), LQYTKR ↓ GG (NS2B-NS3), FASGKR ↓ SQ (NS3-NS4A), KPGLKR ↓ GG (NS4A-NS5)), with polar, acidic, basic, and hydrophobic residues all tolerated at P6-P3 positions. To predict protease residues that are important for substrate binding, we conducted molecular modeling experiments using GOLD to dock tetrapeptide pNA substrates into the crystal structure of the WNV NS2B/NS3 protease (Protein Data Bank code 2fp7). The tetrapeptide substrate Ac-LKRR-pNA spanning P4-P1 had been previously identified (21Li J. Lim S.P. Beer D. Patel V. Wen D. Tumanut C. Tully D.C. Williams J.A. Jiricek J. Priestle J.P. Harris J.L. Vasudevan S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28766-28774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as optimal for dengue protease and, since we knew that WNV elicited a preference for Lys over Arg at P2, our docking studies began with the tetrapeptide substrate Ac-LKKR-pNA. Docking flexible molecules such as peptides into rigid solid state structures of proteases is notoriously difficult due to inadequate sampling of conformational space and insufficiently minimized docked poses (25Stoermer M.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 2: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and because GOLD does not allow for cooperative interactions or enzyme flexibility. To generate more valid docking results, hydrogen bonding and distance constraints were used to restrict the substrate to β-strand-like conformations that are more biologically relevant (4Tyndall J.D. Nall T. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 973-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 5Loughlin W.A. Tyndall J.D.A. Glenn M.P. Fairlie D.P. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 6085-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of WNV protease suggests that in addition to substrate-binding residues within NS3, residues within the NS2B cofactor also interact with substrate. Molecular docking (Fig. 2A) suggests that the P3 Lys side chain does not occupy a well defined S3 pocket in the enzyme but instead is largely solvent-exposed and binds in a shallow groove extending toward S1. This hydrophobic region is perhaps the reason that the four endogenous cleavage sequences contain a range of residues at P3 (Arg, Thr, Gly, and Leu). In all cases, there are hydrophobic elements in proximity to the main chain that are able to interact with the hydrophobic wall of the groove (e.g. Ile-155) as well as being able to accommodate both charged and polar side-chain termini directed outward into solvent. Asn-152 is hypothesized to be the S2 hydrogen bond acceptor of the P2 Lys side chain (7Nall T.A. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N.X. Tyndall J.D. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the opposite side of the substrate binding cleft to S2 is a hydrophobic surface patch consisting of Val-154, Met-156, and cofactor residue Leu-87. The hydrophobicity of these residues is highly conserved within the Flavivirus genus, and they most likely constitute one side of the shallow S4 pocket. The cofactor residue Gln-86 is observed in the crystal structure to participate in a hydrogen bond with the P3 Lys-NH3+ of an aldehyde inhibitor bound in an unusual conformation, but, since this residue is poorly conserved among the flaviviruses, the side chain is probably not important for substrate binding. Farther away, the cofactor residue Val-75 may make interactions with P5 or P6. However, it is difficult to predict how substrate might extend into and bind at this position. Also of interest is the cofactor residue Asn-84, which appears to make a hydrogen bond with the P2 Lys. This residue is semiconserved within the Flavivirus genus as either a polar or negatively charged residue (Asn, Ser, Thr, Asp, and Glu). Docking of 2-naphthoyl-KKR-pNA generally resulted in two docking poses. One had the bulky naphthoyl residue in the S1 pocket, resulting in a nonextended conformation reminiscent of the turnlike structure of the inhibitor aldehyde in the published crystal structure. The other had the aromatic residues interacting with hydrophobic enzyme residues at S4 but with some resultant steric clashes. Docking with GOLD used an explicit rigid protein method that is frequently inadequate for proteases, since they often display a high degree of active site plasticity (25Stoermer M.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 2: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this case, we took the docked poses where the 2-naphthoyl residue occupied the conventional extended conformation in the S4 site and used a combination of molecular dynamics and energy minimization to investigate possible induced fit binding modes. Fig. 2B shows one minimized docking pose where the small S4 pocket has been enlarged by a subtle movement of the side chains of Ile-155 and Val-154 in NS3 and Val-75, Val-77, and Leu-87 of NS2B. After these movements, the now slightly deeper S4 pocket is additionally defined by two residues (Phe-116 from NS3 and Phe-85 from NS2B) that make favorable aromatic-aromatic interactions with the naphthoyl ring. Regarding the orientation of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme, the model suggests that the carbonyl carbon of the substrate scissile amide was 2.5-2.8 Å from the catalytic serine hydroxyl and in an orientation reminiscent of a Michaelis complex, despite no explicit restraints being used to fix it. Following these substrate-docking modeling experiments, we prepared a number of site-directed mutants with residue substitutions in both NS3 and NS2B to test the predicted interactions. In parallel, we synthesized a library of chromogenic pNA substrates, designed around the optimal substrate used for our docking studies, and examined their processing kinetics by both wild type and mutant NS2B/NS3 West Nile Virus proteases. Cofactor-Substrate Correlations—The crystal structure of WNV NS2B/NS3 protease revealed that Asn-84 of the NS2B cofactor is within hydrogen bonding distance of the P2 Lys of the bound ligand. Asn-84 is located within a highly conserved region of the cofactor, the Gly residue on the N-terminal side is completely conserved, and the third residue on the C-terminal side is a highly conserved hydrophobic Leu or Ile. Although the residue homologous with NS2B Asn-84 in other flaviviruses is variable, it is always polar or negatively charged (Table 1). This is of particular interest, because there appears to be an association between this residue and either Lys or Arg at P2 in native cleavage sequences. An Asn residue is at this position in WNV and St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) proteases, corresponding to a preferred Lys at P2 of native substrates. However, in the proteases of all four serotypes of dengue, there is either Ser or Thr at this position matched by Arg at P2 in native substrates. The presence of Gln at P2 for one of the crucial cleavage sites (NS2B-NS3) suggests a requirement for a hydrogen-bonding pair and not a charge-charge interaction pair. Specific partnering between cofactor and substrate is also"
https://openalex.org/W2068186074,"The role of constraint in adaptive evolution is an open question. Directed evolution of an engineered β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IMDH), with coenzyme specificity switched from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), always produces mutants with lower affinities for NADP. This result is the correlated response to selection for relief from inhibition by NADPH (the reduced form of NADP) expected of an adaptive landscape subject to three enzymatic constraints: an upper limit to the rate of maximum turnover ( k cat ), a correlation in NADP and NADPH affinities, and a trade-off between NAD and NADP usage. Two additional constraints, high intracellular NADPH abundance and the cost of compensatory protein synthesis, have ensured the conserved use of NAD by IMDH throughout evolution. Our results show that selective mechanisms and evolutionary constraints are to be understood in terms of underlying adaptive landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2030226022,"von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to platelets under high fluid shear is an important step regulating atherothrombosis. We applied light and small angle neutron scattering to study the solution structure of human VWF multimers and protomer. Results suggest that these proteins resemble prolate ellipsoids with radius of gyration (Rg) of ∼75 and ∼30 nm for multimer and protomer, respectively. The ellipsoid dimensions/radii are 175 × 28 nm for multimers and 70 × 9.1 nm for protomers. Substructural repeat domains are evident within multimeric VWF that are indicative of elements of the protomer quarternary structure (16 nm) and individual functional domains (4.5 nm). Amino acids occupy only ∼2% of the multimer and protomer volume, compared with 98% for serum albumin and 35% for fibrinogen. VWF treatment with guanidine·HCl, which increases VWF susceptibility to proteolysis by ADAMTS-13, causes local structural changes at length scales <10 nm without altering protein Rg. Treatment of multimer but not protomer VWF with random homobifunctional linker BS3 prior to reduction of intermonomer disulfide linkages and Western blotting reveals a pattern of dimer and trimer units that indicate the presence of stable intermonomer non-covalent interactions within the multimer. Overall, multimeric VWF appears to be a loosely packed ellipsoidal protein with non-covalent interactions between different monomer units stabilizing its solution structure.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 3Wagner D.D. Olmsted J.B. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). This protein occurs both as a protomer and in multimeric form. The ∼500-kDa protomer consists of two identical monomer subunits linked at the C terminus by disulfide bonds. Linear multimers formed by cysteine-cysteine linkages near the N terminus result in a molecular mass of >10,000 kDa. VWF serves many functions. The binding of surface-immobilized VWF to platelet receptor GpIbα results in intermolecular bonds with high tensile strength (4Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 5Doggett T.A. Girdhar G. Lawshe A. Schmidtke D.W. Laurenzi I.J. Diamond S.L. Diacovo T.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 194-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This molecular interaction allows platelet capture at sites of vascular injury under high fluid shear conditions. The binding of plasma VWF to platelet receptor GpIbα under high hydrodynamic shear also leads to platelet activation and subsequent platelet arrest (6Kasirer-Friede A. Cozzi M.R. Mazzucato M. De Marco L. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Blood. 2004; 103: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Various mutations in VWF result in the bleeding defects that characterize von Willebrand disease (1Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In blood, VWF binding to pro-coagulation factor VIII increases factor VIII lifetime in circulation. Finally, the size of VWF and its response to fluid flow are key determinants in regulating protein function under physiological and pathological conditions. In support of this, the life threatening systemic illness thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is attributed to the presence of very large VWF multimers, which are caused by the malfunction or absence of a metalloprotease termed ADAMTS-13 (“a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin” family member) (7Levy G.G. Nichols W.C. Lian E.C. Foroud T. McClintick J.N. McGee B.M. Yang A.Y. Siemieniak D.R. Stark K.R. Gruppo R. Sarode R. Shurin S.B. Chandrasekaran V. Stabler S.P. Sabio H. Bouhassira E.E.

Nature. 2001; 413: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) VWF cleavage by ADAMTS-13 is enhanced both upon protein denaturation with guanidine·HCl (Gd·HCl) (8Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and upon application of physiological fluid shear (9Tsai H.M. Sussman II Nagel R.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2171-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies on VWF have been performed using two-dimensional electron microscopy (10Slayter H. Loscalzo J. Bockenstedt P. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8559-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 76: 1491-1500Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These studies show that multimeric VWF consists of a repeating protomer unit that has a maximum extended length of 120 nm (12Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 76: 1491-1500Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This protomer has 2-fold symmetry, with each half consisting of a long flexible 34 × 2-nm rod linked to a large globular 22 × 6.5-nm domain at one end and to a second rod at the other end. Using rotary-shadowed electron microscopy of VWF deposited on mica surfaces, it has been shown that whereas 87% of multimeric VWF adopt a “ball of yarn” or “tangled” conformation with a mean diameter of 100–150 nm, the remaining exist in an “extended form” with a mean length of 350 nm (10Slayter H. Loscalzo J. Bockenstedt P. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8559-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of VWF immobilized on different substrates further suggest that the VWF structure determined using microscopy depends on the surface on which it is deposited. On hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass, VWF exhibits a compact structure, whereas the molecule is more extended on hydrophilic mica (13Raghavachari M. Tsai H. Kottke-Marchant K. Marchant R.E. Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces. 2000; 19: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The detailed solution structure of VWF is yet to be determined. Whereas light scattering provides good estimates of hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and radius of gyration (Rg), this method does not provide detailed information on molecular shape (12Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 76: 1491-1500Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S.

Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Such data, however, only provide a static picture of individual domains and not the dynamic features of the full soluble protein. To address this gap in knowledge, we performed light and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies with human multimeric VWF isolated from plasma cryoprecipitate and recombinant protomer VWF expressed in mammalian systems. These methods probe protein structure over a wide length scale from 2 to 250 nm. Thus, they allow the simultaneous study of specific treatments on both the domain structure and overall protein shape. We observed that both multimer and protomer VWF exist as prolate ellipsoids with Rg of ∼75–100 nm and 30 nm, respectively. Structural studies with the denaturant Gd·HCl suggest that large scale changes in protein structure are not necessary for proteolysis by ADAMTS-13. Thus, fluid shear in previous studies (9Tsai H.M. Sussman II Nagel R.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2171-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may cause subtle rearrangement of VWF domains rather than unraveling the entire protein. Cross-linking studies with amino homobifunctional cross-linker BS3 (bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate) also reveal, for the first time, that VWF solution structure is stabilized by frequent interdomain interactions between residues located on different monomer units. Such interdomain interactions may be important regulators of VWF function in normal physiology and pathology. Materials—Polyclonal rabbit antihuman VWF was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Non-inhibitory anti-VWF mAb AVW-1 and A1 domain function blocking mAb AVW-3 were from GTI Diagnostics (Waukesha, WI). Polyclonal rat antifactor VIII antibody and recombinant factor VIII were kindly provided by Dr. Balasubramanian (SUNY-Buffalo). F(ab′)2 Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Denaturant Gd·HCl was deuterated by dissolving it in 99.9% D2O (Cambridge Isotope, Andover, MA) at 4 m and subjecting the solution to three cycles of evaporation using a vacuum oven, with resuspension in D2O at the end of each cycle (20Calmettes P. Roux B. Durand D. Desmadril M. Smith J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The final product, which is abbreviated Gd·DCl, was completely deuterated as determined by proton NMR spectroscopy (Varian Inova-500, Fort Collins, CO) and solid phase fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Mattson Galaxy series FT-IR 5000, Madison, WI). Multimeric human VWF was purified from blood plasma cryoprecipitate obtained from Community Blood Bank (Erie, PA) (14Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels confirmed that a unique protein was isolated. VWF Protomer (ΔPro-VWF) Expression—Full-length VWF contains 2813 amino acids including a 741-amino acid propeptide. Deletion of this propeptide results in dimeric ΔPro-VWF formation with protomer units linked by disulfide bonds at the C, but not N terminus (21Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To produce ΔPro-VWF for small angle scattering studies, cDNA was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) in the PMT-2-ADA vector. This construct was digested with EcoRI, and full-length VWF was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/Myc-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (VWF-pcDNA). VWF-pcDNA was then digested using BamHI, and the excised fragment of VWF was ligated into pBluescript sk(+) (Stratagene). The propeptide portion of VWF (residues Ala23-Arg763) was deleted in this vector by performing a PCR with 5′-phosphate sense 5′-AGCCTATCCTGTCGGCCtCCaATGGTCAAGCTG-3′ and antisense 5′-ACAAAGGGTCCCTGGCAAAATGAG-3′ primers. During this PCR step, silent mutations at C2307T and C2310A were introduced to facilitate primer design. The PCR product thus formed was purified and blunt end-ligated (del-BamHI-VWF-Blue). del-BamHI-VWF-Blue was digested with BamHI, and the VWF fragment was ligated back into the BamHI-digested VWF in pcDNA (ΔPro-VWF-pcDNA). Restriction enzyme digests were performed to verify correct orientation of insert, and the final product was sequenced. CHO-S cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with ΔPro-VWF-pcDNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were obtained by selecting with 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After selection, the antibiotic concentration was reduced to 0.5 mg/ml. Unique colonies were obtained by limiting dilution and were then scaled up for protein purification. The cultures were converted to protein-free CD-CHO media (Invitrogen), and the cell culture supernatant was harvested for ΔPro-VWF purification. A two-step procedure was used to purify ΔPro-VWF from CD-CHO culture medium. In the first step, anion exchange chromatography was applied using Fractogel® EMD TMAE (M) (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) and FPLC system from Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ) (22Fischer B.E. Schlokat U. Reiter M. Mundt W. Dorner F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This column was first equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Cell culture supernatant containing ΔPro-VWF was diluted 1:1 in 20 mm Tris buffer (final pH 7.2), and this was run through the column twice. VWF binding to column was verified by assaying negligible VWF concentration in culture supernatant following passage through ion-exchange column, using the flow cytometry-based VWF concentration assay described below. Following binding, VWF was eluted using 20 mm Tris buffer by increasing NaCl concentration in a stepwise manner from 150 and 260 mm up to 400 mm. VWF was observed to elute when 260 mm NaCl was applied. Fractions containing ΔPro-VWF were thus pooled. In the second step, Microsep™ 100-kDa cutoff centrifugal devices (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) were used to remove low molecular weight impurity. First a 15-fold concentration of the pooled fractions was performed. Following this, two more sequential cycles of centrifugal concentration were performed with ΔPro-VWF, with protein volume increased by 10-fold using 20 mm Tris buffer before each centrifugation step, and 10-fold concentration was accomplished. Fresh Microsep units were used for each centrifugal concentration step. Following the third and final centrifugal step, theoretically, >99% of the low molecular impurities should have been removed. Protein Concentration Determination—VWF concentration was measured using three methods. In the case of purified protein where concentration was high (>1–2 μg/ml), the Coomassie/Bradford protein assay kit (Pierce) was employed. In complex protein mixtures and at lower concentrations down to 50 ng/ml, VWF concentration was assayed using a flow cytometry assay. For this, mAb AVW-1 was covalently immobilized on 5.7-μm polybead-carboxylated microbeads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) using carbodiimide chemistry (23Xiao Z. Goldsmith H.L. McIntosh F.A. Shankaran H. Neelamegham S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2221-2234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These beads are called anti-VWF beads. Polyclonal anti-VWF mAb (Dako) was conjugated with FITC. Multimeric VWF protein standards were also developed for this assay based on measurement of protein concentration using the Coomassie protein assay kit. During each run, VWF (unknown samples or standards at varying doses) was incubated with 106 anti-VWF beads/ml for 20 min at room temperature, washed, and then l:20 (v/v) FITC-conjugated polyclonal anti-VWF was added to these beads. Following 20 min, the sample was again washed. FITC fluorescence associated with the beads was then measured by FACSCalibur flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) to quantify VWF concentration. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, this assay detected protein concentration down to ∼50 ng/ml, and sample readouts were linear over at least two logs (0.1–10 μg/ml). Quantitative amino acid analysis was further performed at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory (Texas A&M University), and results from this absolute measurement were used to calibrate both the Bradford and flow cytometry assays described above. Thus, the VWF concentrations presented in this article are based on amino acid analysis. Here, we observed that the Bradford assay overpredicts VWF concentration by ∼6%. The concentration of individual amino acids assayed using amino acid analysis was also within 10% of that predicted based on protein primary sequence. This is reasonable for a purified protein. Electrophoresis—Western blotting of VWF was performed using 0.6% agarose gel (14Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Silver staining of gradient (4–20%) SDS-PAGE gels was performed using Silver SNAP stain Kit II (Pierce). Densitometry analysis was performed using the Kodak 1-D software (New Haven, CT). In studies with BS3, the homobifunctional cross-linker was dissolved in Hepes buffer (30 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3) immediately prior to use. This was added to either 9.4 μg/ml or 47 μg/ml VWF at either 1 or 5 mm concentrations for fixed times. The reaction was then quenched using 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5) for 15 min, and disulfide bonds were reduced by adding 25 mm DTT (dithiothreitol) for 30 min. This was followed by Western blot analysis. Protein mass was estimated using fibrinogen, IgM, and ΔPro-VWF, in addition to ladders from Bio-Rad. Factor VIII Analysis—The function of the D′ domain in multimeric and promoter VWF was confirmed by measuring factor VIII binding to VWF. For studies with multimeric VWF, the amount of factor VIII bound to VWF during its purification from plasma cryoprecipitate was determined using a one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay using micronized silica as an activator (Organon Teknika Corporation, Durham, NC) and factor VIII-deficient plasma (Biopool International, Ventura, CA) as substrate. The assay was performed using COAG-A-MATE coagulation analyzer (Organon Teknika). Purified VWF samples or factor VIII standards were added to factor VIII-deficient plasma, and the clotting time was monitored. The factor VIII concentration in VWF samples was obtained by comparing the clotting time to those of recombinant factor VIII standards. To confirm that factor VIII binds recombinant ΔPro-VWF, a “sandwich-cytometry” assay was developed. For this, polyclonal rabbit antihuman VWF mAb was covalently immobilized on 5.7-μm carboxylate polystyrene beads using carbodiimide chemistry (23Xiao Z. Goldsmith H.L. McIntosh F.A. Shankaran H. Neelamegham S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2221-2234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Plasma VWF from cryoprecipitate (0.57 μg/ml) or ΔPro-VWF (1.53 μg/ml) were incubated with these beads (106/ml) along with either 10 μg/ml mouse anti-VWF mAb (clone AVW-3) and 1:200 polyclonal anti-mouse Alexa488-conjugated Ab to quantify VWF bound on beads; or with 7.5 μg/ml recombinant factor VIII along with 1:100 polyclonal anti-factor VIII rat antibody and 1:200 Alexa488-conjugated detection secondary Ab to quantify factor VIII associated with beads. Following 30 min of incubation in the dark, the sample volume was increased 25-fold, and binding of VWF and factor VIII to beads was independently determined using flow cytometry measurement based on Alexa488 fluorescence associated with beads. Control beads were prepared identically as above, except they lacked immobilized VWF. Fluorescence of controls was subtracted from sample fluorescence for data presented here. VWF-GpIbα Binding—The function of the A1 domain of multimeric and protomer VWF was measured by either assaying the ability of multimeric VWF to function in a shear-induced platelet activation assay (14Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or by measuring the binding of recombinant protein to platelet GpIbα under fluid flow conditions. The methods for the platelet activation assay are described elsewhere (14Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Here, multimeric VWF isolated from plasma cryoprecipitate was observed to behave similarly to native protein in human blood in terms of its ability to bind platelet GpIbα and activate platelets. For the binding assay, 9.4 μg/ml VWF (ΔPro-VWF or purified multimeric VWF) was incubated with 106/ml anti-VWF beads (described above) for 20 min. This resulted in VWF immobilization on polystyrene beads. Platelets isolated from human blood were labeled green using a FITC-conjugated anti-CD61/GpIIIa Ab (Dako) as previously described (23Xiao Z. Goldsmith H.L. McIntosh F.A. Shankaran H. Neelamegham S. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2221-2234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following this, 5 × 106 beads/ml were mixed with 15 × 106 platelets/ml in a cone-plate viscometer at a shear rate of 1785/s. Samples withdrawn at 60 s were analyzed using flow cytometry to measure percent bead-platelet adhesion, which is defined as percent of beads having at least one platelet bound to it. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed both using control beads without immobilized VWF and using function blocking anti-VWF mAb, AVW-3. Small Angle Neutron Scattering—Multimeric and protomer VWF were dialyzed three times against Hepes buffer (composition given above) that lacked glucose and that was made in 99.9% D2O. The goal of this dialysis was to remove residual hydrogenated material that can contribute to the incoherent scattering of neutrons. Detailed methods including instrument settings and data analysis protocols are provided under supplemental materials. A brief overview follows. SANS measurements were performed on the 30-m NG3 SANS spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (Gaithersburg, MD) (24Glinka C.J. Barker J.G. Hammouda B. Krueger S. Moyer J.J. Orts W.J. J. Apply Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 430-445Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). During experimentation, 0.094–0.28 mg/ml multimeric or 0.15 mg/ml protomer VWF was placed in the path of a 6-Å neutron beam at room temperature. In some runs, VWF was incubated with 1.25 m Gd·DCl for 4–5 h before SANS measurement. SANS experiments produce data that quantify scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the scattering vector, q. In general, q is a measure of instrument magnification (25Spalla O. Neutrons, X-Rays and Light Scattering Methods Applied to Soft Matter, 1st Ed. Elsevier, New York2002: 23-50Google Scholar), and it is defined as 4π/λsin(θ/2), with θ representing the scattering angle and λ the neutron wavelength. Because scattering angle (θ) is related to the macromolecule length scale under study, the I(q) versus q plot contains information on protein solution structure. The q range applied in our experiments allows study of proteins in the size range from 2–250 nm. SANS data were analyzed using three complementary approaches. First, VWF Rg was estimated by plotting 1/I(q) versus q2.206, and fitting data using the Calmettes approximation (26Calmettes P. Durand D. Desmadril M. Minard P. Receveur V. Smith J.C. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 53: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Only a few points at the lowest q range were used for this analysis because this analysis method is only valid when qRg < 4. The intercept of this plot yields 1/I(0), and Rg is obtained using Rg = (3 × slope/(0.359 × intercept))1/2.206. Second, the overall protein shape was determined by fitting the I(q) versus q data in the low and moderate q range, with the model of an ellipsoid using software available from NIST. Output parameters from this fit were the major and minor axis radii, ra and rb. The radius of gyration Rg was calculated using Rg = rb [(ν2 + 2)/5]0.5, and this was within 20% of the value obtained from Calmettes analysis. Finally, higher resolution fitting of data over the entire q range was performed using the unified equation (27Beaucage G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1996; 29: 134-146Crossref Scopus (813) Google Scholar). According to this, scatter arising from a complex morphology over a wide q range is the result of individual contributions from substructural elements that span a smaller q range. In this context, each structural level resembles a plateau at low q in the I(q) versus q plot followed by a power law decay at higher q (27Beaucage G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1996; 29: 134-146Crossref Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The scattering intensity at the low q plateau is defined by the parameter Gi (Guinier prefactor), the point where the decay begins is defined by Rgi (Rg of the ith structural level) and Pi (power law exponent) defines the decay-slope at high q. Gi is thus a measure of neutron intensity at the start of the ith structural feature, and it equals I(0) in the case of the first structural level. Depending on protein concentration and extent of VWF multimer formation, G for lower structural levels can differ between different VWF preparations. Pi contains information about the features of the substructure: 4 > Pi > 3 for surface fractals, Pi < 3 for mass fractals, and Pi > 4 for diffuse interfaces. Radii of consecutive structural levels (Rgi and Rg(i+1)) define the bounds of each structural level. Using a piecewise fitting algorithm described under supplemental materials, Gi, Rgi, and Pi were determined for substructures that form multimeric and protomer VWF. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed using a Brookhaven Goniometer (BI-200SM Ver.2.0, Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY) with a 514-nm laser and autocorrelator (model:BI-9000AT) (14Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These experiments yielded VWF hydrodynamic diameter distribution function on a volume basis. Statistics—All data are presented as mean ± S.E., except for SANS data where error bars represent S.D. Light and neutron scattering studies were performed with protomer and multimeric VWF. Efforts were undertaken to characterize the protein function so that structural results could be attributed to functional macromolecules. Functional Characterization of Protomer VWF (ΔPro-VWF)—For studies with ΔPro-VWF, this protein was expressed in stably transfected mammalian CHO cells. After scale up, the flow cytometry-based protein assay demonstrated that the cell culture supernatant of transfected CHO cells yielded ΔPro-VWF at ∼1.88 μg/ml. This was purified and concentrated to 150 μg/ml. Fig. 2A compares the Western blots for multimeric and ΔPro-VWF. As seen, ΔPro-VWF has a molecular mass of ∼500 kDa, which corresponds to the lowest mass band of the multimeric protein. Mutimeric VWF preparations had a size up to 20–30 mers as determined using densitometry. Silver staining and densitometry analysis of reduced ΔPro-VWF (∼250 kDa in Fig. 2B) demonstrated this protein was ∼93% pure. Lower density bands of 45 and 37 kDa were also present. The lower mass bands remain even after repeated centrifugal filtration, suggesting that these were non-covalently associated with VWF when the protein was secreted from CHO cells. Addition of DTT and SDS prior to electrophoresis likely resulted in their dissociation from VWF. There is a minimal contribution of lower MW proteins to ΔPro-VWF scattering data as discussed later. ΔPro-VWF was functional in terms of its ability to bind factor VIII (Fig. 2C). In this sandwich-cytometry assay, which independently measured the binding of VWF to anti-VWF beads and of factor VIII to VWF immobilized on these be"
https://openalex.org/W2034336813,"Recently, a novel 87-amino acid influenza A virus protein with proapoptotic properties, PB1-F2, has been reported that originates from an alternative reading frame in the PB1 polymerase gene and is encoded in most known human influenza A virus isolates. Here we characterize the molecular structure of a biologically active synthetic version of the protein (sPB1-F2). Western blot analysis, chemical cross-linking, and NMR spectroscopy afforded direct evidence of the inherent tendency of sPB1-F2 to undergo oligomerization mediated by two distinct domains located in the N and C termini, respectively. CD and 1H NMR spectroscopic analyses indicate that the stability of structured regions in the molecule clearly depends upon the hydrophobicity of the solvent. In aqueous solutions, the behavior of sPB1-F2 is typical of a largely random coil peptide that, however, adopts α-helical structure upon the addition of membrane mimetics. 1H NMR analysis of three overlapping peptides afforded, for the first time, direct experimental evidence of the presence of a C-terminal region with strong α-helical propensity comprising amino acid residues Ile55-Lys85 connected via an essentially random coil structure to a much weaker helix-like region, located in the N terminus between residues Trp9 and Lys20. The C-terminal helix is not a true amphipathic helix and is more compact than previously predicted. It corresponds to a positively charged region previously shown to include the mitochondrial targeting sequence of PB1-F2. The consequences of the strong oligomerization and helical propensities of the molecule are discussed and used to formulate a hypothetical model of its interaction with the mitochondrial membrane.

In the last century, it was the origin of at least three pandemics, the most serious outbreak being the “Spanish flu” (1918-1919) that claimed 20-50 million casualties worldwide (for a review, see Ref. 1Lamb R.A. Takeda M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Apart from various mammals, IAV also infects avian hosts, and particularly aquatic birds have been shown to be the primary reservoir. Sporadically, some of these avian strains acquire the capability to infect other mammals or humans either as a whole or more likely upon genetic reassortment with prevailing human IAV strains. This process termed antigenic (viral) shift appears to occur via the pig as an intermediate host and “mixing vessel” and can lead to new IAV subtypes of mixed surface antigens (2Webster R.G. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1997; 13: 105-113PubMed Google Scholar, 3Webby R.J. Webster R.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).The genome of IAV, a representative of the orthomyxoviruses, consists of eight separate linear segments of negative sense RNA and was thought to encode 10 gene products. Only very recently, while screening for major histocompatibility complex class I epitopes derived from out-of-frame viral polypeptides, an 11th IAV gene product, named PB1-F2, was incidentally discovered (4Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Like the two proteins M1 (matrix protein) and M2 (ion channel) encoded on the M gene segment and the two nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 encoded on the NS gene segment, respectively, PB1-F2 was found to be expressed as a second protein from the PB1 (RNA polymerase basic protein 1) gene segment. In contrast to NS2 and M2, which are derived from spliced mRNAs, PB1-F2 is the only influenza A virus protein that originates from an alternative (+1) open reading frame of the PB1 gene. PB1-F2 was characterized as an 87-amino acid residue protein and originally discovered for IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1), also termed IAVPR8. However, whereas the pb1-f2 open reading frame was identified in the majority of analyzed IAV subtypes, it is not present in the influenza B virus genus (4Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).A major part of IAV replication occurs in the nucleus, where viral RNA is produced through the concerted action of three polymerase subunits (polymerase acidic protein, PB1, and PB2), together with the nucleoprotein. At a late stage of infection, M1 and NS2 proteins enter the nucleus, where, among other functions, they induce the shutdown of viral RNA synthesis and promote the export of newly assembled cores through the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where progeny virions bud from the membrane (reviewed in Ref. 5Neumann G. Brownlee G.G. Fodor E. Kawaoka Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 283: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). IAV infection generally activates several host cell antiviral mechanisms that are in part counteracted by accessory IAV proteins, like the NS1 protein that is involved in the inhibition of type I interferon response (6Garcia-Sastre A. Egorov A. Matassov D. Brandt S. Levy D.E. Durbin J.E. Palese P. Muster T. Virology. 1998; 252: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 7Garcia-Sastre A. Virology. 2001; 279: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 appears to represent another tool by which IAV regulates the host's immune response to virus infection (4Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). It is assumed that PB1-F2 removes host immune cells responding to IAV infection either by functioning as an endogenously expressed apoptosis stimulator in infected cells or in an exogenous form when the protein is released from infected cells or from disintegrated virus particles similar to the function of the proapoptotic human immunodeficiency virus-1 protein Vpr (8Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U. Licha K. Kopp J. de Noronha C.M. Greene W.C. Wray V. Schubert U. J. Biol.

Res. 2005; 121: 270-286PubMed Google Scholar).With the goal of understanding the molecular mechanism involved in the biological function of the regulatory IAV protein PB1-F2, we describe here the first structural characterization of the molecule derived from the IAVPR8 isolate. Although the molecule investigated exhibits a high degree of flexibility in pure aqueous environment, PB1-F2 adopts extended α-helical structures in the presence of organic solvents that mimic the membrane environment. According to high resolution NMR data, PB1-F2 consists of two independent structural domains, two closely neighboring short helices at the N terminus, and an extended C-terminal helix. Both helical domains are connected by a flexible and unstructured hinge region. Furthermore, we observed that the PB1-F2 molecule has an intrinsic strong propensity to form oligomeric structures, a characteristic that supports the recent observation that the molecule can form membrane pores in planar lipid bilayers (10Chanturiya A.N. Basanez G. Schubert U. Henklein P. Yewdell J.W. Zimmerberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6304-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The major oligomerization domain is located in the C-terminal helix, whereas both N- and C-terminal domains exhibit separate oligomerization capacity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis and Purification—The synthesis, purification, and molecular characterization of sPB1-F2 and the three related fragments PB-(1-40), PB-(30-70), and PB-(50-87) derived from influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) (isolate IAVPR8) (4Chen W.

Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of the protein and related peptides were recorded at room temperature and a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 0.5-mm cuvettes on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in a wavelength range from 260 to 180 nm at various TFE concentrations as described previously (8Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U. Licha K. Kopp J. de Noronha C.M. Greene W.C. Wray V. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32016-32026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resulting curves were smoothed using a high frequency filter, and secondary structure elements were quantified by deconvoluting the measured ellipticity using the DICROPROT 2000 program.1H NMR Spectroscopy—One- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded at various temperatures between 293 and 323 K on a Bruker Avance DMX 600 NMR spectrometer using a triple resonance probe head with a gradient unit. sPB1-F2 was dissolved at a concentration of 1 mm (10 mg/ml) without pH adjustment in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and in 50 and 90% aqueous TFE-d2 to give final volumes of 600 μl. Spectra of the fragments, PB-(1-40), PB-(30-70), and PB-(50-87), were recorded in 50% aqueous TFE-d2 at 300 K of 2 mm solutions. Spectra were referenced to either the water signal or to the residual TFE-d2 signal at 3.95 ppm. Two-dimensional measurements without spinning were accumulated with mixing times of 110 ms for the TOCSY and 250 ms for the NOESY spectra, respectively. Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics INDY work station using XWIN-NMR 1.3. The percentages of the proline cis-isomer content were determined from comparison of resolved signal intensities in the spectra of PB-(30-70) and PB-(50-87) and the small 10-mer peptides PB-(3-12) and PB-(23-32).The unambiguous amino acid spin systems, sequential assignments, and final nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) of the three fragments were established using a standard procedure (12Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 13-19Google Scholar) that has been used by us previously (13Bruns K. Fossen T. Wray V. Henklein P. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43188-43201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The complete signal assignments and 1H chemical shifts of PB-(1-40), PB-(30-70), and PB-(50-87) have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank under accession numbers 7289, 7290, and 7258, respectively.The volumes of the integrated cross-peaks from the NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 250 ms of PB-(50-87) were determined and converted to interproton distances by calibration against the side chain Gln or Asn amide protons (0.19 nm) using the AURELIA 2.7.9 program (14Neidig K.P. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 155-160Google Scholar). Structures were then generated using the standard protocol embodied in the CNS-solve 1.0 software package starting from an extended peptide backbone as described previously (13Bruns K. Fossen T. Wray V. Henklein P. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43188-43201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 20 structures with the lowest energy terms were chosen for the final analysis. Structure fitting criteria were objectively derived using a consecutive segment approach described by us previously (15Blankenfeldt W. Nokihara K. Naruse S. Lessel U. Schomburg D. Wray V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Final structures were displayed and manipulated on an Silicon Graphics OCTANE-work station using the program BRAGI (16Schomburg D. Reichelt J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 161-165Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structure superposition was performed with the same program and r.m.s. deviations for the regions of interest were calculated using LSQMAN (Uppsala Software Factory). The final structure of PB-(50-87) has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code 2HN8 and RCSB ID RCSB038537.Chemical Cross-linking of sPB1-F2 and Detection by Western Blotting—For chemical cross-linking, sPB1-F2 and the overlapping fragments PB-(1-40), PB-(30-70), and PB-(50-87) were incubated at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline, usually at a final protein concentration of 5 μg/ml, with varying concentrations of different cross-linkers: bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce), ethylene glycol disuccinate di(N-succinimidyl)ester (Pierce), glutaraldehyde (Pierce), and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce). After 30 min, the cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of glycine and 10 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol in 65 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8). The samples were denatured (5 min, 95 °C) and subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Following electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were stained by Western blotting using anti-sera (anti-FL) raised in rabbits against the full-length molecule sPB1-F2 as described previously (11Henklein P. Bruns K. Nimtz M. Wray V. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To follow the oligomerization of sPB1-F2 by Coomassie staining, the peptide was incubated at room temperature in PBS to a final protein concentration of 250 μg/ml. DSS was added at a 2- or 20-fold molar ratio, respectively. After 30 min, the reaction was quenched using glycine at a final concentration of 25 mm. The cross-linking samples were boiled in SDS buffer (0.2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 65 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, with or without 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min, at 55 °C, and separated by electrophoresis in a 15% SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining (0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 10% acetic acid, 25% isopropyl alcohol), the gel was destained (25% methanol, 10% acetic acid), and processed for imaging.RESULTSsPB1-F2 Has a Strongly Environmentally Dependent Secondary Structure—As a prerequisite for structural and functional studies on the small IAV regulatory protein PB1-F2, we have established solid phase peptide synthesis protocols for the production of milligram amounts of full-length synthetic (s) peptide, sPB1-F2, and several fragments thereof on a routine basis in highly pure and biologically active form (4Chen W.

Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence of the sPB1-F2 molecule used in the present investigation corresponds to the strain IAVPR8 (4Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat.

Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although relatively small quantities of PB1-F2 have been produced by recombinant methods as a GST fusion protein (17Zamarin D. Garcia-Sastre A. Xiao X. Wang R. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 40-54Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), large scale production of recombinant PB1-F2 sufficient for structural studies is difficult both because of its inherent tendency for aggregation and interactions with hydrophobic components of the producer cell as well as its cytotoxicity causing altogether low expression levels. Here we have used our synthetic material to investigate the oligomerization and structure of PB1-F2. Based on secondary structure prediction, the molecule was subdivided into three similarly sized domains, and three overlapping fragments were synthesized, comprising the 40 N-terminal residues (PB-(1-40)), the central residues (PB-(30-70)), and the 38 C-terminal residues (PB-(50-87)) (11Henklein P. Bruns K. Nimtz M. Wray V. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although no clear structure was calculated for the N terminus, strong helical regions were predicted for the central and particularly the C-terminal domain (11Henklein P. Bruns K. Nimtz M. Wray V. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Gibbs J.S. Malide D. Hornung F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7214-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1.Self-association of sPB1-F2 Is Regulated by Disulfide Bond Formation and by Two Distinct Oligomerization Domains— The first evidence for self-association of sPB1-F2 originates from our previous studies demonstrating oligomers of sPB1-F2, or the viral counterpart expressed in IAVPR8-infected cells, that were detected without any chemical fixation even under denaturating conditions of the SDS-PAGE (11Henklein P. Bruns K. Nimtz M. Wray V. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further, it was shown that sPB1-F2 induces pore formation in planar lipid bilayers, a characteristic of membrane-interacting proteins that tend to form oligomeric structures (10Chanturiya A.N. Basanez G. Schubert U. Henklein P. Yewdell J.W. Zimmerberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6304-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the existence of oligomeric structures of sPB1-F2 is now provided by chemical cross-linking. In a first set of experiments, the peptide was exposed to various chemical cross-linkers, which clearly resulted in the fixation of a ladder of high molecular weight complexes with pronounced signals in the molecular weight range of dimers to pentamers. In Fig. 2A, the results are shown for exposure of sPB1-F2 to increasing concentrations, ranging from 10-3- to 103-fold molar excess, of the cross-linking reagents bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, ethylene glycol disuccinate di(N-succinimidyl)ester, glutaraldehyde, and DSS. The most effective stabilization of oligomers was achieved with DSS and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, where trimers were stabilized starting at a 10-1-fold molar excess of the cross-linking reagent, whereas dimers were observed for all cross-linkers used, even at their lowest concentration.FIGURE 2Oligomerization of PB1-F2. A, 100 ng of sPB1-F2 was subjected to cross-linking with increasing concentrations of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), ethylene glycol disuccinate di(N-succinimidyl)ester (EGS), glutaraldehyde (GA), and DSS, ranging from 103- to 10-3-fold molar excess (lanes a-g). Half of each cross-linking reaction was resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with anti-FL antibodies. B, N- and C-terminal fragments, PB-(1-40) and PB-(50-87), were cross-linked with varying concentrations of DSS as in A and detected by Western blot using anti-N for PB-(1-40) and anti-FL for PB-(50-87). In the lower panel of the PB-(50-87) section, 50 ng of peptide was separated per lane, whereas 25 ng of peptide was separated in all other lanes in B. It should be noted that at the highest cross-linker concentrations, extremely high molecular weight complexes are formed that cannot be further resolved in the gel system, thus reducing the detection of the cross-linked peptides in the high molecular weight range. C, 0.1-1μg of PB-(1-40) or PB-(50-87) was cross-linked with one molar excess of DSS, resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE, and stained in Western blot as for B. Increasing concentrations of PB-(1-40) (D) or PB-(50-87) (E) were mixed with 100 ng of sPB1-F2 and subjected to the cross-linking reaction with an equimolar ratio of DSS and stained in Western blot with anti-FL. Evidence of hetero-oligomers formed between sPB1-F2 and the fragments are marked by arrows. Monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of sPB1-F2 are marked with asterisks. F, 100 ng of sPB1-F2 were treated with a 2-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (DTT) and then subjected to the cross-linking reaction with an equimolar ratio of DSS, resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE, and stained in Western blot with anti-FL. For control, the peptide solution was cross-linked without prior dithiothreitol treatment. G, 2.5μgof sPB1-F2 were cross-linked with 2- or 20-fold molar excess of DSS, resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions, and stained with Coomassie Blue.βME,β-mercaptoethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we investigated the oligomerization of individual fragments of sPB1-F2. According to secondary structure prediction, the N-terminal ∼40 residues are mainly random coil, whereas the C terminus has a high propensity for α-helix formation that should support protein interactions (Fig. 1). Indeed, we found that the C-terminal fragment PB-(50-87) displayed the highest capacity to form oligomeric structures when compared with the N-terminal fragment PB-(1-40). First, titration experiments similar to that shown for full-length sPB1-F2 (Fig. 2A) revealed oligomeric forms of PB-(1-40) starting at a 102-fold molar excess of DSS, whereas the oligomerization of PB-(50-87) was observed already at a 10-fold molar ratio (Fig. 2B). The formation of dimers (marked with an asterisk) was much more pronounced even at the lowest concentration of DSS for PB-(50-87) compared with PB-(1-40) (Fig. 2B). Further, using 1-molar excess DSS ratios, oligomers of PB-(50-87) were detected already at 100 ng of the peptide, whereas 400 ng of PB-(1-40) were required per cross-linking reaction in order to stabilize a similar pattern of oligomers (Fig. 2C).Similar cross-linking analyses were also conducted with the middle fragment, PB-(30-70). Although this fragment contains only one cysteine residue at position 42 and has the inherent capacity to form disulfide-linked dimers, it does not exhibit significant oligomerization capacity compared with the N- and C-terminal fragments (data not shown). Thus, the self-association of sPB1-F2 is mediated by both the Nand C-terminal domains, with the C-terminal domain showing a higher propensity for oligomerization than the N-terminal domain.In an additional set of cross-linking experiments, we investigated the interaction of individual domains of sPB1-F2 with the full-length molecule. Increasing concentrations of PB-(1-40) (Fig. 2D) or PB-(50-87) (Fig. 2E) were mixed with 100 ng of sPB1-F2 and subjected to the cross-linking reaction with an equimolar ratio of DSS with respect to sPB1-F2. Most strikingly, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal fragments caused significant changes in the pattern of the sPB1-F2 oligomers. In addition to the monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of sPB1-F2 migrating at ∼11, ∼23, and 34 kDa (Fig. 2, D and E, marked with an asterisk), hetero-oligomeric adducts of the full-length sPB1-F2 and the N- and C-terminal fragments were detected (Fig. 2, D and E, marked with arrows). The intensities of these hetero-oligomers clearly increased with higher concentration of the fragments PB-(1-40) or PB-(50-87) added to the cross-linking reactions (Fig. 2, D and E). In the case of the C-terminal fragment, the maximum formation of hetero-oligomers, consisting of sPB1-F2 and PB-(50-87), already occurred at 200 ng of PB-(50-87) (Fig. 2E), whereas ∼5-fold more of the N-terminal fragment PB-(1-40) was required to achieve the same intense hetero-oligomerization (Fig. 2D), further supporting the notion that the strongest oligomerization domain is located within the C-terminal region of sPB1-F2.In order to try to locate more specifically which residues are the underlying cause of this phenomenon, we have used the statistical mechanics algorithm TANGO, which identifies aggregation-prone regions of peptides and denatured proteins using a set of balanced physico-chemical parameters (19Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 20Pande V.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1240-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). According to the TANGO algorithm, a score of ≤0.02% indicates no aggregation, 0.02-5.0% indicates moderate aggregation, and ≥5.0% indicates high aggregation propensities. The application of this program predicted two regions of five residues populating the oligomerization state to more than 5% per residue, 54-58 (1.34-9.83% per residue) and 68-72 (93.01-97.25% per residue) under variable conditions. A further oligomerization domain was predicted with much lower scores (1.38-1.36% per residue) for the N-terminal region extending from residue 9 to 13. Thus, there is a good correlation between the predicted regions and the trends in the experimental cross-linking data with specific 5-residue regions being predicted to be responsible for the differences in the oligomerization behavior.Further, to analyze the potential of disulfide bridge formation by the single cysteine residue in position 42 of sPB1-F2, the peptide was studied in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to the cross-linking reaction. As demonstrated in Fig. 2F, the same pattern of oligomers was observed, albeit the formation of trimers and tetramers was slightly decreased under reducing conditions (Fig. 2F).In a further set of confirmatory cross-linking studies, we followed the oligomerization of sPB1-F2 directly by staining the peptide in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2G) as opposed to using antibody reactions. In contrast to the detection of oligomers of sPB1-F2 by Western blot (Fig. 2A), approximately a 100-fold higher concentration of the peptide was necessary for each cross-linking reaction in order to allow detection by Coomassie Blue staining. Nevertheless, a similar pattern of oligomers was detected, using various molar ratios of the cross-linking reagent DSS, when compared with those found above using the more sensitive Western blot analysis, suggesting that most of the possible oligomeric structures were reactive with the antibodies used in the above experiments (Fig. 2A). Clearly, at a 20-fold molar excess of DSS, high order oligomers of sPB-F2 were stabilized, most of which were barely separated in the higher molecular weight range of the SDS-PAGE. In gels lacking β-mercaptoethanol, sPB1-F2 forms stable dimers even in the absence of cross-linkers (Fig. 2G). Also, the extent of stabilization of dimers by cross-linking was more evident when the cross-linking reaction was resolved in the absence of reducing reagent, indicating that at least dimeric forms of sPB1-F2 were stabilized by disulfide bonds. In summary, our comprehensive cross-linking data provide compelling evidence that sPB1-F2 is a molecule with an unusually high propensity for oligomerization that in addition is capable of forming a disulfide-linke"
https://openalex.org/W2018680078,"The Hat1 histone acetyltransferase catalyzes the acetylation of H4 at lysines 5 and 12, the same sites that are acetylated in newly synthesized histone H4. By performing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assays on various synthetic H4 N-terminal peptides, we have examined the interactions between Hat1 and the H4 tail domain. It was found that acetylation requires the presence of positively charged amino acids at positions 8 and 16 of H4, positions that are normally occupied by lysine; however, lysine per se is not essential and can be replaced by arginine. In contrast, replacing Lys-8 and -16 of H4 with glutamines reduces acetylation to background levels. Similarly, phosphorylation of Ser-1 of the H4 tail depresses acetylation by both yeast Hat1p and the human HAT-B complex. These results strongly support the model proposed by Ramakrishnan and colleagues for the interaction between Hat1 and the H4 tail (Dutnall, R. N., Tafrov, S. T., Sternglanz, R., and Ramakrishnan, V. (1998) Cell 94, 427–438) and may have implications for the genetic analysis of histone acetylation. It was also found that Lys-12 of H4 is preferentially acetylated by human HAT-B, in further agreement with the proposed model of H4 tail binding. Finally, we have demonstrated that deletion of the hat1 gene from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe causes increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate in the absence of any additional mutations. This is in contrast to results obtained with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hat1Δ strain, which must also carry mutations of the acetylatable lysines of H3 for heightened methyl methanesulfonate sensitivity to be observed. Thus, although the role of Hat1 in DNA damage repair is evolutionarily conserved, the ability of H3 acetylation to compensate for Hat1 deletion appears to be more variable.

During replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are deposited onto newly replicated DNA by the chromatin assembly factor CAF-1 (1Polo S.E. Almouzni G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). H3 and H4 form a heterodimer prior to deposition in both cytosolic and nuclear chromatin assembly complexes (2Tagami H.

Notably, in species as divergent as humans, Drosophila, and Tetrahymena, newly synthesized H4 is acetylated in a conserved pattern at lysines 5 and 12 prior to its association with DNA (the sites are Lys-4 and -11 in Tetrahymena due to a deletion of the usual arginine residue at position 3) (4Chicoine L.G.

Tanphaichitr N. Chalkley R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The function of the acetylation of nascent H4 is currently unknown; however, when deacetylation is inhibited, newly replicated chromatin fails to mature properly (7Annunziato A.T. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12675-12684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A likely candidate for the enzyme that acetylates newly synthesized H4 is Hat1, a type B histone acetyltransferase found in virtually all eukaryotic systems examined (8Annunziato A.T. Hansen J.C. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 37-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hat1 is recovered in cytosolic extracts, but there is evidence that it also resides in the nucleus (9Richman R. Chicoine L.G.

In human cells, Hat1 functions as a member of the HAT-B complex, which also contains the small protein p46 (also known as Rbap46) (10Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) the p46 orthologue is termed Hat2p (11Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R.

Cell. 2004; 14: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Hat1p has been demonstrated to be important for the proper establishment of telomeric silencing and for the repair of damaged DNA; in combination with mutations of the acetylatable lysines of histone H3, deletion of HAT1 causes loss of telomeric silencing and increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent MMS 3The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; HAT, histone acetyltransferase. (19Kelly T.J. Qin S. Gottschling D.E. Parthun M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7051-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Qin S. Parthun M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8353-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that Hat1p is recruited to the sites of DNA double-stranded breaks, where it acetylates H4 at Lys-12 (21Qin S. Parthun M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3649-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is possible that Hat1p participates in gene silencing and DNA repair by acetylating H4 during localized chromatin assembly. The structure of Hat1p from S. cerevisiae has been solved, and a model has been proposed for the interaction of the H4 N-terminal domain with the catalytic site (there is as yet no Hat1p:H4 tail co-crystal) (22Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The H4 tail is postulated to lie in a shallow channel on the concave face of the enzyme. When Lys-12 of H4, i.e. the lysine that is most readily acetylated by yeast Hat1p, is aligned adjacent to the acetyl-CoA moiety, the lysines at positions 8 and 16 come in close proximity to two acidic regions on the surface of the enzyme (Fig. 1, top). It has therefore been proposed that electrostatic interactions between Lys-8/Lys-16 and the negatively charged patches serve to hold the H4 tail in place during the acetylation of Lys-12 (22Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we tested this hypothesis by performing in vitro HAT assays using variously acetylated H4 tail peptides. In support of the model, our results demonstrated that prior acetylation of the H4 tail at Lys-8 and -16 dramatically reduced the ability of recombinant yeast Hat1p and native human HAT-B to acetylate Lys-12 in vitro (24Makowski A.M. Dutnall R.N. Annunziato A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43499-43502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To further explore the interaction of the H4 N-terminal domain with Hat1, we have extended our analysis to include amino acid substitutions of the H4 tail at lysines 8 and 16. We found that the presence of lysine at these sites is not absolutely required for enzyme activity, but that a positive charge at Lys-8/Lys-16 is critical. Our results also implicate the N-terminal serine of H4 in the enzyme-substrate interaction. It is further demonstrated that Lys-12 of H4 is the preferred substrate for the human cytosolic HAT-B complex and that Lys-12 is typically acetylated prior to Lys-5 in generating diacetylated H4. Finally, in contrast to results obtained with S. cerevisiae,we have shown that hat1Δ Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells exhibit heightened sensitivity to DNA damage in the absence of concurrent mutations of H3 N-terminal domain. Peptide Synthesis, in Vitro HAT Assays—Custom 20-mer peptide synthesis, preparation of HeLa cytosolic extracts, and in vitro HAT filter-binding assays were performed as previously described (17Chang L.

Reaction times are given in the figure legends (see Figs. 2 and 3). In vitro peptide assays using recombinant yeast Hat1p (yHat1p) from S. cerevisiae were performed following a modified procedure of Kleff et al. (26Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) as described previously (yHat1p was the generous gift of Robert Dutnall) (24Makowski A.M.

Methods. 2004; 33: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In some cases, HAT assays were performed in the presence of 0.5 mm okadaic acid (e.g. to prevent the dephosphorylation of Ser-1 in phosphorylated H4 tail peptides). Okadaic acid did not interfere with HAT activity. Peptide dephosphorylation reactions were performed at 37 °C using 2–6 μg of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) per μg of peptide in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protocols for performing HAT assays on immobilized peptide substrates are given in detail elsewhere (25Benson L.J. Annunziato A.T.

Treatment was overnight at 4 °C; immunodepletion was monitored by Western blotting. HAT reactions used 100 μlof immunodepleted S100 extract, 1.5 μg of recombinant H4 (Upstate Biotechnology), and 10 μm unlabeled acetyl-CoA. We have previously shown that Hat1 is the only HAT activity detected in HeLa S100 extracts (17Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T.

The reaction proceeded for 2.5 min at 37 °C and was terminated by placing the tube for 5 min into a slurry of dry ice in 95% ethanol. H4 was recovered by acid extraction and precipitated using 25% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration); pellets were washed in acidified acetone (0.05 m HCl) and then 100% acetone and dried (17Chang L.

Antibodies used were as follows: anti-histone H4 acetylated on Lys-5 (1:1000 dilution; Serotec); anti-total H4 (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-histone H4 acetylated on Lys-12 (1:1000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology). Antibody specificity was verified by Western blotting of acetylated histones in the presence or absence of competing, variously acetylated, H4 N-terminal peptides; both of the anti-acetylated H4 antibodies strongly recognized Lys-5/Lys-12-diacetylated H4, as determined by Western blotting of histones resolved in Triton X-100/acid/urea gels. Deletion of the hat1 Gene from S. pombe—S. pombe yeast were routinely cultured on YEA medium (28Gutz H. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 92: 1567-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genotypes of all yeast strains used in this study are given in Table 1. The gene encoding the S. pombe Hat1 protein (SPAC139.06; Uniprot accession number Q9UTM7) was deleted using the PCR-based one-step gene replacement technique described by Bahler et al. (29Bahler J.

PCR primers HAT-forward (5′-ATGAGTGCTGTTGATGAATGGGTACATAATGCCAATGAATGCATAGAAATTGTACAAGTAAACGAAAAGCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′) and HAT-reverse (5′-AAGATTGAGCAAGTTTTTGGCGTTTTCGAGGCGAATCTTCCTTAAGCTTGGGTAGCTTTTTGACAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′) were used to amplify the kanMX6 selectable marker from plasmid pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6. This PCR product, containing ∼60 bp of sequence homology flanking the hat1+ gene, was used to transform a diploid strain (constructed by mating FWP2 and FWP39 and selecting for Ade+ diploid cells due to intragenic complementation of the ade6-M210 and ade6-M216 alleles) to G418 resistance. Deletion of the hat1+ gene was confirmed by PCR. Tetrad dissection of the diploid transformant resulted in a 2:2 pattern of G418 resistant to G418-sensitive progeny, indicating that the hat1Δ deletion progeny are viable. Diagnostic PCR of the progeny revealed that the PCR product associated with the hat1Δ deletion co-segregates with G418 resistance. The hat1+ gene was subsequently deleted from strain 975 (h+) by homologous recombination using a PCR product containing the hat1Δ::kan locus amplified from one of the G418-resistant progeny to create strains LBP6 and LBP7. This gene deletion was also confirmed by PCR analysis.TABLE 1S. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReference or Source975h+48Leupold U. Compt. Rend. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg Ser.

Acetylation by Hat1 Requires Positively Charged Amino Acids at Positions 8 and 16 of the H4 Tail—In a previous study, we determined that prior acetylation of H4 tail peptides at Lys-8 and/or Lys-16 significantly reduced the ability of both the human HAT-B complex and recombinant yHat1p to acetylate lysines 5 and 12 of H4 (24Makowski A.M. Dutnall R.N. Annunziato A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43499-43502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This was interpreted as supporting the model of the Hat1-H4 tail interaction proposed by Dutnall et al. (22Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); however, questions still remained concerning the requirement for (unacetylated) lysine at positions 8 and 16. One possibility was that a positive charge was itself sufficient and not lysine per se. Alternatively, it could be that lysine was uniquely required at these sites for Hat1 to recognize and acetylate the H4 tail. To test these alternatives, H4 tail peptides, containing either glutamine (to mimic acetylation) or arginine (to provide a nonspecific positive charge), were synthesized and tested in HAT assays using recombinant yHat1p. (It is important to emphasize that Lys-5 and Lys-12, the substrate lysines of Hat1, are unaltered in these experiments and thus remain potentially acetylatable.) The results are presented in Fig. 2A. Consistent with our previous results, substituting glutamine for lysine at Lys-8 and Lys-16 dramatically reduced the ability of yHat1p to acetylate the H4 tail peptide (Fig. 2, A and B). This confirms the importance of lysine and/or a positive charge at Lys-8 and Lys-16 for acetylation to occur. Surprisingly, substituting arginine at positions 8 and 16 resulted in acetylation as great or greater than that observed when the normal lysine residues were present at these sites (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained for the native HeLa HAT-B complex (Fig. 2C). These results provide additional support for the proposed model of H4 tail binding and help further refine our understanding of the Hat1-H4 tail interaction. Clearly lysine is not uniquely required at positions 8 and 16 for Hat1 to recognize and acetylate the H4 tail. Nevertheless, it is of considerable importance to retain positive charges at these sites. Involvement of Ser-1 in Acetylation of the H4 Tail by Hat1—In an early study of post-translational modifications of newly synthesized histones, it was suggested that new H4 may be phosphorylated at the N-terminal serine residue (30Ruiz-Carrillo A. Wangh L.J. Allfrey V.G. Science. 1975; 190: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of H4 at Ser-1 (31Utley R.T. Lacoste N. Jobin-Robitaille O. Allard S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8179-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine the effect of phosphorylation of H4 at Ser-1 on HAT-B activity. HAT assays were performed on an H4 N-terminal peptide phosphorylated at Ser-1 (Fig. 3A, S1P) (see supplemental Fig. S1 for a time course curve). Consistent with the findings of Utley et al. (31Utley R.T. Lacoste N. Jobin-Robitaille O. Allard S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8179-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) concerning NuA4, an H4 peptide phosphorylated at Ser-1 was a relatively poor substrate for human HAT-B. Dephosphorylation of the S1P peptide with alkaline phosphatase restored acetylation (Fig. 3A), whereas treatment with bovine serum albumin had no effect (data not shown). To determine whether phosphorylation of Ser-1 would affect the acetylation of Lys-5 or Lys-12 differently, additional HAT-B assays were performed on dimodified H4 peptides that were phosphorylated at Ser-1 and also acetylated at either Lys-5 or Lys-12 (Fig. 3B). As expected and in agreement with our previous results (24Makowski A.M. Dutnall R.N. Annunziato A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43499-43502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), prior acetylation at Lys-5 or Lys-12 reduced the incorporation of [3H]acetate by ≥50% (note that in these cases one of the Lys-5/Lys-12 substrate sites is already acetylated). Notably, phosphorylation of Ser-1 further reduced the acetylation of H4 peptides acetylated at Lys-5 or Lys-12 (Fig. 3B). Indeed, phosphorylation of a peptide already acetylated at Lys-12 reduced further acetylation by HeLa HAT-B to background levels, indicating that acetylation at Lys-5 was essentially eliminated under these conditions. Identical results were obtained with yeast Hat1p, although in this case acetylation of the Lys-12ac peptide was itself much reduced relative to acetylation by the human enzyme (a reflection for the strong preference of yHat1p for this site (Fig. 3C) (16Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 26Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To better visualize the effect of phosphorylation of the H4 tail on yHat1p activity, the results of Fig. 3C were replotted by setting acetate incorporation into the Lys-5ac and Lys-12ac peptides at 100% (Fig. 3D). From this it can be seen that phosphorylation of S1P dramatically reduced acetylation of the H4 tail by yHat1p at both substrate sites. Acetylation of Immobilized Peptide Substrates—It remained formally possible that the observed reduction in acetylation of the Lys→ Gln and S1P peptides was caused by a failure of these altered substrates to adhere properly to filters in preparation for scintillation counting. To eliminate this potential artifact, HAT assays were also performed on peptide substrates that were immobilized on agarose beads, as we have previously described (25Benson L.J. Annunziato A.T. Methods. 2004; 33: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immobilized peptides yielded results that were in full agreement with those obtained from conventional HAT assays (supplemental Fig. S2). It is therefore concluded that lysines 8 and 16 (and potentially Ser-1) of the H4 N-terminal domain can modulate the Hat1-H4 tail interaction. Order of Acetylation of H4 by Hat1—The human HAT-B complex acetylates lysines 5 and 12 of H4 exclusively (10Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 17Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine the order of acetylation of these sites, recombinant H4 was briefly incubated with HeLa HAT-B in vitro in the presence of unlabeled acetyl-CoA, and the reaction was rapidly quenched in a dry ice bath. The products were then separated in a Triton X-100/acid/urea gel (to resolve acetylated isoforms) and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies that recognize H4 acetylated at either Lys-5 or Lys-12 (Fig. 4). Lys-12 is the preferred substrate of human HAT-B. When approximately half of newly acetylated H4 was still monoacetylated at Lys-12 (Fig. 4, lane 7), acetylation at Lys-5 was observed predominantly in the diacetylated isoform (lane 3). Thus, Lys-12 is typically acetylated first by HeLa HAT-B followed by acetylation at Lys-5 to generate the diacetylated product. Scans of the Western blot indicated that there was an ∼3-fold preference by HAT-B for Lys-12 over Lys-5, in agreement with a previous analysis of maize HAT-B (18Kolle D. Sarg B. Lindner H. Loidl P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and consistent with the strong preference for Lys-12 by the yeast enzyme (16Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E.

As these paired Commentaries discuss, neuroscientists and architects are just beginning to collaborate, each bringing what they know about their respective fields to the task of improving the environment of research buildings and laboratories. At first glance the disciplines of neuroscience and architecture might appear to have little in common. Architecture traditionally has relied on observation and intuition rather than the experimental method and proof that constitutes neuroscience research. Yet advances in neuroscience are now able to explain the ways in which we perceive the world around us and navigate in space and the way our physical environment can affect our cognition, problem-solving ability, and mood. Thus, an understanding of the principles of neuroscience, particularly in the area of perception and spatial orientation, can inform the design of built spaces to include environmental features that minimize negative physiological, cognitive, and emotional effects (see the Commentary by Goldstein, page 243). For example, poor lighting renders edges difficult to discern, and lack of landmarks or presence of multiple choice points in the absence of visual cues triggers anxiety and a stress response. Jonas Salk was convinced of the importance of this crossdisciplinary understanding. In his legacy, Salk requested that neuroscientists continue to work with architects, just as he had done with the great 20th century architect Louis Kahn to design the Salk Institute, such that built work space would enhance creative ability (see Figure 1). No doubt Salk would be pleased to know that this year's Society for Neuroscience annual meeting opened with a lecture by the renowned architect Frank Gehry as part of the “Dialogues between Neuroscience and Society” series (see Figure 2).Figure 2Reflecting the Research WithinShow full captionMIT's Stata Center for Computer, Information, and Intelligence Sciences was designed by Frank Gehry with the goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaborations.

When one considers the factors that contribute to an environment we tend to think of the spatial features that define it, such as the configuration of prominent stimuli or landmarks and the paths that can be taken when moving through it. These characteristics influence both the form and function of an environment and each contribute to different aspects of spatial perception and memory. An intriguing finding in the neurobiology of spatial memory is the involvement of the hippocampus in navigation as well as in the formation and retrieval of memory of autobiographical events (Jeffery and Hayman, 2004Jeffery K.J. Hayman R. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 15: 309-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This intimate relationship between memory and sense of place is reflected in the observation that the hippocampus appears to be critical for both functions. Our memory of events may depend upon a strong sense of place, and by extension, our sense of place may be influenced by the integrity of the memories formed there. Thus, consideration of factors that influence memory may help to enhance architectural designs of research buildings, hospitals, and any space occupied by a community of individuals trying to navigate their way to a particular location. Our understanding of the neural basis of spatial perception and memory has been advanced by recordings of neural activity within the hippocampus as rats explore an environment. Such studies reveal that individual neurons respond when the animals move to certain locations in that environment, with different patterns of neural activity corresponding to different locations. Unlike neurons in sensory areas of the brain, these “place” neurons are not activated by any one type of stimulus, such as a visual feature, or a sound, or a smell, but rather by the combination of features that serve to define the animal's internal sense of place (Nakazawa et al., 2004Nakazawa K. McHugh T.J. Wilson M.A. Tonegawa S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). (Perhaps this is the neuroscience equivalent of what is known in architecture as the “haptic sense,” that is, an awareness of one's surroundings.) Place neurons are also dependent upon a strong sense of orientation within the environment, and different environments are associated with different patterns of neural activity. Because our sense of “place” may be defined by the activity of these neurons, understanding the factors that influence them may help to elucidate how we are impacted by architectural design elements. Although places are typically associated with spatial environments, the notion of a place differs from that of space with a critical difference being the requirement for interaction by the individual. The internal representation of a place is strongly influenced by the way in which an individual moves within it, with different places connected based upon the ability to move between them. For example, two locations separated by a glass wall may be physically adjacent in space (separated by a small distance), but the hippocampus will treat them as separate places because the individual cannot move directly from a location on one side of the wall to a location on the other. In this way, a glass partition, while allowing plenty of light, still provides a separation between one room and another. These barriers do not have to be physical. Factors that reinforce consistent paths of movement through an environment will also serve to separate the representations of place within the hippocampus. Hallways are an example of spaces that are typically navigated in two directions. Indeed, in animal experiments, each of those directions is represented by different patterns of neural activity—travel in each direction is effectively treated as a different environment with unique places within it. This can be extended to open spaces in which the design has individuals consistently traveling from one location to another, such as from a stairwell to a room or hallway. Environments that encourage free exploration will create representations of “place” that are not as strongly influenced by the paths taken through them. This phenomenon may be applied in the design of spaces that are intended to enhance a sense of being within the environment rather than a sense of just passing through. A central idea is that within an environment, a sense of place is defined by the way in which locations are connected through exploration or movement (the topology of the environment), and not simply by the configuration of the space itself (the topography of the environment). This emphasizes the benefit of architectural designs that address both the functionality of a space (topological characteristics), such as movement and usage patterns, and aesthetic elements (topographic characteristics), such as physical layout and form. A strong sense of place may result from the effective integration of these factors. The way in which visual landmarks reinforce a strong sense of place may depend upon the way in which they contribute to determining the location and orientation of individuals within an environment. Much like a compass keeps track of our heading relative to a global reference frame (absolute north), there are neurons in the brain that keep track of the direction that an animal is facing within an environment. These “head direction” neurons provide an internal sense of direction that, unlike a global compass, can change when an animal moves between environments (Taube, 1998Taube J.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 55: 225-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This internal compass can be updated by keeping track of self-motion information (such as visual flow), by tracking motor movements (such as footsteps), and by monitoring acceleration and deceleration through activity of the vestibular system of the inner ear. However, the advantage of visual landmarks is that they can serve to keep people “oriented” as they move within and between different environments, such as rooms or hallways. A sense of disorientation may stem from a difficulty in keeping track of heading within an environment and relating the orientation of one environment (such as a room) to another. Windows that provide access to external distant landmarks, such as identifiable buildings or other prominent features, are particularly effective in supporting this orienting system and in so doing provide stability to the spatial representations within the hippocampus, reinforcing a strong sense of place. Although prominent individual landmarks enable animals and ourselves to become oriented within an environment, it is the configuration of multiple cues, both distant and nearby (such as unique architectural design features or stationary decorations), that contribute to the evaluation of location within an environment. This can be used to define important spaces within an environment through the combined use of local cues and features. In learning paradigms in which rats are placed in milky water and swim to a hidden platform underwater, the presence of clearly discernable shapes on the wall around the pool facilitates their ability to learn the position of the platform (Schimanski and Nguyen, 2004Schimanski L.A. Nguyen P.V. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2004; 28: 463-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lack of such landmarks not only delays learning of the location of the platform but also activates the stress response. This stress reaction is recognizable to any who have found themselves in unfamiliar buildings, including hospitals and laboratory buildings, in which long hallways with no landmarks present multiple choice points, just the type of dilemma faced by a rodent in a maze. The role of prominent stimuli in an environment contributing to a strong sense of place is further supported by the observation that features that draw the attention of an animal contribute to the stability of representations of place within the hippocampus. Experiments that measure the way in which memories of places are formed during exploration of an environment and then later retrieved show that memory of place is not composed of isolated locations but rather sequences of connected locations (Lee and Wilson, 2002Lee A.K. Wilson M.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). By carefully considering the paths that will be taken by people moving within an environment, architects can incorporate design elements that allow these paths to be more readily navigated and remembered. Journeys through an environment can be described as routes involving travel between a series of locations. Those locations may be associated with particular cues that may serve as landmarks for segments of a route and can be used to direct paths when a choice must be made, such as turning left or right at an intersection. Landmarks or cues that are associated with this type of following of a route-based path are treated differently from distant landmarks that serve to orient both the individual and the representation of the environment. These landmarks can be closely associated with particular locations and can take the form of local decorations such as pictures, objects, distinct colors of a wall, or textures of a floor. Although such features do not contribute significantly to the sense of orientation within an environment, they do contribute to a sense of place as indicated by the consistency of neural activity in the hippocampus in the presence of such stimuli. By providing prominent local cues that serve to establish uniquely memorable routes, along with distant cues that strengthen a sense of orientation, the “memorability” of an environment can be enhanced, and hence a strong sense of place can be reinforced. In the field of rodent behavior, it is well established that crowding, sudden loud noise, bright lights, multiple choices, lack of landmarks, and new environments are all potent triggers of the physiological stress response (Bailey et al., 2006Bailey K.R. Rustay N.R. Crawley J.N. ILAR J. 2006; 47: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All of these features of the physical environment can activate both the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and the adrenergic component of the autonomic nervous system (Mormede et al., 2002Mormede P. Courvoisier H. Ramos A. Marissal-Arvy N. Ousova O. Desautes C. Duclos M. Chaouloff F. Moisan M.P.

Immunol. 2005; 5: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Studies using these environmental variables reveal activation of the stress response, including increased hypothalamic production of the stress hormone corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), increased pituitary gland secretion of adrenocorticotropin hormone, and release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. Similarly, there is also activation of adrenergic brainstem regions involved in focused attention and vigilance and adrenergic outflow sympathetic responses that govern heart rate. At a cognitive level, both acute and chronic stress are known to be associated with impaired problem-solving ability and increased error rates in decision making. Chronic activation of the stress response is also associated with suppressed immune responses resulting in health effects such as prolonged wound healing, a decreased antibody response to vaccination, and increased severity and frequency of viral infection (Sternberg, 2006Sternberg E.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). A rich neuroscience literature exists that can be mined by architects who wish to optimize the design of built space. Although these studies have not been performed with the goal of studying built spaces, environmental variables are routinely altered in such studies to identify neurobiological mechanisms and nervous system responses. Such studies provide information about features of the environment that trigger various neural and physiological responses that may induce a sense of comfort or anxiety. Architectural designs that take into account these principles of neuroscience are likely to enhance the creativity, cognition, and comfort of those occupying or working in such spaces."

https://openalex.org/W2028983248,"Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) is essential for signaling by the thrombopoietin (TpoR) and erythropoietin (EpoR) receptors. In the absence of JAK2 most EpoR molecules are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in an Endo H-sensitive form. In contrast, we show that in the absence of JAK2 a large fraction of the TpoR is processed to the mature Endo H-resistant form and reaches the cell surface. By studying chimeras of the TpoR and EpoR we show that high surface expression of the TpoR is entirely conferred by the membrane-proximal region of the intracellular domain that includes the juxtamembrane, Box 1, and Box 2 regions. The TpoR intracellular domain shows similar effects on receptor endocytosis rate as that of the EpoR, but does stabilize the mature receptor isoform from degradation. Co-expression of JAK2 further stabilizes mature TpoR and thus further increases its surface expression. This JAK2 effect depends on the Box 1 region, the only JAK2 interacting site in the TpoR. By contrast, EpoR requires Box 1 as well as the flanking 20 residues on the C-terminal side for JAK2 interaction and JAK2-dependent surface expression. Our study suggests that whereas cell surface expression of type I cytokine receptors requires their cognate JAKs, the mechanisms governing receptor-JAK interactions differ among receptors interacting with the same JAK protein."

Although crmA can also inhibit caspase-9 with high rate constant in vitro, this is not thought to be an important target in vivo (16Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S.

To better understand how crmA is used by the cowpox virus to abrogate apoptosis and inflammation, we have characterized the complexes formed between crmA and three caspases by SEC, PAGE, mass spectrometry, Western blotting, sequencing, and kinetic assays. The complexes studied are with the initiator caspase-8, the pro-inflammatory caspase-1, and the executioner caspase-6. We found evidence for the presence of a thioacyl intermediate in all three complexes, equivalent to the acyl intermediate formed in serpin complexes with serine proteinases. An unexpected finding was that complex formation appeared to cause dissociation of the caspase tetramer and loss of the small subunit from complexes with caspases 1 and 8. It seems likely that this tetramer disruption is an additional means of ensuring irreversible inhibition of apoptosis initiation or inflammation. The complex with the downstream executioner caspase-6, showed much less perturbation of the interface between the p10 subunits, which resulted in an equilibrium mixture of crmA2·(p20-p10)2 and crmA·(p20-p10) species. Expression and Purification of Caspase-1—Separate p20 and p10 subunits of caspase-1 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), harboring pET11a-ICEp20 or pET11a-ICEp10 as inclusion bodies in LB medium containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin (17Rano T.A.

Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, then further incubated overnight and harvested by centrifugation. Plasmids pET11a-p20 and pET11a-p10 were a gift from Dr. Kathy McCusker, Merck. Caspase-1 was refolded and purified as described by Thornberry et al. (18Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R.

Inclusion bodies of the subunits, separately solubilized in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mm DTT at about 3 mg/ml for p20 and 1.5 mg/ml for p10 were combined dropwise in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 30 ml of the solubilized subunits was added dropwise with gentle agitation to 3 liters of caspase-1 buffer (100 mm Hepes, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 10 mm DTT and 50 ml of Ac-YVKD-CHO (Bachem) coupled, according to Rano et al. (17Rano T.A. Timkey T. Peterson E.P. Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Becker J.W. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1997; 4: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B. Stirring continued overnight to allow the refolded caspase-1 to bind to the aldehyde inhibitor resin. The resin was then packed into a column and washed with 1 liter of caspase-1 buffer without DTT. Caspase-1 was eluted with 50 ml of 100 μm Ac-YVAD-CHO, which is a tighter inhibitor of caspase-1. The exchange reaction was allowed to proceed overnight, then caspase-1 buffer was applied to displace the eluted protein. Caspase-1 was simultaneously activated by adding 100 mm hydroxylamine (final concentration, pH adjusted to 7.5) and inactivated by adding 10 mm final oxidized glutathione (GSSG). After 4 h at room temperature caspase-1-SG (inactive glutathione adduct of caspase-1) was concentrated and dialyzed exhaustively against caspase-1 buffer to remove GSSG and hydroxylamine. Caspase-1-SG was stored at -80 °C in aliquots. The typical yield was 6-7 mg (about 4-5% of the applied inclusion bodies) pure and highly active caspase-1. Expression and Purification of Caspases 6 and 8—Caspase-6 (Mch2) and caspase-8 (FLICE) were expressed as one-chain His6-tagged proteins and purified as described (15Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). During the procedure they become processed into their respective two-chain forms. Caspase-8 contained a MGSSH6SSGLVPRGSHM peptide tag on the N terminus, which added a mass of 2295 daltons to the large subunit, p18 (Ser-217-Asp-374). The small subunit, p11 (Leu-385-Asp-479), had the unmodified sequence. Caspase-6 had a C-terminal LEH6 tag, which added a mass of 1065 to the small, p11 subunit (Ala-194-Asn-293). The large caspase-6 subunit carried the interconnecting propeptide on its C terminus after processing, with a mass of 19.67 kDa corresponding to the sequence Ala-24-Asp-193. Expression and Purification of crmA—The cysteine-free variant of crmA (all cysteine mutated to serine) was expressed and purified as described (19Simonovic M. Gettins P.G.W. Volz K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 1440-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, crmA inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at about 2 mg/ml. 20 ml of the solubilized inclusion bodies were added dropwise into 1 liter of ice-cold 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH7.4, dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 5.0, and passed through a 20-ml SP-Sepharose column. The pH of the flow-through, which contained crmA, was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 m Tris, applied to a 40-ml Q-Sepharose HP column, and eluted with a gradient of 150-350 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0. After concentration it was stored in aliquots at -80 °C. A variant containing cysteine at position 101 was labeled with fluorescein for fluorescent detection of crmA species in complex with caspase-1. Reaction of crmA and Caspases—crmA and the caspases were reacted at different molar ratios and in different buffers. The crmA + caspase-1 reaction was examined in more detail. We found that the buffer composition had little effect on the complex formation between pH 7-8 as long as the buffering compound was not a strong nucleophile. The optimal DTT concentration was found to be 10 mm. Higher pH favored a somewhat faster reaction, whereas lower pH favored a somewhat higher stability (data not shown). Typically, to a 20 μm solution of crmA in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Bicine, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1mm CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, pH 8.0, the respective caspase was added at 5 μm final concentration (activation of caspase1-SG by DTT and reaction with crmA happens simultaneously). The 4:1 molar ratio ensured an excess of crmA. After 2 h at room temperature the reaction mix was either placed on ice or frozen and kept at -80 °C until further treatment. Concentrations of crmA and caspases were determined from their absorbance at 280 nm, and extinction coefficients were calculated from the amino acid composition (20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—For preparative scale isolations, the crmA + caspase reaction mixes (20 μm crmA + 5 μm caspase in 0.1-2 ml) were applied to a Superdex 200 column (180 ml, 90 cm column for 0.5-2-ml samples) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate or 100 mm Hepes buffers containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1-0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7-7.5, and eluted with the same buffer at 0.25 ml/min. Peaks were monitored at 280 nm, and 5-ml fractions were collected and subjected to further analysis. For analytical and small-scale preparative purposes a smaller 24-ml Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (AP Biotech) was used (as in Figs. 1 and 5) in the same buffer. The applied sample was 100 μl; it eluted at 0.25 ml/min and was detected by protein fluorescence, with excitation at 280 nm and detection at 340 nm. The column was calibrated using myoglobin (17.6 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), IgG (160 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa), all from Sigma, in the same buffer without DTT.FIGURE 5Size exclusion chromatograms of reaction mixtures of excess crmA with caspases 6 and 8.

To isolate proteins from the native gel for MALDI-TOF MS analysis, the gel-slice, where the protein is expected to migrate, was cut out with a razor blade and extracted with 2 gel volumes of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Bicine, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, pH 8.0, overnight at 0 °C. The extracted protein was concentrated when necessary on a small spin column. The gel was stained afterward to ensure the proper cut. When only SDS-PAGE was performed with the isolated protein, the gel was stained first, then extracted with SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was done on 4-12% Bis-Tris Novex™ gels in combination with MES running buffer (separation range, 2-200 kDa) from Invitrogen. Fluorescein-labeled proteins were visualized using a Fotodyne UV transilluminator. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—1 μl of the protein samples (concentration range, 0.05-0.2 mg/ml) in their respective buffers was mixed with 1 μl of the matrix compound solution and analyzed on a Voyager-DE PRO (Applied Biosystems) spectrometer at the University of Illinois at Chicago Research Resources Center facility. The samples were made fresh or thawed on ice just before the analysis. Amino Acid Sequencing—crmA-caspase-1 complex samples were separated and purified by native gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot Cell for 1 h at a constant 100 V at 5 °C using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol buffer. Stained bands were cut from the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and sequenced by the Macromolecular Structure Facility at Michigan State University. Western Blotting—Proteins run as above (for sequencing) were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hoefer Scientific) for antibody detection. Western blots were developed using the Super Signal West Pico kit and CL-Exposure film from Pierce. After transfer the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked using 5% dry milk in PBS (20 mm NaPi, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.3), 0.3% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide overnight at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml BSA. The primary antibody for p10 was Oncogene Pan Caspase-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody, diluted 1/400. The primary antibody for p20 was Santa Cruz Biotechnology goat polyclonal anti-caspase-1 p20, diluted 1/1000. After extensive washing in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml BSA, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C. The secondary antibody for p10 was Cell Signaling anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase diluted 1/1000 in PBS/Tween 20/BSA. The secondary antibody for p20 was antisheep/goat Ig peroxidase from the Binding Site, diluted 1/10,000 in PBS/Tween 20/BSA. Membranes were washed twice using PBS/Tween 20/BSA and three times using PBS before development using the chemiluminescent substrate. Measurement of Regenerated Caspase Activity—For measurement of dissociation of in situ-formed complex, complexes were prepared in HSC buffer (100 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 20% sucrose, pH 7.5) plus 5 mm DTT at 25 °C with 0.1-2 μm caspase and a sufficient molar excess of crmA to completely inhibit the caspase, based on stoichiometric titrations of the enzyme with the inhibitor. After allowing enough time for the caspase to be fully inhibited, complexes were diluted >100-fold into fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrates (25 μm YVAD-amidomethylcoumarin (AMC) for caspase-1, 50 μm WEHD-AMC for caspase-6, and 50 μm IETD-AMC for caspase-8) in the above Hepes buffer without sucrose plus 5 mm DTT to concentrations of 0.4-12 nm. The initial rate of complex dissociation was then continuously monitored for up to 90 min from the parabolic increase in fluorescence due to substrate hydrolysis by active proteinase released from the complex, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively, as in previous studies (21Calugaru S.V. Swanson R. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32446-32455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Initial rates were measured by nonlinear least squares fitting of progress curves to a parabolic function and then plotted as a function of the complex concentration for at least three different concentrations of complex. The dissociation rate constant was determined from the slope of this linear plot. The extensive dilution of complex into substrate and the proportional relationship between the initial rate of complex dissociation and complex concentration ensured that a first order rate constant for complex dissociation was being measured, with no significant contribution of complex reformation due to any excess inhibitor present (21Calugaru S.V. Swanson R. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32446-32455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For measurement of dissociation from purified crmA-caspase complexes, complexes purified by size-exclusion chromatography (see above) were diluted into fluorogenic substrates, and complex dissociation was measured as above. Complex concentrations for purified complexes were measured from the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients for crmA and caspase subunits together with the determined composition of the complexes. crmA-Caspase-1 Complex Formation—Caspase-1 was incubated with an excess of crmA, and the mixture was fractionated on a previously calibrated Superdex 200 size exclusion column. The elution profile consisted of two major peaks (Fig. 1). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the tall, later-eluting peak was found to comprise unreacted and cleaved crmA (data not shown), whereas the early eluting peak was taken to be the complex of caspase-1 and crmA, even though it eluted at a position suggesting a size of ∼60-70 kDa rather than the ∼140 kDa expected for a crmA2·(p20-p10)2 species. This was confirmed by native PAGE (Fig. 2A), which showed that the purified complex migrated at the same position (Fig. 2A, lane 4) as the complex band formed by caspase-1 in the presence of excess crmA (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The complex band migrated at a quite distinct position from that of free caspase-1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or crmA (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The complex was examined first by SDS-PAGE and shown to consist of cleaved crmA, which gives the expected two bands at 34 and 4 kDa, corresponding to the portions of the serpin N- and C-terminal to the cleavage site, respectively, together with the p20 subunit of caspase-1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). The relative intensities of the 34-kDa crmA band and the caspase-1 p20 band were consistent with a 1:1 ratio and, thus, with each caspase-1 active site engaging one crmA molecule in complex. The p10 subunit of caspase-1, which stained quite well in samples of free caspase-1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), was almost undetectable in the purified complex. SDS-PAGE of fractions taken throughout the elution profile showed that p10 did not elute at a discrete position but, rather, was present at very low levels in many fractions, suggesting either aggregation in multiple oligomerization states or else a very weak equilibrium with the crmA-complexed p20 subunits. Presence of a Covalent Linkage between Caspase-1 p20 and crmA and Loss of the p10 Subunit—To independently confirm the loss of the p10 subunit from the crmA-caspase-1 complex and also to determine the nature of the crmA·p20 interaction, MALDI-TOF was run on the crmA-caspase-1 complex. Here the complex was isolated from the discrete complex band that is resolved on a native gel (see Fig. 2A). The most intense peak was at 53.88 kDa (Fig. 3A), corresponding to the sum of the larger crmA fragment and the p20 caspase-1 subunit (calculated 53.68 kDa). A peak of ∼40% intensity occurred at an m/z value of 58.12 kDa, which corresponds to both chains of crmA together with caspase-1 p20 subunit (calculated 57.91 kDa). Additional smaller peaks were observed that correspond to m/z values expected for cleaved crmA (both chains, 37.98 kDa; calculated, 37.95 kDa), cleaved crmA (N-terminal fragment, 33.77; calculated, 33.72), caspase-1 p20 (20.18 kDa; calculated, 19.98 kDa), and a small peak for caspase-1 p10 (10.27 kDa, calculated 10.24). No significant peaks at m/z higher than the 58.12 peak were seen. The appearance of pairs of peaks for species containing RCL-cleaved crmA is the same as seen for cleaved crmA itself (Fig. 3B). Species corresponding to z = 2 for complex and for cleaved crmA are also detectable in Figs. 3, A and B. Although absolute amounts of each species cannot be calculated directly from such a spectrum, the inverse relationship between molecular size and peak intensity that reflects the difficulty of vaporizing larger species allows a crude estimate to be made of relative amounts of different species. Thus, free caspase-1 gave a peak for the p10 subunit approximately twice as intense as for the p20 subunit even though both were present in equimolar amounts (Fig. 3C). The dominance of the highest m/z peak of crmA + p20 in Fig. 3A, thus, suggests that nearly all of the p20 subunit is very tightly associated with crmA, consistent with the presence of a covalent thioester linkage between the p20 and the larger N-terminal crmA fragment. That the p10 subunit is not present in the complex rather than simply too weakly associated to give higher m/z species is shown by the negligible intensity for free p10 and the absence of higher m/z peaks corresponding to the presence of both p20 and p10 in complex with crmA (Fig. 3A). Caspase-1 alone shows some evidence for the ability of p20 and p10 subunits to remain associated during analysis (Fig. 3C). MALDI-TOF of crmA-caspase-1 complex isolated from SEC gave essentially the same results as for complex isolated from the separate band on a native gel (data not shown). Western Blotting and Amino Acid Sequencing of the crmA-Caspase-1 Complex—Two additional approaches were used to confirm the composition of the crmA-caspase-1 complex. Western blotting of reaction mixtures of crmA and caspase-1 using specific anti-caspase-1-p10 and anti-caspase-1-p20 antibodies showed that the complex contained p20 but not p10 subunits (Fig. 4, A and B). Demonstration that the complex contained crmA was carried out using fluorescein-labeled crmA for the reaction (Fig. 4C). Finally, N-terminal sequencing of the complex, extracted from the native gel, was performed and confirmed the presence of caspase-1 p20 (PAMPT) and of the two crmA chains (the original N terminus of MDIFRE and the additional new N terminus from RCL cleavage at P1-P1′ DS of SASTVT) but not of the caspase-1 p10 peptide. A control sequence determination of caspase-1 gave both expected sequences for the p20 (PAMPT) and p10 (AIKKA) subunits. crmA-Caspase-8 Complex Formation—Size exclusion chromatography of an incubation mixture of caspase-8 with an excess of crmA gave similar results to those with caspase-1 and crmA. The early eluting peak appeared at a position consistent with a species of ∼60-80 kDa rather than ∼140 kDa (Fig. 5A). Native PAGE of crmA-caspase-8 reaction mixtures showed a similar shift in band position as seen with caspase-1, corresponding to complex formation (Fig. 6A). The residual intensity of unreacted caspase-8 resulted from the presence of about 50% inactive caspase, since reactions at different crmA-caspase-8 ratios, but with constant amount of caspase-8, showed the same amount of complex formation (data not shown). Complex excised from the native gel and run on SDS-PAGE showed the presence of cleaved crmA and of the larger, p18, subunit of caspase-8 but with very little detectable intensity for the smaller, p11, caspase-8 subunit (Fig. 6B). The relative intensities were again consistent with the presence of equimolar amounts of crmA and caspase-8 p18 subunit. MALDI-TOF analysis of this complex isolated from the native gel showed similar intense peaks for crmA-caspase-8 p18 complex without and with the crmA C-terminal 4-kDa peptide, indicating that the complex was composed of p18 covalently linked by thiol ester to the major N-terminal portion of crmA (Fig. 7). Although there is also a somewhat larger peak for p11 than found for the p10 peak of caspase-1, this is still much less intense than expected if p11 were present in a similar molar ratio to crmA (compare with MALDI-TOF of crmA-caspase-6 complex; Fig. 9).FIGURE 9MALDI-TOF of crmA-caspase-6 complex isolated from SEC. The spectrum of complex from peak 2 (Fig. 4B) is shown here. Note that p11 is now by far the largest peak, in contrast to complexes with caspase-1 (Fig. 3A) and caspase-6 (Fig. 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) crmA-Caspase-6 Complex Formation—The complex formed between caspase-6 and crmA behaved differently from those of caspases 1 and 8 on size exclusion chromatography.

Phosphoryl transfer is an important biochemical reaction involved in numerous critical physiological processes in life. It is thought that the catalyzed reaction occurs by nucleophilic attack on the reaction center phosphorus, for which an “in line” mechanism is believed to be the most likely (1Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), although an adjacent mechanism has been suggested to be a possibility in some cases (2Lowe G. Cullis P.M. Jarvest R.L.

The in line mechanism describes a continuum between two extremes, associative and dissociative mechanisms. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) 2The abbreviations used are: BPGM, bisphosphoglycerate mutase; BPG, bisphosphoglycerate; dPGM, cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase; PGA, phosphoglycerate. and cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM) are tri-functional enzymes, catalyzing a series of intermolecular phosphoryl group transfer reactions (3Fothergill-Gilmore L.A.

The structure of the dPGM from Escherichia coli in complex with its vanadate inhibitor modeled the monophosphoglycerate and bisphosphoglycerate binding (9Bond C.S. White M.F. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, this model is inconsistent with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae dPGM/3-PGA complex structure, although the electron density for the 3-PGA in this structure is very poor (19Crowhurst G.S. Dalby A.R. Isupov M.N. Campbell J.W. Littlechild J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus the model of substrate binding and the roles of active site residues as well as the possible conformational changes during the catalysis have remained a mystery. Here we present the crystal structures of human BPGM binding with 2,3-BPG, 3PGA + AlF4-, or 3-PGA as well as the equilibrated structures of phosphorylated BPGM and BPGM binding with 2,3-BPG. We observed that the process of histidine phosphorylation in human BPGM was dramatically slowed down under crystallization conditions so that each step of the reaction had been captured. The series of structures reveal the stepwise conformational changes of the enzyme during the reaction. The nucleophile histidine moved back and forth to access the substrate and catch the phosphoryl group, whereas the substrate remained relatively still. The expression and purification of human BPGM were performed as described previously (8Wang Y. Wei Z. Bian Q. Cheng Z. Wan M. Liu L. Gong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39132-39138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Three conditions were used to obtain BPGM·substrate complex crystals. Condition A: protein sample (30 mg/ml) was mixed with 2,3-BPG at a 1:20 molar ratio; the reservoir solution was 22-24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Condition B: as for condition A but with a pH value of 8.0 and at 16 °C. Condition C: protein sample (30 mg/ml) was mixed with NaF, AlCl3, and 3-PGA at a 1:30:10:10 molar ratio. All crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without any cryoprotectant. The diffraction data were collected at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility equipped with a Mar CCD detector, flash cooled with liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Diffraction data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to space group P212121 with similar unit cell parameters. There was a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The mode of dimerization was the same as in free BPGM, indicating that the dimer was a physiological one. The crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement using the free BPGM structure (Protein Data Bank code 1T8P) as the search model and were refined with the non-crystallography symmetry restraint using the crystallography NMR software package (21Brunger A.T.

The quality and stereochemistry of the final models were analyzed with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Valenti M. J. of Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In the Ramachandran plots of all structures, more than 91.8% of the residues are located in the most-favored regions, and only Ser-24 is located in the general allowed region as in the free BPGM structure (8Wang Y.

Open table in a new tab Structure of BPGM Bound with a 2,3-BPG before Reaction—To obtain the BPGM·substrate complex structure, we co-crystallized human BPGM with 2,3-BPG at 4 °C and at room temperature (crystallization condition A). In the crystal grown at 4 °C, the electron density clearly shows the presence of a 2,3-BPG molecule (Fig. 1A, structure 1). The Nϵ-2 atom of the catalytic His-11 formed a hydrogen bond with the 2′-phosphoryl group, which was also stabilized by the side chains of Arg-10, Arg-62, His-188, the amide atom of Gly-189, and four water molecules. On the other side, the 3′-phosphoryl group was anchored by hydrogen bonds with Arg-100, Arg-116, Arg-117, Tyr-92, Asn-190, and two water molecules. The carboxylate group of C-1 atom hydrogen bonds to the amide atoms Ser-24 (Fig. 5C and Supplemental Fig. 1). Compared with free BPGM (8Wang Y. Wei Z. Bian Q. Cheng Z. Wan M. Liu L. Gong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39132-39138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), residues 99-122 move toward the active site, with a 36° rotation toward the “core” domain (calculated by the program DynDom (24Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar)), putting Arg-100, Arg-116, and Arg-117 into the active site. The C-terminal residues 236-250 also shift along the C-terminal helix by more than 3 Å. Residues 251-256, which were disordered in free BPGM, stretched forward with clear electron density. Thus the active pocket is fully closed. In addition, the backbone conformations of residues 12-21 also significantly changed to accommodate 2,3-BPG binding (Fig. 2).FIGURE 5A, schematic of the distance (Å) variation between His-11 and the ligand during the phosphoryl transfer process. i, the binding state of 2,3-BPG. ii, the reacting state of 2,3-BPG. iii, the transition state derived from the structure with AlF4- and 3-PGA bound. iv, the phosphorylation state of His-11. v, binding with 3-PGA when the 2′-phosphoryl group is gone.

Structure refinement was carefully carried out to 1.5-Å resolution. This density was defined as a mixture of a 2,3-BPG, ready for reaction and a phosphoryl group covalent bonding to His-11 plus a 3-PGA (Fig. 3). The two monomers in the asymmetric unit exhibited the same structure with slightly different occupancies of the ligands (40% of His-11 phosphorylated with 60% of 2,3-BPG unreacted in monomer A and 65% of His-11 phosphorylated with 35% of 2,3-BPG unreacted in monomer B) (Figs. 4 and 5D). The phosphorylated histidine is the intermediate in the BPGM reaction. In this mixed structure, each of the active site residues exhibits a single conformation indicating that this is an equilibrated state in which the phosphoryl group is being transferred. An equilibrated mixture of states in the enzyme reaction was also observed for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (25Theisen M.J. Misra I. Saadat D. Campobasso N. Miziorko H.M. Harrison D.H.T.

A. 2004; 101: 16399-16400Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the phosphorylated BPGM, the covalent N-P bond length of phosphorylated His-11 is 1.7 Å, consistent with the calculated value of 1.76 Å (27Van Wazer J.R. J. Dent. Res. 1964; 43: 1052-1064Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Compared with structure 1 (Fig. 1A), further conformational changes occurred at residues 11-19 with the Cα atoms shifting an average of 1 Å, making the imidazole ring of His-11 rotate about 20° and move toward 2,3-BPG by 0.5 Å. Consequently, the Nϵ-2 atom of His-11, central phosphorus atom, and the C-2 oxygen atom of 2,3-BPG are in a line, and the distance between the Nϵ-2 atom of His-11 to the C-2 oxygen atom is shortened from 5.1 to 4.6 Å (Fig. 5A). This conformation is consistent with an in line mechanism (1Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To stabilize this conformation, Asn-17 moves its side chain toward the substrate, forming a hydrogen bond with the 2′-phosphoryl group. The side chain of Gln-28 also protrudes into the active site pocket, strengthening the hydrogen bond network.FIGURE 4Schematic of the interactions between the ligand and human BPGM with all interactions between the ligand and residues depicted as dashed lines and labeled with the bond lengths (Å). A, interactions between 2,3-BPG and BPGM in the reacting state. B, interaction between 3-PGA and the phosphorylated enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structure of BPGM Bound with 3-PGA—To further confirm the above equilibrated structures and to observe what would happen before and after the observed steps, BPGM crystals were grown with 2,3-BPG at room temperature (crystallization condition B) for different time periods, and the structures were determined. (Crystals suitable for diffraction could be obtained after growing for at least 12 days.) When crystals were allowed to grow for 12-16 days, the structures observed were similar to the equilibrated mixture described above. However, in crystals that were allowed to grow for more than 18 days, only 3-PGA was observed (Fig. 1C, structure 3). The 2′-phosphoryl group was absent, and His-11 was no longer phosphorylated. Two water molecules replaced the 2′-phosphoryl group (Fig. 5E and supplemental Fig. 2). This structure is quite stable and remains unchanged in crystals grown for 4 months. Consistent with the above observation, the 17th day crystal revealed that 2,3-BPG had almost converted to 3-PGA (Fig. 1D, structure 4). The backbone of residues 11-19 in structures 3 and 4 returned to a similar position as in structure 1, so that the imidazole ring of His-11 returned to the position it occupied at the start of the reaction. It suggests that this enzyme adopts a similar conformation at the beginning and the end of the reaction. Structure of BPGM Bound with an Intermediate Analogue AlF4-—AlF3 or AlF4- is often used to mimic the intermediate in phosphoryl transfer reactions. To investigate the intermediate structure, BPGM was crystallized from a solution containing 3-PGA, AlCl3, and NaF (crystallization condition C). In this structure (Fig. 1E, structure 5), 3-PGA was observed to bind at the same position as above, and an AlF4- molecule was located between His-11 and 3-PGA with its AlF4- plane perpendicular to the line between the His-11 Nϵ-2 atom and the C-2 oxygen of 3-PGA (Figs. 1E and 5F; Supplemental Fig. 3). The enzyme conformation is almost identical to structure 2 with a root mean square deviation of 0.14 Å when all of the 250 Cα atoms are superimposed. The only significant structural difference is that His-11 shifts further toward 3-PGA by about 0.5 Å so that the distance from the His-11 Nϵ-2 atom to the 3-PGA C-2 oxygen atom is 4.1 Å. The aluminum atom is 2.1 Å from the Nϵ-2 atom of His-11 and 2.0 Å from the 3-PGA C-2 oxygen atom. The axial bond lengths are almost the same as in the pentavalent phosphorus intermediate of β-phosphoglucomutase (28Lahiri S.D. Zhang G.F. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), although the structure of this intermediate is still a matter of argument (29Blackburn G.M. Williams N.H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Webster C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 6840-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our structures depict clearly the binding modes of 2,3-BPG and 3-PGA for the first time. In all of the BPGM complex structures we obtained, only the 2′-phosphoryl group was observed to access and donate the phosphoryl group to His-11, whereas the 3′-phosphoryl group remained distant (Fig. 4 and supplemental Figs. 1-3). Both 2′- and 3′-phosphoryl groups were tightly bound involving a number of hydrogen bonds. In addition, there was insufficient space for 2,3-BPG to rotate within the active site. Thus it is unlikely that both of the phosphoryl groups in 2,3-BPG could phosphorylate His-11, as proposed previously (3Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). The above structures of the BPGM complex provide a series of snapshots of the process of phosphoryl transfer between 2,3-BPG and BPGM (Fig. 5A). These structures, for the first time, provide direct evidence that His-11 phosphorylation occurs by an in line partially associative mechanism. In the structure that mimics the transition state (Fig. 1E, structure 5), the distance between the nucleophile (His-11) and the leaving group is 4.1 Å, indicating the mechanism is 28% associative, approaching an SN2 mechanism. The bond order here is similar to that observed in the pentavalent phosphorus intermediate of β-phosphoglucomutase (28Lahiri S.D. Zhang G.F. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In SN2 nucleophilic substitution, stretching and then breaking of the bond to the leaving group occurred during the transformation of the reactants into the products. How could the distance between the nucleophile and the attacked atom be shortened? The motion of the catalytic His-11 offers the first glimpse. During the reaction, the backbone conformational changes of residues 11-19 drove the imidazole ring of His-11 to move back and forth, whereas 2,3-BPG and 3-PGA remained static with tight hydrogen binding (Fig. 5B). Besides, comparing BPGM structures 1 and 2 (Fig. 1, A and B), although both of them bind to 2,3-BPG, the conformations of the enzyme vary significantly. This indicates that the conformation of the enzyme in the substrate-bound state may differ from that in the reacting state. This is consistent with the idea that enzymes not only provide the reactive chemical group for catalysis but also, through conformational rearrangements, play a significant role in aligning the reactive atoms perfectly for the reaction (31Wolf-Watz M. Thai V. Henzler-Wildman K. Hadjipavlou G. Eisenmesser E.Z. Kern D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In addition, comparison of the series of structures presented here shows the importance of His-188 and Glu-89 in catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer. Both these residues are strictly conserved within the BPGM/dPGM family. His-188 hydrogen bonds to His-11, helping it to attain the correct position in free BPGM, and is involved in substrate binding in the complex. This explains why the mutation of His-188 to Ala in yeast dPGM results in a 1000-fold decrease in activity (32White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem.

Acta. 1996; 1296: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Glu-89 is not directly involved in 2,3-BPG binding in structure 1 (Fig. 1A). However, during the reaction (the equilibrated structure), the carboxylate group of Glu-89 rotated about 90°, forming a hydrogen bond with the leaving group, the C-2 oxygen atom. This indicates that Glu-89 could act as a proton donor to the C-2 oxygen, helping the phosphoryl group to leave. This is consistent with the fact that the E89Q mutant has a slightly higher Km value for 2,3-BPG but a kcat value less than 5% of that of wild type (13Rigden D.J. Walter R.A. Phillips S.E.

Many natural products are available only in trace quantities from natural sources, making total or partial synthesis a necessity. For example, the drug Taxol, an anticancer natural product, is present only in minute quantities in the bark of Taxus brevifolia. A closely related compound, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, can be extracted from leaf clippings from Taxus baccata with no harm to the tree (2). During studies of the transformation of 10-deacetylbaccatin into Taxol, a compound was synthesized that turned out to be more soluble and twice as active as Taxol itself (3). This compound was developed into the drug Taxotere. Total and partial syntheses of bioactive natural products and derivatives also provide the driving force for the invention of new reactions with ever-increasing levels of efficiency and selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2044247363,"Given that science is a collaborative endeavor, architects are striving to design new research buildings that not only provide a more pleasant work space but also facilitate interactions among researchers. Given that science is a collaborative endeavor, architects are striving to design new research buildings that not only provide a more pleasant work space but also facilitate interactions among researchers. In research, crucial “aha!” moments are often the result of chance meetings between scientists outside the laboratory space, wherever they encounter each other in the course of their movement between the lab, shared equipment rooms, and common areas. Over the past four decades, laboratory design has seen incremental improvements. In reviewing these developments, one can see that a common theme has begun to emerge: Lab design must facilitate interaction, both within a research group and between research groups. Architects who design research labs know from observation and experience that successful research facilities offer environments that combine rigorous technical sophistication and flexibility with comfort, visual delight, and inspiration—“high tech plus high touch”—thereby setting the stage for constructive interactions. In the post-war building boom of the 1950s and 1960s, American colleges, universities, and corporations built tens of millions of square feet of laboratory space for the sciences. Many of those buildings have proven inflexible in design, preventing their easy adaptation to evolving research needs and the accompanying expansion of building systems. By today's standards, buildings of that era are too narrow (floor plan depth); floor-to-floor height is often insufficient; structural bay spacing is too small; and too little space is devoted to accommodating utility shafts and mechanical equipment. In addition, the exterior walls of these older buildings usually are not sufficiently insulated. The windows are typically single-glazed, leading to high energy consumption and thermal discomfort for occupants, particularly those working near the outside wall. In older buildings, operable windows in labs were often designed as part of the ventilation system creating unsafe air-balance situations. One consequence of these deficiencies is that inserting new systems into these older buildings to enable them to continue as labs requires a difficult and costly renovation process, often leading to the decision either to convert them to “dry” uses or to demolish and replace them. A well-known example of a building typical of that era is the Richards Medical Research Laboratories (1962), designed by master architect Louis Kahn for the University of Pennsylvania. Although a renowned architectural landmark, it has proven to be poorly adapted to research needs and lab design standards as they have evolved over the past forty years, due to its constrained dimensions and awkward configuration. Even today, the Richards building still suffers from isolated spaces, dreary lighting, and inefficient organization of space. And its historic landmark status potentially limits the university's ability to make substantive changes to the exterior. By contrast, another seminal Kahn-designed research building, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California (1965), elegantly displays principles that have both aged well and have proven to be valuable models of lab design even now (Figure 1, top). Generous dimensions, open structural spans that permit open labs and considerable interior flexibility, modular lab components, and sufficient space for lab services contribute to a marvelous research environment in a spectacular setting. A key element of the Salk building's airy design is a full “interstitial” floor containing the ducts and piping serving the lab spaces, which is inserted between the floors housing laboratories (Figure 1, bottom). This design strategy, emulated in other recently built research institutes, facilitates maintenance and renovation by separating lab service distribution from the lab space occupied by researchers. Salk's floor plan has exterior corridors along the perimeter (appropriate for the benign climate) with glass walls enclosing the open labs in the center. A commonly implemented design strategy in older research facilities buried the lab areas in the center of the building plan, enclosed by corridors, denying researchers direct visual contact with the outdoors. We now know that depriving the occupants of daylight and the ability to stay visually oriented has negative consequences on their performance and mental well-being (see the Commentary by Sternberg and Wilson, page 239 of this issue). When designing a complete renovation of I.M. Pei's 1971 Dreyfus Chemistry Research Laboratories at MIT—a building characterized by interior labs without daylight—the researchers expressed to the architects their dissatisfaction with the lack of visual connection with the exterior. The new design included reorienting and opening up the small, closed lab spaces and using internal windows in the corridor wall to allow daylight from the building's perimeter windows to penetrate deep into the lab, benefiting all the occupants (Figure 2, left). Many buildings from the mid-20th century also inadequately supported the need for interaction and the fostering of a science community. Now, we understand the ways in which design can affect those phenomena. Although functional spaces such as labs, equipment rooms, offices, and meeting spaces were often aggregated in efficient layouts in older buildings, that design approach provided few or no shared public social spaces, which are critical elements in fostering interaction and community. It has been said that “research happens in the labs, but science happens in the corridors.” From today's perspective, the design of older buildings simply fell short in allowing collaborative science to happen to its fullest potential. Fortunately, architects and researchers have learned much from these older buildings. Post-occupancy evaluation, both informal and more structured, has helped us to understand more thoroughly how patterns of use contribute to the success—or failure—of a building design. Modern research labs are designed to simultaneously balance functional needs and safety concerns (always of primary importance) with ergonomics, indoor air quality, thermal/visual/acoustical comfort, flexibility, and the provision of shared social spaces. These interaction zones represent a range of space types such as break rooms, lounges, and other places in which researchers can relax and collaborate outside the lab proper. A good example of this new design approach is MIT's Koch Biology Building, in which open communicating stairs rise through the six-story building, serving, in combination with glass-walled “tea rooms,” as the intellectual heart of the lab space (Figure 2, middle). Researchers can see each other from one floor to the next and can take advantage of conveniently located benches and a comfortable handrail (with footrest) for an impromptu chat with a colleague. A side benefit of encouraging building occupants to use attractive interior stairs instead of elevators is increased exercise. Aside from acting as traditional eating areas, open common spaces invite researchers to reflect or discuss their progress and challenges with colleagues without having to leave the building or take an extended departure from their work. If collaboration is accepted as useful in a research endeavor, we believe that every lab building, large or small, should have a place that serves as a “heart” and through which most of the occupants pass at least once a day. This strategy will contribute to a successful interactive research community by its very nature, in that the likelihood of unplanned interaction is increased. Ideally, this space, often taking the form of an atrium or lobby, should be provided with ample daylight (see Figure 2, right). The more generous volume of such an open central space contrasts with the more compact nature of laboratory spaces and has the power to uplift the spirit. The variability and play of natural light provide vibrancy to the space even when sparsely occupied, not to mention the well-documented psychological benefits of daylight to humans. The extensive use of interior glass puts the life of the labs on display and conveys a sense of openness about the scientific endeavor. If you can see your neighbor at work, when you run into him or her on the stairs or in the corridor, there is a greater likelihood that you will be prompted to share a recent research breakthrough or challenge. Interior glass also allows daylight to penetrate from the exterior deeper into the lab building—heightening the sense of connectedness to the outdoors. Recent neuroscience research has shown the importance of maintaining one's orientation to external cues (see Commentary by Sternberg and Wilson, pp. 239). Glass-panel doors from the corridor into the lab, often used in combination with high windows in the corridor wall, or between an office and an inner room, allow the “borrowing” of daylight and contribute to a more pleasant interior environment. The goal of sustainable or “green” design is to minimize a building's overall environmental impact. Although energy consumption is the most often discussed aspect, this approach applies to more than energy-saving strategies. Issues such as orientation of the building relative to the sun and prevailing winds, provision of bicycle parking, the availability of recharging stations for electric vehicles, recycling of construction waste, and even subsidies to encourage use of public transportation are all part of a holistic approach to building design. Modern research buildings, particularly those for the life sciences, are inherently large energy consumers due to the high ventilation rates and the prevalence of once-through use of fresh air for safety reasons. Current design best practice typically includes, for example, heat-recovery systems to recapture and reuse some of the energy embodied in exhaust air streams ejected at the roof level. High-performance building envelopes, in which the exterior wall is built to a higher level of resistance to air and moisture vapor transmission, are becoming the norm, both due to newer building and energy codes and because of the more stringent requirements of laboratories for temperature and air-balance controls. Other strategies that architects are incorporating in these buildings include more sophisticated fume hood controls; low-flow plumbing fixtures; “gray-water” systems that recover and reuse rainwater for toilet flushing or landscape irrigation; integrated daylight and artificial lighting; increasing use of renewable materials such as wood from certified sustainably grown forests; and high recycled-content finish materials such as flooring made from marble chips. Many of these strategies can easily be integrated into the design of new construction, and quite a few are appropriate for renovation projects as well. Building owners, both private- and public-sector, are increasingly using a green building rating system known as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), developed and administered by the U.S. Green Building Council, to assess a building's environmental performance. Buildings certified as Silver, Gold, or Platinum are acknowledged to be among the most environmentally sensitive in the industry. Nevertheless, LEED certification is only one way of measuring environmental suitability—there are design approaches that achieve high energy savings (particularly in laboratories) that are not yet recognized by the LEED system. A valuable point to remember in planning a lab building is to consider sustainability from the outset. Post-occupancy evaluation is a powerful, though underutilized, tool with which design professionals and behavioral researchers study completed buildings. In its most scientifically rigorous format, post-occupancy evaluation involves systematic evaluation of opinions about buildings from the perspective of the people who use them. It assesses how well buildings match users' needs and identifies ways to improve building design, performance, and fitness for purpose. One might imagine a post-occupancy evaluation of a research facility that looks for evidence that the design influenced the building's use in ways the designers did not intend. Looking ahead, we have identified a preliminary list of topics and directions that architects and neuroscientists—supported by others such as social scientists—might explore together in the near future. •What aspects of research space design would help researchers to maintain their focus and avoid “cognitive overload”? To what degree does visual clutter in a lab environment hinder one's ability to think clearly or creatively?•What actually constitutes a (perceived) barrier to easy collaboration between researchers? Is there a measurable difference in the impact of a door that separates/connects two spaces—even if it stands open—versus just an opening in the wall? What about a window between spaces (cognitive proximity versus physical proximity)?•Does perceived flexibility, as measured by a researcher's sense that he or she can easily modify the research space, make a difference in the ability to do the best work?•How important is the presence of transition spaces, in which one can maintain a sense of connectedness to the outdoors and thus still feel oriented to external cues? Possible experimental approaches that could help to answer these questions would involve pairs of actual lab configurations that differ in key characteristics, such as relative openness, transparency to adjacent spaces, or visual distractions. Observation of use patterns, interviews with lab occupants, and other noninvasive surveys would be implemented over extended periods of time. •To what extent are organizational or institutional culture factors influential in supporting collaboration/collegiality, as opposed to architectural conditions? How much is dependent upon the individuals or the culture of the research entity?•To what degree does trust (for example, between researchers) enter into the equation? Consider willingness to share equipment, to leave connecting doors open, to store glassware in a semi-public corridor, etc. These questions probably require more interviews and fewer truly experimental techniques than the first set of questions. Enlisting behavioral psychologists and organizational specialists to help in studying and analyzing these factors would be necessary but could yield critical new information about how space and culture can be combined in better building design. In identifying organizational or cultural factors that impede or encourage interaction, could architectural solutions be devised to specifically alter or support them? If one accepts the premise that improved collaboration between researchers will more effectively lead to scientific breakthroughs and ultimately benefit humankind, then a logical implication would be that lab design should be optimized to enhance such collaboration. Architects would benefit immeasurably from a more scientific, empirical basis for making design decisions. Neuroscience research has the potential to advise lab designers on, for example, how to minimize the perception that barriers to collaboration exist within a building. The combination of experiments tailored to answer these questions and post-occupancy evaluation of existing research facilities will undoubtedly yield enormously valuable results that can be applied to the building of new research institutes."

For scientists at the UK's National Institute of Medical Research, which is facing relocation from London's outskirts to its center, the question is no longer academic. Is translational research enhanced by the proximity of research institutes to hospitals? For scientists at the UK's National Institute of Medical Research, which is facing relocation from London's outskirts to its center, the question is no longer academic. Is it essential for basic scientists and clinicians to work next door to each other to deliver the best results for human health? The short answer is yes, at least in the view of Britain's Medical Research Council (MRC), the government agency that funds much of biomedical research in the UK. This month, the MRC is seeking approval from the UK Treasury to move its largest establishment, the internationally respected National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), from suburban Mill Hill in north London to the city center, at a cost of more than £320 million (US $605 million). After a debate over the institute's future that has lasted almost four years, a decision from the Treasury is expected very soon. The NIMR has a proud history dating back to 1913. Discoveries by its researchers include the influenza virus, acetylcholine and the nature of neurotransmitters, interferon, the nature of immunological tolerance, and the sex-determining gene. Among its alumni, NIMR boasts five Nobel prize winners, including the immunologist Peter Medawar and A.J.P. Martin, who developed gas chromatography. The institute today, with a budget of £25 million (US $47 million) and more than 700 staff members, is recognized for its work on infection and immunity, developmental biology and genetics, neuroscience, and structural biology. Its future is of interest to scientists outside the UK as well as nationally not only because of its stature but because the changes it faces typify much broader shifts in the way biomedical research is being funded worldwide. For some, the proposed move is an exciting step. “The renewed NIMR will potentially be the most powerful biomedical research environment in the UK,” claims the MRC. If approved by the Treasury, the proposed new institute will not be wholly owned by the MRC but instead will be a partnership with University College London (UCL). It will be sited next door to UCL and minutes from University College Hospital. As well as giving its biomedical researchers access to other basic scientists at UCL, the council's key aim is to improve the two-way links between bench researchers and clinicians. Like other public funding bodies on both sides of the Atlantic, including the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the MRC is keen to intensify its efforts in translational research. But some NIMR researchers are concerned. They question the evidence that physical proximity is necessarily the best way for scientists to work together in the 21st century. They point out that the potential benefits of the move are uncertain, whereas its costs are real, both to the public purse and, in the medium term, to the ongoing research activities of NIMR. “You have an institute at Mill Hill that functions well and is renowned,” says Robin Lovell-Badge, head of developmental genetics at NIMR who, with Peter Goodfellow, discovered SRY, the sex-determining gene, in 1991. “I personally think it is fine for the MRC to build an institute to strengthen translational research in central London, but it would have been more imaginative to start a new one, instead of moving the NIMR.” Having just been awarded an NIH grant for $3 million to study treatments for stroke, together with colleagues at London's King's College and two US institutes, Lovell-Badge points out that he is already doing translational research. “It just emphasises to me that we don't need to be located next to anyone to work with them,” he says. Some researchers fear that a move will also have a negative impact on the institute's basic science. “What frightens me,” says Jonathan Stoye, head of NIMR's division of virology, “is that there is a calculation that says you can improve translational research by moving us, but there is no hard evidence that you will improve outputs that way…. What you need to do is facilitate links between researchers and clinicians, not put buildings next to each other.” Stoye points out that NIMR already works with a long list of other hospitals in different locations. For example, in a Lancet paper last month, NIMR scientists reported a new test for active tuberculosis infection that they had developed in collaboration with researchers at St. George's Hospital Medical School on the opposite side of London. The tensions over the NIMR's future reflect a growing debate over how best to support high-quality biomedical science. In the public sector, in Europe and the US alike, funding bodies are under political pressure to show that taxpayers' money delivers results for people's health. In the US, the NIH Roadmap for medical research, launched in 2003, reaffirmed the need for intensified translational efforts as part of its move to “re-engineer” clinical research. In Britain, the MRC has been pushing for scientists to work more closely with clinicians for years, but in 2003 it formally made translational research a priority in its strategic plan for the decade. “The government, through the research councils, needs to be keeping its customers happy,” says Richard Henderson, director of the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge. Henderson has not failed to spot the contrast between the agenda of the publicly funded research agencies and those of some private foundations. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has just invested half a billion dollars in a state-of-the-science campus, deliberately sited 30 miles from Washington DC in the Virginia countryside. Janelia Farm, due to open this month, has been designed to give high-calibre scientists the freedom to pursue long-range, high-risk research questions “without distraction.” Ironically, Janelia Farm's head, Gerald Rubin, has said that he modeled elements of the new campus on the original LMB, where he did his PhD. Henderson argues that, because private foundations such as the Howard Hughes have fewer stakeholders to answer to than the public-sector funding bodies, they are free to fund visibly separate research initiatives that clearly demonstrate their investment rather than allowing their funds to get blurred with those from other sources. As another example of this separation, Henderson cites the Wellcome Trust's Sanger Institute outside Cambridge, with almost 2000 researchers and with 90% funding by the Trust. The current status of the NIMR belies a long and fraught debate over its future. In 2003, the MRC reviewed its plans for capital investment over the next decade not only for NIMR but also for other major MRC institutes. The review gave the NIMR full marks for its research but concluded that its facilities would need to be modernized to keep competitive, and the case for keeping it on its present Mill Hill site was “not strong,” given the council's broader push for bringing stand-alone institutes closer to other research bases. The MRC then set up a task force to re-examine the options, although modernizing the existing Mill Hill institute was the one option not under consideration. Privately, some scientists suspected that the MRC had a hidden agenda to close Mill Hill, or that its plans were the result of empire-building by clinicians keen to regain some of the status that clinical research has lost in recent decades. That suspicion is vigorously dismissed by Colin Blakemore, the MRC's Chief Executive. “If there is a hidden agenda then after three years at the MRC I am still unaware of where it is hidden,” he told Cell. “The only agenda is to achieve the best possible future for the institute and its research in a promising new era.” Late in 2004, the MRC accepted the recommendations of the task force that the institute should move alongside a university and teaching hospital, with a renewed focus on “basic and translational research,” while remaining in London. This recommendation was made on the condition that the new institute would ultimately be an improvement on the existing one. In 2005 the MRC agreed to a partnership with University College London. Staff from the MRC, the NIMR, and UCL drew up a draft business plan for the new institute. The MRC estimated then that the new institute would cost about £320 million. This would be funded partly by £100 million from the MRC, with a further £140 million from a separate government pot administered by the Office of Science and Innovation (OSI), called the Large Facilities Capital Fund. The balance would come mainly from UCL and the proceeds of selling the Mill Hill site. Earlier this year, the MRC bought the site adjacent to UCL but could not press ahead with its plans without approval from OSI and the Treasury. As Cell went to press, the final version of the business plan was to be presented to the MRC Council and then, following the Council's approval, will be sent straight to the Treasury. The MRC expects a response from the Treasury before the end of the year. Assuming the plan goes ahead, it will be at least 6 years before the new institute is ready. The design phase will take until 2009 and building is due to be completed by 2012. Because the future of NIMR has taken longer to decide than originally expected, the timing of the building phase may pose a headache for the MRC. Sceptics point out that by the time the MRC calls the builders in, every builder in London will already be committed to construction of the infrastructure for the 2012 Olympics, so costs are likely to spiral upwards. Blakemore confirms that the estimated cost of the proposed institute has risen, but for “explicable” reasons. NIMR researchers accept that the proposed central London institute could be adequate. However, they are worried about other options that the Treasury has required the MRC to explore in its business plan as a means to justify its preferred option for a new institute in central London. These include moving the institute out of south-east England, or leaving the NIMR without new investment in its current aging buildings—the “do-nothing” option. Blakemore says that these are not serious options but simply exercises to explain MRC's reasons for its preferred plan. Without investment, the current NIMR site has at most a life expectancy of 20 years and the MRC Council has already concluded that the site has no long-term future, he says. “We know that the do-nothing option is literally not an option, and the Treasury is unlikely to challenge that,” says Blakemore. Likewise, he accepts that locating the institute outside south-east England would effectively break up its existing teams. “One of our aims is to keep the excellent scientists at NIMR working together.” Even if the Treasury approves the preferred option, there are many important details that have yet to be resolved. “It is clearly very good that the MRC is thinking of investing £320 million in the institute and its continued success,” says Lovell-Badge. “But we are very worried about the practicalities of the move, and whether the site is sufficient.” One obvious issue is size. The NIMR currently has a campus of more than 40 acres and includes sophisticated animal research and containment laboratories. The new site covers less than one acre. Although the MRC has argued that it could fit most of the institute's existing laboratory space into a high-rise building on this site, it has not ruled out the possibility that some scientists could be based elsewhere. A second issue is the animal facilities. Some scientists understand that the animals could end up being sited 2 miles from the new building, while others fear that moving the animal facilities could lose vital research time. It could take 2 years or more after a move to re-establish specific lines of animals, forcing scientists either to wait or establish parallel animal facilities during the transition. There are also questions about whether the institute's containment facilities for infectious agents can be moved to central London. “We welcome the investment in a new institute, but it is a major concern for me if we do not have those facilities on site,” says Stoye. Yet more uncertainty surrounds the leadership of the institute. John Skehel, the director since 1987, retired last month. Although the MRC has tried to recruit a new director, it is unlikely to get one until the detailed future of the new institute is agreed. Although the MRC will not confirm any names, many scientists know that its preferred candidate is Scott Fraser, professor of bioengineering at Caltech in Pasadena, California. “I have always thought that NIMR is one of the real crown jewels,” says Fraser, whose bioimaging skills and previous collaboration with NIMR teams have put him in the spotlight. He confirmed before Cell went to press that he was in “advanced discussions” with the MRC but stresses that there are still many undecided issues, as well as other opportunities for him to consider. Meanwhile, the MRC has asked 68-year-old Keith Peters, former head of the medical school at Cambridge University, to step in as interim caretaker. Until a permanent director is appointed, recruitment has been frozen and insiders report that some teams are now in need of new members, although, surprisingly, given the continued uncertainty, no senior scientists have yet left NIMR. Many outside the NIMR hope that the years of argument over its future can be laid to rest. Richard Henderson, head of the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, takes a philosophical view. He acknowledges the fears of NIMR researchers but also understands the need for a government-funded enterprise to be accountable to its stakeholders and to serve its communities to the best standard possible. For that reason, he thinks it is “reasonable” that the MRC wants a new institute alongside a university and hospital. “The only question is this,” he says: “If you have got something that works, why change it?” The MRC could have developed its new institute with UCL while also maintaining the current site and NIMR infrastructure, he believes. Clearly, the question of whether clinicians and basic scientists should rub shoulders daily is still unanswered. Advocates of the approach admit that there is no hard evidence to support the idea that sharing space results in better work, and they doubt it will ever be possible to document this in a systematic way. But they say they are persuaded of its benefits by their own working experience. “I do think in general there is an advantage in proximity,” says Henderson. A similar view is held by Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust, and formerly chair of the division of medicine at Imperial College London's Hammersmith campus. “I think there are real advantages,” he says. He points to the successful links between groups of institutions elsewhere. One example, he suggests, is Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard (although this network has evolved rather than being deliberately created). And, Walport argues, since the MRC moved its Clinical Sciences Centre to the Hammersmith Hospital, it has been working “incredibly well.” Of the proposed NIMR move he says: “Asked if this is a piece of cosmic irrationality—no, I don't think so. We need as strong a biomedical science endeavour as possible, and we can never afford to stand still.”"
