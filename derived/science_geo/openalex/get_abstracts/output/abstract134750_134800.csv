https://openalex.org/W2167705142,"Integrating conceptually similar models of the growth of marine and terrestrial primary producers yielded an estimated global net primary production (NPP) of 104.9 petagrams of carbon per year, with roughly equal contributions from land and oceans. Approaches based on satellite indices of absorbed solar radiation indicate marked heterogeneity in NPP for both land and oceans, reflecting the influence of physical and ecological processes. The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light, nutrients, and temperature. On land, water limitation imposes additional constraints. On land and ocean, progressive changes in NPP can result in altered carbon storage, although contrasts in mechanisms of carbon storage and rates of organic matter turnover result in a range of relations between carbon storage and changes in NPP."
https://openalex.org/W2087749727,"The activity of TGF-beta1 is regulated primarily extracellularly where the secreted latent form must be modified to expose the active molecule. Here we show that thrombospondin-1 is responsible for a significant proportion of the activation of TGF-beta1 in vivo. Histological abnormalities in young TGF-beta1 null and thrombospondin-1 null mice were strikingly similar in nine organ systems. Lung and pancreas pathologies similar to those observed in TGF-beta1 null animals could be induced in wild-type pups by systemic treatment with a peptide that blocked the activation of TGF-beta1 by thrombospondin-1. Although these organs produced little active TGF-beta1 in thrombospondin null mice, when pups were treated with a peptide derived from thrombospondin-1 that could activate TGF-beta1, active cytokine was detected in situ, and the lung and pancreatic abnormalities reverted toward wild type."
https://openalex.org/W1989844987,"We have characterized a flat cellular variant of HTLV-1 Tax-transformed rat fibroblasts, 5R, which is unresponsive to all tested NF-kappaB activating stimuli, and we report here its genetic complementation. The recovered full-length cDNA encodes a 48 kDa protein, NEMO (NF-kappaB Essential MOdulator), which contains a putative leucine zipper motif. This protein is absent from 5R cells, is part of the high molecular weight IkappaB kinase complex, and is required for its formation. In vitro, NEMO can homodimerize and directly interacts with IKK-2. The NEMO cDNA was also able to complement another NF-kappaB-unresponsive cell line, 1.3E2, in which the protein is also absent, allowing us to demonstrate that this factor is required not only for Tax but also for LPS, PMA, and IL-1 stimulation of NF-kappaB activity."
https://openalex.org/W2092425394,"The CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) gene encodes a MYB-related transcription factor involved in the phytochrome induction of a light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein (Lhcb) gene. Expression of the CCA1 gene is transiently induced by phytochrome and oscillates with a circadian rhythm. Constitutive expression of CCA1 protein in transgenic plants abolished the circadian rhythm of several genes with dramatically different phases. These plants also had longer hypocotyls and delayed flowering, developmental processes regulated by light and the circadian clock. Furthermore, the expression of both endogenous CCA1 and the related LHY gene was suppressed. Our results suggest that CCA1 is a part of a feedback loop that is closely associated with the circadian clock in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2142389038,"The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) gene is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. We isolated the LEC1 gene and showed that it functions at an early developmental stage to maintain embryonic cell fate. The LEC1 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the CCAAT box-binding factor HAP3 subunit. LEC1 RNA accumulates only during seed development in embryo cell types and in endosperm tissue. Ectopic postembryonic expression of the LEC1 gene in vegetative cells induces the expression of embryo-specific genes and initiates formation of embryo-like structures. Our results suggest that LEC1 is an important regulator of embryo development that activates the transcription of genes required for both embryo morphogenesis and cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2084901455,"The dominant late elongated hypocotyl (lhy) mutation of Arabidopsis disrupted circadian clock regulation of gene expression and leaf movements and caused flowering to occur independently of photoperiod. LHY was shown to encode a MYB DNA-binding protein. In wild-type plants, the LHY mRNA showed a circadian pattern of expression with a peak around dawn but in the mutant was expressed constantly at high levels. Increased LHY expression from a transgene caused the endogenous gene to be expressed at a constant level, suggesting that LHY was part of a feedback circuit that regulated its own expression. Thus, constant expression of LHY disrupts several distinct circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis, and LHY may be closely associated with the central oscillator of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2051764674,"A single molecule of F1-ATPase, a portion of ATP synthase, is by itself a rotary motor in which a central gamma subunit rotates against a surrounding cylinder made of alpha3beta3 subunits. Driven by three catalytic betas, each fueled with ATP, gamma makes discrete 120 degree steps, occasionally stepping backward. The work done in each step is constant over a broad range of imposed load and is close to the free energy of hydrolysis of one ATP molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2025693577,"In most tissues, cell division is coordinated with increases in mass (i.e., growth). To understand this coordination, we altered rates of division in cell clones or compartments of the Drosophila wing and measured the effects on growth. Constitutive overproduction of the transcriptional regulator dE2F increased expression of the S- and M-phase initiators Cyclin E and String (Cdc25), thereby accelerating cell proliferation. Loss of dE2F or overproduction of its corepressor, RBF, retarded cell proliferation. These manipulations altered cell numbers over a 4- to 5-fold range but had little effect on clone or compartment sizes. Instead, changes in cell division rates were offset by changes in cell size. We infer that dE2F and RBF function specifically in cell cycle control, and that cell cycle acceleration is insufficient to stimulate growth. Variations in dE2F activity could be used to coordinate cell division with growth."
https://openalex.org/W2095841601,"Mouse kif5B gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. kif5B−/− mice were embryonic lethal with a severe growth retardation at 9.5–11.5 days postcoitum. To analyze the significance of this conventional kinesin heavy chain in organelle transport, we studied the distribution of major organelles in the extraembryonic cells. The null mutant cells impaired lysosomal dispersion, while brefeldin A could normally induce the breakdown of their Golgi apparatus. More prominently, their mitochondria abnormally clustered in the perinuclear region. This mitochondrial phenotype was reversed by an exogeneous expression of KIF5B, and a subcellular fractionation revealed that KIF5B is associated with mitochondria. These data collectively indicate that kinesin is essential for mitochondrial and lysosomal dispersion rather than for the Golgi-to-ER traffic in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1910033896,"Skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness are thought to be stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in a variety of chronic diseases. However, little is known about the direct effects of TNF-alpha on differentiated skeletal muscle cells or the signaling mechanisms involved. We have tested the effects of TNF-alpha on the mouse-derived C2C12 muscle cell line and on primary cultures from rat skeletal muscle. TNF-alpha treatment of differentiated myotubes stimulated time- and concentration-dependent reductions in total protein content and loss of adult myosin heavy chain (MHCf) content; these changes were evident at low TNF-alpha concentrations (1-3 ng/ml) that did not alter muscle DNA content and were not associated with a decrease in MHCf synthesis. TNF-alpha activated binding of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) to its targeted DNA sequence and stimulated degradation of I-kappaBalpha, an NF-kappaB inhibitory protein. TNF-alpha stimulated total ubiquitin conjugation whereas a 26S proteasome inhibitor (MG132 10-40 microM) blocked TNF-alpha activation of NF-kappaB. Catalase 1 kU/ml inhibited NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha; exogenous hydrogen peroxide 200 microM activated NF-kappaB and stimulated I-kappaBalpha degradation. These data demonstrate that TNF-alpha directly induces skeletal muscle protein loss, that NF-kappaB is rapidly activated by TNF-alpha in differentiated skeletal muscle cells, and that TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling in skeletal muscle is regulated by endogenous reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W1980008292,"Dendritic cells (DCs) developmentally regulate their capacity for antigen presentation by controlling the transport and surface expression of MHC class II molecules. These events reflect a developmental regulation of invariant (Ii) chain cleavage, most likely by the cysteine protease cathepsin S. In immature DCs, inefficient Ii chain cleavage due to low cathepsin S activity leads to the transport of class II-Ii chain complexes to lysosomes, while in mature DCs, elevated cathepsin S activity results in efficient delivery of class II αβ dimers to the plasma membrane. Cathepsin S is not controlled transcriptionally but by a novel mechanism involving alterations in the expression and localization of an endogenous cathepsin S inhibitor cystatin C. Thus, the ratio of cystatin C to cathepsin S in developing DCs helps to determine the fate of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2126000459,"The yeast [PSI+] factor propagates by a prion-like mechanism involving self-replicating Sup35p amyloids. We identified multiple Sup35p mutants that either are poorly recruited into, or cause curing of, wildtype amyloids in vivo. In vitro, these mutants showed markedly decreased rates of amyloid formation, strongly supporting the protein-only prion hypothesis. Kinetic analysis suggests that the prion state replicates by accelerating slow conformational changes rather than by providing stable nuclei. Strikingly, our mutations map exclusively within a short glutamine/asparagine-rich region of Sup35p, and all but one occur at polar residues. Even after replacement of this region with polyglutamine, Sup35p retains its ability to form amyloids. These and other considerations suggest similarities between the prion-like propagation of [PSI+] and polyglutamine-mediated pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2048000262,"Next to N 2 gas, the largest pool of reduced nitrogen in the ocean resides in the enormous reservoir of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The chemical identity of most of this material, and the mechanisms by which it is cycled, remain fundamental questions in contemporary oceanography. Amino acid enantiomeric ratios in the high molecular weight fraction of DON from surface and deep water in three ocean basins show substantial enrichment in d enantiomers of four amino acids. The magnitude and pattern of these d / l enrichments indicate that peptidoglycan remnants derived from bacterial cell walls constitute a major source of DON throughout the sea. These observations suggest that structural properties of specific bacterial biopolymers, and the mechanisms for their accumulation, are among the central controls on long-term cycling of dissolved organic nitrogen in the sea."
https://openalex.org/W1981990802,"The cadherins are a family of cell–cell adhesion molecules that mediate Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions between cells and transduce signals by interacting with cytoplasmic proteins. In the hippocampus, immunostaining combined with confocal microscopy revealed that both neural- (N-) and epithelial- (E-) cadherin are present at synaptic sites, implying a role in synaptic function. Pretreatment of hippocampal slices with antibodies (Abs) raised against the extracellular domain of either N-cad or E-cad had no effect on basal synaptic properties but significantly reduced long-term potentiation (LTP). Infusion of antagonistic peptides containing the His-Ala-Val (HAV) consensus sequence for cadherin dimerization also attenuated LTP induction without affecting previously established LTP. Because the intense synaptic stimulation associated with LTP induction might transiently deplete extracellular Ca2+ and hence potentially destabilize cadherin–cadherin interactions, we examined whether slices could be protected from inhibition by N-cad Abs or HAV peptides by raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Indeed, we found that high extracellular Ca2+ prevented the block of LTP by these agents. Taken together, these results indicate that cadherins are involved in synaptic plasticity, and the stability of cadherin–cadherin bonds may be regulated by synaptic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2015913538,"The mechanism through which kainate receptors downregulate the release of GABA in the hippocampus is not known. We have found that the action of kainate on the hippocampal inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) is mediated by a metabotropic process that is sensitive to Pertussis toxin (PTx) and independent of ion channel current. The downregulation of GABA IPSCs by kainate was also prevented in a dose-dependent manner by calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, and the inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) drastically reduced the action of kainate. The effect of kainate was completely occluded by phorbol esters and by increasing extracellular Ca2+ but remained unaltered after inhibition or activation of protein kinase A (PKA). These results demonstrate that the activation of kainate receptors triggers a second messenger cascade, which results in the stimulation of PKC, and therefore document a metabotropic action of kainate receptors, which results in the inhibition of GABA release."
https://openalex.org/W2069852256,"A 20-residue protein (named Betanova) forming a monomeric, three-stranded, antiparallel beta sheet was designed using a structural backbone template and an iterative hierarchical approach. Structural and physicochemical characterization show that the beta-sheet conformation is stabilized by specific tertiary interactions and that the protein exhibits a cooperative two-state folding-unfolding transition, which is a hallmark of natural proteins. The Betanova molecule constitutes a tractable model system to aid in the understanding of beta-sheet formation, including beta-sheet aggregation and amyloid fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W2022087383,"To investigate the possible biological function of the lateral ""strand dimer"" observed in crystal structures of a D1 domain extracellular fragment from N-cadherin, we have undertaken site-directed mutagenesis studies of this molecule. Mutation of most residues important in the strand dimer interface abolish the ability of N-cadherin to mediate cell adhesion. Mutation of an analogous central residue (Trp-2) in E-cadherin also abrogates the adhesive capacity of that molecule. We also determined the crystal structure of a Ca2+-complexed two-domain fragment from N-cadherin. This structure, like its E-cadherin counterpart, does not adopt the strand dimer conformation. This suggests the possibility that classical cadherins might stably exist in both dimeric and monomeric forms. Data from several laboratories imply that lateral dimerization or clustering of cadherins may increase their adhesivity. We suggest the possibility that the strand dimer may play a role in this activation."
https://openalex.org/W2010576264,"Community respiration ( R ) rates are scaled as the two-thirds power of the gross primary production ( P ) rates of aquatic ecosystems, indicating that the role of aquatic biota as carbon dioxide sources or sinks depends on its productivity. Unproductive aquatic ecosystems support a disproportionately higher respiration rate than that of productive aquatic ecosystems, tend to be heterotrophic ( R &gt; P ), and act as carbon dioxide sources. The average P required for aquatic ecosystems to become autotrophic ( P &gt; R ) is over an order of magnitude greater for marshes than for the open sea. Although four-fifths of the upper ocean is expected to be net heterotrophic, this carbon demand can be balanced by the excess production over the remaining one-fifth of the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2087744429,"Is thalamic input to the visual cortex strong and well tuned for orientation, as predicted by Hubel and Wiesel's (1962) model of orientation selectivity in simple cells? We directly measured the size of the thalamic input to single simple cells intracellularly by combining electrical stimulation of the cortex with a briefly flashed visual stimulus. In nearby cells, the electrical stimulation evoked a long-lasting inhibition that prevented them from firing in response to the visual stimulus. The visually evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded during the period of cortical suppression, therefore, reflected largely the thalamic input. In 16 neurons that received monosynaptic input from the thalamus, cortical suppression left 46% of normal visual response on average (12%-86% in range). In those cells tested, this remaining visual response was as well tuned for orientation as the normal response to the visual stimulus alone. We conclude that the thalamic input to cortical simple cells with monosynaptic input from the thalamus is strong and well tuned in orientation, and that the intracortical input does not appear to sharpen orientation tuning in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2137457846,"The 50S subunit of the ribosome catalyzes the peptidyl-transferase reaction of protein synthesis. We have generated X-ray crystallographic electron density maps of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui at various resolutions up to 9 A using data from crystals that diffract to 3 A. Positioning a 20 A resolution EM image of these particles in the crystal lattice produced phases accurate enough to locate the bound heavy atoms in three derivatives using difference Fourier maps, thus demonstrating the correctness of the EM model and its placement in the unit cell. At 20 A resolution, the X-ray map is similar to the EM map; however, at 9 A it reveals long, continuous, but branched features whose shape, diameter, and right-handed twist are consistent with segments of double-helical RNA that crisscross the subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1998620162,"A new method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the detection of relatively strong signal from intermolecular zero-quantum coherences (iZQCs) is reported. Such a signal would not be observable in the conventional framework of magnetic resonance; it originates in long-range dipolar couplings (10 micrometers to 1 millimeter) that are traditionally ignored. Unlike conventional MRI, where image contrast is based on variations in spin density and relaxation times (often with injected contrast agents), contrast with iZQC images comes from variations in the susceptibility over a distance dictated by gradient strength. Phantom and in vivo (rat brain) data confirm that iZQC images give contrast enhancement. This contrast might be useful in the detection of small tumors, in that susceptibility correlates with oxygen concentration and in functional MRI."
https://openalex.org/W2022850426,"Mass spectrometry has become an increasingly important tool of high accuracy, efficiency, and speed for the routine analysis of nucleic acids. To make it useful for large-scale sequencing of genomic material as required for example in genotyping and clinical diagnosis, it is necessary to find approaches that allow the analysis of sequences much larger than the 100 nucleotides currently possible. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectra of synthetic DNA, restriction enzyme fragments of plasmid DNA, and RNA transcripts up to a size of 2180 nucleotides are reported. The demonstrated mass accuracy of 1 percent or better and the sample requirement of a few femtomoles or less surpass all currently available techniques for the analysis of large nucleic acids. DNA and RNA can be analyzed with only a limited investment in sample purification."
https://openalex.org/W1973220450,Radiocarbon (14C) content of surface waters inferred from a coral record from the Galapagos Islands increased abruptly during the upwelling season (July through September) after the El Nino event of 1976. Sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the upwelling season also shifted after 1976. The synchroneity of the shift in both 14C and SST implies that the vertical thermal structure of the eastern tropical Pacific changed in 1976. This change may be responsible for the increase in frequency and intensity of El Nino events since 1976.
https://openalex.org/W1982474924,"Recovery from depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) in adrenal chromaffin cells was studied at differing basal [Ca2+]i or following protein kinase C (PKC) activation by phorbol esters. Following depletion, the pool size was estimated at varied times from cell capacitance jumps in response to paired depolarizations. The experimentally observed RRP recovery time course and steady-state size could be predicted from the measured [Ca2+]i signal assuming a Michaelis-Menten-type regulation of the vesicle supply by Ca2+. An elevated recruitment activity was observed at increased [Ca2+]i even when protein kinase C was blocked, but maximum effects could be obtained only after stimulation of PKC by phorbol esters or by prolonged elevations in [Ca2+]i. We suggest that, in chromaffin cells, elevated cytosolic Ca2+ modulates exocytotic plasticity via PKC-dependent and -independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1512211793,"Mice were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 30 mg/kg i.p. twice, 16 h apart). This resulted in changes in motor performance and toxic insult of nigral neurons as evidenced by dopamine depletion in nucleus caudatus putamen. In vitro and in vivo treatment of MPTP caused the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) as measured by a sensitive salicylate hydroxylation procedure. A dopamine agonist, bromocriptine (10 microM and 10 mg/kg i.p.), blocked .OH formation caused by MPTP in vitro (20 microM) and in vivo (30 mg/kg i.p.). An MPTP-induced increase in the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in substantia nigra on the seventh day was reduced by bromocriptine pretreatment. Bromocriptine blocked MPTP-induced behavioral dysfunction as well as glutathione and dopamine depletion, indicating its potent neuroprotective action. This study suggests that bromocriptine stimulates antioxidant mechanisms in the brain and acts as a free radical scavenger in addition to its action at dopamine receptors, thus indicating its strength as a valuable neuroprotectant."
https://openalex.org/W2090398095,"We find that inactivation of a Drosophila homolog of the tumor suppressor APC (D-APC) causes retinal neuronal degeneration and pigment cell hypertrophy, a phenotype remarkably similar to that found in humans with germline APC mutations. Retinal degeneration in the D-APC mutant results from apoptotic cell death, which accompanies a defect in neuronal differentiation. Reduction in the Drosophila beta-catenin, Armadillo (Arm), rescues the differentiation defect and prevents apoptosis in the D-APC mutant, while Arm overexpression mimics D-APC inactivation. A mutation in dTCF, the DNA-binding protein required in Arm-mediated signal transduction, can eliminate the cell death without rescuing the differentiation defect in D-APC mutants. Uncoupling of these two Arm-induced processes suggests a novel role for the Arm/dTCF complex in the activation of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035263031,"The cation-conducting channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor is lined by the first (M1) and second (M2) membrane-spanning segments of each of its five subunits. Six consecutive residues, alphaS239 to alphaT244, in the alpha subunit M1-M2 loop and at the intracellular end of M2 were mutated to cysteine. The accessibility of the substituted cysteines were probed with small, cationic, sulfhydryl-specific reagents added extracellularly and intracellularly. In the closed state of the channel, there is a barrier to these reagents added from either side between alphaG240 and alphaT244. ACh induces the removal of this barrier, which acts as an activation gate. The residues alphaG240, alphaE241, alphaK242, and alphaT244 line a narrow part of the channel, in which this gate is located."
https://openalex.org/W2087748087,"The solidus of a pyrolite-like composition, approximating that of the lower mantle, was measured up to 59 gigapascals by using CO2 laser heating in a diamond anvil cell. The solidus temperatures are at least 700 kelvin below the melting temperatures of magnesiowustite, which in the deep mantle has the lowest melting temperatures of the three major components-magnesiowustite, Mg-Si-perovskite, and Ca-Si-perovskite. The solidus in the deep mantle is more than 1500 kelvin above the average present-day geotherm, but at the core-mantle boundary it is near the core temperature. Thus, partial melting of the mantle is possible at the core-mantle boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1981498914,"Expression of human immunodeficiency virus–type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr after productive infection of T cells induces cell cycle arrest in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. In the absence of de novo expression, HIV-1 Vpr packaged into virions still induced cell cycle arrest. Naturally noninfectious virus or virus rendered defective for infection by reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors were capable of inducing Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest. These results suggest a model whereby both infectious and noninfectious virions in vivo, such as those surrounding follicular dendritic cells, participate in immune suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2085011262,"Zhoukoudian is widely regarded as having the oldest reliable evidence for the controlled use of fire by humans. A reexamination of the evidence in Layer 10, the earliest archaeological horizon in the site, shows that burned and unburned bones are present in the same layer with stone tools. However, no ash or charcoal remnants could be detected. Hence, although indirect evidence for burning is present, there is no direct evidence for in situ burning."
https://openalex.org/W1967108876,"We have acquired structural evidence that two components evident previously in the depolarization-evoked gating currents from voltage-gated Shaker K+ channels have their origin in sequential, two-step outward movements of the S4 protein segments. A point mutation greatly destabilizes the “fully retracted” state of S4 transmembrane translocation, causing instead an intermediate state to predominate at resting potentials. This state is distinguishable topologically and fluorometrically. That a point mutation effectively excludes half the range of S4 motion from physiological voltages suggests that the diverse sensitivities among voltage-gated channels might reflect not only differences in S4 valence, but also displacement. Existence of an intermediate subunit state helps explain why modeling channel activation has required positing greater than four closed states."
https://openalex.org/W1775874584,"Telomerase, the enzyme that elongates telomeric DNA (TTAGGG)n, may be involved in cellular immortality and oncogenesis. To investigate the effect of inhibition of telomerase on tumor cells, we transfected the antisense vector against the human telomerase RNA into human malignant glioma cells exhibiting telomerase activity. After 30 doublings, some subpopulations of transfectants expressed a high level of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) protein and underwent apoptosis. In contrast, other subpopulations also showed enhanced ICE protein but escaped from apoptotic crisis and continued to grow, although their DNA synthesis, invasive ability, and tumorigenicity in nude mice were significantly reduced. Surviving cells demonstrated increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and decreased motility, consistent with a more differentiated state. These cells also contained enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p21 and p27. Treatment of surviving nonapoptotic cells with antisense oligonucleotides against p27, but not p21, induced apoptotic cell death, suggesting that p27 may have protected differentiating glioma cells from apoptosis. These data show that treatment with antisense telomerase inhibits telomerase activity and subsequently induces either apoptosis or differentiation. Regulation of these two distinct pathways may be dependent on the expression of ICE or CDKIs.—Kondo, S., Tanaka, Y., Kondo, Y., Hitomi, M., Barnett, G.

https://openalex.org/W1537686225,"A newly identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily shows activities associated with osteoclastogenesis inhibition and fibroblast proliferation. This new member, called TR1, was identified from a search of an expressed sequence tag database, and encodes 401 amino acids with a 21-residue signal sequence. Unlike other members of TNFR, TR1 does not contain a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a 62 kDa glycoprotein. TR1 gene maps to chromosome 8q23-24.1 and its mRNA is abundantly expressed on primary osteoblasts, osteogenic sarcoma cell lines, and primary fibroblasts. The receptors for TR1 were detected on a monocytic cell line (THP-1) and in human fibroblasts. Scatchard analyses indicated two classes of high and medium-high affinity receptors with a kD of approximately 45 and 320 pM, respectively. Recombinant TR1 induced proliferation of human foreskin fibroblasts and potentiated TNF-induced proliferation in these cells. In a coculture system of osteoblasts and bone marrow cells, recombinant TR1 completely inhibited the differentiation of osteoclast-like multinucleated cell formation in the presence of several bone-resorbing factors. TR1 also strongly inhibited bone-resorbing function on dentine slices by mature osteoclasts and decreased 45Ca release in fetal long-bone organ cultures. Anti-TR1 monoclonal antibody promoted the formation of osteoclasts in mouse marrow culture assays. These results indicate that TR1 has broad biological activities in fibroblast growth and in osteoclast differentiation and its functions."
https://openalex.org/W1974889144,"Activation of adenylyl cyclase and the consequent production of cAMP is a process that has been shown to be central to invertebrate model systems of information storage. In the vertebrate brain, it has been suggested that a presynaptic cascade involving Ca influx, cAMP production, and subsequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is necessary for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the cerebellar parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapse. We have used mutant mice in which the major Ca-sensitive adenylyl cyclase isoform of cerebellar cortex (type I) is deleted to show that this results in an ∼65% reduction in cerebellar Ca-sensitive cyclase activity and a nearly complete blockade of cerebellar LTP assessed using granule cell–Purkinje cell pairs in culture. This blockade is not accompanied by alterations in a number of basal electrophysiological parameters and may be bypassed by application of an exogenous cAMP analog, suggesting that it results specifically from deletion of the type I adenylyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2148038951,"A nonpeptidyl small molecule SB 247464, capable of activating granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) signal transduction pathways, was identified in a high-throughput assay in cultured cells. Like G-CSF, SB 247464 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins and stimulated primary murine bone marrow cells to form granulocytic colonies in vitro. It also elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts in mice. The extracellular domain of the murine G-CSF receptor was required for the activity of SB 247464, suggesting that the compound acts by oligomerizing receptor chains. The results indicate that a small molecule can activate a receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1484692085,"This study investigated the sources of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolite, in the brain and blood of HIV-infected patients and retrovirus-infected macaques. In brain, quinolinic acid concentrations in HIV-infected patients were elevated by > 300-fold to concentrations that exceeded cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by 8.9-fold. There were no significant correlations between elevated serum quinolinic acid levels with those in CSF and brain parenchyma. Because nonretrovirus-induced encephalitis confounds the interpretation of human postmortem data, rhesus macaques infected with retrovirus were used to examine the mechanisms of increased quinolinic acid accumulations and determine the relationships of quinolinic acid to encephalitits and systemic responses. The largest kynurenine pathway responses in brain were associated with encephalitis and were independent of systemic responses. CSF quinolinic acid levels were also elevated in all infected macaques, but particularly those with retrovirus-induced encephalitis. In contrast to the brain changes, there was no difference in any systemic measure between macaques with encephalitis vs. those without. Direct measures of the amount of quinolinic acid in brain derived from blood in a macaque with encephalitis showed that almost all quinolinic acid (>98%) was synthesized locally within the brain. These results demonstrate a role for induction of indoleamine-2,3dioxygenase in accelerating the local formation of quinolinic acid within the brain tissue, particularly in areas of encephalitis, rather than entry of quinolinic acid into the brain from the meninges or blood. Strategies to reduce QUIN production, targeted at intracerebral sites, are potential approaches to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2037946798,"Brightness discrimination thresholds and facilitation by lateral interaction were measured in five human observers and two monkeys. The subjects judged the brightness of one of four peripherally seen lines against a reference. This experiment was performed both when the observer was cued to the position of the test line (focused attention) and when there was no cue (distributed attention). Discrimination was better with focused than with distributed attention. When the test line had a collinear flank, its brightness was enhanced; this enhancement was four times more prominent with distributed than with focused attention. After training, thresholds improved and collinear facilitation decreased under distributed but not under focused attention. The findings show that there are fewer benefits from contextual interaction once attention is directed toward a visual location, and that the attentional effects are subject to training."

This temperature is much lower than that of traditional methods. The x-ray powder diffraction patterns showed three strong peaks of diamond. The Raman spectrum showed a sharp peak at 1332 inverse centimeters, which is characteristic of diamond. Although the yield was only 2 percent, this method is a simple means of forming diamond."
https://openalex.org/W1501872126,"Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) type I has been established as an acute inhibitor of T cell activation. For this reason, we investigated the possible role of PKA type I in HIV-induced T cell dysfunction. T cells from HIV-infected patients have increased levels of cAMP and are more sensitive to inhibition by cAMP analog than are normal T cells. A PKA type I-selective antagonist increases the impaired proliferation of T cells from HIV-infected patients to normal or subnormal levels (up to 2.8-fold). Follow-up of patients after initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment revealed that a majority of patients have a persistent T cell dysfunction that is normalized by incubation of T cells with Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. These observations imply that increased activation of PKA type I may contribute to the progressive T cell dysfunction in HIV infection and that PKA type I may be a potential target for immunomodulating therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1657130262,"The 2.5 angstrom resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) α subunit amino-terminal domain (αNTD), which is necessary and sufficient to dimerize and assemble the other RNAP subunits into a transcriptionally active enzyme and contains all of the sequence elements conserved among eukaryotic α homologs, has been determined. The αNTD monomer comprises two distinct, flexibly linked domains, only one of which participates in the dimer interface. In the αNTD dimer, a pair of helices from one monomer interact with the cognate helices of the other to form an extensive hydrophobic core. All of the determinants for interactions with the other RNAP subunits lie on one face of the αNTD dimer. Sequence alignments, combined with secondary-structure predictions, support proposals that a heterodimer of the eukaryotic RNAP subunits related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb3 and Rpb11 plays the role of the αNTD dimer in prokaryotic RNAP."
https://openalex.org/W2155624357,"Nematode degenerins have been implicated in touch sensitivity and other forms of mechanosensation. Certain mutations in several degenerin genes cause the swelling, vacuolation, and death of neurons, and other mutations in the muscle degenerin gene unc-105 cause hypercontraction. Here, we confirm that unc-105 encodes an ion channel and show that it is constitutively active when mutated. These mutations disrupt different regions of the channel and have different effects on its gating. The UNC-105 channels are permeable to small monovalent cations but show voltage-dependent block by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Amiloride also produces voltage-dependent block, consistent with a single binding site 65% into the electric field. Mammalian cells expressing the mutant channels accumulate membranous whorls and multicompartment vacuoles, hallmarks of degenerin-induced cell death across species."
https://openalex.org/W2066613474,"Vacuole fusion requires Sec18p (NSF), Sec17p (α-SNAP), Ypt7p (GTP binding protein), Vam3p (t-SNARE), Nyv1p (v-SNARE), and LMA1 (l ow Mr a ctivity 1, a heterodimer of thioredoxin and IB2). LMA1 requires Sec18p for saturable, high-affinity binding to vacuoles, and Sec18p “priming” ATPase requires both Sec17p and LMA1. Either the sec18-1 mutation and deletion of IB2, or deletion of both IB2 and p13 (an IB2 homolog) causes a striking synthetic vacuole fragmentation phenotype. Upon Sec18p ATP hydrolysis, LMA1 transfers to (and stabilizes) a Vam3p complex. LMA1 is released from vacuoles in a phosphatase-regulated reaction. This LMA1 cycle explains how priming by Sec18p is coupled to t-SNARE stabilization and to fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2071848758,"In bovine chromaffin cells, the Ca2+ channels involved in exocytosis are effectively inhibited by ATP and opioids that are coreleased with catecholamines during cell activity. This autocrine loop causes a delay in Ca2+ channel activation that is quickly removed by preceding depolarizations. Changes in Ca2+ channel gating by secreted products thus make it possible to correlate Ca2+ channel activity to secretory events. Here, using cell-attached patch recordings, we found a remarkable correlation between delayed Ca2+ channel openings and neurotransmitter secretion induced by either local or whole-cell Ba2+ stimulation. The action is specific for N- and P/Q-type channels and largely prevented by PTX and mixtures of purinergic and opioid receptor antagonists. Overall, our data provide evidence that exocytosis, viewed through the autocrine inhibition of non-L-type channels, is detectable in membrane patches of ∼1 μm2 distributed over 30%–40% of the total cell surface, while Ca2+ channels and autoreceptors are uniformly distributed over most of the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2122726854,"Induction of tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR) beta-chain is believed to require its autophosphorylation at Tyr1162, Tyr1163, and Tyr1158. However, the mechanism of the initial phosphorylation is poorly understood. We show that treatment of IR-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with antioxidants inhibits insulin responsiveness. Conversely, partial inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and glutathione reductase by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), i.e., procedures that intracellularly induce mildly oxidative conditions, caused a decrease in IR beta-chain sulfhydryl groups and enhanced synergistically the induction of IR tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin. The IR beta-chain from cells treated with BSO/BCNU in the absence of insulin was not detectably tyrosine phosphorylated, but nevertheless was functionally altered, as demonstrated in vitro by a moderate kinase activity at lowATP concentrations (5 nM) and a strong kinase activity at 25 microM ATP. This activity was found to be specific for tyrosine (not for serine or threonine), and tryptic peptide maps indicated that it is more selective than that induced by insulin. Moreover, the kinase activity from BSO/BCNU-treated cells showed a spontaneous decay that was not prevented by the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate. Together, these results suggest that optimal insulin responsiveness may require a process of 'redox priming' of the IR beta-chain that involves structural and functional changes in the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-chain."
https://openalex.org/W2019495983,"Phosphoinositides function as important second messengers in a wide range of cellular processes. Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (IPP) is an enzyme essential for the hydrolysis of the 1-phosphate from either Ins(1,4)P2 or Ins(1,3,4)P3. This enzyme is Li+ sensitive, and is one of the proposed targets of Li+ therapy in manic-depressive illness. Drosophila ipp mutants accumulate IP2 in their system and are incapable of metabolizing exogenous Ins(1,4)P2. Notably, ipp mutants demonstrate compensatory upregulation of an alternative branch in the inositol-phosphate metabolism tree, thus providing a means of ensuring continued availability of inositol. We demonstrate that ipp mutants have a defect in synaptic transmission resulting from a dramatic increase in the probability of vesicle release at larval neuromuscular junctions. We also show that Li+ phenocopies this effect in wild-type synapses. Together, these results support a role for phosphoinositides in synaptic vesicle function in vivo and mechanistically question the ""lithium hypothesis."""
https://openalex.org/W1492528732,"Implantation is characterized by an inflammatory-like response with expansion of extracellular fluid volume, increased vascular permeability, and vasodilatation. These effects are believed to be mediated at the paracrine level by prostaglandin E2 and platelet-activating factor (PAF), but the cellular mechanism (or mechanisms) remains largely unknown. We demonstrate that PAF receptor (PAF-R) immunoreactivity and mRNA are detected in proliferative and secretory endometrial glands, however, the responsiveness of endometrium to physiological concentrations of PAF is confined predominantly to the secretory endometrium. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that PAF-R transcript levels were highest in the mid-late proliferative and late secretory phases of the cycle. Interaction of PAF with its receptor resulted in the rapid release of nitric oxide (NO), increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and activation of FAKpp125, a focal adhesion kinase, demonstrating that the PAF-R is functionally active. Inhibition of NO synthesis by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine produced dose-dependent attenuation of PAF-evoked NO release, indicating NOS activation; the dependency of PAF-evoked NO release on PKC and extracellular Ca2+ was confirmed by PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 and by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. PAF up-regulated VEGF gene expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion in human endometrial epithelial cell lysates. Transcription of VEGF was rapidly followed by secretion of the protein. These data support our premise that this autocoid acts as an angiogenic mediator in the regeneration of the endometrium after menses and as a vasodilator to promote blastocyst attachment during the implantation process."
https://openalex.org/W1855016271,"The purpose of our study was to determine the mechanism through which phorbol esters and smooth muscle myosin phosphatase inhibitors can induce contraction of smooth muscle in the absence of Ca2+. Protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC-epsilon) was previously implicated in this process based largely on its supposed absence in the ferret portal vein, and a correlation was drawn between the presence of this isoform and the ability of smooth muscle to contract independently of Ca2+ and phosphorylation of the 20 kDa regulatory light chains of myosin (MLC20). We demonstrate here, with two antibodies, one to the NH2 terminus and the other to the COOH terminus of PKC-epsilon, that epsilon is present in both ferret portal vein and rabbit portal vein smooth muscle, neither of which exhibits phorbol ester-induced contraction in the absence of Ca2+. However, in the presence of clamped submaximal Ca2+, phorbol es ter increased MLC20 phosphorylation from 17.7+/-1.7% to 46.4+/-3.6% in ferret portal vein smooth muscle and evoked an increase in force. Prolonged (48 h) incubation of ferret portal vein with phorbol esters completely down-regulated PKC-epsilon, as shown by Western blots, and abolished the phorbol ester-evoked contraction at submaximal Ca2+, but not Ca2+-independent, contractions induced by the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin. Contractions induced by microcystin in Ca2+-free solution were associated with increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activation of MLCK by autophosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+ occurs in vitro (1). We conclude that PKC-epsilon is neither necessary nor sufficient for Ca2+-independent regulation of myosin II in smooth muscle, but contractions induced by agents that inhibit smooth muscle myosin phosphatase in the absence of Ca2+ may be mediated by MLCK autophosphorylated or activated by another Ca2+-independent kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2116244572,"Human low density lipoprotein (LDL) is prepared in the presence of antioxidants and is oxidized to different levels (measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) with copper ion. The effects of unoxidized LDL and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) on stress fiber formation, cell membrane ruffling, and pinocytosis (measured by [14C]sucrose uptake) in cultured human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (EC) are compared. We show that at a concentration range of 100 to 200 microg cholesterol/ml, both unoxidized LDL and ox-LDL promote EC elongation and stress fiber formation, but the effect by the latter is more prominent when compared at the same dose range. In addition, ox-LDL also induces EC membrane ruffling and promotes pinocytosis. These effects are positively correlated with the extent of LDL oxidation and depend on the dose of ox-LDL. Ox-LDL-promoted membrane ruffling and pinocytosis are effectively blocked by brief preexposure of the cells to antioxidants. In contrast, stress fiber formation is not affected by antioxidant pretreatment. Although unoxidized LDL also promotes [14C]sucrose uptake, it is less potent than ox-LDL and significantly higher concentrations are required to produce a detectable effect. Unlike ox-LDL, unoxidized LDL-enhanced pinocytosis is not accompanied by the appearance of membrane ruffling; therefore, they may act via different mechanisms. Elevated pinocytosis may increase transcytotic activity of the endothelium, leading to an increased influx of plasma components such as LDL into the subendothelial space."
https://openalex.org/W1518983382,"In avian species such as the chicken, development of the oocyte is associated with massive deposition of yolk in this cell. Oocytes grow within the follicle, a compartment consisting of a very specialized set of cells and acellular structures. The oocyte is surrounded by the perivitelline layer and granulosa cells, which are separated from the thecae by a pronounced basement membrane. In addition to the production of yolk precursors in the liver, we have long implied that cells within the follicle make a direct contribution to the growth of the oocyte. Here we show that chicken granulosa cells express and actively secrete apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) as a part of particles with very high density. The granulosa cell-derived, apoA-I-containing material is different from the small portion of yolk high density lipoprotein that arises via transfer from the peripheral circulation. We propose that the ApoA-I-containing particles secreted by granulosa cells 1) support the growth of the rapidly growing germ cell, possibly by direct lipid transfer to the plasma membrane of the oocyte, and/or 2) deliver cholesteryl esters to the steroid-producing cells of the theca layer. These findings are discussed with respect to the proposed functions of apoE (an apolipoprotein not found in chicken) within the mammalian follicle."
