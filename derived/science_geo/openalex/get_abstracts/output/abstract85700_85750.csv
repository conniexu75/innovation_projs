https://openalex.org/W2062984171,"The fate of the transferrin receptor during in vitro maturation of sheep reticulocytes has been followed using FITC- and 125I-labeled anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies. Vesicles containing peptides that comigrate with the transferrin receptor on polyacrylamide gels are released during incubation of sheep reticulocytes, tagged with anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies. Vesicle formation does not require the presence of the anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies. Using 125I-surface-labeled reticulocytes, it can be shown that the 125I-labeled material which is released is retained by an immunoaffinity column of the anti-transferrin-receptor antibody. Using reticulocytes tagged with 125I-labeled anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies to follow the formation of vesicles, it can be shown that at 0 degree C or in phosphate-buffered saline the rate of vesicle release is less than that at 37 degrees C in culture medium. There is selective externalization of the antibody-receptor complex since few other membrane proteins are found in the externalized vesicles. The anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies cause redistribution of the receptor into patches that do not appear to be required for vesicle formation."

https://openalex.org/W1988832534,"Protein phosphorylation is a principal regulatory mechanism in the control of almost all cellular processes. The nature of the protein phosphatases that participate in these reactions has been a subject of controversy. Four enzymes, termed protein phosphatases 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C, account for virtually all of the phosphatase activity toward phosphoproteins involved in controlling glycogen metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, and protein synthesis. The properties, physiological roles, and mechanisms for regulating the four protein phosphatases are reviewed."

https://openalex.org/W2056041200,"PDGF is a connective tissue mitogen that has been associated with clotted blood serum for at least 300 million years. It regulates the expression of cell cycle ""early genes"" in normal fibroblasts. Induction of early genes is preceded by stimulation of a tyrosine-specific kinase. The putative structural gene for PDGF has been acquired by an acutely transforming retrovirus and is expressed in many connective tissue tumors. Further work is needed to determine whether (i) production of PDGF by tumor cells confers a proliferative advantage on these cells, (ii) tyrosine-specific phosphorylations mediate the induction of cell cycle early genes by PDGF, and (iii) products of cell cycle early genes play any functional role in the 10-12 hr chain of events that culminates in replicative DNA synthesis and cell division. In the meantime, these very issues represent candidate functions for other viral oncogenes and their cellular homologs. Some of these genes could act at the onset of the mitogenic cascade by causing the production of automitogenic growth factors. Others may function in the interior of the cascade by promoting tyrosine-specific phosphorylations. Still others may be mutated or rearranged homologs of cell cycle early genes whose expression is normally modulated by extracellular growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2022932732,"Biochemical transformation of thymidine-kinase-deficient (TK−) mouse L cells is enhanced 20 to 40 fold when microinjected plasmid DNA contains regions of the genomes of Rous sarcoma virus or simian virus 40 in addition to the complete herpes simplex virus tk gene, irrespective of the orientation and location of the enhancer. The enhancing sequence of RSV DNA has been localized to 143 bp that include 88 bp at the 5′ end of the long terminal repeat; the enhancing segment of SV40 DNA lies 42–276 bp upstream from the initiation site for early transcription. The RSV enhancer does not provide a favored integration site within microinjected plasmids and does not affect the frequency of integration into host cell DNA. When microinjected cells were grown into cell lines in nonselective medium, few cells containing integrated HSV tk without RSV DNA could grow in selective medium. In contrast, over 80% of cells from lines containing the HSV tk gene linked to the RSV enhancer could grow in selective medium. Thus the RSV enhancer affects the expression rather than the integration of the tk gene."

https://openalex.org/W1530273007,"The aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli is branched. In aerobically grown cells harvested in midexponential phase, a respiratory chain containing only b-type cytochromes is predominant. This chain contains a terminal oxidase which is a b-type cytochrome, referred to as cytochrome o. However, when the bacteria are grown under conditions of oxygen limitation, additional components of the respiratory chain are induced, as evidenced by the appearance of new spectroscopic species. These include a new b-type cytochrome, cytochrome b558, as well as cytochrome a1 and cytochrome d. In this paper, a purification protocol and the initial characterization of the terminal oxidase complex containing cytochrome d are reported. Solubilization of the membrane is effected by Zwittergent 3-12, and purification is accomplished by chromatography with DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and hydroxyapatite. The complex contains cytochrome b558, a1, and d. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indicates that the complex contains only two types of polypeptides with the molecular weights estimated to be 57,000 and 43,000. The purified complex has oxidase activity in the presence of detergents, utilizing substrates including ubinquinol-1, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. The cytochrome d complex contains protoheme IX and iron, but does not contain nonheme iron or copper. Approximately half of the cytochromes which are thought to participate in E. coli aerobic respiration are accounted for by this single complex. These results suggest that the E. coli aerobic respiratory chain is organized around a relatively small number of cytochrome-containing complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1519160353,"Mitochondrial DNA was quantitated in total DNA of various normal and mutant strains of human diploid fibroblasts (finite replicative lifespan) and permanent cell lines, using Southern-transfer hybridization to 32P-labeled pure mtDNA probe and saturation hybridization to 3H-labeled cRNA copied from mtDNA. In six normal fibroblast strains, mtDNA copy number increased during serial passage roughly in proportion to cell volume or protein content, whereas normalized mtDNA content per pg of protein depended upon in vivo donor age but not passage level (in vitro age). Copy numbers for mtDNA varied much more widely in individual fibroblast clones than in mass cultures, but were not well correlated with longevity or growth rate. Five mutant fibroblast strains associated with reduced replicative lifespan, and four permanent cell lines, were also examined; in each group, mtDNA values were observed both lower and higher than any obtained for normal fibroblasts. No evidence was found of petite-type deletions from human mtDNA, either at late passage or in individual clones of fibroblasts. Methylation of mtDNA genomes was strikingly non-random and apparently decreased with culture age."
https://openalex.org/W1594694014,"Two molecular species of calpain (Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteinases) were concurrently purified from rat kidney, both to homogeneity. Calpain I and calpain II having low and high Ca2+ requirements, respectively, were clearly separated on DEAE-cellulose chromatography at pH 7.5, and thereafter they were purified by separate but almost identical procedures which included (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and successive chromatographies on TSK-Gel G 3000 SWG, blue Sepharose CL-6B, and DEAE-Bio-Gel A. The purification folds and activity yields were 6170-fold and 17.8% for calpain I and 4160-fold and 11.9% for calpain II. Ca2+ concentrations for half-maximal activation were 2 microM for calpain I and 200 microM for calpain II. The specific activity of calpain II on casein as the substrate was more than twice higher than that of calpain I. Both enzymes are heterodimers, each composed of 80,000-Da and 25,000-Da subunits. The amino acid compositions of calpain I and calpain II are very similar but not identical. Calpain II is more acidic (pI 4.6) than calpain I (pI 5.3). This paper is the first to describe parallel isolation and characterization of low and high Ca2+-requiring proteases from one single nonmuscular tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2123874680,Abstract The property of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases to catalyze 3'-P--O bond cleavage and the insertion of a single nonexchangeable atom of 18O from [18O]water into the phosphoryl of the 5'-nucleotide product has been utilized as a means for measuring the hydrolytic flux of cGMP and cAMP in isolated dark-adapted intact rabbit retinas. Without illumination 18O labeling of guanine nucleotide (GTP and GDP) alpha-phosphoryls proceeds linearly for at least 80 s at a rate of 3.3 nmol of 18O/s.g of retina (wet weight). This rate is estimated to be approximately 8 times greater in the rod outer segment layer where over 90% of retinal cGMP metabolic components reside. Photic stimulation during a 20-s incubation was provided by intermittent flashes of light representing 800 ms of total illumination. Light stimuli over a range of intensities of greater than 3 log units commencing with a minimally detectable intensity produce graded increments in the rate of 18O incorporation into guanine nucleotide alpha-phosphoryls to a maximum increase of 5-fold. On the basis of only the 800-ms period of illumination this maximum increase is 125-fold. Steady state levels of retinal cGMP are not altered appreciably over this greater than 3 log range of light intensities but a light stimulus exceeding this intensity range causes an approximate 50% decrease in retinal cGMP concentration and a relative decline in the maximal rate of 18O labeling of guanine nucleotide alpha-phosphoryls. No light-related increases were detected in 18O incorporation into adenine nucleotide alpha-phosphoryls nor the gamma-phosphoryls of GTP or ATP or Pi. These observations indicate that light stimuli over greater than 3 log of light intensity produce incremental increases in cGMP metabolic flux that result from comparable increases in the rates of both cGMP generation and cGMP hydrolysis. It is postulated that increases in cGMP metabolic flux rather than changes in cGMP steady state levels are integral to phototransduction by a mechanism that involves the coupling of cGMP synthesis and/or hydrolysis to either the release of calcium from disc membranes or the inhibition of Na+ conductance by the photoreceptor membrane. This is suggested to occur by an energy-linked process and/or the generation of protons.
https://openalex.org/W2002397775,"Two regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus were tested for their ability to enhance transcription of the SV40 early promoter. A portion of the intervening sequence between the heavy chain joining region (Jh) and the constant region of the mu chain (Cmu) can enhance transcription when it is cloned either 5' or 3' to the SV40 early promoter. The region between C alpha and the alpha switch site, which occurs 5' to the translocated c-myc oncogene in many murine plasmacytomas, does not show transcriptional enhancer activity in this assay."
https://openalex.org/W2000185263,"The subcellular localization of the 34 kd protein substrate of the pp60src kinase was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. When permeabilized fibroblasts were stained with a monoclonal anti-34 kd protein antibody, a diffuse reticular pattern was observed. The 34 kd protein was not exposed on the outside surface of the cell. Double immunofluorescence staining experiments established that the 34 kd protein distribution was similar to that of the membrane-associated protein α-spectrin. The 34 kd protein was found in cell sections to be concentrated along the cell edges. Taken together, these results suggested that the 34 kd pp60src substrate was associated with the inside surface of the plasma membrane. This conclusion was supported by subcellular fractionation experiments in which the 34 kd protein was observed to fractionate with the plasma membrane. These localization studies support further the hypothesis that many of the primary effects of the pp60src kinase occur at the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1495494427,"In freshly isolated parenchymal hepatocytes of adult rats, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Ip) did not stimulate cAMP formation, protein kinase activity, or glycogenolysis, although glucagon markedly stimulated all these activities. However, the beta-adrenergic response appeared when rat hepatocytes were cultured as monolayers. This response had already appeared after 2-h culture and increased during further culture. The appearance of the beta-adrenergic response during culture was blocked by cycloheximide, actinomycin D, or alpha-amanitin. Thus adult rat hepatocytes acquired marked ability to respond to Ip during culture through the syntheses of mRNA and protein. Freshly isolated hepatocytes from postnatal rats showed a high beta-adrenergic response that did not increase further during culture. This response gradually decreased during development and had almost disappeared about 60 days after birth. In plasma membranes prepared from freshly isolated cells of adult rats the basal and NaF-stimulated activities of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) were similar to those of cultured cells and the enzyme activity was also stimulated by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. However, in plasma membranes of freshly isolated cells Ip scarcely stimulated adenylate cyclase, but glucagon did. The intact cells, whether they were freshly isolated or cultured, accumulated cAMP when exposed to cholera toxin. Moreover, the two subunits of GTP-binding regulatory protein (also named G/F or Ns site) were detected by [32P]ADP ribosylation with cholera toxin and [32P]NAD+ in freshly isolated cells as well as in cultured cells. These results indicate that freshly isolated and cultured hepatocytes of adult rats contain sufficient levels of all the components of the postreceptor-adenylate cyclase system for activity. However, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors measured by binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, was very low in purified plasma membranes of freshly isolated cells (20 fmol/mg of protein), and the number increased about 6-fold without change in the dissociation constant (Kd = 132 pM) when the cells were cultured for 7 h. This increase in beta-adrenergic receptor sites was completely abolished by cycloheximide and alpha-amanitin. Thus it is concluded that the unresponsiveness of adult rat hepatocytes to Ip was due to a very low amount of beta-adrenergic receptor and that the appearance of a beta-adrenergic response during primary culture was due to new synthesis of beta-adrenergic receptor through synthesis of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1512078715,"Abstract Two forms (CANP1 and CANP2) of a calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP) have been purified, 1,950- and 1,250-fold, respectively, to near homogeneity from calf brain. The purification procedure involves ammonium sulfate fractionation of the brain cytosol followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite, and alpha-casein-CH-Sepharose 4B affinity gel. A protein with apparent Mr = 17,000 copurifies with each of the proteases. This protein was separated by chromatography on a reactive red-120 agarose. Preliminary experiments indicate that, in the absence of this protein, the activity of each of the proteases was reduced. These observations raise the possibility that the 17,000-Da protein may regulate the activity of these proteases. Each of the proteases have similar apparent Mr = 78,000 as judged on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Except for casein, hemocyanin, and hemoglobin, no other exogenous proteins tested were significantly hydrolyzed by either of the proteases. [ methyl-14C ]alpha-Casein or methemoglobin was routinely used as a substrate for both of the enzymes. The endogenous proteins, neurotubules (microtubule-associated proteins and tubulin), neurofilament triplet proteins and desmin from smooth muscle were extensively hydrolyzed by both of the proteases. A marked difference was found in their requirement for CaCl2. CANP1 was maximally active at 700 microM while CANP2 exhibited highest activity at 2 microM CaCl2. Both displayed maximum activity at pH 7.5, although the overall pH profiles were slightly different. Among the actinomycete protease inhibitors, antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin, leupeptin was highly effective in inhibiting the activities of both enzymes. Both of the proteases were also inhibited by sulfhydryl modifying agents. Metal ions other than CaCl2 were poor activators of the activity of either protease."

https://openalex.org/W2167591082,"Five random subclones of the rat fibroblast line F2408 vary in their frequency of transformation by the unrelated Kirsten murine sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus. The same pattern of sensitivity is displayed when the cells are induced to anchorage-independent growth (transformed) by epidermal, platelet-derived, and sarcoma growth factors, or by whole serum. Our results demonstrate that a growth factor's ability to render cells anchorage independent is not unique to transforming growth factors, but common to many growth factors; anchorage-independent growth is a function of the total growth factor concentration in the medium; cells vary in their inherent responsiveness to growth-factor-induced anchorage-independent growth; and cells resistant to growth-factor-induced anchorage-independent growth are also resistant to transformation by a variety of tumor viruses. We conclude that the way a cell responds to growth factors plays a central role in the expression of the transformed phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1591932185,"The properties of interaction of both tetrodotoxin (TTX) and tritiated ethylenediamine tetrodotoxin [3H] en-TTX) were studied in rat heart membranes at different stages of development and in cultured cells. Studies by electrophysiology and by 22Na+ flux measurements on cardiac cultured cells indicate that the functional form of the Na+ channel is of low affinity for TTX (250-700 nM). Binding experiments (bioassay and [3H]en-TTX binding) on cultured cardiac cells from newborn rats indicate the presence of both high and low affinity binding sites for TTX with dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.6 and 135 nM, respectively. On homogenates of hearts taken just after birth, [3H]en-TTX binding reveals no high affinity binding site for TTX but the presence of a low affinity binding site with a Kd of 125 nM. This result was confirmed by kinetic studies and competition experiments. Conversely, binding studies on homogenates and extensively purified membranes from adult ventricles reveal the presence of both high and low affinity binding sites for TTX with Kd values of 1.5 and 170 nM, respectively. The maximum binding capacity for the low affinity binding sites is 45 times higher than that of the high affinity binding sites. High affinity sites do not exist at the fetal stage or at birth, but after 5 days their number gradually increases to reach a maximum level around 45 days after birth. Conversely, the number of low affinity binding sites is essentially invariant between birth and adulthood. Monolayers of cardiac cells from hearts at 2 days after birth which have no high affinity TTX-binding sites in vivo develop both high and low affinity binding sites for TTX in vitro. The results presented here are the first direct demonstration of the coexistence in rat heart plasma membrane of two families of binding sites for TTX."

Analysis of the purified receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and silver staining showed a major band of Mr = 210,000 (Mr = 250,000 after reduction with dithiothreitol). When 125I-MSA was chemically cross-linked to the purified receptor and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis (with and without dithiothreitol) and autoradiography, the radioactive bands coincided with the Mr = 210,000 and 250,000 bands identified by silver staining. The purified receptor also appeared to contain an Mr = less than 68,000 species identified by silver staining in addition to the Mr = 250,000 binding component. IGF-I, IGF-II, and MSA-II inhibited binding of 125I-MSA to the purified receptor with the same relative potency as for binding to the intact chondrosarcoma cell (IGF-II greater than MSA-II greater than IGF-I), and insulin did not inhibit binding. The association constant (K alpha) for MSA-II binding to the purified receptor was 2 X 10(9) M-1. The purified receptor bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose and wheat germ lectin-Sepharose columns and was eluted with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, respectively, showing that the receptor is a glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1493393474,"The in vivo and in vitro synthesis and turnover of dolichol and dolichyl phosphate have been studied over the course of early development in sea urchin embryos. Synthesis of dolichol and dolichyl phosphate was studied in vivo and in vitro using [3H]acetate and [14C] isopentenylpyrophosphate, respectively, as precursors. Both the in vivo and in vitro results indicate that the principal labeled end product of de novo synthesis is the free alcohol, and that this alcohol is subsequently phosphorylated to produce dolichyl phosphate. The presence of 30 microM compactin inhibits the de novo synthesis of dolichol from [3H]acetate by greater than 90%, but has no effect on the incorporation of 32Pi into dolichyl phosphate for more than 6 h, thus suggesting that during this time interval the major source of dolichyl phosphate is preformed dolichol. The rate of turnover of the [3H]acetate-labeled polyisoprenoid backbone of dolichyl phosphate is very slow (t1/2 = 40-70 h). In contrast, the rate of loss of the [32P]phosphate headgroup is more rapid (t1/2 = 5.7-7.7 h) and increases over the course of development. Finally, dolichyl phosphate phosphatase activity has been measured in vitro. The activity of this enzyme, which can be distinguished from phosphatidic acid phosphatase, was found to increase as a function of development, in qualitative agreement with the increased turnover of 32P from dolichyl phosphate observed in vivo. These results suggest that the phosphate moiety of dolichyl phosphate is in a dynamic state, and that dolichol kinase and dolichyl phosphate phosphatase play key roles in regulating the cellular level of dolichyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1531750599,"24-Keto-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been identified as an intestinal metabolite of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by ultraviolet absorbance, mass spectroscopy, and chemical reactivity. The metabolite was produced from 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,24R,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 in rat intestinal mucosa homogenates. 24-Keto-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is present in vivo in the plasma and small intestinal mucosa of rats fed a stock diet, receiving no exogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and in the plasma and small intestinal mucosa of rats dosed chronically with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. 24-Keto-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has affinity equivalent to 1,24R,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 for the 3.7 S cytosolic receptor specific for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the intestine and thymus. In cytosolic preparations contaminated with the 5 S vitamin D-binding protein, both metabolites are about 7-fold less potent than 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In contrast, in cytosolic preparations largely free of the 5 S binding protein, both metabolites are equipotent with the parent compound. No evidence was obtained supporting a substantial presence of 23-keto-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in vivo; nor was the latter compound generated in detectable amounts from 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by intestinal homogenates. Thus, C-24 oxidation is a significant pathway of intestinal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism that produces metabolites with high affinity for the cytosolic receptor which mediates vitamin D action."
https://openalex.org/W1578533950,"A monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor of A431 cells was obtained after fusion of immunized BALB/c mouse spleen cells with NS-1 myeloma cells. Specific binding of the antibody to the plasma membrane of A431 cells was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The antibody did not react with human KB cells, normal rat kidney cells, or Swiss 3T3 cells. The antibody is an IgG3K; it specifically immunoprecipitated a Mr approximately 170,000 protein from radiolabeled A431 cell extracts. This protein is phosphorylated in a EGF-dependent manner in intact A431 cells and in Triton X-100-solubilized plasma membranes. The specificity of the interaction of the antibody with the Mr = 170,000 protein was confirmed by electrophoretic transfer of A431 cell proteins to nitrocellulose followed by incubation with the antibody and 125I-protein A. When 125I-EGF was covalently cross-linked to its receptor, the 125I-EGF-receptor complex was specifically precipitated by the antibody. The monoclonal antibody did not inhibit the binding of 125I-EGF to its receptor in intact A431 cells and also failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of the Triton X-100-solubilized EGF receptor. The results indicate that the antibody and EGF bind to different sites on the EGF receptor. The antibody will be useful for isolating the EGF receptor in an unactivated form."
https://openalex.org/W1963498189,"We describe an assay procedure to quantitate relative DI resistance of a variety of DI particle resistant (Sdi-) mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). We show that numerous diverse Sdi- mutants of VSV are selected continuously in a stepwise manner during persistent infections, and also during serial undiluted lytic passages initiated with cloned virus. Concurrently with the successive appearance and disappearance of different Sdi- mutants of infectious VSV, new DI particle types with altered interference properties also appear and disappear, resulting in rapid ""coevolution"" of virus and DI particle populations. Complementation tests with Sdi- mutants indicate that mutations in at least two different virus factors (presumably associated with replication-encapsidation) can give rise to Sdi- mutants. Interference studies with chimeric DI particles indicate that DI particle template RNA rather than DI particle protein determines the interference properties of DI particles interacting with Sdi- and Sdi+ mutants of helper virus."
https://openalex.org/W1540094397,"We sequenced 487 base pairs (bp) covering the 5' end of chicken vitellogenin II gene and 840 bp of its 5' end-flanking region. This region includes a MspI/HpaII restriction site which becomes undermethylated in chicken liver upon estrogen treatment. Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme digests of total DNA confirms that this undermethylation site is the one situated at -611 bp from the cap sequence. This site is flanked at nucleotides -567, -629, and -667 by stretches of DNA very rich in A + T. We used S1 nuclease mapping as well as a primer extension procedure to map the transcription starting point of the vitellogenin II gene. We found a 5'CATAAAA3' box between nucleotides -32 and -26, and between nucleotides -77 and -69 a sequence (5'TTGAGAATT3') homologous to the bacterial RNA polymerase-binding site. A similar sequence (5'TGTTTACATAAA3') is also found between nucleotides -101 and -90. A comparison of the sequence of the primer-extended DNA with the 5' end of vitellogenin II gene revealed the presence of two small exons of 53 and 21 bp between nucleotides +1 and +53, and +169 and +189, respectively, and two small introns of 115 and 100 bp between nucleotides +54 and +168, and +190 and +290, respectively. The first AUG at nucleotide +14 is in front of an open reading frame. We found that 77% of the amino acids coded by the first exon are hydrophobic, a feature compatible with a signal sequence of a secreted protein such as vitellogenin."
https://openalex.org/W1549264844,"Calcium-activated neutral protease has been purified partially from A431-V1 cells, a high passage variant of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells having extraordinary activity of this protease. This activity cleaves Mr = 160,000 epidermal growth factor receptors, converting them to a Mr = 145,000 form in detergent-treated membrane preparations, but not in intact cells or membrane vesicles. Properties of this activity, including molecular weight, resemble those of previously described Ca2+-activated neutral proteases. A431-V1 cell Ca2+-activated neutral protease action on epidermal growth factor receptors required 0.5 mM Ca2+ for half-maximal activity and the optimal pH was 6.5. Degradation was inhibited completely by Ca2+ chelators (EDTA and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) and sulfhydryl group specific reagents (iodoacetate and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid] and was inhibited partially by leupeptin. Degradation of epidermal growth factor receptors by Ca2+-activated neutral protease or trypsin was compared in intact cells, membrane vesicles, detergent-solubilized membranes, and membranes subjected to hypotonic shock in solutions containing protease. Results support the hypothesis that protease-susceptible domains of epidermal growth factor receptors, including the Ca2+-activated neutral protease-sensitive domain, are located on the cytosolic surface. The localization of Ca2+-activated neutral protease in A431-V1 cells is entirely cytosolic, making it available in cells to the protease-susceptible site on epidermal growth factor receptor substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1572201679,"Recent interest in the modulation of ionic conductances in excitable membranes, particularly K+ conductances, has focused on biochemical mechanisms such as protein phosphorylation. Several distinct types of voltage-dependent K+ currents (e.g. transient, delayed, and Ca2+-dependent) can be separated by electrophysiological and pharmacological means. We have found that two treatments, 4-aminopyridine and high external K+, which preferentially reduce the transient K+ current also reduce the level of 32P incorporation in a 25,000 molecular weight phosphoprotein band in eyes and ganglia of the nudibranch mollusc Hermissenda crassicornis. The effect of agents which reduce the transient K+ current is relatively specific because 32P incorporation in this band is not significantly affected by Ba2+ which preferentially blocks the delayed K+ current, or by Ni2+, which blocks the Ca2+ channel and in turn inhibits the Ca2+-dependent K+ current. Additional studies indicate that a change in endogenous impulse activity is not required for the expression of the 4-aminopyridine effect on protein phosphorylation. The concentration dependence and time course of the 4-aminopyridine effect on 32P incorporation are in reasonable agreement with those reported for the blockade of the transient K+ current by 4-aminopyridine. Following removal of 4-aminopyridine, 32P incorporation increases in the 25,000 molecular weight phosphoprotein band and in a 23,000 molecular weight Ca2+-stimulated phosphoprotein band. The data presented here suggest that there is a relationship between the transient K+ current and the state of phosphorylation of specific neuronal proteins in Hermissenda and point to further studies to identify the phosphoproteins and the mechanism which leads to the observed changes in protein phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1587610871,"Minicells from Escherichia coli DS410 harboring cDNA for human interferon (IFN) alpha 1 or alpha 2 were metabolically labeled with [3H]leucine and the radioactive IFN was purified to homogeneity by immune precipitation with anti-IFN-alpha serum. These preparations of radioactive IFN-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 were used to study the binding on two human (FL and Daudi) and one bovine (MDBK) cell lines. IFN-alpha 2 specifically bound well to both human and bovine cells, while IFN-alpha 1 bound very poorly to human cells but well to bovine cells. Specific binding of radioactive IFN-alpha 2 to these cell lines was completely inhibited by not only nonradioactive IFN-alpha 2 but also IFN-alpha 1, and binding of IFN-alpha 1 to bovine cell was also competed by IFN-alpha 2 as well as IFN-alpha 1, indicating that the receptors for both IFNs are identical. However, 50-100-fold (on human cells) or 4-fold (on bovine cell) more nonradioactive IFN-alpha 1 than -alpha 2 was required to inhibit the binding of radioactive IFN-alpha 2 to the receptors. Scatchard analysis showed that IFN-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 bind to the receptors on human cells with an apparent Kd of greater than 6 X 10(-10) and 3 X 10(-11) M, respectively, while on bovine cells with a Kd of 4.2 X 10(-11) and 1.6 X 10(-11) M, respectively. These results show that the different target cell specificity of IFN-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 in regard to antiviral activity (Streuli, M., Hall, A., Boll, W., Stewart, W. E., II, Nagata, S., and Weissmann, C. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 2848-2852) is due to the different binding activity of IFN-alpha molecules to their common receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2033437477,"Thrombin, the central regulatory enzyme in coagulation, when incubated in nanomolar concentrations with murine neuroblastoma cells produced a rapid and marked increase in tritiated guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) formation that was blocked by hirudin and competitively antagonized by dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide. Diisopropylphosphofluoridate-inactivated thrombin as well as the serine protease trypsin were markedly less potent and less effective than α-thrombin in producing this effect. Thrombin-stimulated cyclic GMP formation was inhibited by mepacrine and nordihydroguaiaretic acid but unaffected by indomethacin, suggesting that lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid are involved in the response. These results suggest that a thrombin-like protease in the brain may be involved with the function of neurons or that thrombin interactions with nerve cells, such as those following cerebral hemorrhage or other trauma of the central nervous system, may be important in the subsequent neuropathology."

The tetramers and dimers were analyzed for variants, ubiquitin adducts, and proteolyzed forms. The minor histone variants H2A.X and H2A.Z were found to be associated with histone H2B as H2A.X:H2B and H2A.Z:H2B dimers, respectively. Ubiquitin adducts of the H2A's and H2B were also present in H2A:H2B dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1500502002,"The state of DNA methylation around prostatic steroid-binding protein genes has been investigated at CCGG sites by using the restriction enzymes MspI and HpaII. In the ventral prostate, these sites change from being completely methylated around the C1, C2, and one of two C3 genes in 10-day-old animals to being unmethylated in 28-day-old animals. The second C3 gene is always methylated and probably transcriptionally inactive, and all four genes are hypermethylated in other tissues. Hormone withdrawal from mature animals results in methylation of approximately 50% of CCGG sites in the ventral prostate which correlates with an increase in the number of stromal cells relative to epithelial cells. This suggests that the state of DNA methylation in epithelial cells, where prostatic steroid-binding protein is expressed, is unchanged. Thus, the inverse correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation is valid during development but probably not during subsequent hormone withdrawal."

We have examined the conformation of the vitellogenin genes in chromatin and the methylation state of one vitellogenin gene during the process of estrogen stimulation and withdrawal. Sensitivity of the vitellogenin genes to DNase I digestion parallels transcription. The vitellogenin genes are insensitive to DNase I digestion in unstimulated liver cells, become more sensitive to DNase I digestion following estrogen activation of vitellogenin gene transcription, and are insensitive to DNase I digestion in liver cells withdrawn from estrogen. In contrast, the methylation state of nine potential methylation sites within the vitellogenin A1 gene is identical in red blood cells, unstimulated and withdrawn liver, estrogen-stimulated liver, and hepatocytes purified from estrogen-stimulated liver. Rapid transcription of the vitellogenin genes in estrogen-stimulated liver cells occurs with six of the nine methylation sites examined fully methylated."
https://openalex.org/W1608225079,"In wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fructose-6-P is known to be in much lower amounts than needed to saturate fructose-6-P 1-kinase in vitro, and the same is true for a mutant with reduced affinity for fructose-6-P, even though its in vivo fructose-6-P concentration is much higher than normal. Both the wild type and mutant fructose-6-P 1-kinases were activated in vitro by fructose-2,6-P2 in the 0.1 microM concentration range, and the effector was present in more than adequate amounts. Hence, it is likely to be necessary for sufficient flux through the fructose-6-P 1-kinase reaction in vivo, and the data also fit with fructose-2,6-P2 acting at different sites on the enzyme from fructose-6-P. In growth on glucose, a variety of wild type strains contained 5-10 microM fructose-2,6-P2, and various fructose-6-P 1-kinase mutant strains had levels of up to 150 microM in the presence of glucose. Fructose-2,6-P2 was also found (0.5-10 microM) in derepressed cultures after glucose exhaustion and in growth on pyruvate. Activities of fructose-6-P 2-kinase in the various strains and situations are also presented. The data generally indicate a correlation between levels of fructose-2,6-P2 and fructose-6-P and suggest that fructose-2,6-P2 is not rapidly degraded after glucose exhaustion."
https://openalex.org/W1552137151,"Vitamin D3 is known to stimulate the absorption of calcium across the asymmetric intestinal epithelial cells. Efforts to elucidate the mechanism of stimulation of intestinal calcium transport by vitamin D are now focused on evaluating the protein composition and topology of the brush-border membrane and its associated core material. Intestinal brush-border membranes were isolated from vitamin D-replete and vitamin D-deficient chicks. Core material proteins were isolated, by sedimentation, from brush-border membranes which were solubilized with Triton X-100. As determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dietary vitamin D3 treatment caused no change in the relative amounts of five major core material proteins with Mr = 101,000, 94,000, 67,000, 42,000 (actin), and 17,000. In contrast, dietary vitamin D3 treatment caused a significant reduction in the levels of two proteins with Mr = 111,000 (sucrase) and 83,000, and an increase in the levels of a protein with Mr = 78,000 (possibly a subunit of alkaline phosphatase). The Mr = 111,000, 83,000, and 78,000 proteins are readily solubilized by Triton X-100 and are located on the extracellular surface of the brush-border membrane, as judged by [125I]diazoiodosulfanilic acid and lactoperoxidase 125I labeling. A significant vitamin D-dependent difference was found with respect to iodination of isolated core material as evidenced by the 125I labeling patterns of the Mr = 42,000 protein (actin). The Mr = 42,000 protein was labeled two to three times more extensively when associated with core material derived from vitamin D-deficient chicks as compared to vitamin D-replete chicks. Increasing the salt concentration (0-125 mM KCl) present during core material isolation from either vitamin D-replete or vitamin D-deficient chicks yields core material actin which is more susceptible to iodination by both [125I]diazoiodosulfanilic acid and lactoperoxidase. This increase in the extent of actin iodination is coupled to a salt-induced decrease in the stability of the core material which is evidenced by a decrease in the percentage of total brush-border membrane actin which is Triton-insoluble. This strongly suggests that the vitamin D-induced decrease in the accessibility of actin to iodination reagents results from a vitamin D-dependent change in the structure of the core material. Collectively, these results implicate a role for dietary vitamin D3 in maintaining a specified composition and topology of both the brush-border membrane proteins as well as its associated cytoskeletal core proteins, which is possibly important for intestinal calcium transport."
https://openalex.org/W1518397918,"alpha-D-Mannosidase and beta-D-glucosidase from Dictyostelium discoideum are efficiently endocytosed into mutant human fibroblasts through a saturable, mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)-inhibitable uptake system (Freeze, H. H., Kaplan, A., and Miller, A. L. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11081-11084). We have extended this study using both of these active, purified enzymes and 125I-labeled beta-glucosidase for uptake into normal human fibroblasts. The pH optimum of uptake is 6.0 for both enzymes and greater than 95% is inhibited by 2 mM Man-6-P (Ki = 5 X 10(-5) M). A variety of mono-and diesterified mannans or mannan derivatives also inhibited uptake of the enzymes. Both enzymes compete with each other for uptake (Ki, 2.0 X 10(-9) M) and have Kuptake of 1.0-2.2 X 10(-9) M and a Vmax of 0.35-0.48 pmol/mg of cell protein/h. The specific binding of 125I-beta-glucosidase to fibroblasts was measured at 0-4 degrees C and found to have a Kd of 1.0 X 10(-9) M with approximately 15,900 +/- 900 receptors/cell. The receptors could be internalized every 5-7 min at saturating concentrations of enzyme at 37 degrees C. The 125I-beta-glucosidase previously bound to the cells at 4 degrees C could be released by continued incubation at 4 degrees C in the presence of Man-6-P, however, after brief warming to 37 degrees C followed by reincubation at 4 degrees C, Man-6-P could no longer release the ligand. Chloroquine inhibited 95% of the uptake of 125I-beta-glucosidase at 50 microM. Following internalization of the enzyme, it is degraded to trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments with a half-life of approximately 6.5 h. These data suggest that the slime mold enzymes are bound to the same receptors which function in the uptake of mammalian lysosomal enzymes and make the slime mold lysosomal enzymes useful models to study uptake involving this receptor in normal human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1636890785,"A novel endonuclease from adult hen liver nuclei has been purified to a homogeneous state through salt extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, acetone fractionation, and successive chromatography of 1) hydroxyapatite and DNA Sepharose and 2) hydroxyapatite and isoelectric focusing. The endonuclease has a pH optimum at 9.0 and requires Mg2+ for activity. The enzyme hydrolyzes more rapidly in the order of polynucleotide: denatured DNA = rRNA greater than poly(dA) = poly(dT) greater than poly(dC) = poly(dG) greater than native DNA. This endonuclease degrades denatured DNA about 20 times more rapidly than does the native DNA. The products contain 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini and all four deoxynucleotides are present while dGMP is predominant. The enzyme cleaves the circular duplex PM2 DNA, endonucleotically, via single strand scission. The isoelectric point is 10.2 +/- 0.2 and the molecular weight is 43,000 +/- 2,000, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and 2,3-butanedione inhibit the catalytic activity, respectively. The inhibition of DNA binding activity was also seen with former, but not with the latter. Purified Mg2+-dependent alkaline endonuclease was used to investigate the nature of poly(ADP-ribose) inhibition of the enzyme. In contrast to the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (Yoshihara, K., Tanigawa, Y., Burzio, L., and Koide, S. S. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 289-293), ADP-ribosylation of the endonuclease protein was not observed. When 100 ng of the poly(ADP-ribose) having four to five ADP-ribose units per molecule were added to the nuclease assay system (total volume of 0.2 ml) 14% inhibition was observed, and increase in the chain length increased the inhibition. When 100 ng of poly(ADP-ribose) consisting of 20 or more units of the ADP-ribose per mol were added, the inhibition was over 95%. The possible role of the poly(ADP-ribose)-sensitive endonuclease is discussed."

A number of other virus strains, as well as endogenous AKR-type ecotropic virus and AKR-type, mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses, did not produce these abnormalities. In mice with erythroid and myeloid leukemia, the perivibrissal sinus is the site of extramedullary hematopoiesis, but this did not appear to be the basis of the deformities. Genetic evidence indicated that newly arisen MCF-type recombinant viruses are involved in the pathogenesis of the abnormalities, at least with some of the virus systems studied."
https://openalex.org/W1535588562,"sn-Glycerol 3-phosphorothioate, a bacteriocidal analog of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate in strains of Escherichia coli with a functioning glycerol phosphate transport system, was investigated for its ability to be incorporated into phospholipid under in vitro and in vivo conditions. A cell-free particulate fraction from E. coli strain 8 catalyzes the transfer of sn-[3H]glycerol 3-phosphoro[35S]thioate to chloroform-soluble material in the presence of either CDP-diglyceride or palmitoyl coenzyme A. With CDP-diglyceride as the co-substrate, the product of the reaction was tentatively identified as phosphatidylglycerol phosphorothioate. No formation of phosphatidylglycerol was observed, suggesting that the specific phosphatase required for the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol does not catalyze, or else at a greatly reduced rate, the hydrolysis of the phosphorothioate monoester linkage. The kinetics of incorporation of sn-[3H]glycerol 3-phosphate and phosphorothioate into chloroform-soluble material in the presence of CDP-diglyceride are almost identical. In the presence of palmitoyl coenzyme A, sn-[3H]glycerol 3-phosphoro[35S]thioate was converted to the phosphorothioate analog of phosphatidic acid. Kinetic analysis showed that the apparent Km values for the incorporation of the phosphate and the phosphorothioate derivatives into phospholipid were 0.4 and 0.8 mM, respectively. The Vmax for the phosphorothioate analog was approximately half that for the phosphate derivative. Chemically synthesized thiophosphatidic acid was not a substrate for CTP:phosphatidic acid cytidylyltransferase. sn-[3H]Glycerol 3-phosphoro[35S]thioate was incorporated into phospholipid by cultures of E. coli strain 8. The major phosphorothioate-containing phospholipid synthesized in vivo was identified as 1,2-diacyl-sn-[3H]glycerol 3-phosphoro[35S]thioate. The phosphorothioate analog of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate was not observed despite our observations that this analog can be synthesized in vitro. Our results indicate that the phosphorothioate analog is an effective sn-glycerol 3-phosphate surrogate and suggest that a major reason for its toxicity toward E. coli strain 8 may be due to a total blockade of endogenous phospholipid biosynthesis."
