https://openalex.org/W2147166346,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently described illness of humans that has spread widely over the past 6 months. With the use of detailed epidemiologic data from Singapore and epidemic curves from other settings, we estimated the reproductive number for SARS in the absence of interventions and in the presence of control efforts. We estimate that a single infectious case of SARS will infect about three secondary cases in a population that has not yet instituted control measures. Public-health efforts to reduce transmission are expected to have a substantial impact on reducing the size of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2096145431,"We present an analysis of the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been characterized by two large clusters-initiated by two separate ""super-spread"" events (SSEs)-and by ongoing community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately transmissible. Excluding SSEs, we estimate that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also because of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, although continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained. Restrictions on longer range population movement are shown to be a potentially useful additional control measure in some contexts. We estimate that most currently infected persons are now hospitalized, which highlights the importance of control of nosocomial transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2095135796,"In animals, effective immune responses against malignancies and against several infectious pathogens, including malaria, are mediated by T cells. Here we show that a heterologous prime-boost vaccination regime of DNA either intramuscularly or epidermally, followed by intradermal recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), induces high frequencies of interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting, antigen-specific T-cell responses in humans to a pre-erythrocytic malaria antigen, thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP). These responses are five- to tenfold higher than the T-cell responses induced by the DNA vaccine or recombinant MVA vaccine alone, and produce partial protection manifest as delayed parasitemia after sporozoite challenge with a different strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Such heterologous prime-boost immunization approaches may provide a basis for preventative and therapeutic vaccination in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2081526354,"Understanding the mechanisms through which multicellular organisms regulate cell, organ and body growth is of relevance to developmental biology and to research on growth-related diseases such as cancer. Here we describe a new effector in growth control, the small GTPase Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain). Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster Rheb gene were isolated as growth-inhibitors, whereas overexpression of Rheb promoted cell growth. Our genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that Rheb functions downstream of the tumour suppressors Tsc1 (tuberous sclerosis 1)-Tsc2 in the TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling pathway to control growth, and that a major effector of Rheb function is ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K)."

The cortical representation of both Vernier and grating acuity thresholds in V1 was found to be roughly constant across all eccentricities. We also found a within-observer correlation between cortical magnification and Vernier acuity, further supporting claims that Vernier acuity is limited by cortical magnification in V1."

In contrast, the arterial regions exposed to laminar shear (LS) are relatively lesion-free. The mechanisms underlying the opposite effects of OS and LS on the inflammatory and atherogenic processes are not clearly understood. Here, through DNA microarrays, protein expression, and functional studies, we identify bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) as a mechanosensitive and pro-inflammatory gene product. Exposing endothelial cells to OS increased BMP4 protein expression, whereas LS decreased it. In addition, we found BMP4 expression only in the selective patches of endothelial cells overlying foam cell lesions in human coronary arteries. The same endothelial patches also expressed higher levels of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein compared with those of non-diseased areas. Functionally, we show that OS and BMP4 induced ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion by a NFκB-dependent mechanism. We suggest that BMP4 is a mechanosensitive, inflammatory factor playing a critical role in early steps of atherogenesis in the lesion-prone areas.

Endothelial cells are constantly exposed to shear stress (a dragging force generated by blood flow), which controls cellular structure and function such as regulation of vascular tone and diameter, vessel wall remodeling, hemostasis, and inflammatory responses (1Davies P.F. Polacek D.C. Shi C. Helmke B.P. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 299-306PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of various types of shear stress is highlighted by the focal development of atherosclerosis (2Zarins C.K. Giddens D.P. Bharadvaj B.K. Sottiurai V.S. Mabon R.F. Glagov S. Circ. Res. 1983; 53: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in the arterial regions exposed to unstable shear stress conditions in branched or curved arteries, whereas straight arteries exposed to unidirectional laminar shear (LS) 1The abbreviations used are: LS, laminar shear; BMP4, bone morphogenic protein-4; OS, oscillatory shear; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; VCAM1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; MAEC, mouse aortic endothelial cells; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cells; FACS, fluorescence-activated cytometry sorting; ALK, activin-like kinase. are relatively lesion-free (1Davies P.F.

Atherosclerosis is now known as an inflammatory disease caused by endothelial dysfunction (3Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar, 4Libby P. Ridker P.M. Maseri A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (5922) Google Scholar). One of the first visible markers of endothelial dysfunction in the lesion-prone areas is up-regulation of inflammatory adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and ICAM-1 (3Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar, 4Libby P. Ridker P.M. Maseri A.

These endothelial adhesion molecules play essential roles in adhesion and recruitment of monocytes to the subendothelial layer (3Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar, 4Libby P. Ridker P.M. Maseri A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (5922) Google Scholar). How do unstable shear conditions such as low and oscillating shear stress (OS) cause inflammation in those lesion-prone areas, whereas LS exerts athero-protective effects? The opposite effects of LS and OS may be determined by differential expression of genes and proteins, ultimately inducing anti- and pro-inflammatory and atherogenic responses. Recently, several studies (7Garcia-Cardena G. Comander J. Anderson K.R. Blackman B.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4478-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 8Chen B.P. Li Y.S. Zhao Y. Chen K.D. Li S. Lao J. Yuan S. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Physiol.

Genomics. 2002; 9: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have begun to address the initial question to determine the expression profiles of mechanosensitive genes. However, the functional importance of those genes has not been clearly established. Here, we report identification of a mechanosensitive gene, BMP4, by DNA microarray analyses and subsequent verification by a variety of additional approaches in both cultured endothelial cells and human coronary arteries. More importantly, we discovered a novel role of BMP4 as an inflammatory cytokine, providing a potential mechanistic link from shear forces to inflammatory responses and atherogenesis. Endothelial Cells—Mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAEC) were cultured and used at passages 4–8 as described by us (11Cai H. Li Z. Dikalov S. Hwang J. Jo H. Dudley S.C. Harrison D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 107: 48311-48317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) purchased from Clonetics were cultured using the EGM-2 bullet kit (Clonetics) and used at passages 4–8. Shear Stress Studies—Confluent endothelial monolayers grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were exposed to an arterial level of unidirectional LS (15 dyn/cm2) in the growth medium by rotating a Teflon cone (0.5° cone angle) as described previously by us (12Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To mimic unstable shear conditions in vivo, endothelial cells were exposed to OS with directional changes of flow at 1 Hz cycle (±5 dyn/cm2) by rotating the cone back and forth using a stepping motor (Servo Motor) and a computer program (DC Motor Company, Atlanta, GA). In some studies, 5 dyn/cm2 unidirectional LS was used for comparison to OS (±5 dyn/cm2). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Following experimental treatments, endothelial cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described by us (13Boo Y.C. Hwang J. Sykes M. Michell B.J. Kemp B.E. Lum H. Jo H. Am J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1819-H1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.1 ml of boiling lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% SDS). The lysate was further homogenized by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle. Protein content of each sample was measured by using a Bio-Rad DC assay (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To detect secreted BMP4 in conditioned media, endothelial monolayers were first washed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with minimum non-essential amino acids and pyruvic acid and exposed to OS, LS, or static conditions for 1 day. The conditioned media were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots (2 ml) of the supernatant were collected and placed on ice with 10 ml of ice-cold acetone to precipitate protein for 30 min. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (13Boo Y.C. Hwang J. Sykes M. Michell B.J. Kemp B.E. Lum H. Jo H. Am J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1819-H1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates (20 μg of protein each) were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then with a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1 h at room temperature), which were detected by a chemiluminescence method (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The intensities of immunoreactive bands in Western blots were analyzed by using the NIH Image program. The following primary antibodies were used: a monoclonal BMP4 antibody, rabbit ICAM1 antibody, goat VCAM1 antibody, and goat actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA Microarray Analysis—DNA microarray analyses were performed with an Affymetrix murine gene chip containing 12,000 genes (U74Av2; Affymetrix) and a Motorola murine genome chip containing 10,000 genes, according to the protocols provided by each manufacturer (16Napoli C. de Nigris F. Welch J.S. Calara F.B. Stuart R.O. Glass C.K. Palinski W. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Affymetrix chips were scanned and analyzed at the DNA core facility at Emory University School of Medicine; studies with Motorola chips, the entire process from reverse transcription to hybridization, scanning to initial data analysis, were performed by using the manufacturer's protocol and laboratory (Chicago, IL). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR for BMP4 was carried out as previously described (17Sorescu D. Weiss D. Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Szocs K. Sorescu G.P. Valppu L. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Vega J.D. Taylor W.R. Griendling K.K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using random primers and a Superscript-II kit (Invitrogen) to synthesize first-strand cDNA. The cDNA was purified using a microbiospin 30 column (Bio-Rad) in Tris buffer and stored at –20 °C until used. The cDNA was amplified using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) RT-PCR machine. The mRNA copy numbers were determined based on standard curves generated with murine BMP4 and 18 S templates. The 18 S primers (50 nm at 61 °C annealing temperature; Ambion) were used as an internal control for real-time PCR using a LightCycler and capillaries (Roche Applied Science), recombinant Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and Taq start antibody (Clontech). A quantitative RT-PCR using BMP4 primer pair (forward, 5′-CTGCGGGACTTCGAGGCGACACTTCT-3′, reverse, 5′-TCTTCCTCCTCCTCCTCCCCAGACTG-3′) using endothelial RNA sample yielded a 130-base pair fragment on agarose gel electrophoresis. This pair of primers was verified by a nested PCR using other BMP4 primer pairs (forward, 5′-ATGGACTGTTATTATGCCTTGTTTTCTGTCAACACCATGATTC-3′, reverse, 5′-CCACGTATAGTGAATGGCGACGGCAGTTCTT-3′, and forward, 5′-GTCAACACCATGATTCCTGGTAACCGAATGCTGA-3′, reverse, 5′-TTATACGGTGGAAGCCCTGTTCCCAGTCAG-3′) and by running DNA gels. Real-time PCR for BMP4 was carried out using the annealing temperature 65 °C and extension time for 7 s in the PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, at 25 °C, 4mm MgCl2 to which was added 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm deoxynucleotides) containing SYBR green (1:84,000 dilution), 0.05 unit/μl Taq DNA polymerase, and Taq Start antibody (1:100 dilution). Fluorescence-activated Cytometry Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Treated cells were dissociated into single-cell suspensions using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in a FACS buffer (Hank's buffered solution containing 5% fetal bovine serum). Aliquots of cell suspensions were incubated with ICAM1 antibody (R&D Systems) for 20 min on ice, washed twice with FACS buffer, and incubated with secondary antibody (fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate- or phycoerytherin-conjugated; Chemicon) for 20 min on ice in the dark. Then samples were washed again, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by FACS (Calibur; Becton-Dickinson) using CellQuest software. The fluorescence intensity of ICAM1 and forward cell scattering of 30,000 cells were measured, and the geometric means calculated from histograms were shown. In some studies, HAEC were transfected with either BMP4 (Dr. Elizabeth J. Robertson, Harvard University) cloned in a bicistronic pAdTrack CMV vector (Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University) or an empty vector, both expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), using LipofectAMINE 2000. In these experiments, ICAM1 expression was measured in the red phycoerytherin channel, while the green channel was used to monitor GFP expression. GFP expression was determined by FACS analysis and fluorescence microscopy (20–30% transfection efficiency). Because expression of GFP was similar among different treatment groups within the same experiment, we did not need to normalize ICAM1 expression data to the GFP level. Human recombinant noggin was either a kind gift from Dr. Arturo Alvarez-Buylla (University of California at San Francisco) or purchased from R&D Systems and used in all experiments at 50 ng/ml (18Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 19Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 20Dale L. Jones C.M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Study—Frozen sections of human coronary arteries obtained from patients undergoing heart transplants were prepared (17Sorescu D. Weiss D. Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Szocs K. Sorescu G.P. Valppu L. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Vega J.D. Taylor W.R. Griendling K.K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) and stained with antibodies specific for BMP4 (1:1,000 dilution, goat antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ICAM-1 (1:50 dilution, mouse antibody; R&D), or von Willebrand factor (1:100 dilution, mouse antibody; Dako) for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (anti-goat IgG or anti-mouse IgG) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Then the slides were washed and developed with a DAKO kit (DAKO). Photographs of the slides were taken using a Zeiss microscope. Fifteen different human coronary arteries, containing various stages of atherosclerosis from minimally diseased to fatty streak to advanced atheroma stage, from six different patients were examined. Monocyte Adhesion—Monocyte binding was determined under no-flow conditions using THP-1 monocytes (ATCC) by the method described by Chappel et al. (21Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were labeled with a fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein-AM (BCECF; Molecular Probes) (1 mg/ml) in serum-free RPMI medium for 45 min at 37 °C. Following exposure to shear stress or BMP treatments in the presence or absence of noggin or vehicle, the endothelial cells were washed in RPMI medium before adding BCECF-loaded THP-1 cells (1:1 ratio). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C under no-flow conditions, unbound monocytes were removed by washing the endothelial dishes five times with Hank's phosphate-buffered saline. Bound monocytes were quantified by either counting the cells under a fluorescent microscope or by measuring the fluorescent intensity of cell lysates by fluorescence spectrophotometry using a plate reader. Both assays showed similar results. Some studies were performed with MAEC pretreated with 5 μg/ml mouse-ICAM1 antibody (YN1; Southern Biotechnology) (22Kevil C.G. Patel R.P. Bullard D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 8955-8960Google Scholar). NFκB Assay—NFκB activity was determined by using a NFκB reporter construct, NFκB-SEAP vector (1 μg; Clontech) expressing a secreted form of placental alkaline phosphatase driven by 4-κB sequences in tandem. This construct was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of either pAdTrack BMP4 or empty vector control using LipofectAMINE 2000. Six hours post-transfection, conditioned media were centrifuged and heat treated at 65 °C (to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase) for 30 min, followed by chemiluminescence alkaline phosphatase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test using the Microcal Origin statistical package. Differential Regulation of the BMP4 Gene by LS and OS in Endothelial Cells—To identify the genes that may be responsible for the athero-protective and pro-atherogenic effects of LS and OS, respectively, we performed DNA microarray studies using cultured MAEC. Exposing MAEC to LS, but not OS, for 1 day using the modified “cone-and-plate” device (12Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) induced a cell shape alignment to the direction of the flow from a typical polygonal “cobblestone shape” found in static cultured cells (Fig. 1). The total RNAs prepared from these cells were used to determine mRNA expression profiles by using Affymetrix and/or Motorola DNA chips according to the manufacturers' protocols. The analyses of these studies showed that LS exposure significantly and consistently inhibited BMP4 mRNA level in MAEC by more than 60–80% of static control levels (Fig. 2A). Unlike LS, however, exposure of endothelial cells to OS did not inhibit BMP4 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). We also found that LS exposure up-regulated a well known mechanosensitive gene, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), mRNA level by more than 5-fold (5.6 ± 1.2, n = 3) above static controls. In addition, eNOS protein level was also increased by ∼2-fold above controls as determined by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (data not shown), providing further confidence in our results. BMPs play an important role in bone formation, embryonic development, and differentiation (23Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 24Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Although BMP4 protein has been found previously in calcified atherosclerotic plaques (25Dhore C.R. Cleutjens J.P. Lutgens E. Cleutjens K.B. Geusens P.P. Kitslaar P.J. Tordoir J.H. Spronk H.M. Vermeer C. Daemen M.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), its expression and functional importance in endothelial cells have not been determined. Therefore, we decided to verify the microarray results by independent methods at the levels of mRNA and protein as well as the functional roles of BMP4 in endothelial biology and pathobiology. First, we verified the BMP4 mRNA data by using a quantitative real-time PCR method. Exposure of endothelial cells to LS almost eliminated the BMP4 mRNA level (n = 6, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, OS marginally, statistically not significant, increased BMP4 mRNA level compared with that of static control (n = 3). These results confirmed the DNA microarray results. Next, BMP4 protein expression was determined by immunoblot studies. BMP4 protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (48–55 kDa) that is proteolytically cleaved by proprotein convertases, and the active ∼23-kDa protein is secreted (23Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 24Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In endothelial cell lysates, the BMP4 precursor was detected as a 54-kDa protein, and the mature form (p23) was detected in the conditioned media collected from static or shear-exposed cells (Fig. 2C). Exposure of cells to LS significantly down-regulated expression of BMP4 precursor in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). After 16–24 h of LS exposure, BMP4 precursor expression was virtually undetectable (Fig. 2C, left panel, p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure of MAEC to OS significantly increased BMP4 precursor protein level by 2-fold above control (Fig. 2C, middle panel, p < 0.05). Consistent with the cell lysate result, the conditioned media of MAEC exposed to LS (15 dyn/cm2) showed a barely detectable amount of secreted form of BMP4 (p23) (Fig 2C, right panel). In contrast, OS exposure did not significantly change the p23 BMP4 level in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2C, right panel, p < 0.05). Because the cells were exposed to LS (15 dyn/cm2) and OS (±5 dyn/cm2), we next determined whether it was the shear magnitude difference that accounted for our results observed so far. To address this question, we compared the effects of LS and OS using the same magnitudes (5 dyn/cm2 LS versus ±5 dyn/cm2 OS). As shown as Fig. 2C, right panel, at the same shear magnitude, OS-exposed cells had more than 3-fold BMP4 protein than that of LS. However, the higher LS magnitude (15 dyn/cm2) showed a much lower amount of BMP4 than that of lower LS (5 dyn/cm2). These results show that LS exposure inhibits BMP4 expression in a force-dependent manner, whereas OS maintains high BMP4 expression. BMP4 Expression in the Selective Patches of Endothelial Cells over Foam Cell Lesions in Human Coronary Arteries— Next, using the human coronary arteries we determined whether BMP4 protein is expressed in endothelial cells of human atherosclerotic lesions. The coronary arteries exhibiting a spectrum of atherosclerotic lesion complexity were obtained from patients undergoing heart transplants and examined by immunohistochemical staining (17Sorescu D. Weiss D. Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Szocs K. Sorescu G.P. Valppu L. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Vega J.D. Taylor W.R. Griendling K.K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). BMP4 protein expression was not apparent in the intimal endothelial cells in relatively normal, “minimally diseased” human coronary arteries (Fig. 3A) or in advanced lesions (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3D, one exception was found in the endothelial cells (arrows) overlying foam cell lesions that were stained strongly against the BMP4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3C, isotype-matched nonspecific mouse IgG used as a negative control further supported the specificity of BMP4 staining. In contrast, the medial smooth muscle cells and macrophages (Fig. 3, A and D) were most intensely stained against a monoclonal BMP4 antibody (smooth muscle cells and macrophages identified by α-actin and CD-68 staining, respectively; data not shown). To verify the identity of endothelial cells, the serial sections were stained with a von Willebrand factor antibody (endothelial marker, Fig. 3, B and E), demonstrating the location of BMP4 staining in select areas of endothelium. Furthermore, immunostaining with an ICAM1 staining showed that the expression of this pro-inflammatory adhesion molecule was selectively increased in the similar endothelial areas expressing BMP4 (Fig. 3, D and F, arrowheads). On the other hand, we failed to detect VCAM-1 in the adjacent serial sections (data not shown). This result is consistent with the finding reported by Endress et al. (7Garcia-Cardena G. Comander J. Anderson K.R. Blackman B.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4478-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). BMP4 Produced in Endothelial Cells by OS Stimulates Monocyte Adhesion—The selective expression of BMP4 protein in endothelial cells above foam cell lesions (an early form of atherosclerotic lesions) prompted a speculation that BMP4 may be involved in the inflammatory responses observed in lesion-prone areas (3Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar, 4Libby P. Ridker P.M. Maseri A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (5922) Google Scholar). To begin to test the hypothesis, MAEC were treated with increasing amounts of BMP4 for 24 h and then monocyte adhesion to endothelium was determined. As a positive control, some cells were treated with a well known inflammatory cytokine, TNFα (100 units/ml). BMP4 stimulated monocyte binding in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum activation of 4–7-fold over control (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05). As low as 0.1 ng/ml BMP4 induced a statistically significant increase, whereas 50 ng/ml BMP4 induced a maximum effect. A similar effect of BMP4 on monocyte adhesion was also observed by transfecting MAEC or HAEC with a vector expressing mouse BMP4 (data not shown). OS has been shown to induce monocyte adhesion both in vivo and in cultured endothelial cells by increasing surface expression of adhesion molecules (21Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a BMP4 inhibitor, noggin (18Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 20Dale L. Jones C.M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), to examine whether OS induces monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells in a BMP4-dependent manner. Exposure of endothelial cells to OS for 24 h significantly increased monocyte adhesion (Fig. 4B, p < 0.05). Treatment of MAEC with noggin (50 ng/ml) inhibited OS-induced monocyte adhesion (Fig. 4B). In contrast, exposure of MAEC to LS for 24 h inhibited monocyte adhesion by ∼50% of static control level (Fig. 4C, p < 0.05) as expected (26Tsao P.S. Lewis N.P. Alpert S. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1995; 92: 3513-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because LS exposure significantly inhibited BMP4 expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 2), we next examined whether the inhibitory effect of LS on monocyte adhesion could be reversed by BMP4 addition. For this study, we exposed MAEC in the presence of BMP4 during shear or static control for 24 h, followed by monocyte adhesion assay. The inhibitory effect of LS on monocyte adhesion was lost when MAEC were sheared in medium supplemented with BMP4 (Fig. 4C, p < 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that BMP4 produced from endothelial cells by OS exposure leads to monocyte adhesion. BMP4 Stimulates Monocyte Adhesion by Inducing ICAM-1 Expression in an NFκB-dependent Manner—Next, we examined the mechanism by which BMP4 increases monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells is mediated by sequential coordinated molecular interactions between the integrins expressed on monocyte surface and several adhesion molecules expressed on the endothelial surface, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin (3Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown previously that expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin on endothelial cell surface is increased in atherosclerosis-prone areas (3Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first determined whether the endothelial expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin was modified in response to OS by FACS analysis. Exposure of HAEC to OS (1 day) increased ICAM-1 expression by 2.8-fold above control (Fig. 5A, p < 0.05). For comparison, TNFα stimulated ICAM-1 expression 4–5-fold above control cells (Fig. 5A). To determine whether ICAM-1 expression induced by OS was mediated by a BMP4-dependent mechanism, HAEC were either exposed to OS or static co"

Here we present crystal structures of human FcalphaRI alone and in a complex with the Fc region of IgA1 (Fcalpha). FcalphaRI has two immunoglobulin-like domains that are oriented at approximately right angles to each other. Fcalpha resembles the Fcs of immunoglobulins IgG and IgE, but has differently located interchain disulphide bonds and external rather than interdomain N-linked carbohydrates. Unlike 1:1 FcgammaRIII:IgG and Fc epsilon RI:IgE complexes, two FcalphaRI molecules bind each Fcalpha dimer, one at each Calpha2-Calpha3 junction. The FcalphaRI-binding site on IgA1 overlaps the reported polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)-binding site, which might explain why secretory IgA cannot initiate phagocytosis or bind to FcalphaRI-expressing cells in the absence of an integrin co-receptor."

Two types of neurons were distinguished. The first initially selected the singleton even in antisaccade trials, although most subsequently selected the endpoint of the saccade. The time the singleton was located was not affected by stimulus-response compatibility and did not vary with reaction time across trials. The second type of neuron selected only the endpoint of the saccade. The time of endpoint selection by these neurons accounted for most of the effect of stimulus-response compatibility on reaction time. These results indicate that visual selection and saccade selection are different processes."

https://openalex.org/W2137310763,"Claspin is a newly identified protein that regulates Chk1 activation in Xenopus. In the present study we investigated the role of human Claspin in the DNA damage/replication checkpoint in mammalian cells. We observed that human Claspin is a cell cycle regulated protein that peaks at S/G2 phase. Claspin localizes in the nuclei, but it only associates with Chk1 following replication stress or other types of DNA damage. In addition, Claspin is phosphorylated in response to replication stress, and this phosphorylation appears to be required for its association with Chk1. Moreover, Claspin interacts with the checkpoint proteins ATR and Rad9. Given that both the ATR and Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complexes are involved in Chk1 activation, it is possible that Claspin works as an adaptor molecule bringing these molecules together. Using small interfering RNA technology, we have shown that down-regulation of Claspin expression inhibits Chk1 activation in response to replication stress. More importantly, down-regulation of Claspin augments the premature chromatin condensation induced by hydroxyurea, inhibits the UV-induced reduction of DNA synthesis, and decreases cell survival. Taken together, these data imply a potentially critical role for Claspin in replication checkpoint control in mammalian cells.

Taken together, these data imply a potentially critical role for Claspin in replication checkpoint control in mammalian cells. In response to DNA damage and DNA replication stresses, cells activate surveillance pathways called cell cycle checkpoints. Activation of these checkpoints slows or arrests cell cycle progression to ensure appropriate time for DNA repair. The components of mammalian checkpoint pathways include protein kinase cascades. At the top of these pathways are the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases ATM 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia mutated- and Rad3-related; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HU, hydroxyurea; PCC, premature chromatin condensation; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and ATR (1Abraham R.T.

The ATM gene is mutated in patients with the syndrome ataxia telangiectasia. ATM mutant cells are defective in DNA damage checkpoints and are very sensitive to agents that promote DNA double strand breaks, such as γ-irradiation (3Kastan M.B. Lim D.-S. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In the case of ATR, disruption of this gene in mice results in embryonic lethality and fragmented chromosomes (4Brown E.J. Baltimore D.

In contrast to ATM, ATR is primarily involved in cellular responses to unreplicated DNA (induced by agents such as hydroxyurea (HU)) and to certain DNA-damaging agents, including UV. Cells overexpressing the kinase-inactive ATR are sensitive to HU and UV in addition to γ-irradiation (6Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H.

In addition, phosphorylation of these sites in vivo was shown to be ATR-dependent (13Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Like ATR, Chk1 is an essential gene. Chk1 deficiency leads to cell death in embryonic stem cells and embryonic lethality in mice (11Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G.

In addition, embryos and conditional embryonic stem cells lacking Chk1 have defective checkpoint responses (11Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Along with ATR, two protein complexes, Rad17-replication factor C (RFC) and Rad9-Rad1-Hus1, are also required for Chk1 activation (17Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These complexes have been implicated as sensors of DNA damage and replication stress (19Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 20Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), but it is not known how they regulate Chk1 activation. Recently, a novel protein called Claspin was also shown to be involved in Chk1 activation in Xenopus (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Claspin was isolated from Xenopus extracts as a Chk1-binding protein. Binding of Claspin to Chk1 was elevated in the presence of DNA templates that trigger cell cycle checkpoint arrest (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of Claspin from Xenopus egg extracts abolished the activation of Chk1 induced by unreplicated or UV-damaged DNA. Furthermore, Claspin-depleted extracts were unable to arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA replication blocks (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Claspin is an upstream regulator of Chk1 in Xenopus. In the present study we investigated the role of Claspin in the DNA damage and replication stress pathways in mammalian cells. We report here that Claspin expression is cell cycle-regulated and that Claspin binds to several checkpoint proteins, including Chk1, ATR, and Rad9. Suppression of Claspin expression results in defective Chk1 activation and defective S-phase checkpoint in response to DNA damage. Down-regulation of Claspin expression also increases premature chromatin condensation (PCC) induced by HU. In combination, our results suggest that Claspin participates in DNA damage and/or replication stress pathways in mammalian cells. Cell Culture—Human cell lines T24, K562, 293T, and HeLa were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For cell cycle experiments T24 cells were grown until confluent and arrested by contact inhibition for 3 days as described by Yu and Baer (22Yu X. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were then released into the cell cycle by replating at low densities. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-Claspin antibody was raised against a mixture of four GST fusion proteins covering the entire length of Claspin. This anti-Claspin monoclonal antibody was used in Western blots and immunofluorescence experiments. Anti-Claspin antibody for immunoprecipitation was a polyclonal antibody raised against a GST fusion protein encoding residues 636–1003 of Claspin. Chk1 was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody raised against a GST-Chk1 fusion protein. Anti-Chk1 antibodies for Western blot were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-317) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-ATR rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against an N-terminal peptide (for immunoprecipitation) and a C-terminal peptide (for Western blot) of ATR. Rad9 antibodies for immunoprecipitation and Western blot were a gift of Dr. L. M. Karnitz. Anti-Chk2 antibodies were described previously (23Ward I.M. Wu X Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde solution and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and/or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. All antibodies were diluted in 5% goat serum. Cells were counterstained with 4–6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dye for 30 s. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNA duplexes were 21 base pairs including a 2-deoxynucleotide overhang (24Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). The coding strand of Claspin siRNA was CUUGCUUAGAGCUGAGUCdTdT, and the control siRNA was UCCAGUGAAUCCUUGAGGUdTdT. Chk1 siRNA was designed as described previously (25Zhao H. Watkins J. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). For transfections, 293T or HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates and were transfected at 40% confluency with the siRNA duplex and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Transfection was repeated 24 h later, and cells were analyzed 72 h after the first transfection. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—293T cells were treated with 10 mm HU for 1.5 h and then lysed in NETN lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Cleared lysates (1–2 mg protein) were immunoprecipitated with the indicated polyclonal antibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. In phosphatase experiments, Claspin immunoprecipitates were treated with 400 units of λ phosphatase in the accompanying buffer (New England Biolabs) for 1 h 30 °C. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-Claspin antibody. Mitotic Spreads—HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs as described above. 54 h after the first transfection, 2 mm HU plus nocodazole (200 ng/ml) were added. Cells were harvested 20 h later, and mitotic spreads were performed as described previously (26Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.S. Vazari C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Measuring the Rate of DNA Synthesis—HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs, and 48 h after the first transfection they were plated at 5000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. 24 h later, cells were UV-irradiated (10 J/m2). After 40 min, 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added per well, and cells were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and harvested. The rate of DNA synthesis was assessed based on [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cell Survival—HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs as described above, and 48 h after the first transfection they were plated at 800 cells/plate. After 8 days colonies were stained with Coomassie Blue and counted. Claspin Expression Is Cell Cycle-regulated—Because Chk1 is a cell cycle-regulated protein (27Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether the expression of human Claspin is cell cycle-dependent. For this purpose we evaluated the levels of Claspin protein in synchronized T24 bladder carcinoma cells. T24 cells were arrested in G0 by contact inhibition and then were induced to reenter the cell cycle by being replated at low densities. Cells were then harvested at different time points. For each time point the cell cycle distribution was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Western blot analyses were performed with either a mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human Claspin. We observed that the levels of Claspin were undetectable in G0 cells and increased at late G1/S phase (Fig. 1A). The protein level of Claspin peaks at S/G2 phase similar to Chk1. In contrast, Chk2 protein levels remain constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that, like Chk1, Claspin is a cell cycle-regulated protein and may have a function in S phase cells. To investigate the cellular localization of Claspin, we performed immunofluorescence staining experiments using anti-Claspin antibodies. In unsynchronized HeLa cells we observed nuclear localization of Claspin. HU treatment did not change Claspin cellular localization but induced Chk1 activation as detected by staining with anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-317) antibody (Fig. 1B). Only cells that stained positive with Claspin antibodies stained positive with the anti-phospho-Chk1 antibody after HU treatment (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with the observations made by Western blot, demonstrating that Chk1 and Claspin are both expressed during the same cell cycle stages. Claspin Is Phosphorylated following Replication Stress and DNA Damage—In Xenopus, Claspin appears to be phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation is required for its interaction with Chk1. Therefore, we investigated whether human Claspin is phosphorylated following replication stress. In cells treated with HU, the migration of Claspin in SDS-PAGE was retarded compared with that in untreated cells (Fig. 2A). Similar mobility shift was observed when cells were treated with UV (data not shown). The mobility shift was reversed by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Claspin is hyperphosphorylated in mammalian cells in response to DNA damage. We also investigated whether caffeine, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase kinases (28Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), affected Claspin phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with caffeine before HU treatment inhibited the HU-induced mobility shift of Claspin (Fig. 2B; also see Fig. 3D), suggesting that ATR or other phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase kinases could be involved in the regulation of Claspin phosphorylation following replication stress.Fig. 3Claspin associates with Chk1 in response to replication stress and DNA damage. A, 293T cells were treated for 1.5 h with 10 mm HU before lysis or left untreated. Cell lysates were incubated with either GST-Chk1-Sepharose beads or immunoprecipitated with anti-Chk1 antibodies. An aliquot of whole cell lysate (wcl) was used as control. IP, immunoprecipitate; WB, Western blot. B, 293T cells were treated with 40J/m2 UV or left untreated, and cells were lysed after 2 h. Cell lysates were incubated with either GST-Chk1 or GST-Chk2-containing Sepharose beads. C, 293T cells were treated for 1.5 h with 10 mm HU before lysis or left untreated. Cell lysates were treated or not with λ phosphatase for 1 h before pull-down assay with GST-Chk1 beads. D, 293T cells were incubated in the presence and absence of 3 mm caffeine for 20 min prior to HU treatment. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Chk1 antibodies. Western blots were performed with anti-Claspin and anti-Chk1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Claspin Associates with Chk1 upon Replication Stress and DNA Damage—To determine whether Claspin associates with Chk1, we tested whether Claspin coimmunoprecipitates with Chk1 in 293T cells before and after replication stress. 293T cells were incubated in the presence or absence of HU for 1.5 h, and Chk1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Chk1 antibodies. We observed that Claspin immunoprecipitated with Chk1 in a damage-dependent manner, because only weak association was observed in control cells (Fig. 3A). To further confirm this association, we performed pull-down assays using GST-Chk1 fusion proteins purified from insect cells. GST-Chk1 also associated with Claspin in a replication stress-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The association between Claspin and Chk1 was observed after HU treatment but also was induced by other types of DNA-damage agents such as UV (Fig. 3B) and ionizing radiation (not shown). In contrast, no association was observed between Claspin and GST-Chk2 (Fig. 3B). We also investigated whether phosphorylation of Claspin was required for Claspin-Chk1 interaction. Treatment of cell lysates with λ phosphatase prior to pull-down assays prevented the HU-induced association between Claspin and Chk1 (Fig 3C). Claspin levels remained unchanged after phosphatase treatment (Fig 3C, lower panel), suggesting that Claspin phosphorylation is required for Claspin binding to Chk1. Similarly, the association between Claspin and Chk1 was also inhibited by pretreatment of cells with caffeine (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that the damage-dependent phosphorylation of Claspin is required for the inducible Claspin-Chk1 association in mammalian cells. Claspin Associates with ATR and Rad9 —Because Chk1 activation depends on ATR and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex (10Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M.C. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr.

A. 2001; 98: 11289-11294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Claspin could also associate with the ATR and the 9-1-1 complexes. We immunoprecipitated ATR from extracts prepared from 293T cells treated with or without 10 mm HU and performed Western blots with anti-Claspin antibodies. We observed that Claspin associates with ATR (Fig. 4A). As a control, no Claspin was immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Claspin co-immunoprecipitated with Rad9 (Fig. 4B). No association was observed between Claspin and ATM or Chk2 (data not shown). It also appears that the ATR-Claspin and the Rad9-Claspin interactions decreased slightly following replication stress, whereas Claspin levels did not change (Fig. 2) The significance of these modest reductions in association is not yet clear. It is possible that Claspin may dissociate from ATR and/or Rad9 following replication stress and then associate with Chk1 to facilitate Chk1 activation. Claspin Is Required for Chk1 Phosphorylation—To investigate whether Claspin is required for Chk1 activation in mammalian cells, we used the siRNA technique to suppress Claspin expression (24Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, transfection of a siRNA targeted to Claspin suppressed Claspin expression in 293T cells. Similar effects were observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). As a control, an unrelated control siRNA did not affect Claspin levels (Fig. 5). To analyze the involvement of Claspin in Chk1 activation we transfected 293T cells with control and Claspin siRNA. After 72 h, cells were treated with 10 mm HU. Phosphorylation of Chk1 was determined by Western blot performed with anti-phospho-Chk1 antibodies (Ser-317). Although transfection of Claspin siRNA decreased Chk1 activation, transfection of a control siRNA failed to do so (Fig. 5). As a control, siRNA transfections did not change Chk1 protein levels, as judged by immunoblotting with anti-Chk1 antibody. Thus, Claspin is involved in the Chk1 activation following DNA damage. Claspin Prevents PCC—PCC is a hallmark of mammalian cells that begin mitosis before completing DNA replication (26Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.S. Vazari C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This is a lethal event that is induced by agents like HU that promote DNA damage or prolong S phase and is prevented by a conserved checkpoint pathway involving ATR and Chk1 (26Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.S. Vazari C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Caffeine and overexpression of ATR-kinase dead (ATR-kd) or Chk1-kd augmented the PCC induced by HU or UV (26Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.S. Vazari C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To examine whether Claspin also participates in this ATR-Chk1-dependent checkpoint control, we transfected HeLa cells with a Claspin or a control siRNA. Cells were then treated with 2 mm HU for 20 h. Mitotic spreads were prepared and counted. Cells with fragmented chromosomes were judged as cells with PCC. We found that transfection with Claspin siRNA, but not with control siRNA, increased the HU-induced PCC (Fig. 6A). Similar to earlier reports (26Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.S. Vazari C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we observed increased PCC in cells transfected with Chk1 siRNA following HU treatment (Fig 6A). There were also modest increases of PCC in cells transfected with Claspin or Chk1 siRNA without HU treatment, indicating that PCC may occur in untreated control cells in the absence of Claspin or Chk1. In conclusion, these data suggest that like ATR and Chk1, Claspin is involved in the pathway that prevents the premature chromatin condensation. Claspin Is Involved in the UV-induced S Phase Checkpoint—In addition to ionizing radiation, other DNA-damaging agents such as UV and some carcinogens also lead to reduction of DNA synthesis and induce the S phase checkpoint. This phenomenon is believed to be a checkpoint response regulate by the ATR/Chk1 pathway, because it is blocked by caffeine, UCN-01 (Chk1 inhibitor (8Matsuoka S. Huang M.X. Elledge S.J.

Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether Claspin participates in the regulation of this S phase checkpoint, we examined the rate of DNA synthesis in cells transfected with control or Claspin siRNAs. There was a 30–40% reduction in DNA synthesis in normal cells treated with 10 J/m2 UV (Fig. 6B). This inhibition was reversed by caffeine, demonstrating that this is a checkpoint response. Similarly, Chk1 siRNA almost completely reversed the inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by UV (data not shown), indicating that this response depends on Chk1 in the cell. As a control, cells transfected with an unrelated siRNA showed an inhibition of DNA synthesis (about 30%) similar to untransfected cells. In cells transfected with Claspin siRNA, we observed a reversal, albeit modest, of DNA synthesis inhibition (∼15%) following UV radiation, suggesting that Claspin is involved in this S phase checkpoint. Claspin Is Required for Cell Survival—Both ATR and Chk1 are essential for normal cell survival (4Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 5de Klein A.

Given that Claspin is required for Chk1 activation and Chk1-dependent checkpoint regulation, we investigated whether Claspin would be similarly required for cell survival. As shown in Fig. 6C, inhibition of Claspin expression by siRNA greatly reduced the numbers of colonies formed, implying a potential critical role for Claspin in replication checkpoint control. The results presented here demonstrate that Claspin is one of the key regulators involved in Chk1 activation in mammalian cells. Using siRNA to down-regulate Claspin expression, we observed that Claspin is required for full Chk1 activation in response to replication stress. We have also shown that the association between Claspin and Chk1 is induced by replication stress and other types of DNA damage and appears to be phosphorylation-dependent similar to observations in Xenopus (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These studies taken together suggest that the mechanisms by which Claspin regulates Chk1 activation are conserved in vertebrates. Our study provides additional information on the possible mechanism by which Claspin regulates Chk1 activation. Our working hypothesis is that Claspin associates with ATR and is possibly phosphorylated by ATR in response to replication stress. After phosphorylation, Claspin associates with Chk1 and may facilitate Chk1 activation by ATR. Several observations suggest that ATR could be the kinase that phosphorylates Claspin. First, Claspin coimmunoprecipitates with ATR. Second, the migration of Claspin in SDS-PAGE and the association between Claspin and Chk1 are inhibited by caffeine, an ATR inhibitor (28Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Claspin has several S(Q/T)Q motifs, which are potential substrates for kinases such as ATM and ATR (3Kastan M.B. Lim D.-S. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 35Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Because Claspin interacts with both Chk1 and ATR, Claspin may act as an adaptor molecule responsible for bringing ATR and Chk1 together. Because Chk1 is phosphorylated by ATR (11Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo S. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Zhao H.

A. 2001; 98: 11289-11294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), by bringing these two kinases in proximity Claspin may facilitate the phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR. However, we were unable to detect any association between ATR and Chk1 in our co-immunoprecipitation experiments. It is possible that the ATR/Claspin/Chk1 interaction is transient and difficult to detect by the co-immunoprecipitation technique used in this study. Given that we observed an interaction between ATR and Claspin, our study supports a direct role of ATR in damage-induced phosphorylation of Claspin. However, a recent study had identified phosphopeptide motifs in Xenopus Claspin required for Claspin/Chk1 interaction (36Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These phosphopeptide sequences do not resemble the consensus ATR phosphorylation sites ((S/T)Q). Thus it remains to be determined whether ATR directly phosphorylates Claspin following DNA damage. We have also shown here that Claspin associates with the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex. This complex interacts with the Rad17 complex (37Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and has been postulated to be the sensor of the DNA damage/replication stress (20Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The current model is that ATR and Rad17-RFC are two independent protein complexes that recognize DNA damage and/or replication forks (19Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Although the Rad17 complex is required for chromatin loading of the 9-1-1 complex (a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like structure) onto DNA, it is dispensable for the recruitment of ATR to sites of DNA damage (18Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similarly, ATR is not required for the chromatin loading of the 9-1-1 complex (18Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, all of these complexes, ATR, Rad17, and 9-1-1, function in concert because they are all required for Chk1 activation (12Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 497-501Crossref Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 17Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr.

It is not yet clear how Claspin fits into this current model of checkpoint activation. In Xenopus it has been shown that Claspin associates with chromatin during S phase in an ATR- and Rad17-independent manner (38Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although Claspin, ATR, and Rad17 each bind independently to chromatin, they appear to have some functional interactions on chromatin, as all of them are required for Chk1 activation in Xenopus. Given that our results demonstrate that Claspin associates with Chk1, ATR, and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex, Claspin likely works by bridging both the 9-1-1 and ATR complexes to Chk1. Our data suggest that Claspin regulates replication checkpoints in mammalian cells. Claspin expression is cell cycle-regulated, and like Chk1, its protein level peaks in the S phase (27Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Claspin is involved in the regulation of PCC and DNA synthesis in response to DNA damage, two phenomena that are also regulated by ATR and Chk1 (6Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M.

Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 479-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), Claspin is required for cell survival. Thus, our results strongly suggest that Claspin is a mediator in the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway. We consistently observed a lesser effect by the Claspin siRNA than the Chk1 siRNA on PCC and S-phase checkpoint regulation, although they inhibited the expression of their target genes to a similar extent. These observations agree with our finding that the Claspin siRNA does not completely block Chk1 activation following DNA damage. It is possible that there are additional signaling molecules besides Claspin required for full Chk1 activation. Future studies will reveal the exact mechanism underlying the activation of Chk1 by these multiple protein complexes following DNA damage.

The present study examined the activity of ventral striatal neurons in awake, behaving rats during go/no-go odor discrimination learning and reversal. Many neurons fired selectively to odor cues predictive of either appetitive (sucrose) or aversive (quinine) outcomes. Few neurons were selective when first exposed to the odors, but many acquired this differential activity as rats learned the significance of the cues. A substantial proportion of these neurons encoded the cues' learned motivational significance, and these neurons tended to reverse their firing selectivity after reversal of odor-outcome contingencies. Other neurons that became selectively activated during learning did not reverse, but instead appeared to encode specific combinations of cues and associated motor responses. The results support a role for ventral striatum in using the learned significance, both appetitive and aversive, of predictive cues to guide behavior."

We showed that RhoA upon activation with thrombin associated with both IP3R and TRPC1. Thrombin also induced translocation of a complex consisting of Rho, IP3R, and TRPC1 to the plasma membrane. IP3R and TRPC1 translocation and association required Rho activation because the response was not seen in C3 transferase (C3)-treated cells. Rho function inhibition using Rho dominant-negative mutant or C3 dampened Ca2+ entry regardless of whether Ca2+ stores were emptied by thrombin, thapsigargin, or inositol trisphosphate. Rho-induced association of IP3R with TRPC1 was dependent on actin filament polymerization because latrunculin (which inhibits actin polymerization) prevented both the association and Ca2+ entry. We also showed that thrombin produced a sustained Rho-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] i in endothelial cells overexpressing TRPC1. We further showed that Rho-activated Ca2+ entry via TRPC1 is important in the mechanism of the thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability. In summary, Rho activation signals interaction of IP3R with TRPC1 at the plasma membrane of endothelial cells, and triggers Ca2+ entry following store depletion and the resultant increase in endothelial permeability.

For example in endothelial cells, increase in [Ca2+] i triggered by depletion of Ca2+ stores is essential for the increase in endothelial permeability induced by thrombin (5Sandoval R. Malik A.B.

The initial release of cytosolic Ca2+ occurs following the heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) on ER, and signals Ca2+ release from ER stores. Depletion of ER Ca2+ induces activation of store-operated channels (SOC), resulting in Ca2+ entry and replenishment of ER stores (8Berridge M.J. Biochem.

Despite their involvement in the mechanism of Ca2+ entry, the signals by which store depletion activate TRPC1-induced Ca2+ entry are unclear. It is believed that interaction of IP3R with TRPC is required for activation of store depletion-induced Ca2+ entry (1Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat.

Both models help to explain activation of Ca2+ entry through TRP channels (1Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat.

In the chemical-coupling model, Ca2+ store depletion induces release of diffusible messenger(s) from ER that activate SOC (26Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stuhmer W.

In the conformational coupling model, store depletion causes a IP3R conformational change that enables it to interact with TRPC, thereby resulting in channel opening (7Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 8Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 13Birnbaumer L. Boulay G. Brown D.

If a change in IP3R conformation is the sole requirement for its coupling to TRPC and its activation, Ca2+ entry through these channels should be essentially complete upon store depletion. However, patch clamp and whole cell fluorescence studies showed that complete activation of Ca2+ entry through SOC was achieved several tens to hundreds seconds after Ca2+ store depletion (1Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B.

Furthermore, this model fails to explain Ca2+ entry by TRPC1 as these channels have been shown to be localized within intracellular membranes (35Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). These inconsistencies suggest that coupling involves other events such as translocation and docking of IP3R and TRPC1 at the plasma membrane (1Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L.

Thus, it is possible that proteins capable of trafficking IP3R and TRPC1 to the membrane induce association of components of the complex and trigger Ca2+ entry.

Activation of monomeric Rho family GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, depends on the GTP/GDP exchange cycle (40Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 41Ridley A.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 42Hall A.

These proteins can traffic from cytosol to plasma membrane on activation and they also regulate vesicle trafficking (40Ridley A.J.

We and others have shown that thrombin rapidly induces activation of RhoA (but not Rac or Cdc42) in endothelial cells (43van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Draijer R. Vermeer M.A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ.

Kouklis, unpublished observations. In the present study, we addressed the possibility that RhoA induces the interaction of IP3R and TRPC1 required for activation of store depletion-induced Ca2+ entry. We observed that RhoA associated with IP3R and TRPC1 at the plasma membrane after thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells. Plasma membrane translocation of IP3R and TRPC1 and store depletion-induced Ca2+ entry were dependent on Rho because inhibition of Rho activation prevented these responses. We also showed that Rho-activated Ca2+ entry has an important functional consequence in mediating the thrombin-induced increase in transendothelial permeability. Materials—Human α-thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAEC) and endothelial growth medium were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Human microvessel endothelial cells (HMEC), a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line, were obtained from Dr. Edwin W. Ades (National Center for Infectious Diseases, Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA). LipofectAMINE, Opti-MEM I, trypsin, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and pD-SRed1-N1 (dsREd) plasmid cDNAs were obtained from Invitrogen. Superfect transfection reagent was obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Anti-RhoA polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA), anti-IP3 receptor polyclonal antibody and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-myoinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and TRPC1 polyclonal antibody and blocking peptide was purchased from Alamonos Lab (Jerusalem, Israel) or Sigma. Green fluorescent protein (pGREEN LANTERN-1, GFP) was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Alexa-phalloidin, Alexa-bound secondary Abs, Fluo3-AM, Fura2-AM, and DAPI were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). C3 transferase was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Endothelial Cell Culture—HPAEC were cultured in endothelial growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS. HMEC were grown in endothelial basal medium MCDB-131 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air until they formed confluent monolayer. Cells from each primary flask were detached with 0.05% trypsin containing 0.02% EDTA, resuspended in fresh culture medium, and passaged as described below. In all experiments, HPAEC between passages 5 and 8 were used. Cell Transfection—C3 transferase was introduced into endothelial monolayer by transfecting C3 using LipofectAMINE (46Borbiev T. Nurmukhambetova S. Liu F. Verin A.D. Garcia J.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After rinsing the monolayer with Opti-MEM I, cells were incubated with Opti-MEM I medium containing 3.5 μg/ml LipofectAMINE for 45 min. C3 transferase (2–4 μg/ml) was then added to this medium and cells were allowed to incubate for 6–8 h after which media was replaced with 10% FBS, endothelial growth medium and cells were used for experiments the following day. The EGFP vector containing wild type RhoA was a generous gift from Dr. M. Philips (New York University School of Medicine, NY), pCMV5 vector and vector containing dominant-negative (N19dn) Rho mutant were provided by Dr. T. Kozasa (University of Illinois at Chicago, IL). Transfection was performed on 50–70% confluent HPAEC grown on 4-well Lab-Tek chambers or 24-well plates using Superfect reagent following the supplier's protocol. The efficiency of transfection in HPAEC ranged from 10 to 20%. We also determined whether Rho regulates Ca2+ entry by modulating the activity of TRPC1. We overexpressed TRPC1 by 3-fold in HMEC as in these cells a high efficiency of transfection can be obtained. Briefly, HMEC grown to 50% confluence were incubated with LipofectAMINE-TRPC1 cDNA or LipofectAMINE-pcDNA3.1 vector complexes for 4 h. LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were made by incubating 4 μg of LipofectAMINE with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM I for 45 min at 22 °C. LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM before being added to HMEC, pre-washed 2 times with Opti-MEM I, for 4 h. To end the transfection procedure, 2 ml of MCDB 131-medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well for up to 16 h after which they were fed again with fresh 10% FBS-MCDB medium and allowed to grow further till confluence (47Ellis C.A.

Cells overexpressing TRPC1 were then treated without or with C3 to determine the role of Rho in modulating TRPC1-induced Ca2+ entry. Transendothelial Resistance Measurement—The time course of endothelial cell retraction in real time, a measure of increased endothelial permeability, was determined as described (48Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). HPAE cells (200,000 cells) grown to confluence on gelatin-coated small gold electrode (4.9 × 10–4 cm2) were left untreated or treated with C3, as reported previously (45Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated with thrombin to measure changes in electrical resistance of endothelial monolayer in real time. The small electrode and larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was supplied by a 1-V, 4000-Hz alternating current connected serially to 1 mΩ resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage between the small electrode and large electrode was monitored by lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed on a computer. Data are presented as change in resistive (in-phase) portion of impedance normalized to its initial value at time. [Ca2 + ]i Measurement—Increase in [Ca2+] i was measured using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes fura-2AM or fluo3-AM. For loading cells with fura-2AM, cells grown on 25-mm coverslips were incubated with 3 μm fura for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed 2 times with HBSS and imaged using an Attoflor Ratio Vision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope and a F-Fluar ×40, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Regions of interest in individual cells were marked and excited at 334 and 380 nm with emission at 520 nm. The 334/380 excitation ratio that increased as a function of [Ca2+] i was captured at 5-s intervals. For loading cells with fluo-3AM, cells were grown on 4-well Lab-Tek chambers and incubated with 3 μm fluo-3AM for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed 2× with HBSS and viewed using a LSM510 Zeiss confocal microscope with 63X 1.2 NA water immersion objective. A series of time lapse confocal images were acquired at 12.5-s intervals following thrombin stimulation using 488 and 568 nm excitation laser lines for fluo3 and dsRed fluorescence, respectively. We used the Zeiss Multitrack imaging configuration to acquire these images independent of each other to avoid cross-talk between the two fluorescent indicators. Patch Clamping of Endothelial Cells—Patch clamp in a whole cell configuration was performed on HMEC attached to a coverslip. Patch electrodes made from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass tubing without filament (Narishige, Japan) had a resistance typically between 3 and 6 mΩ when filled. Cell membrane and pipette capacitative transients were subtracted from the records by the amplifier circuitry before sampling. Voltages were not compensated for liquid junction potentials. Membrane currents were measured with an EPC-7 amplifier in conjunction with pClamp 8.1 software and a Digidata 1322 A/D converter (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The currents were filtered at 2 kHz (low-pass bessel filter) and sampled at an interval of 10 ms. Coverslips with cells were perfused at a rate of ∼2 ml/min, whereas the bath solution was continuously removed by a vacuum line. Complete solution changes were achieved within 10 s. The standard extracellular solution contained (mm) 135 sodium glutamate, 1 MgCl2, 4 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). The pipette was filled with (mm) 135 N-methyl-d-aspartic acid glutamate, 10 CsCl, 10 BAPTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 ATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). After formation of the giga-ohm seal the patch was ruptured by negative suction and the whole cell patch configuration was achieved. SOC currents were then measured at a holding potential of –50 mV by depleting the store with 30 μm 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-myoinositol-IP3 (non-metabolizable IP3) included in the pipette solution. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Co-immunoprecipitation of Rho, IP3R, and TRPC1—HPAEC grown in 100-mm dishes were serum starved followed by quick washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. The lysate was scraped and centrifuged at 4 °C at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysate containing an equal amount of protein was then incubated with rabbit IgG or incubated with anti-rabbit polyclonal Rho, IP3 receptor, or TRPC1 Abs for 3–4 h followed by addition of protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with lysis buffer without detergents after which proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling the samples suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Each sample was then electrophoresed on 10 or 4–20% linear gradient SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting with IP3 receptor, TRPC1, or Rho Abs. Specificity of the TRPC1 Ab as described recently (22Rosado J.A. Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42157-42163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was confirmed by using peptide immunogen as a negative control. Measurement of Rho Activity—pGEX-2T containing Rhotekin-Rho binding domain was provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Bacterial expressed GST-Rhotekin Rho binding domain protein (GST-RBD) was purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranozide (1 mm)-induced DH5α cells previously transformed with the appropriate plasmid as described (49Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Confluent HPAE cells grown in 100-mm dishes were stimulated for the indicated times with 50 nm thrombin. Cells were then quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min and equal volumes of cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD beads (15 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and bound Rho was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples from beads and total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-RhoA, anti-IP3R, or anti-TRPC1 Abs. In addition, cell lysate from each sample was Western blotted with anti-RhoA Ab to confirm equal protein loading in each lane. Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells were fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in HBSS containing 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, at room tempe"
https://openalex.org/W2020744351,"During a sensory discrimination task, the responses of multiple sensory neurons must be combined to generate a choice. The optimal combination of responses is determined both by their dependence on the sensory stimulus and by their cofluctuations across trials-that is, the noise correlations. Positively correlated noise is considered deleterious, because it limits the coding accuracy of populations of similarly tuned neurons. However, positively correlated fluctuations between differently tuned neurons actually increase coding accuracy, because they allow the common noise to be subtracted without signal loss. This is demonstrated with data recorded from the secondary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a vibrotactile discrimination task. The results indicate that positive correlations are not always harmful and may be exploited by cortical networks to enhance the neural representation of features to be discriminated."
https://openalex.org/W2046490985,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy-sensing enzyme that plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular metabolism for sustaining energy homeostasis under stress conditions. Activation of AMPK has been observed in the heart during acute and chronic stresses, but its functional role has not been completely understood because of the lack of effective activators and inhibitors of this kinase in the heart. We generated transgenic mice (TG) with cardiac-specific overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of the AMPK α2 catalytic subunit to clarify the functional role of this kinase in myocardial ischemia. In isolated perfused hearts subjected to a 10-min ischemia, AMPK α2 activity in wild type (WT) increased substantially (by 4.5-fold), whereas AMPK α2 activity in TG was similar to the level of WT at base line. Basal AMPK α1 activity was unchanged in TG and increased normally during ischemia. Ischemia stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake over base line in WT, whereas the inactivation of AMPK α2 in TG significantly blunted this response. Using 31P NMR spectroscopy, we found that ATP depletion was accelerated in TG hearts during no-flow ischemia, and these hearts developed left ventricular dysfunction manifested by an early and more rapid increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The exacerbated ATP depletion could not be attributed to impaired glycolytic ATP synthesis because TG hearts consumed slightly more glycogen during this period of no-flow ischemia. Thus, AMPK α2 is necessary for maintaining myocardial energy homeostasis during ischemia. It is likely that the functional role of AMPK in myocardial energy metabolism resides both in energy supply and utilization.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; TG, transgenic; WT, wild type; PCr, phosphocreatine; HA, hemagglutinin; 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; pHi, intracellular pH; ANOVA, analysis of variance. functions as a fuel gauge, such that when the cell is exposed to stresses associated with energy depletion, it switches off ATP-utilizing pathways and switches on ATP-generating pathways to restore energy homeostasis (1Hardie D.G.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). This kinase is activated by decreases in ATP/AMP and in phosphocreatine (PCr)/creatine through Thr172 phosphorylation by one or more upstream kinases (AMPK kinase) and through allosteric modification by AMP (1Hardie D.G.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (1Hardie D.G.

Each subunit has two or more different isoforms; the α1 subunit is widely expressed, whereas the α2 subunit is expressed primarily in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar). As glycolysis is a major source of ATP during ischemia, stimulation of glucose uptake and glycolysis by AMPK in the ischemic heart is consistent with the overall function of this enzyme in restoring cellular energy levels during stress. To establish a causal role of AMPK for these stress responses, however, inhibition of AMPK is required during stress. This has not been possible because of the lack of a specific inhibitor of AMPK in the heart. Furthermore, the inability to block AMPK activation during ischemia makes it difficult to test whether AMPK also functions to preserve energy by reducing ATP consumption by the heart during ischemia. In the present study, we sought to inhibit AMPK activity by generating transgenic mice (TG) overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of the AMPK α2 catalytic subunit in the heart. This approach led to a selective inhibition of AMPK α2 activity in the heart. Here we report that AMPK α2 mediates critical cellular responses in maintaining energy homeostasis in the ischemic heart. Generation of Transgenic Mice—A full-length cDNA of rat AMPK α2 subunit was tagged at the 5′ end with a HA epitope. The aspartic acid at residue 157 was changed to alanine to render the catalytic subunit inactive (14Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 15Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The TG mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the mutant α2 subunit were generated by injecting the recombinant DNA construct, regulated by a mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter, into fertilized Friend virus B-type mouse oocytes. Transgenic mouse founders were identified by the polymerase chain reaction-based method, and transgene expression was confirmed by Western blotting of the HA tag. Three transgenic lines were established. Mice from F1 and F2 generations were used for this study, and TG mice were compared with their wild type (WT) littermates. All the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Harvard Medical School. Isolated Perfused Heart Experiments—Hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode with phosphate-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing (in millimoles/liter) NaCl (118), NaHCO3 (25Bergeron R.

Abel E.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All hearts were perfused with a constant perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg, and the left ventricular function was continuously monitored using a water-filled balloon (16Tian R. Abel E.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the protocols for isolated perfused heart experiments. After stabilization, one base-line 31P NMR spectrum was collected (16Tian R. Abel E.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and one-half of the hearts were subjected to a 10-min no-flow ischemia and the other half to a 10-min normal perfusion. During ischemia, four consecutive 2-min 31P NMR spectra were collected to monitor the dynamic changes in high energy phosphate content. At the end of the 10-min period, a subgroup of hearts was freeze-clamped for biochemical analysis, and the rest were reperfused with a buffer in which glucose was replaced with 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). Five consecutive 4-min 31P NMR spectra were collected for determination of the time-dependent accumulation of 2-DG-phosphate. The rate of glucose uptake was estimated by the slope of the fitted line as described previously (11Tian R. Musi N. D'Agostino J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J.

During 2-DG perfusion, 1.2 mm KH2PO4 and5mm pyruvate were supplied to replenish the intracellular inorganic phosphate pool and to maintain ATP synthesis. AMPK Activity Assay and Western Blotting—Freeze-clamped heart samples were homogenized as described previously, and lysates were used for AMPK activity assays and for Western blotting (18Musi N. Fujii N. Hirshman M.F. Ekberg I. Froberg S. Ljungqvist O. Thorell A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). AMPK activity was measured after immunoprecipitating 200 μg of protein using antibodies made against the amino acid sequences 339–358 of rat AMPK α1, 352–366 of α2, and 2–16 of both α1 and α2 (pan-α) (18Musi N. Fujii N. Hirshman M.F. Ekberg I. Froberg S. Ljungqvist O. Thorell A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was done using synthetic peptide with sequence HMR-SAMSGLHLVKRR as substrate, and AMPK activity is expressed as incorporated ATP (picomoles) per mg of protein per min (19Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Western blotting was done with antibodies against AMPK α1, α2, pan-α, HA (Roche Diagnostics), GLUT1, GLUT4 (Chemicon, Intl., Inc., Temecula, CA), SERCA2 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland). HPLC Measurements and Glycogen Assay—Freeze-clamped tissues were used for determination of myocardial content of adenine nucleotides, nucleosides, and purine bases by a HPLC method as reported previously (20Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Myocardial glycogen content was determined by measuring the amount of glucose released from glycogen by use of an alkaline extraction to separate glycogen and exogenous glucose (21Passonneau J.V. Lauderdale V.R. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Glucose content in the extract was measured using a Sigma assay kit. Data Analysis and Statistics—Myocardial ATP content obtained by HPLC was converted to [ATP] assuming an intracellular water content of 0.48 ml and a protein content of 0.15 g/g of blotted wet tissue (22Polimeni P.I. Buraczewski S.I. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1988; 20: 15-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mean value of [ATP] for WT or TG hearts was used to calibrate the ATP peak area of the base-line 31P NMR spectrum. Concentrations of other metabolites were calculated using the ratio of their peak areas to the ATP peak area, and intracellular pH (pHi) was determined by the chemical shift of inorganic phosphate (Pi) relative to PCr (20Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The values of [ATP] and [PCr] in the ischemic hearts were obtained from summed spectra of 3–4 hearts. Each data point represents the average of four summed results from a total of 13 hearts. Differences in results obtained from WT and TG hearts were compared by 2-tailed Student's t test or one-way factorial ANOVA. Changes during ischemia and 2-DG perfusion were compared by repeated-measures ANOVA. All the statistical analyses were performed with Statview (Brainpower Inc.), and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expressing Dominant Negative α2 Subunit Resulted in Isoform-specific Inhibition of AMPK Activity—The mutant α2 subunit of AMPK was expressed in TG hearts as evidenced by the presence of HA-tagged protein (Fig. 2A). The expression of mutant α2 subunit caused an upward shift of the AMPK α2 band (due to the HA tagging). The presence of a single shifted AMPK α2 band in the TG hearts suggests that the native AMPK α2 protein is replaced by the mutant protein (Fig. 2A). Because monomeric α subunit protein is unstable and has a short life span (23Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35347-35354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), those endogenous α subunits that were displaced by the mutant protein and failed to bind with β and γ subunits are likely to be degraded. In contrast to the changes in AMPK α2, the amount of AMPK α1 was unchanged in the TG hearts (Fig. 2B). AMPK α2 activity was reduced in the TG hearts at base line by 78% (Fig. 3A). Ischemia increased AMPK α2 activity by 4.5-fold in the WT hearts, whereas the activation of AMPK α2 in the TG hearts was severely blunted (Fig. 3A). The AMPK α1 activity in TG hearts was not different from that of WT hearts at base line, and it increased normally in response to ischemia (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that the dominant negative transgenic approach used here resulted in specific inhibition of AMPK α2 activity in the heart. Blocking the activation of AMPK α2 during ischemia led to a 65% reduction in total AMPK activity in the heart (Fig. 3C), suggesting that AMPK α2 is a major contributor to ischemia-stimulated AMPK activity in the heart. General Characteristics and Cardiac Function of the TG Mice— Table I summarizes the base-line characteristics of the mice used for this study. There was no difference in the body weight and heart weight between TG and WT mice. The TG mice were grossly normal, and no premature death was observed up to 1 year (data not shown). Left ventricular contractile function at base line was similar for TG and WT hearts, suggesting that inhibition of AMPK α2 activity does not alter cardiac function during normal perfusion. When subjected to ischemia, however, the TG hearts showed a more rapid increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (Fig. 4, LVEDP). This is unlikely because of a decrease in the amount of calcium-handling proteins in TG hearts. The protein levels for SERCA2 and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger were unchanged in TG hearts (SERCA2: 31 ± 1 versus 32 ± 2 absorbance units; and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger: 79 ± 2 versus 76 ± 2 absorbance units for WT and TG, respectively, n = 4 in each group). The rapid increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is consistent with the observation that ATP depletion was accelerated during ischemia in TG hearts (see below), implying a faster development of myofibril rigor force in these hearts.Table IGeneral characteristics and base-line cardiac functionWT (n = 50)TG (n = 41)Age (weeks)15.8 ± 1.317.3 ± 2.3Body weight (g)26.6 ± 0.526.4 ± 0.7Heart weight (mg)82 ± 6.482 ± 1.5LVSP (mm Hg)108 ± 19111 ± 20LVEDP (mm Hg)7.3 ± 1.37.4 ± 1.4HR (bpm)324 ± 56316 ± 58CF (ml/min)3.1 ± 12.8 ± 1 Open table in a new tab High Energy Phosphate Content—Dynamic changes in high energy phosphate content during ischemia were monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy and shown in Fig. 5. Pre-ischemic values of [PCr], [ATP], and [Pi] are not different in WT and TG hearts. [PCr] decreased rapidly in both groups during ischemia; the PCr peak was no longer detectable in TG hearts after 4 min of ischemia, whereas a very low but detectable PCr peak remained for 2 more minutes in WT hearts. The rate and extent of ATP depletion was also accelerated in TG hearts; [ATP] decreased by 80 and 55% from the pre-ischemic value in TG and WT hearts, respectively (p < 0.05). The [Pi] rose markedly (by 10-fold) during ischemia. The pHi decreased significantly in both groups, but pHi was lower in WT hearts than in TG hearts at the end of ischemia (6.40 ± 0.03 and 6.58 ± 0.05, respectively, p < 0.05). Table II shows ATP degradation and accumulation of adenine nucleosides and purine bases during ischemia measured by HPLC. Myocardial content of adenine nucleotides was similar in WT and TG hearts during base-line perfusion. At the end of a 10-min ischemia, ATP content in TG and WT hearts decreased by 80 and 60% from the base-line value, respectively (p < 0.05). Thus, the measurement by HPLC was consistent with the NMR measurement. Increased ATP degradation in the TG hearts during ischemia resulted in a tendency for higher content of AMP, adenosine, and inosine compared with WT (Table II).Table IIContent of adenine nucleotides, nucleosides, and purine bases in the mouse heartATPADPAMPADOINOHYPOXANTotalWT-con (n = 3)37 ± 27.6 ± 11.7 ± 0.4trtrtrtr46 ± 2TG-con (n = 3)35 ± 58.9 ± 32.1 ± 1.2trtrtrtr46 ± 8WT-isch (n = 5)14 ± 212 ± 113 ± 31.2 ± 0.33.5 ± 0.90.7 ± 0.021.6 ± 0.845 ± 3TG-isch (n = 5)8 ± 2ap < 0.05 versus WT-isch.11 ± 217 ± 32.1 ± 0.54.7 ± 1.20.6 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.143 ± 4a p < 0.05 versus WT-isch.

The protein content of GLUT1 and GLUT4, two primary glucose transporters in the heart, was also unchanged in TG hearts (Fig. 7). These results suggest that AMPK α2 has a minimum effect on glucose metabolism in hearts under unstressed conditions.Table IIIGlycogen content (μmol of glucoselg of protein) and ATP generated by glycogenolysis (μmol/g wet wt)WT (n = 8)TG (n = 9)Pre-ischemic glycogen139 ± 29134 ± 30Post-ischemic glycogen47 ± 726 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus WT.Glycogen consumed92108ATP generated4149a p < 0.05 versus WT.

In contrast, 2-DG uptake increased by only 1.7-fold in TG hearts after ischemia, representing a 62% reduction in the response to ischemia (Fig. 6). Thus, blocking the activation of AMPK α2 in the ischemic heart significantly blunted the increase in myocardial glucose uptake. During no-flow ischemia, glycogen is the only substrate for anaerobic glycolysis that generates ATP. To assess glycogen consumption during ischemia, we determined the differences in average myocardial glycogen content before and after ischemia (Table III). ATP produced from glycogen consumption was estimated assuming that each glucose molecule derived from glycogen gave three molecules of ATP. Interestingly, glycogen content in TG hearts at the end of ischemia was lower than WT hearts, and ATP generated during ischemia was slightly greater in TG hearts. These results indicate that accelerated ATP depletion in TG hearts during ischemia is not because of impaired ATP generation via glycogenolysis. There are three major findings in this study. First, overexpressing the dominant negative α2 subunit of AMPK in mouse hearts results in isoform-specific inhibition of AMPK α2 activity. Second, blocking the activation of AMPK α2 dramatically reduces ischemia-stimulated glucose uptake in the heart. Third, inhibition of AMPK α2 activity during ischemia leads to an accelerated depletion of ATP and exacerbated diastolic dysfunction, possibly because of increased energy consumption. These results demonstrate that AMPK α2 regulates energy metabolism in the ischemic hearts by modulating both energy supply and expenditure. Selective Inhibition of AMPK α2 Activity—Little is known about the isoform-specific characteristics of the AMPK heterotrimers. In this study, we sought to inhibit AMPK activity by generating transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of the α2 subunit (D157A) (14Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 15Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of this mutant α2 subunit results in substantial and selective replacement of the native α2 subunit while leaving the α1 subunit unaffected. Accordingly, AMPK α1 activity in TG hearts remains unchanged and responds normally during ischemia. We found that total AMPK activity, measured by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against pan-α-AMPK was reduced by two thirds, supporting the notion that AMPK α2 contributes the majority of AMPK activity under these conditions. In a transgenic mouse model described previously, in which a different mutation of α2 subunit (R45K) was overexpressed in skeletal muscle (24Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), the authors reported that both native α subunits were replaced by the mutant. This apparent discrepancy between the two models raises the possibility that skeletal muscle differs from cardiac muscle in subunit composition and/or subcellular localization of AMPK heterotrimers. Selective inhibition of AMPK α2 activity in the heart, as observed in our model, offers a unique opportunity to examine isoform-specific function of AMPK in the heart. AMPK α2 and Glucose Metabolism—AMPK has emerged as a potential mediator of increased glucose uptake in response to energy depletion. Pharmacological activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside results in increased glucose uptake in both skeletal and cardiac muscle in an insulin-independent fashion (13Russell 3rd, R.R. Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bergeron R. Russell 3rd, R.R. Young L.H. Ren J.M. Marcucci M. Lee A. Shulman G.I. Am. J.

Furthermore, a close relationship between increased AMPK activity and enhanced glucose uptake has been observed under a variety of stress conditions (8Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Because ischemia also stimulates glucose uptake through an insulin-independent mechanism (27Tong H. Chen W. London R.E. Murphy E. Steenbergen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11981-11986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Russell 3rd, R.R. Yin R. Caplan M.J. Hu X. Ren J. Shulman G.I. Sinusas A.J. Young L.H.

Res. 1999; 84: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the role of AMPK in this event is strongly implied. Yet, the effort of defining a causal relationship between AMPK activation and increased glucose uptake during ischemia has been hindered by the lack of an effective AMPK inhibitor for the heart. Using the transgenic approach to prevent AMPK activation, here we provide the first direct evidence that AMPK α2 plays a critical role in ischemia-stimulated glucose uptake. Our results also show that AMPK α2 is not the sole mediator for ischemia-stimulated glucose uptake. The finding that AMPK α2-specific TG hearts have a partial reduction in ischemia-stimulated glucose uptake raises the possibility that AMPK α1 is also important in the regulation of glucose uptake in the heart. Our study, however, does not rule out the possibility that other mechanisms in addition to AMPK are also responsible for ischemia-stimulated glucose uptake. It has been suggested that AMPK contributes to enhanced glycolysis during ischemia by activating 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent stimulator of glycolysis (10Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In this study, we found a greater breakdown of glycogen in TG hearts during no-flow ischemia, suggesting that AMPK α2 activity is not required for stimulating glycolysis under our experimental conditions. Because the total AMPK activity increased partially in the ischemic TG hearts due to the activation of AMPK α1, it is possible that this increase is sufficient to activate 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and hence stimulate glycolysis. In addition, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase can be phosphorylated and activated by other kinases such as protein kinase A (30Depre C. Rider M.H. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, glycolysis is also regulated by the concentrations of adenine nucleotides and intracellular pH (31Uyeda K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 48: 193-244PubMed Google Scholar, 32Opie L.H. The Heart: Physiology, from Cell to Circulation. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1998: 295-342Google Scholar). Both accelerated depletion of ATP and reduced acidosis in TG hearts would favor increased glycolytic flux. Considering the essential role of glycolysis for myocardial survival during ischemia, it is conceivable that redundant signaling mechanisms exist for stimulation of glycolysis. Role of AMPK α2 in Energy Homeostasis during Ischemia—We found normal content of high energy phosphate and adenine nucleotides in the TG hearts under base-line conditions. This observation, together with the apparent normal glucose metabolism in unstressed TG hearts, support the notion that the primary function of AMPK is to regulate cellular response to stress. By subjecting hearts to ischemia, we observed a more rapid decline of ATP in TG hearts. This finding suggests that AMPK α2 plays a critical role in sustaining energy homeostasis in stressed hearts. Importantly, the exacerbated ATP degradation cannot be explained by decreased ATP synthesis via glycogenolysis. Because the no-flow ischemia protocol applied in this study does not allow utilization of energy substrates other than glycogen, our results likely indicate increased ATP consumption by TG hearts during ischemia. It has been shown that in the liver AMPK reduces energy consumption by switching off synthetic reactions in the cell (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev.

It has not been determined if AMPK mediates energy conservation mechanisms in the heart. The majority of energy consumed by the heart supports contractile function, i.e. the myosin ATPase reaction (33Gibbs C.L. Papadoyannis D.E. Drake A.J. Noble M.I. Circ. Res. 1980; 47: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Suga H. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 247-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). During our ischemic protocol, the heart stops contracting in less than 1 min. Increased ATP depletion in TG hearts under this condition likely reflects increased ATP consumption for noncontractile function, predominantly for maintaining basal metabolism and ion homeostasis (33Gibbs C.L. Papadoyannis D.E. Drake A.J. Noble M.I. Circ. Res. 1980; 47: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Suga H. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 247-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). On this note, we found a slower decline in pHi indicating a reduced accumulation of intracellular H+ in TG hearts. This is in contrast to the observation that degradation of ATP and glycogen is accelerated in TG hearts, which would lead to increased H+ production during ischemia. Thus, it is likely that the TG heart is more active in exporting H+. Taken together, our findings suggest that AMPK α2 plays a role in energy conservation in the ischemic heart, possibly by modifying the ion transport process. In summary, inactivation of AMPK α2 causes accelerated ATP depletion and early development of myocardial contracture and leads to decreased glucose uptake in response to ischemia. These findings suggest that AMPK plays a critical role in sustaining energy homeostasis and myocardial protection during ischemia, possibly by modulating cellular functions for both energy supply and utilization.

Paradoxically, arsenic also may serve as an anti-tumor therapy, although the mechanisms of its antineoplastic effects remain unclear. Arsenic exerts its toxicity in part by generating reactive oxygen species. We show that arsenic-induced oxidative stress promotes telomere attrition, chromosome end-to-end fusions, and apoptotic cell death. An antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, effectively prevents arsenic-induced oxidative stress, telomere erosion, chromosome instability, and apoptosis, suggesting that increasing the intracellular antioxidant level may have preventive or therapeutic effects in arsenic-induced chromosome instability and genotoxicity. Embryos with shortened telomeres from late generation telomerase-deficient mice exhibit increased sensitivity to arsenic-induced oxidative damage, suggesting that telomere attrition mediates arsenic-induced apoptosis. Unexpectedly, arsenite did not cause chromosome end-to-end fusions in telomerase RNA knockout mouse embryos despite progressively damaged telomeres and disrupting embryo viability. Together, these findings may explain why arsenic can initiate oxidative stress and telomere erosion, leading to apoptosis and anti-tumor therapy on the one hand and chromosome instability and carcinogenesis on the other.

In particular, arsenic exerts its toxicity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; TR–/–, telomerase knockout; WT, wild type; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; TR–/–, telomerase knockout; WT, wild type; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Mitochondria, the main source of ROS production, which also play a crucial role in the control of apoptosis (23Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 24Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), have been implicated in arsenite-induced apoptosis (21Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell.

Cell Res. 1999; 249: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction may explain the cytotoxicity and degenerative effects induced by arsenic. How ROS links arsenic exposure to carcinogenesis is still not well understood.Vertebrate telomeres consist of tandem repeats of G-rich sequence that cap the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from fusion and chromosomal instability. The telomerase RNA template (TR) cooperates with telomerase reverse transcriptase, the catalytic subunit, to form active telomerase, which is primarily responsible for telomere elongation during cell division (26Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Telomere shortening, chromosome end-to-end fusion, and reactivation of telomerase are known to promote carcinogenesis in p53 mutant backgrounds (27Chin L. Artandi S.E. Shen Q. Tam A. Lee S.L.

Human cells are more sensitive to arsenite than are cells of rodent origin (30Lee T.C. Wei M.L. Chang W.J. Ho I.C. Lo J.F. Jan K.Y. Huang H. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Lee T.C. Ho I.C. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and one possible reason for this difference could be attributed to the short telomeres found in human cells (32Kipling D. Cooke H.J. Nature. 1990; 347: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 33Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W.

Differences between mouse and human telomeres limit the laboratory mouse as a straightforward model to critically test the role of telomere dysfunction and telomerase in human malignancy (35Kipling D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, telomerase RNA knockout (TR–/–) mice show progressive telomere shortening and chromosome instability with increasing generations and also exhibit defects in highly proliferative tissues, affecting fetal development, growth, immune function, and carcinogenesis (36Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We sought to investigate the influence of arsenic on both mitochondrial function and genomic instability using mouse early embryos as models. This experimental model has a unique advantage such that it allows non-invasive assessment of cell viability by direct observation of cleavage and blastocyst formation as well as precise control over confounding variables possibly present in intact animal models. We further examined whether TR–/– mice, with shortened telomeres, are more sensitive to arsenite-induced genotoxicity, similar to human cells.We show that arsenic-induced oxidative stress promotes telomere attrition, chromosome end-to-end fusions, and apoptotic cell death. An antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, effectively prevents arsenic-induced oxidative stress, telomere erosion, chromosome instability, and apoptosis, further supporting the notion that oxidative stress is involved in arsenic-induced chromosome instability and genotoxicity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice, Embryos, and in Vitro Culture—Outbreed CD1 mice or telomerase-deficient mice (36Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

Female mice were induced to super-ovulate by consecutive injection of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin and mated with proven fertile males. Zygotes were collected from oviducts 20–21 h after injection of human chorionic gonadotropin and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2 in potassium simplex optimized media supplemented with nonessential amino acids (42Liu L. Blasco M.A. Trimarchi J.R. Keefe D.L. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Reactive Oxygen Species—Dynamics in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were measured by quantification of fluorescence intensity of cells stained with the probe tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Zygotes were loaded with 150 nm TMRE in potassium simplex optimized media for 30 min at 37 °C, and relative TMRE fluorescence intensity was imaged in Hepes-buffered potassium simplex optimized media containing 50 nm TMRE using an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) and analyzed using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA). Fluorescence was acquired at the excitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission wavelength of 580 nm. The intracellular production of ROS was determined using the fluorescent probe carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes). Zygotes were loaded with 5 μm carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein diacetate at 37 °C for 25 min and washed, and carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.Immunocytochemistry for Localization of Cytochrome c—Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was assessed by immunocytochemistry (43Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen). Embryos were washed and then incubated with Texas Red anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cytochrome c localization was detected by fluorescence microscopy using a Texas Red filter (excitation 595 nm, emission 610–615 nm).Detection of Telomere Length Using Quantitative Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) with a Telomere Probe—Embryos were arrested at metaphase with nocodazole (0.5 μg/ml) and prepared for chromosome spreads. FISH with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (CCCTAA)3 peptide nucleic acid probe (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chromosomes were counterstained with 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Embryos were mounted onto a glass slide in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Telomeres were detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axiophot), and images were captured by an AxioCam and AxioVision 3.0 software. Telomere detection using peptide nucleic acid probe for mouse cells has been described previously (34Zijlmans J.M. Martens U.M. Poon S.S. Raap A.K. Tanke H.J. Ward R.K. Lansdorp P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7423-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar).Apoptotic Assay—DNA fragmentation was detected by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturer's instruction, and nuclei were counterstained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) and assessed by a Zeiss fluorescence microscopy. Statistical significance was analyzed by analysis of variance using Stat-View software (SAS, Cary, NC).RESULTSArsenite Compromises Embryo Viability—Survival of outbreed CD-1 mouse embryos was compromised by exposure to arsenite in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Embryo viability, determined by both cleavage at 20–24 h and the ability to develop to the blastocyst stage at 90–96 h in culture (Fig. 1A), was not affected by exposure to 2 μg/ml arsenite for 2 h. The dosage was chosen based on previous study using sodium arsenite (20Hei T.K. Liu S.X. Waldren C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 22Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I. Waldren C. Hei T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, exposure of zygotes to 2 μg/ml arsenite overnight (20 h) completely inhibited cleavage and subsequent development in all embryos (n = 44). Increasing doses of arsenite over a 2-h exposure progressively reduced embryo survival (Fig. 1B). Exposure of mouse zygotes to 4 or 8 μg/ml arsenite significantly reduced cleavage rate (78%, n = 64 or 17%, n = 67, respectively) compared with control zygotes (95%, n = 72, p < 0.01). By 90–96 h, most (93%) untreated embryos reached the blastocyst stage, whereas only 40% of zygotes treated with 4 μg/ml arsenite and none of zygotes treated with 8 μg/ml arsenite reached blastocyst stage.The total cell number in blastocysts derived from zygotes treated with 4 μg/ml arsenite for 2 h was significantly reduced, and apoptosis was significantly increased (37 ± 12.5 and 6.0 ± 2.2, respectively, n = 7) compared with those of controls (52.5 ± 15.4 and 2.5 ± 2.1, respectively, n = 11; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A and B, and D and E). The total cell number in developed blastocysts did not differ between zygotes treated with 2 μg/ml arsenite and untreated zygotes as control (Fig. 2, D and E). Many of the arrested embryos that failed to reach blastocysts showed apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that arsenite affects embryo viability through apoptosis.Fig. 2Apoptosis is increased in arsenite-treated embryos. A, control blastocyst showed total cell nuclei stained by propidium iodide (red) and one apoptotic nucleus (yellow green). A blastocyst (B) and arrested embryos (C) derived from zygotes treated with 4 μg/ml arsenite for 2 h showed increased apoptotic nuclei and fewer cells. D, total cell number (mean ± S.D.) is significantly less. E, apoptotic cell number (mean ± S.D.) is significantly increased (p < 0.01) in blastocysts from 4 μg/ml arsenite-treated zygotes than non-treated and 2 μg/ml arsenite-treated zygotes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Arsenite Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Promotes ROS Production—To further determine mechanisms of arsenic-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell survival, we examined mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, and cytochrome c release, an early signal of apoptosis. Arsenite gradually disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) (Fig. 3A). Adding vehicle did not change Δψm in controls. At 60 min after exposure to 8 μg/ml arsenite, the Δψm was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (62.4 ± 12.1 and 87.2 ± 3.8%, respectively, n = 5, p < 0.001). From 80 min after exposure to arsenite, the Δψm reduced to half the levels of normal controls. Zygotes treated with 8 μg/ml arsenite exhibited obvious membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage 24 h after treatment followed by cytofragmentation at 48 h (Fig. 1A). These morphological events are consistent with apoptosis induced by acute oxidative stress. Embryos treated with 8 μg/ml for 1 h cleaved normally to equal 2 cells and developed further to blastocysts, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs before developmental impairment.Fig. 3Arsenite induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Zygotes treated with 8 μg/ml arsenite exhibited significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential measured by TMRE fluorescence intensity (mean ± S.D.) 60 min after treatment (A) and significantly increased reactive oxygen species, indicated by carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein fluorescence 2 h after treatment (B), and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, as indicated by diffuse cytochrome c staining in the cytoplasm 7 h after treatment. Control embryos showed punctate staining of cytochrome c in the mitochondria (C). The asterisk indicates p < 0.01, compared with controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ROS were significantly increased after exposure of zygotes to arsenite (8 μg/ml) for 2 h compared with controls (relative fluorescence intensity valued at 2.1 ± 0.31, n = 11, and 1.0 ± 0.09, n = 10, respectively, Fig. 3B). The increased ROS production coincided with sustained low Δψm after arsenite challenge. At 2 h after exposure of zygotes to 8 μg/ml arsenite, cytochrome c was localized in mitochondria and was not abnormally distributed compared with control zygotes, which displayed reticulate and punctate staining, indicative of localization of mitochondria (43Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) (data not shown) (Fig. 3C). However, zygotes treated with 8 μg/ml arsenite for 2 h, then washed and cultured in normal medium for a further 5 h exhibited a diffuse distribution of cytochrome c staining in the cytoplasm, indicative of its release from mitochondria into cytoplasm. These results show that oxidative stress and apoptosis links arsenic actions to mitochondrial dysfunction.Antioxidant Rescues Embryos from Arsenite Toxicity—If arsenic-induced ROS caused cell death, then adding antioxidants might prevent embryos from undergoing apoptosis, and promoted cell survival. The antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which scavenges ROS, at a concentration of 30 mm effectively prevented cytochrome c release from mitochondria in zygotes challenged by arsenite (Fig. 3C). Arsenite-treated embryos consistently manifested membrane blebbing with no cleavage at 20–24 h and no blastocyst formation at 90–96 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Not unexpectedly, NAC rescued embryos from blebbing and promoted development to blastocysts. Zygotes co-treated with NAC and arsenite cleaved and developed to blastocysts at a frequency significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that of zygotes treated with only 2 μg/ml arsenite for 20 h or 4 or 8 μg/ml arsenite for 2 h but were indistinguishable from those of NAC-treated embryos as control (Fig. 4C). A majority of blastocysts from embryos co-treated with arsenite and NAC were expanded or hatching, but the few blastocysts that survived from arsenite treatment without NAC were not expanded or hatching. The total cell number and apoptotic cells did not differ between blastocysts that developed from zygotes co-treated with NAC and arsenite and NAC controls (p > 0.05, Fig. 4D). Thus, antioxidant prevents oxidative stress induced by arsenite and increases cell survival.Fig. 4Antioxidant protects embryos from arsenite-induced oxidative damage. Representative images showing zygotes co-treated with arsenite and antioxidant NAC (30 mm) cleaved normally to 2-cell stage at 20–24 h (A) and blastocysts at 90–96 h (B). C, 30 mm NAC effectively rescued embryo survival, indicated by rates (mean ± S.E., 3–4 replicates) of cleavage and blastocyst formation regardless of arsenite treatment at 4 or 8 μg/ml for 2 h or 2 μg/ml for 22 h. The single asterisk (*) and double asterisks (**) indicate p < 0.01 for cleavage and blastocyst, respectively. D, the total cell number and apoptotic cells did not differ (mean ± S.D., p > 0.05) in blastocysts from zygotes co-treated by arsenite and NAC, compared with those of NAC controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Oxidative Stress by Arsenite Causes Telomere Dysfunction and Genomic Instability—We and others previously showed that oxidative stress could damage telomeres.

We also utilized the absence of obvious telomere fluorescence signals at the end of chromosomes and chromosome fusion by quantitative FISH to indicate telomere dysfunction as well as chromosome instability. Chromosome spreads of normal blastocysts from untreated CD-1 mouse zygotes (n = 40) showed obvious telomere fluorescence signals at each chromosome end and normal chromosomal ploidy (Fig. 5A). No obvious telomere loss or chromosome fusions were found. Higher doses of arsenite (8 μg/ml) caused embryos to arrest at interphase or undergo apoptosis, with no chromosome spreads suitable for telomere analysis. Some zygotes exposed to 4 μg/ml arsenite for 2 h, which had arrested at interphase stage from 2-cell stage to morula stage, also failed to produce mitotic chromosome spreads, preventing analysis for telomere function. However, 43% of arrested embryos (n = 14) with observable chromosome spreads harbored either at least one chromosome end-to-end fusion where telomere signals were not readily visible (Fig. 5, B and C) or fragmented chromosomes with extensive erosion of telomere signals. Thirty percent of surviving blastocysts (n = 20) also showed one or more telomere losses and chromosome end-to-end fusions (Fig. 5D). Chromosome end-to-end fusions were found more frequently at the p-arm close to centromeres, brightly stained by DNA dye Hoechst or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Fig. 5, B and D), than at the q-arm of chromosomes (Fig. 5C). Aneuploidy was consistently observed in embryos with telomere loss and chromosome fusions.Fig. 5Arsenite damages telomeres and causes chromosome end-to-end fusion in CD1 mouse embryos. A, a normal chromosome spread from untreated blastocysts showing telomere fluorescence signals at the ends of chromosomes. B–D, arsenite (4 μg/ml) induced loss of telomere fluorescence signals at the chromosome ends where chromosomes are fused (arrows) in arrested embryos (B and C) and a survived blastocyst (D). Arrowheads indicate two centromere regions at the p-arm. Telomeres (green) are detected by peptide nucleic acid telomere probe using FISH. Chromosomes (blue) were counter-stained by DNA dye Hoechst 33342.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If the observed telomere dysfunction and chromosome end-to-end fusions were indeed triggered by ROS produced by arsenite-stressed mitochondria, then reducing ROS with an antioxidant would expectedly prevent telomere loss and chromosome fusions. Indeed, co-treatment of arsenite and NAC significantly reduced telomere dysfunction and chromosome fusion. In 50 chromosome spreads analyzed, only 3 (6%) from arrested embryos showed telomere loss and chromosome end-to-end fusion, indicating that embryos failed from rescue by antioxidants exhibited similar phenotypes of embryos treated with arsenite alone. Other chromosome spreads showed obvious telomere signals at the chromosome ends and normal ploidy. Again, these results suggest that maintenance of telomere function in chromosomes and therein of embryo viability by oxidant scavenger NAC may be a consequence of embryos having escaped from the significantly reduced oxidative stress. Thus, ROS could be an important mediator that links arsenite toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere shortening and erosion, genomic instability, and cell viability.Telomerase-deficient Mouse Embryos with Shortened Telomeres Are More Sensitive to Arsenite-mediated Inhibition of Cell Survival—To further confirm that arsenic-induced oxidative stress and increased apoptosis resulted from telomere dysfunction, we compared embryo survival after exposure to arsenic treatment between wild-type (WT) and age-matched, third generation telomerase-deficient mice (G3 TR–/–) with shortened telomeres (36Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

In MDA-MB-231 cells, immunolocalization and brefeldin A protein transport blocking studies revealed that there was a propensity for newly synthesized Cx43 to be transported to lysosomes. On the other hand, light and electron microscopic analysis of BICR-M1Rk cells showed that Cx43 gap junctions were prevalent with a subpopulation of intracellular Cx43 localized to lysosomes. In both cell types, Western blots revealed a notable increase in total cellular Cx43 in response to lysosome inhibitors. Interestingly, lactacystin inhibition of proteosomal degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a marked increase in phosphorylated Cx43 at the expense of non-phosphorylated Cx43, and this change corresponded with an increase in “oversized” gap junction plaques. In BICR-M1Rk cells, lactacystin treatment partially prevented the BFA-induced loss of gap junctions. Together, our data suggests that lysosomes play a key role in not only degrading internalized gap junction in BICR-M1Rk cells but also in degrading Cx43 delivered from early secretory compartments to lysosomes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall proteasomal degradation regulates the stability of phosphorylated Cx43 and appears to promote the internalization of Cx43 from the cell surface.

Overall proteasomal degradation regulates the stability of phosphorylated Cx43 and appears to promote the internalization of Cx43 from the cell surface. Gap junctions are the intercellular channels localized to the plasma membrane of cell-cell contact between adjacent cells. The existence of these channels allows an intercellular exchange of low molecular weight molecules including most second messengers like cAMP, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2Nicholson B.J. Weber P.A. Cao F. Chang H. Lampe P. Goldberg G. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The building block of gap junctions is a transmembrane protein called a connexin. Six connexin molecules oligomerize into a hemichannel termed a connexon. After being transported to the plasma membrane, two hemichannels supplied by adjacent cells dock with each other to form a complete gap junction channel. The connexin family consists of at least 20 members (3Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), but Cx43 has attracted the most attention as it is widely expressed in many tissues and Cx43 gap junctions correlate with various physiological functions such as cardiac excitability (4Gehrmann J. Berul C.I. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2000; 11: 354-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, Cx43 has been shown to co-translationally insert into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; BFA, brefeldin A; CHX, cycloheximide; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; BFA, brefeldin A; CHX, cycloheximide; GFP, green fluorescent protein. membranes followed by oligomerization during its transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (5Gaietta G.

Further maturation of newly synthesized Cx43 includes phosphorylation, a process that is closely related to gap junction assembly and turnover (8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). As analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Cx43 is normally reported as being represented by a faster migrating, non-phosphorylated species (Cx43-P0) and two more slower migrating, phosphorylated species (Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2) that are both sensitive to phosphoserine-specific phosphatases (8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 9Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Due to the lack of insight into the phosphorylation events that lead to these two Cx43 species, in the present study we refer to these species collectively as Cx43-P. The COOH-terminal portion of Cx43 contains 21 serines, and at least 5 protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate Cx43, suggesting that this region of molecule contains a complex array of potential regulatory sites (10Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cx43 is a short-lived protein with a half-life of only 1–3 h in cultured cells and intact rat heart (9Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 11Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Therefore, an efficient degradation mechanism is indispensable and is necessary to ensure the dynamic turnover of Cx43. In general, lysosomes are involved in the degradation of integral membrane proteins and receptor-mediated internalized proteins (12Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The proteasome, in addition to taking part in degrading most cytosolic and nuclear proteins (13Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 14Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Ulrich H.D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 268: 137-174PubMed Google Scholar), plays a role in endoplasmic reticulum localized degradation of misfolded proteins. Interestingly, both lysosomes and proteasomes have been reported to be involved in the degradation of Cx43 (16Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Lysosomal degradation of Cx43 was evidenced by the finding that Cx43 annular profiles were associated with lysosome-like structure in C6 glioma cells (19Naus C.C. Hearn S. Zhu D. Nicholson B.J. Shivers R.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, Laing and Beyer (16Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) showed that by treating E36 Chinese hamster ovary cells with proteasomal inhibitors and by using cells with defective ubiquitination, Cx43 accumulated accompanied by a prolonged half-life, providing the first evidence of the involvement of proteasome in Cx43 degradation (16Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Later pulse-chase experiments revealed that inhibitors of both proteasomes and lysosomes caused a prolonged half-life of Cx43 to a similar extent in rat cardiac myocytes indicating the co-existence of these two proteolytic pathways for Cx43 degradation (17Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). More recently, Musil et al. (2000) observed that inhibiting proteasome degradation of Cx43 increased gap junction assembly and intercellular dye coupling and subsequently suggested a mechanism where gap junctional intercellular communication could be regulated at the level of connexin turnover (18Musil L.S. Le A.C. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Subcellular isolation of Cx43 and Cx32 suggested that a small population of ER-retained connexins was presumably made available to proteasomes by being translocated into the cytosol in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors (20VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, little data exist to show that either soluble or insoluble connexins become ubiquitinated. Although good evidence exists that suggest that both lysosomes and proteasomes are involved in Cx43 degradation, it is difficult to reconcile why both pathways are available and needed for Cx43 degradation. It is also not clear whether both pathways degrade Cx43 derived from cell surface gap junction plaques as well as possible immature Cx43 localized to the ER or other compartments involved in the secretory pathway. Moreover, it is possible that these degradation pathways are differentially active in cells that are gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC)-competent as opposed to cells that reflect gap junction assembly defects and are GJIC-deficient. In addition, the direct evidence that Cx43 is a substrate for proteasomal degradation is limited. Our present data revealed that intracellularly accumulated Cx43 in GJIC-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells and internalized endogenous Cx43 in BICR-M1Rk cells were both targeted to lysosomes for degradation suggesting that lysosomes play a major role. Interestingly, a transport pathway is available to direct Cx43 from early secretory compartments to lysosomes for degradation. Active proteasomal degradation was found to reduce the phosphorylated species of Cx43 and destabilize gap junctions at the plasma membrane. Cell Preparation—MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells (ATCC) or BICR-M1Rk cells, a rat mammary tumor cell line (7Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), were grown in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Since MDA-MB-231 wild-type cells have heterogeneous low expression of endogenous Cx43 we chose to overexpress exogenous Cx43. To generate Cx43 or GFP-tagged Cx43 (Cx43-GFP)-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, cDNAs were cloned into replication-defective AP2 retroviral cDNA vector as reported previously (21Galipeau J.L.H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mao A.J. Bechberger J. Lidington D. Galipeau J. Laird D.W. Naus C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29132-29138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The re-engineered AP2 viral cDNAs were then delivered into 293GPG packaging cells by transfection to produce infectious viral particle-containing supernatant that was subsequently used to infect MDA-MB-231 cells. The resulting cells were termed MDA-MB-231vCx43. Inhibition of Lysosomal or Proteasomal Protein Degradation—The inhibitors of proteasomes (lactacystin) and lysosomes (chloroquine, leupeptin, and ammonia chloride) were all purchased from Sigma. Cells were treated with the inhibitors at final concentration as follows: 10 μm of lactacystin, 200 μm of chloroquine, 100 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 10 mm of NH4Cl. To block ER-Golgi transportation or protein synthesis 5 μg/ml of brefeldin A (BFA) or 20 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) was employed (7Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Musil L.S. Le A.C. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For these experiments, equal amount of cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes with or without glass coverslips to 70–80% confluence. Cells treated with the various reagents for6hat37 °C were then either fixed for immunofluorescent staining or lysed to collect proteins for Western blots. Immunocytochemistry, Quantification of Cx43 Gap Junctions, and Live Confocal Microscopy—Control or proteasome/lysosome inhibitor-treated Cx43-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231vCx43) or BICR-M1Rk cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 80% methanol, 20% acetone at 4 °C for 20 min and immunolabeled as described previously (7Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cx43 protein was detected using a 500-fold dilution of Cx43 polyclonal antibody (Sigma). In double labeling experiments, the MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells labeled with a polyclonal Cx43 antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate were double labeled with a 100-fold dilution of human LAMP-1 monoclonal antibody (24Qin H. Shao Q. Belliveau D.J. Laird D.W. Cell Commun. Adhesion. 2001; 8: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) followed by goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red. The images were captured on a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal microscope as described previously (7Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Gap junction plaques in MDA-MB-231vCx43 and BICR-M1Rk cells were quantified based on the confocal images acquired using 63× oil lens. The images were digitally enhanced to clearly show the cell-cell appositions so that only the punctate gap junction plaques on the cell-cell contacts that were a minimal size of 5 μm were counted. This method thus eliminated the Cx43-positive structures that may represent internalized gap junctions or transport intermediates. In untreated and drug-treated MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells, we counted the total number of gap junction plaques on 20 cell-cell interfaces that represented four to six randomly chosen confocal images. The semiquantification data was then statistically analyzed using the Student's t test and represent the average value of three independent experiments ± S.E. In lactacystin-treated MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells, we found some Cx43-positive gap junction plaques that had a continuous length in the x and y dimensions of 1 μm or greater. These plaques were termed oversized as endogenous plaques of this size were rarely seen in cultured mammalian cells. In untreated and drug-treated BICR-M1Rk cells, we randomly chose a confocal image representing 10 contacting cells and counted the total number of punctate gap junction plaques along all the interfaces of these ten cells. The semiquantification data was statistically analyzed using the Student's t test and represent the average value of at least three individual images ± S.E. For live imaging, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing Cx43-GFP were cultured on dishes containing glass coverslip bottoms. LysoTracker Red (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) was dissolved in complete RPMI 1640 medium to a final concentration of 50 nm and prewarmed at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then incubated with LysoTracker Red containing medium for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing cells with medium to remove excess LysoTracker red, cells were switched to optimal medium for live imaging. LysoTracker Red and Cx43-GFP images were acquired simultaneously using both 488 nm/568 nm laser lines on a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal microscope. Electron Microscopic Studies—BICR-M1Rk cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 50 mm lysine at pH 7.4. Cells within blocks of agarose were washed several times with phosphate buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of methanol up to 90%, and then embedded in Lowicryl K4M as described previously (25Oko R. Hermo L. Chan P.T. Fazel A. Bergeron J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were cut and mounted on 200-mesh Formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were blocked for 15 min with 10% goat serum in Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with Cx43 polyclonal antibody of a dilution of 1:20 in Tris-buffered saline. After washing, the sections were subsequently incubated for another 1 h with colloidal gold (10 nm) conjugated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate for 2 min followed by lead citrate for 30 s. Electron micrographs were taken on a Philips 400 electron microscope. Western Blot Analysis—MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231vCx43, or BICR-M1Rk cells, either untreated or inhibitor-treated, were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping. Cells were pelleted by centrifuge, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 200 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors, and ruptured by sonication. Protein concentration was measured using BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). 10–20 μg of protein were loaded and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Cx43 NH2-terminal antibody at a dilution of 1/500 for MDA-MB-231vCx43/BICR-M1Rk cells and 1/62.5 for MDA-MB-231 wild-type cells (Cx43NT1, Hybridoma Development, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre, Seattle, WA) or anti-Cx43 COOH-terminal antibody at a dilution of 1/40,000 (Sigma, Oakville, Onatario, Canada). The signals were detected by ECL system (Pierce). After being stripped as described previously (23Qin H. Shao Q. Curtis H. Galipeau J. Belliveau D.J. Wang T. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29132-29138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the membranes were re-probed with vimentin-specific monoclonal antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) to ensure equal loading. The relative intensity of signals was quantified using SigmaScan Pro software (Sigma). The quantification data was statistically analyzed using Student's t test and represent the average value of three independent Western blots ± S.E. Endocytosed Cx43 in GJIC-competent BICR-M1R k and Intracellular Accumulated Cx43 in GJIC-deficient MDA-MB-231 Cells Were Both Targeted to Lysosomes—We chose two breast tumor cell models to study the destinations and degradation of the gap junction protein, Cx43. BICR-M1Rk cells, a transformed rat breast tumor cell line, were characterized to have abundant endogenous Cx43 that assembled into punctate gap junction plaques at cell-cell appositions (Fig. 1A, arrows). As expected these cells displayed efficient intercellular transfer of Lucifer yellow, indicating that Cx43 functional gap junction channels were formed among the contacting cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Unlike BICR-M1Rk cells, MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells had lower levels of Cx43 (23Qin H. Shao Q. Curtis H. Galipeau J. Belliveau D.J. Wang T. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29132-29138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and displayed poor dye coupling even though the cells were engineered to overexpress exogenous Cx43 (Fig. 1, E and F). Immunolabelling MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells for Cx43 revealed an intracellular accumulation of Cx43, while gap junction plaques were rarely observed at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 1D). To further identify the intracellular location of connexin protein, MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells were double stained for lysosome-associated membrane protein, LAMP-1 and Cx43. Confocal image analysis revealed that Cx43 (Fig. 2A, arrows) were precisely localized to lysosomes (Fig. 2B, arrows) and therefore displayed a yellow color in overlapping images (Fig. 2C, arrows). Confirmation of the lysosomal localization of Cx43 was provided when simultaneous live images also revealed the co-localization of Cx43-GFP (Fig. 2, D and F) with LysoTracker Red-labeled lysosomes (Fig. 2, E and F). Together these data indicate that the majority of Cx43 was transported to lysosomes within MDA-MB-231 cells highlighting an important role of lysosomes in Cx43 degradation in this cell type.Fig. 2Cx43 and Cx43-GFP were targeted to lysosomes in MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells. Cells were double labeled for Cx43 (A) and the lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) (B), and the overlapping image revealed that a large population of Cx43 was precisely co-localized with lysosomes (C, arrows, yellow). Live imaging of Cx43-GFP-expressing cells labeled with LysoTracker Red revealed that GFP-tagged Cx43 (D) was delivered into lysosomes (E) displaying an intensive yellow color when the images were overlapped (F, arrows). Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unlike MDA-MB-231 cells, Cx43 did not accumulate within lysosomes of BICR-M1Rk cells (see Fig. 1A), suggesting that lysosomes may either not actively participate in Cx43 degradation or Cx43 is rapidly degraded once it reaches the lysosomes. To ascertain if Cx43 enters lysosomes, BICR-M1Rk cells were examined by immunogold electron microscopy for evidence of Cx43 within lysosomes. Typical gap junction profiles (Fig. 3A, arrows) that were positively stained for Cx43 (Fig. 3A, small arrowheads) were observed at the cell surface. Collapsed immunogold-labeled, double-membrane Cx43 junction plaques (Fig. 3B, arrowheads) were seen within a membrane-bound and electron-dense organelle that was reminiscent of a lysosome. In still other electron dense organelles that resemble lysosomes, immunolabeled membrane debris was evident suggesting that this represented a gap junction that was in the final stages of degradation (Fig. 3C). Collectively, the electron morphological data suggested that internalized gap junctions in the form of annular junctions (26Jordan K. Chodock R. Hand A.R. Laird D.W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 763-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were targeted to the endosome/lysosome pathway for degradation. It could be possible that lack of Cx43 immunostaining at the cell surface in MDA-MB-231 cells was due to the formation of unstable gap junctions that were quickly internalized into the cells. Alternatively, newly synthesized Cx43 could be delivered to lysosomes without first going to the plasma membrane. To evaluate these possibilities we employed BFA to block Cx43 transport through the Golgi apparatus and compared the subsequent change in the steady-state levels of Cx43 between the two cell conditions. When communication-deficient MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells (Fig. 4A) were treated with BFA for 6 h (Fig. 4B) intracellular Cx43 remained prominent and was localized to lysosomes (Fig. 4D). Since the lysosomal pool of Cx43 diminished dramatically in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig. 4, C, E, and F), this suggested that lysosomal function was intact in MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells, and Cx43 was continually transported to lysosomes in the presence of BFA. In GJIC-competent BICR-M1Rk cells, the blocking of ER-Golgi transport eliminated the mature phosphorylated species of Cx43 (Fig. 4, E and G), consistent with our previous studies (7Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As seen in GJIC-deficient cells, cycloheximide dramatically reduced the cellular levels of Cx43 in BICR-M1Rk cells consistent with the continued degradation of Cx43 during the inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 4, E and G). Together, our data suggest that there exists a by-pass pathway where newly synthesized Cx43 can be targeted to lysosomes in GJIC-deficient MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells allowing for the lysosomal pool of Cx43 to be sustained in the presence of BFA. Inhibition of Lysosomal Degradation Resulted in the Accumulation of Total Cellular Cx43, whereas Blocking Proteasomal Degradation Preferentially Accumulated Phosphorylated Cx43—Although our data revealed that Cx43 was targeted to lysosomes in both cell lines, degradation of connexins has been reported to involve both lysosomes and proteasomes (17Laing J.G. Tadros P.N. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To better understand the specific roles of both proteolytic pathways in the life cycle of Cx43, we employed a series of inhibitors for both lysosomes and proteasomes. As expected, non-phosphorylated Cx43 (Cx43-P0) was detected in untreated MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells, whereas the phosphorylated Cx43 species (Cx43-P) were much less apparent (Fig. 5B), consistent with the finding that little Cx43 was localized to gap junction plaques. Similarly, Cx43-P0 was more abundant than Cx43-P in the cells treated with lysosomal inhibitors (chloroquine, leupeptin, or ammonia chloride); however, inhibition of lysosomes caused a significant increase in total cellular Cx43 by 69–75% (Fig. 5, B and C) confirming the critical role of lysosomes in Cx43 degradation in MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells. Surprisingly, inhibiting proteasomal function by lactacystin increased Cx43-P at the expense of Cx43-P0 and consequently kept the total cellular Cx43 unchanged (Fig. 5, B and C). Likewise, in cells where both proteolytic pathways were simultaneously blocked, inhibition of proteasomes did not amplify the lysosomal inhibitor-induced accumulation of total cellular Cx43, but only enriched Cx43-P at the expense of Cx43-P0 (Fig. 5, B and C). Consequently, inactivating proteosomal degradation significantly increased the ratio of Cx43-P to Cx43-P0 by 1.3–2-fold, whereas no difference in this ratio was observed when lysosomal activity was inhibited (Fig. 5D). Lactacystin-dependent accumulation of Cx43-P was also observed in wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells that express limited amounts of endogenous Cx43 (Fig. 5A), which eliminated the possibility that overexpressed Cx43 may be selectively targeted to an alternate degradation pathway not indicative of native Cx43. Together, our findings strongly suggest that lysosomes are a major site for Cx43 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells, while proteasomes may play a more indirect role in reducing Cx43-P possibly by degrading unknown proteins that allow Cx43-P to stabilize. Proteasomal, but Not Lysosomal Inhibition, Correlated with Increased Gap Junction Plaques in MDA-MB-231 Cells—Since phosphorylation is generally associated with the assembly of Cx43 into gap junctions (8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), we next examined whether lactacystin-induced accumulation of Cx43-P would correlate with an increase in the number of gap junction plaques. Unlike control cells where gap junctions were rarely detected (Fig. 6A), the incidence of gap junction plaques in cells treated with lactacystin increased by 120% (Fig. 6I). A striking feature of the plaques found in lactacystin-treated cells was their enlarged size (Fig. 6, B and B-1, double arrows) in comparison with the more “normal” appearing punctate gap junction plaques (Fig. 6, B and B-2, arrows). These oversized plaques represented 47% of the total Cx43 gap junction plaques found in lactacystin-treated MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells (Fig. 6J). In cells treated with lysosomal inhibitors, although Cx43 plaques could occasionally be seen (Fig. 6, C, E, and G, arrows), punctate and oversized gap junction plaques were not significantly different from those in control cells (Fig 6, I and J). However, the incidence of gap junction plaques did increase by 61–88% when lysosomal and proteasomal degradation were simultaneously inhibited (Fig. 6, D, F, and H, double arrows, and I), suggesting that it was proteasomal, but not lysosomal, inhibition that was responsible for the increase in number of gap junction plaques in MDA-MB-231vCx43 cells. Moreover, 42–57% of the Cx43"

Fibril-forming or fibrillar collagens are one of the most ancient families of extracellular matrix molecules being found throughout the metazoan kingdom from the simplest (porifera (sponges)) to the most complex animals (vertebrates). Fibrillar collagens form major structural elements in extracellular matrices as diverse as the evolutionarily “primitive” mesoglea of cnidarians (1Deutzmann R. Fowler S. Zhang X. Boone K. Dexter S. Boot-Handford R.P. Rachel R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 4669-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the highly specialized connective tissues of vertebrates (e.g. bone, cartilage, skin, and tendon) (2Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 159-221Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular features shared by all members of this family include a highly conserved C-terminal noncollagenous (NC1) domain and a long collagenous domain of ∼1000 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the previously known vertebrate fibrillar collagens fall into two related but distinct groups or clades (3Sicot F-X. Exposito J-Y. Masselot M. Garrone R. Deutsch J. Gaill F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Bailey W.J. Kim J. Wagner G.P. Ruddle F.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The type A clade consists of the proα1(I), proα2(I), proα1(II), proα1(III), and proα2(V), whereas the type B clade contains the remaining chains encoding types V and XI collagens (with the exception of proα3(XI), which is derived from the COL2A1 gene). The division of the vertebrate fibrillar collagens into two clades is supported by two further observations. Firstly, the exon structures of the genes are virtually identical within a clade yet distinct between clades (5Chu M.L. Prockop D.J. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 223-248Crossref Google Scholar). Secondly, the members of each clade share homologous N-terminal noncollagenous domains (von Willebrand factor type C domain for type A and TSPN 1The abbreviations used are: TSPN, thrombospondin N-terminal-like domain. for type B clade members) with the exception of the proα2(I) chain, where the N-terminal noncollagenous domain appears to have been deleted (6Ayad S. Boot-Handford R.P. Humphries M.J. Kadler K.E. Shuttleworth C.A. The Extracellular Matrix Facts Book. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Harcourt Brace & Co., London1998: 43-98Google Scholar). We have recently described how the members of the two clades of vertebrate fibrillar collagens have apparently arisen early during vertebrate evolution from a single founder gene through the mechanism of “molecular incest” (7Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Molecular incest is catalyzed by gene/genome duplications, events that not only characterize but are thought by many to have promoted vertebrate evolution (8Holland P.W.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As a result, the proα chains encoding the known vertebrate fibrillar collagens (type I, II, III, V, and XI) are very closely related and interdependent in that gene products from the different clades can trimerize in complex patterns, and the resulting collagen molecules can copolymerize in mixed fibrils. For instance, the proα1(II) chain forms a homotrimer (type II collagen) but can also heterotrimerize with the proα1(XI) and proα2 (XI) chains in some forms of type XI collagen (2Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 159-221Crossref Google Scholar). Some chains of type V and type XI can heterotrimerize to form a hybrid V/XI collagen (9Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). During fibril assembly, types III and V collagens can co-polymerize with type I collagen, and likewise, type XI co-polymerizes with type II collagen (2Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 159-221Crossref Google Scholar). The process of vertebrate collagen evolution by molecular incest following genome duplication is perhaps most apparent in modern day fish (teleosts). Fish appear to have undergone a further round of genome duplication after their divergence, ∼450 million years ago, from the lineage leading to mammals (11Taylor J.S. de Peer Y.V. Braasch I. Meyer A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 1661-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a number of the “classical” vertebrate fibrillar collagen genes found in man and mouse are present in the puffer fish (Fugu rubripes) genome as duplicates that are conserved yet, at the same time, slowly diverging in sequence (7Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was while identifying fibrillar collagen genes in the puffer fish genome that we discovered a novel fibrillar collagen gene that was not only duplicated within the fish genome but also highly conserved in man and mouse. The new fibrillar collagen, proα1(XXVII), has unusual molecular characteristics and a unique expression pattern compared with the classical vertebrate fibrillar collagens. The COL27A1 gene has evolved as an early offshoot of the lineage leading to the type B clade and, together with a second closely related gene, COL24A1, represents a new and third clade (type C) in the vertebrate family of fibrillar collagens. Sequence Determination—Sequences from the collagen XXVII gene were originally identified by blast searches of the F. rubripes genome data base looking for amino acid sequence homologies with C-terminal noncollagenous domains of human fibrillar collagens. The Fugu sequences identified in this fashion were compared directly with the human to identify the collagen chain and type. In this way, F. rubripes sequences matching a previously uncharacterized fibrillar collagen conserved in both human and mouse genomes were identified and assembled by standard bioinformatics approaches including the use of available expressed sequence tags. The majority of the genomic sequences were identified directly in the human genome through expressed sequence tag clone analysis. In F. rubripes, direct translation of genomic sequence was used to identify the majority of the exons. The alignments were performed using the Clustal W (1.8) engine. Northern and in Situ Analyses—IMAGE clones 1712826 (human) and 5289947 (mouse) were utilized for the Northern and in situ analyses. Northern blots of poly(A) RNA were obtained from BD Biosciences. cDNA inserts were 32P-labeled to a specific activity in excess of 4 × 108 cpm/μg DNA using an oligonucleotide labeling kit (Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads; Amersham Biosciences). The Northern blots were hybridized and washed using the Church system (12Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar), and the images were obtained either by PhosphorImager analyses or exposure to x-ray film. In situ hybridization was conducted using 35S-labeled riboprobes (13Poulsom R. Longcroft J.M. Jeffery R.E. Rogers L.A. Steel J.H. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera and Western Blotting—An antiserum was produced in rabbit to two synthetic peptides derived from the mouse variable region domain (TSPTKRSPTKPSVS and SKKFTNPTVAKSKSK) coupled by way of a C-terminal cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentec S.A). Tissue extracts were prepared by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. 24-h conditioned medium (serum-free) from ATDC 5 cells grown under differentiation conditions for 5 days (14Shukunami. C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) was dialyzed into 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions. For collagenase digestion, lyophilized samples were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and digested (37 °C, 60 min) with highly purified bacterial collagenase (CLSPA, Worthington Biochemical Corp.) at a final concentration of 0.5 unit/μl in a 16-μl reaction volume. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (5× concentration). The samples were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), incubated with primary antisera at a 1:100 dilution, and, after washing three times in TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) at a 1:3000 dilution. Finally, the bands were detected using chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Phylogenetic Analyses—Phylogenetic analyses were performed essentially as described (15Tuckwell D. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the following sequences: α1(I) human, CA11_HUMAN; α2(I) human, AC002528_1; α1(II) human, HUMCOL2A1Z_1; α1(III) human, CA13_HUMAN; α1(V) chick, A40695; α1(V) human, CGHU1V/CA15_HUMAN; α2(V) human, CA25_HUMAN; α3(V) mouse, Q9JLJ2; α4(V) rat, Q9JI04; α1(IX) chick, B34493; α1(IX) human, P20849/CA1B_HUMAN; α1(IX) mouse, Q05722; α1(XI) human, AAF04725.1; α2(XI) human, P13942/CA2B_HUMAN; α2(XI) mouse, Q64739; α1(XII) chick, P13944; α1(XII) human, Q99715; α1(XII) mouse, Q60847; α1(XIV) chick, S31211; α1(XIV) human, CAA72402.1; α1(XV) human, A53317; α1(XVI) human, S23810; α1(XIX) human, BAA07368.1; α1(XVIII) human, AAC39659.1; α1(XVIII) mouse, A56101; α1(XIX) mouse, BAA23578.1; α1(XX) chick, (16Koch M.

Multiple alignments were generated using ClustalX (17Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar) and manually adjusted using Align (D. Hepperle, Neuglobsow, Germany). The alignments were edited to remove regions that could not be accurately aligned before being used in the phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using PHYLIP (18Felsenstein J. Phylogenetic Inference Package (PHYLIP), version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar). For distance analyses, pairwise distances were calculated using PROTDIST with a Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix (19Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). The trees were inferred using FITCH with 10 jumbles of input order and global rearrangements. 100 bootstrap replicates were generated using SEQBOOT, distances were calculated using PROTDIST, trees were inferred using NEIGHBOUR, and bootstrap values were calculated using CONSENSE. Most parsimonious trees were identified using PROTPARS with input order jumbled 10 times. 100 bootstrap replicates were generated using SEQBOOT and analyzed by PROTPARS, and bootstrap values were calculated using CONSENSE. Sequence Analyses and Comparisons—The aligned sequences of the human and mouse proα1(XXVII) and the duplicated F. rubripes (proα1 and proα2(XXVII)) chains are presented in Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A. The sequences for human and mouse were derived from a combination of expressed sequence tag analyses and direct identification of conserved amino acid sequences in translated genomic sequences and are identical to those recently posted on sequence databases (accession numbers AY149237 and AY167568) and designated proα1(XXVII). The signal peptide sequences for human and mouse, which are presented for completeness, are from AY149237 and AY167568. The signal peptides for the Fugu genes are not included because they are not conserved and could not therefore be identified with any degree of certainty from the genomic sequences.Fig. 1Complete amino acid sequence and domain structure of type XXVII collagen; comparisons across species (A) and with NC1 domains from different fibrillar collagens (B).

The N terminus of type XXVII collagen proα chains has a similar domain structure to that exhibited by the type B clade vertebrate fibrillar collagens including a TSPN domain of ∼150 residues and a variable domain ranging in size from 403 residues in man to 226 residues in the Fugu proα1(XXVII) chain (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A and Table I). The TSPN is highly conserved between man, mouse, and fish (Table I). Although the variable domain is relatively well conserved between man and mouse (51% identity), no conservation is apparent when comparing the Fugu sequences either with each other or with those derived from the mammalian species (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). However, the chemical nature of the variable domain is conserved in that the mammalian and both fish sequences have high pI values (9.46–11.74), and this is in marked contrast to the low pI exhibited by the equivalent domain of the related but distinct proα1(XXIV) chain (Table I). In collagen XXVII, the variable domain fuses directly with the major triple helical domain (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A), and these proα chains therefore lack the telopeptide and minor triple helical domains found in all previously characterized vertebrate fibrillar collagen chains. In addition, the highly conserved collagen XXVII triple helical domain (994–997 residues; Table I) is both shorter than the equivalent domain in the previously described vertebrate fibrillar collagens (1014–1020 residues) and contains two conserved interruptions in the Gly-X-Y repeat (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). The Fugu proα1 chain contains a further two (nonconserved) interruptions in the collagenous domain (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). The NC1 domain or C-propeptide is joined to the collagenous domain by a short relatively variant sequence of 15–33 residues, depending on the species. The remaining ∼200 residues of the NC1 domain are highly conserved (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A and Table I) with in excess of 50% identity between man, mouse, and Fugu chains. The NC1 domain of proα1(XXVII) is also highly conserved compared with the C-propeptide sequences of fibrillar collagens from across the animal kingdom and contains all 8 of the characteristic cysteine residues (Fig. 1B). It is particularly noteworthy, however, that unlike the proα chains of classical vertebrate fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI), proα1(XXVII) contains a short chain selection sequence, a feature previously only found in fibrillar collagens of invertebrates (Fig. 1B and Ref. 7Boot-Handford R.P.

The mRNA encoding type XXVII collagen is ∼9 kb. The mRNA for collagen XXVII is relatively highly expressed in fetal liver and pancreas with lower levels being found in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Type III collagen mRNA gives an entirely different profile (Fig. 2). To examine the expression of proα1(XXVII) mRNA in more detail, a series of in situ analyses was performed. In fetal human tissues, collagen XXVII expression is particularly strong in chondrocytes in the cartilaginous anlagen of the developing skeleton and in tracheal cartilage (Fig. 3, A–F). The gene is also expressed in the epidermal region of fetal skin (Fig. 3, G–I), by the developing mucosal layer in fetal stomach (Fig. 3, J–L), by bronchial epithelium in developing lung (Fig. 3, M–O), and in epidermal-derived cells in hair follicles but not by the dermal papilla at the base of the follicle (Fig. 3, P–R). In fetal mouse tissues, the pattern of expression of collagen XXVII is similar to that seen in human with strong expression in cartilaginous anlagen of skeletal elements and epithelial cell layers in developing lung and stomach (Fig. 4, D–H). Collagen XXVII expression is evident in cochlear epithelium as well as the cartilaginous structures associated with inner ear development (Fig. 4, A–C). Saggital sections through the head (Fig. 4, J and K) reveal strong expression in both nasal cartilage and ameloblasts, the epithelial cells responsible for synthesizing tooth enamel.Fig. 4Expression of type XXVII collagen in fetal mouse tissues.

Western blots of SDS extracts of newborn mouse skin and tail revealed a fairly complex pattern of polypeptides with major bands at 240, 150, and 110 kDa (Fig. 5). This pattern presumably arises from a combination of covalent cross-linking and degradation. Cells in culture frequently secrete procollagens and partially processed collagens into the medium presenting a simpler pattern to interpret than that found in tissues. We therefore Western blotted the conditioned medium from a chondrogenic cell line (ATDC 5 cells). The antisera specifically recognized a doublet at ∼150 kDa and a third band at 140 kDa (Fig. 5). These bands are collagenous, as demonstrated by their susceptibility to highly purified bacterial collagenase digestion (Fig. 5, lane M+C). Unfortunately, this antiserum was not of use for immunohistochemical analyses. Phylogenetic Analyses—Distance and parsimony analyses of the NC1 (C-propeptide) domains of collagens proα1(XXVII), proα1(XXIV), and other fibrillar collagens showed that proα1(XXVII) and proα1(XXIV) form a separate and distinct clade (Type C) of fibrillar collagens, supported by very high bootstrap values (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). Significantly, proα1(XXVII) and proα1(XXIV) can be distinguished from the two previously described clades within the family of vertebrate fibrillar collagens (Types A and B; Fig. 6, A and B). Invertebrate NC1 sequences were included in these analyses to root the trees. Both distance and parsimony analyses indicated that the collagen XXVII and XXIV NC1 sequences are more closely related to vertebrate fibrillar collagens of the type B rather than type A clade. Distance and parsimony analyses of the N-terminal TSPN domains of proα1(XXVII), proα1(XXIV), and other collagens again showed that proα1(XXVII) and proα1(XXIV) form a distinct clade (Type C; Fig. 6, C and D, respectively) strongly supported by bootstrap values and clearly separate from both the fibrillar type B clade and the FACIT collagen clade. The trees were rooted using collagen XV/XVIII and its Caenorhabditis elegans homologue CLE-1B, because this is the only known TSPN domain collagen with an invertebrate homologue. The distance analysis (Fig. 6C) suggests that the TSPN domains of the FACIT and type B clade fibrillar collagens are more closely related to each other than to the TSPN domains of collagens XXVII and XXIV. However, the parsimony analyses (Fig. 6D) suggest that the TSPN domains of the FACIT and type B and C clade fibrillar collagens are more equally related to each other. Structure of the XXVII Gene—The human COL27A1 gene is ∼156 kb in length and located on chromosome 9q32. The mouse gene is ∼118 kb and is located on chromosome 4c1. The F. rubripes genes are considerably shorter (α1 gene, 37 kb, located on scaffold 2117, partial gene sequence reported under accession number SINFRUG00000036908; α2 gene, 41 kb, located on scaffold 1015, partial gene sequence reported under accession number SINFRUG00000034716). The exon organization of the genes in man, mouse, and fish is virtually identical. The first two exons in man and mouse code for the signal peptide. The third exon encodes the remainder of the N-terminal noncollagenous sequence (TSPN and variable domains plus the first 4 Gly-X-Y repeats of the collagenous domain in man, mouse, and Fugu α2 and 5 Gly-X-Y repeats in Fugu α1). Because of the lack of sequence conservation in the variable domains, the size of the very large exon 3 differs considerably between species (human, 1775 bp; mouse, 1736 bp; Fugu α1, 1245 bp; Fugu α2, 1497 bp). The size of exons encoding the collagenous domain in the type XXVII gene follows a similar but distinct pattern (based on 54- and 45-bp motifs) to that exhibited by the genes encoding the type A and B clades of vertebrate fibrillar collagens (Fig. 7). Exons 4–36 of the collagen XXVII gene coding for the N-terminal region of the collagenous domain appear to have undergone no “exon fusion” events, whereas several such events appear to have occurred independently in each of the progenitor genes for the type A and B clades. In contrast, the more C-terminal parts of the collagenous domains in all three clades (equivalent to exons 38–56 in the type XXVII gene) appear to have been subjected to numerous separate exon rearrangement events (Fig. 7). Comparisons of exon size/pattern across all three clades of vertebrate fibrillar collagen suggests that in the type XXVII genes, one of the most 5-prime 54 bp exons has been deleted in comparison with the genes of other clades (Fig. 7), accounting for the shorter collagenous domain. The conserved interruptions in the collagenous domains of collagen XXVII genes are due to base substitutions in exon 6 (54 bp) and a 3-bp insertion within exon 42 (57 bp; Fig. 7). The NC1 domain is encoded by exons 56 (18 bp of Gly-X-Y and 9 bp of noncollagenous sequence) and exons 57–61 (66, 169, 110, 219, and 147 bp including the stop codon, respectively). Fibrillar collagens are among the most abundant proteins in the vertebrate body. Until very recently, there was thought to be only five types of vertebrate fibrillar collagens (I, II, III, V, and XI) encoded by nine distinct genes. We report here the initial characterization of a new member of the vertebrate fibrillar collagen family, collagen XXVII, that is highly conserved in man, mouse, and puffer fish. When examining the amino acid alignments presented in Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A, it is must be remembered that the puffer fish proα1 and proα2(XXVII) sequences have been evolving in the same organism but as separate genes, because of a teleost-specific gene duplication occurring soon after the fish lineage diverged from that leading to mammals 450 million years ago (11Taylor J.S. de Peer Y.V. Braasch I. Meyer A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 1661-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21Kumar S. Hedges S.B. Nature. 1998; 392: 917-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). In contrast, the human and mouse sequences have been evolving in separate organisms for the relatively short period of 40 million years (21Kumar S. Hedges S.B. Nature. 1998; 392: 917-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly therefore, the human and mouse amino acid sequences are very similar. However, when comparing the two Fugu sequences with each other and with the mammalian sequences, it is intriguing to note the different types of evolutionary constraint exerted on the separate domains of the type XXVII collagen proα chains. The sequence of the TSPN domain is clearly conserved and presumably plays an important role in the biology of the tissues in which the type XXVII gene is expressed. In stark contrast, neither the length nor the precise sequence of the adjacent variable domain seems crucial in that there is no sequence conservation either between the two Fugu sequences or between Fugu and mammalian sequences (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, the chemical characteristics of this domain of the collagen XXVII gene are conserved in terms of the high pI exhibited across species (Table I). It is interesting to note that sequence variation produced within the variable domain of some proα chains of type B clade collagens by alternative splicing (see Ref. 22Chen Y. Sumiyoshi H. Oxford J.T. Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. Morris N.P. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and refs therein) cannot occur in type XXVII collagen because the entire TSPN and variable domain are encoded by a single large exon. The level of sequence conservation for the triple helical domains (including the interruptions shared by the fish and mammalian genes) and for the NC1 domains is high, suggesting that there is little tolerance for sequence variation in these regions of the type XXVII molecule. It is only in the context of one of the duplicated genes in Fugu (proα1(XXVII)]) that any significant sequence deviation in the helical domain has been tolerated in the form of two additional minor interruptions in the collagenous domain (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). The collagen XXVII gene therefore appears similar to all of the other vertebrate fibrillar collagen genes in terms of its resistance to sequence change, and one would predict that mutations of conserved residues are likely to be the cause of specific heritable conditions in man. However, there are no obvious candidate diseases based on the chromosomal location of the gene. The phylogenetic analyses together with data relating to exon structure (Figs. 6 and 7, respectively) demonstrate that type XXVII collagen represents (together with type XXIV collagen) a new clade or subgroup (type C clade) within the vertebrate fibrillar collagen family. A model representing the most likely way in which the type C clade evolved, based on separate phylogenetic analyses of the NC1 and NC2 sequences (Fig. 6) combined with recent new insights into the evolution of fibrillar collagens in vertebrates (7Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), is presented in Fig. 8. The type C clade appears to have arisen as a result of a duplication of the common ancestor shared with the type B clade fibrillar collagen genes. Although the model of type XXVII collagen evolution (Fig. 8) fits well with the phylogenetic data, the model does not provide an explanation for why type XXVII collagen differs so markedly in molecular characteristics compared with its close relatives, the classical fibrillar collagens (A and B clade). For example type XXVII collagen has a short chain selection sequence in its NC1 domain in comparison with the A/B clade collagens. The collagen XXVII major triple helical domain contains two interruptions, whereas the A/B clade α chains have uninterrupted helical domains. Furthermore, XXVII triple helical domain is shorter (994–997 amino acid residues depending on species; Table I) compared with the classical vertebrate fibrillar collagens (helical domains in all nine chains of the A/B clade fall in the range of 1011–1020 residues). Lastly, in collagen XXVII, the N-terminal end of the major helix, defined by the 54 bp-repeat exon structure encoding this region (Fig. 7), fuses directly with the NC2 domain and therefore lacks the telopeptide/telopeptide-like sequences and minor triple-helical domains found in all the A/B clade vertebrate fibrillar collagen chains (see Ref. 5Chu M.L. Prockop D.J. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 223-248Crossref Google Scholar for exon structures through these domains). These unusual molecular features of the collagen XXVII polypeptide have previously only been found in invertebrate fibrillar collagens (7Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, in type XXVII, these features appear to have evolved within the vertebrate lineage after the type C clade diverged from the type B clade (Fig. 8). We have recently proposed a mechanism for how vertebrate fibrillar collagens evolved termed molecular incest that accounts for why the A/B clade polypeptides share such similar molecular characteristics in terms of the length of chain selection sequence and the length and nature of triple helical domain. Briefly, these classical vertebrate fibrillar collagen chains share the listed characteristics because various chains from both clades co-trimerize to form specific collagen types and different collagen types then co-polymerize to form mixed fibrils. Functionally, the chains encoded by the A and B clade genes are therefore interdependent and subject to a common constraining evolutionary pressure. The type XXVII collagen gene has not been subjected to the common evolutionary constraint experienced by the A/B clade genes, raising the possibility that collagen XXVII has evolved functions that are not dependent upon direct interactions (i.e. co-trimerization and co-polymerization) with polypeptides/collagens encoded by the type A and B clade genes. The unique expression pattern exhibited by collagen XXVII lends weight to the prediction that type XXVII collagen may perform functions that are independent of the collagen types encoded by the type A and B clade genes (i.e. types I, II, III, V, and XI). Although type XXVII collagen is expressed by chondrocytes in cartilage as is found for collagens II and XI, it is also expressed by a variety of epithelial cell types (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the classical vertebrate fibrillar collagens are not expressed by these epithelial layers, the function of collagen XXVII at these locations cannot be dependent upon the cotrimerization or co-polymerization with collagens chains of the A/B clade. Antisera were raised to synthetic peptides derived from the variable domain that would remain part of the mature α chain if proteolytic processing of the N terminus of type XXVII collagen follows the same pattern as that of the homologous type B clade proα chains (23Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The detection of type XXVII collagen by Western blotting indicates firstly that this gene, the amino acid sequence of which was predicted largely on the basis of genome analysis, does encode an expressed protein. Secondly, the tissue analysis suggests the protein may be part of a macromolecular structure because a range of nonreducible bands of 250–100 kDa were detected. The predicted molecular mass of a post-translationally modified mouse type XXVII α chain (assuming processing as for the type B clade chains) would be ∼140 kDa. Analysis of type XXVII collagen secreted in a soluble form into the conditioned medium of a chondrogenic cell line revealed bands in the 150–140-kDa range (Fig. 4B), consistent with the expected size of the α1(XXVII) chain. Unfortunately, attempts to immunolocalize the protein in tissue sections using the antiserum has proved unsuccessful. The precise extracellular location of the collagen XXVII, particularly when expressed by epithelial cells, remains to be determined, although some association with basement membrane underlying the epithelial cells seems probable. It is noteworthy that the ectodermal cells of hydra synthesize both basement membrane and fibrillar collagens and produce a composite matrix with a basement membrane sheet adjacent to the cell surface supported by a layer of interstitial matrix containing the fibrillar collagen (1Deutzmann R. Fowler S. Zhang X. Boone K. Dexter S. Boot-Handford R.P. Rachel R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2000; 127: 4669-4680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fowler S.J. Jose S. Zhang X. Deutzmann R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39589-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Types XXVII and XXIV collagen are very closely related fibrillar collagen genes, and it is not altogether clear whether these two genes should have been given separate numbers or alternatively, designated as separate α chains of the same type of collagen. On the basis of the highly conserved nature of the triple helical domains including length and position of interruptions and the similarities in the NC1 domains where both have a short chain selection sequence, it would appear entirely possible that the two types of proα chain can heterotrimerize. However, preliminary analyses suggest that the proα1(XXVII) and proα1(XXIV) chains are not co-ordinately expressed and appear to have distinct patterns of expression in tissues. 2M. Gordon and R. P. Boot-Handford, unpublished observations. On balance, therefore, it seems likely that the type XXVII and XXIV collagen genes are named correctly in that they appear most likely to form distinct collagen types. It will be very interesting to determine the function of type XXVII collagen, given its unusual structure and expression pattern, and work on a mouse knockout model is in progress. The MRC Tissue Bank provided access to the fixed human tissues used in this study. Toby Hunt is thanked for expert technical assistance. Marion Gordon, James Pace, and Peter Byers are thanked for sharing data on types XXIV and XXVII collagen prior to publication."

In the current study, we show that selenite-induced apoptosis involves DNA damage. We showed that selenite-induced apoptosis as evidenced by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was reduced in NIH 3T3 cells treated with ATM small interfering RNA, suggesting the involvement of the DNA damage regulator ATM. Consistent with ATM/ATR involvement, selenite was also shown to stimulate Ser-139 phosphorylation of the ATM/ATR substrate H2AX. Selenite-induced apoptosis was shown to involve DNA topoisomerase II (Top II) as selenite-induced apoptosis was reduced in Top II-deficient HL-60/MX2 cells and in HL-60 cells co-treated with the Top II catalytic inhibitor ICRF-193. Using purified human recombinant Top II, selenite was shown to induce reversible Top II cleavage complexes in vitro.

Cancer chemoprevention has received increasing attention in recent years. Many agents, including naturally occurring and synthetic compounds, have been demonstrated to exhibit cancer preventive activity (1Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Malone W.A. Boone C.W. Kopelovich L. Hawk E.T. Lieberman R. Lawrence J.A. Ali I. Viner J.L. Sigman C.C. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 467S-471SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular significance is the realization that many dietary components have cancer chemopreventive activity (1Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Malone W.A. Boone C.W. Kopelovich L. Hawk E.T. Lieberman R. Lawrence J.A. Ali I. Viner J.L. Sigman C.C. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 467S-471SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selenium (Se) (a micronutrient) and isothiocyanates (from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli) are among the most extensively studied (1Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Malone W.A. Boone C.W. Kopelovich L. Hawk E.T. Lieberman R. Lawrence J.A. Ali I. Viner J.L. Sigman C.C. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 467S-471SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P.

A. 1997; 94: 10367-10372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Despite the clear demonstration of their cancer chemopreventive activity, the molecular mechanism(s) of these dietary agents remains elusive. The trace element Se is an essential micronutrient, which, upon conversion to the amino acid selenocysteine, is used for the synthesis of about a dozen selenoproteins including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The cancer chemopreventive activity of Se was originally proposed by Shamberger and Frost (6Shamberger R.J. Frost D.V. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1969; 100: 682PubMed Google Scholar) in 1969 based on their observation that the cancer mortality rates in the United States were inversely correlated with the geographic distribution of Se in forage crops. Subsequent epidemiological studies have confirmed the result (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies in experimental animal models have also indicated that high levels of Se compounds prevent cancer (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, clinical intervention studies using different Se compounds (e.g. Se-enriched yeast or selenite) in the United States and China have established the cancer chemopreventive activity of Se compounds in humans (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) for the cancer chemopreventive activity of Se compounds remains largely unclear. It was thought originally that the chemopreventive activity of Se compounds could be associated with the nutritional requirement, because certain selenoenzymes such as glutathione peroxidase are known to be involved in antioxidant defense (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). However, many studies (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that the cancer chemopreventive activity of Se compounds requires supranutritional concentrations that are much higher than required for the synthesis of selenoenzymes. In addition, triphenylselenonium chloride has excellent chemopreventive activity but does not support repletion of selenoenzymes in animals, indicating that the cancer chemopreventive activity of Se is completely separable from their nutritional requirement (7Ip C. Lisk D.J. Ganther H.E. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 4179-4182PubMed Google Scholar). Another favorable explanation is that Se compounds affect carcinogen activation and metabolism through inhibition of phase I enzymes and induction of phase II enzymes (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism has been well documented to be important for the chemopreventive activity of many thiol-reactive chemopreventive agents (8Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Massiah M.A. Bozak R.E. Hicks R.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 9Talalay P. Fahey J.W. J.

However, Se compounds can also suppress carcinogenesis post-initiation of carcinogen treatment in animal models, suggesting that additional mechanisms for cancer chemoprevention may exist (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The ability of Se compounds to inhibit growth and induce tumor cell apoptosis has been widely demonstrated and suggested to be a potential mechanism for cancer chemoprevention (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The potency and relative efficacy of Se derivatives as chemopreventive agents in vivo has been shown to parallel their effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis (4Harrison P.R. Lanfear J. Wu L. Fleming J. McGarry L. Blower L. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1997; 10: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that Se-induced apoptosis can deplete carcinogen-initiated cells and suppress clonal expansion of a transformed population (2Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Se compounds are well known for their ability to react with thiols (3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Modification of protein thiols is presumably responsible for enzyme inhibition observed in cells treated with Se compounds (3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether modification of protein thiols by Se compounds is the cause of apoptotic cell death.

Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Its cleavage/religation activity is essential for many vital functions of DNA, such as chromosome condensation and segregation, DNA replication, and transcription (12Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 13Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). However, its delicate act on DNA makes it highly vulnerable to many xenobiotics and physiological stresses that can abort the cleavage/religation reaction to generate Top II·DNA covalent complexes, often referred to as cleavage or cleavable complexes (14Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar, 15Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Top II·DNA cleavage complexes have been shown to be highly effective in triggering tumor cell apoptosis (16Karpinich N.O. Tafani M. Rothman R.J. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16547-16552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that many thiol alkylators can induce Top II cleavage complexes (17Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The involvement of cysteine modification by thiol alkylators has been suggested, because cysteineless mutant Top II is completely resistant to Top II cleavage complex formation induced by thiol alkylators (17Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of a cysteinyl thiol(s) on the Top II cleavage complex presumably stabilizes and hence accumulates the Top II cleavage complex (17Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ability of Se compounds to modify protein thiols has prompted us to test whether they induce Top II cleavage complexes. Our current studies have demonstrated that Se compounds induce Top II cleavage complexes in vitro. In addition, our studies in cells have demonstrated that selenite activates DNA damage signals and induces ATM (18Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 19Chen G. Lee E.Y.-H.P. J. Biol.

Materials—Sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) was purchased from Sigma. VM-26 was a generous gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The mitoxantrone-resistant variant of HL-60, HL-60/MX2, was obtained from ATCC. HL-60/MX2 cells are known to be deficient in Top II because of a lowered nuclear Top IIα content (about 2-fold reduction) and absence of Top IIβ (41Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Human Top IIα was purified from yeast over-expressing hTop IIα using the published procedure (20Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). The ATM siRNA was obtained by annealing the sense (5′-CAUACUACUCAAAGACAUUdTdT-3′) and antisense (5′-AAUGUCUUUGAGUAGUAUGdTdT-3′) RNAs, which were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Cellfectin was purchased from Invitrogen. ATM and actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibodies and anti-phospho histone H2AX antibodies were purchased from Trevigen Inc. Co. Alkaline Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) Assay—SCGE or comet assay was performed as described (21Morris E.J. Dreixler J.C. Cheng K.Y. Wilson P.M. Gin R.M. Geller H.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼5 × 105) were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer. From this suspension, 50 μl was mixed with 0.5 ml of pre-warmed 0.7% low melting point agarose. 0.1 ml of this mixture was then loaded onto a fully frosted slide that was pre-coated with 0.7% agarose. A very thin layer was formed quickly by rapid application of a coverslip. The slide was kept at 4 °C for 10 min. The slides were then submerged in pre-chilled lysis solution (1% N-laurylsarcosine, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 10.5) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with electrophoresis buffer (0.3 m NaOH and 1 mm EDTA), slides were then subjected to electrophoresis for 10 min at 2 V/cm. After electrophoresis, slides were stained with Sybr Gold (Molecular Probes), and nuclei were visualized under a microscope. The images of nuclei were captured by a CCD camera and analyzed with the NIH Image program as described (21Morris E.J. Dreixler J.C. Cheng K.Y. Wilson P.M. Gin R.M. Geller H.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). DNA damage was then calculated using a macro written for the NIH image protocol (21Morris E.J. Dreixler J.C. Cheng K.Y. Wilson P.M. Gin R.M. Geller H.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). DNA Fragmentation Assay by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—2.5 × 106 cells in each sample were treated with different compounds for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted and lysed in 0.4 ml lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton-X100) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation to remove nuclei, soluble chromosomal DNAs including both high molecular weight DNA and nucleosomal DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with 110 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of ethanol and stored at –20 °C overnight. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, rinsed with 70% ethanol, and then resuspended in TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer containing 100 μg/ml RNase A. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, DNA samples were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. Top II-mediated DNA Cleavage Assay—The reaction mixture (20 μl each) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 ng of 3′-end 32P-labeled YEpG DNA, 10 ng of purified hTop IIα, and drug was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of 5 μl of 5% SDS and 1 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by incubation for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. DNA samples were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel containing 0.5× TPE (Tris-phosphate-EDTA) buffer. Gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper and autoradiographed at –80 °C using Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 film. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were lysed with 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins in cell lysates were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. All membranes were stained with Ponceau to confirm equal protein loading. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk for 1 h. Immunoblotting was performed using various antibodies. The secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Bound secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL Western procedure (Pierce). siRNA—ATM siRNA was produced by annealing an equimolar amount of sense and antisense RNAs according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For transfection, subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were transfected with cellfectin alone, cellfectin complexed with 145 ng of ATM sense RNA, or cellfectin complexed with different amounts of ATM siRNA (15, 45, or 145 ng) for 4 h. Medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum, and incubation was continued for another 24 h. Cells were collected and lysed in SDS sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting was performed using ATM and actin antibodies. Selenite Induces DNA Damage as Revealed by Alkaline SCGE—The alkaline SCGE or comet assay under alkaline conditions (21Morris E.J. Dreixler J.C. Cheng K.Y. Wilson P.M. Gin R.M. Geller H.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used to measure chromosomal DNA strand breaks in cells exposed to selenite. Chromosomal DNA strand breaks, which were measured using the comet tail moment, were increased in HL-60 cells exposed to selenite (500 μm for 30 min) as compared with control untreated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1). VM-26 (teniposide), a Top II-specific poison that efficiently induces Top II-mediated DNA damage (22Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a control and was also shown to increase the comet tail moment (Fig. 1). These results indicate that selenite, like VM-26, induces chromosomal DNA strand breaks. Selenite Induces Ser-139 Phosphorylation of H2AX in HL-60 Cells—Activation of nuclear kinases ATM/ATR represents one of the earliest DNA damage signals (23Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 24Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Activated ATM/ATR kinases are known to phosphorylate, among other targets, Ser-139 of histone H2AX (25Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (upper panel), treatment of HL-60 cells with either VM-26 (10 μm) or selenite (500 μm) resulted in increased Ser-139 phosphorylation of the histone H2AX as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho histone H2AX antibodies, suggesting that selenite, like VM-26, induces activation of ATM/ATR kinases. Identical treatments with selenite and VM-26 were also performed in Top II-deficient HL-60/MX2 cells (Fig. 2, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 2 (lower panel), Ser-139 phosphorylation of H2AX induced by VM-26 was greatly reduced (about 10-fold) in Top II-deficient HL-60/MX2 cells as compared with HL-60 cells. Similar reduction of Ser-139 phosphorylation, albeit to a much lesser extent (about 3-fold reduction), induced by selenite was also observed in HL-60/MX2 cells as compared with HL-60 cells, suggesting that selenite, like VM-26, may induce Top II-mediated DNA damage. However, unlike VM-26, selenite also induces non-Top II-mediated DNA damage. Selenite-induced Apoptosis Is Reduced in NIH 3T3 Cells Treated with ATM siRNA—We have also tested whether selenite-induced apoptosis involves the nuclear kinase ATM, which is known to mediate apoptosis induced by many DNA damaging agents (23Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 26Saito S. Goodarzi A.A. Higashimoto Y. Noda Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12491-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). siRNA technology (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) was used to create ATM deficiency in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, ATM siRNA induced dose-dependent reduction of ATM in NIH 3T3 cells as revealed by immunoblotting using anti-ATM antibodies. Apoptosis induced by selenite was then monitored by PARP cleavage using anti-PARP antibodies. PARP cleavage by caspase has been used extensively as an apoptosis end point. As shown in Fig. 3B, PARP cleavage induced by selenite was greatly reduced in ATM siRNA-treated NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that selenite-induced apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells requires the nuclear kinase ATM. The involvement of ATM in selenite-induced apoptosis suggests the possible involvement of nuclear DNA damage. Selenite-induced Apoptosis Is Reduced in Top II-deficient Cells—To test whether selenite-induced apoptosis may involve the formation of Top II cleavage complexes in the nucleus, HL-60 and HL-60/MX2 (Top II-deficient) cells were treated with selenite. Apoptosis was monitored by DNA fragmentation assay using agarose gel electrophoresis. In this assay, chromosomal DNAs released from nuclei because of digestion by apoptotic nucleases were monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. These soluble DNAs included both high molecular weight DNA and smaller nucleosomal DNA fragments. As shown in Fig. 4A, selenite (100 μm) treatment of HL-60 but not HL-60/MX2 cells caused release of both high molecular chromosomal DNA and nucleosomal DNA fragments from nuclei after 4 h of treatment, suggesting that selenite-induced apoptosis could involve Top II. Selenite (20 μm) also induced high molecular weight DNA and nucleosomal DNA fragments in HL60 but not HL-60/MX2 cells after prolonged (24 h) incubation (data not shown). VM-26 and camptothecin (CPT) (28Hsiang Y.H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig. 4A). Like selenite, VM-26 induced release of both high molecular weight chromosomal DNA and nucleosomal DNA fragments from HL-60 but not HL-60/MX2 cells (Fig. 4A). However, CPT, which is known to induce Top I but not Top II cleavage complexes, induced the release of high molecular weight DNA and nucleosomal DNA fragments from both HL-60 and HL-60/MX2 cells (Fig. 4A). Selenite-induced Apoptosis Is Antagonized by a Top II Inhibitor ICRF-193—To test the possibility of Top II involvement, ICRF-193, a Top II catalytic inhibitor, was employed to antagonize the formation of Top II cleavage complexes (29Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike Top II poisons, ICRF-193 specifically inhibits the catalytic activity of Top II without significantly elevating the level of cleavage complexes (30Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 31Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 32Xiao H. Mao Y. Desai S. Zhou N. Liu F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5205-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ICRF-193 is known to antagonize the action of Top II poisons (e.g. VM-26) in terms of both cytotoxicity and the formation of the cleavage complex (30Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 32Xiao H. Mao Y. Desai S. Zhou N. Liu F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5205-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this interference is not completely known but may be related to the ability of ICRF-193 to trap Top II in an ATP-bound circular clamp conformation, which limits access of Top II to chromosomal DNA (32Xiao H. Mao Y. Desai S. Zhou N. Liu F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5205-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, ICRF-193 (100 μm) effectively reduced selenite-induced apoptosis as evidenced by the disappearance of the nucleosomal DNA ladder. To demonstrate the specificity of this effect, ICRF-193 was shown to abolish the formation of the nucleosomal DNA ladder induced by VM-26 (a Top II poison) but not by CPT (a Top I poison) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that Top II cleavage complexes may contribute in part to selenite-induced apoptosis. Se Compounds Induce Reversible Top II Cleavage Complexes in Vitro—To demonstrate a direct role of Se compounds in inducing Top II cleavage complexes, purified hTop IIα was used in a standard in vitro DNA cleavage assay in the presence of selenite (33Li T.K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Wang H. Mao Y. Zhou N. Hu T. Hsieh T.S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15990-15995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, selenite is effective in inducing the cleavage of 32P-labeled DNA in the presence of hTop IIα. DNA cleavage was observed at selenite concentrations as low as 0.5 μm. Selenite-induced DNA cleavage was largely reversed by a second incubation with excess EDTA (Fig. 5). The reversibility of selenite-induced DNA cleavage is indicative of the formation of topoisomerase cleavage complexes (33Li T.K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Wang H. Mao Y. Zhou N. Hu T. Hsieh T.S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15990-15995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to selenite, we also have tested selenocystamine, selenomethionine, and selenate. Selenocystamine is as potent as selenite. However, selenate and selenomethionine were much less active (data not shown). These results are consistent with the known activity of these Se compounds on apoptosis (35Stewart M.S. Spallholz J.E. Neldner K.H. Pence B.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We also tested the effect of selenite on Top IIβ. Selenite induced Top IIβ- and Top IIα-mediated DNA cleavage with about equal efficiency (data not shown). It is noted that the dose response of selenite-induced DNA cleavage is unusual. Above 1 μm, selenite did not increase the amount of DNA cleavage significantly (Fig. 5). This is not because of the complete titration of Top II into cleavage complexes at 1 μm selenite, because much more extensive DNA cleavage was observed using 10 μm VM-26 (see Fig. 6B) under the same conditions. Such a dose response has also been observed previously (17Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with some of the thiol-reactive napthoquinones. It has been suggested that higher concentrations of napthoquinones inactivate Top II and thereby reduce the amount of Top II available for DNA cleavage (17Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It seems possible that higher concentrations of selenite may also inactivate Top II and reduce the amount of Top II cleavage complexes. Reversal of Selenite-induced Top II Cleavage Complexes by Glutathione—Selenite is known to react with protein thiols (3Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that modification of a thiol(s) on Top II by selenite is responsible for the formation of Top II cleavage complexes. To test this possibility, glutathione, whi"

Loss of AR results in XY sex reversal and mutations causing reduced AR activity lead to varying degrees of defects in masculinization. Female PR knockout mice are infertile due to ovarian defects. While much has been discovered about positive regulation of these receptors by coactivators little is known about repression of the transcriptional activity of AR and PR in the presence of agonists. In this study we assessed the effect of SMRT and DAX-1 on AR and PR activity in the presence of both agonists and partial antagonists. We show that SMRT and DAX-1 repress agonist-dependent activity of both receptors, and the mechanism of repression includes disruption of the receptor dimer interactions rather than recruitment of histone deacetylases. We demonstrate that endogenous agonist-bound PR and DAX-1 in T47D breast cancer cells and endogenous AR and DAX-1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells can be coimmunoprecipitated suggesting that the interaction is physiological. Surprisingly, although DAX-1 represses partial antagonist activity of AR, it was ineffective in repressing partial antagonist induced activity of PR. In contrast to most reported repressors, the expression of DAX-1 is restricted. We found that although DAX-1 is expressed in normal human prostate, its expression is strongly reduced in benign prostatic hyperplasia suggesting that DAX-1 plays a role in limiting AR activity in prostate.

Nuclear receptors are regulated both by coactivators and by corepressors. Although steroid receptor coactivators have been studied extensively, less is known about corepressors of agonist activated steroid receptors. Androgens, acting through AR, 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; VDR, vitamin D receptor; TR, thyroid receptor; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoid acid receptor and TR; NCoR, nuclear receptor co-repressor; DAX-1, dosage sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1; LBD, ligand binding domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HDAC, histone deacetylases; I, input; BPH, benign prostate hyperplasia; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RAM, rabbit anti-mouse antibody. play a role in both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. In both cases, reduction in AR activity is an important component of treatment, although fully effective treatments are not yet available. Two well characterized corepressors of thyroid receptor (TR) activity, NCoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid acid receptor (RAR) and TR), have been identified previously (1Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 2Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). They appear to work through binding to TR aporeceptor, recruiting complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDACs); they dissociate from the receptor upon agonist binding allowing coactivator complexes to form (3Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In the case of estrogen receptor (ER), these repressors interact with the antagonist bound receptor through a region that largely overlaps with the coactivator binding interface, and recruit HDACs (4Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). An orphan nuclear receptor DAX-1 (dosage sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1) has been reported to inhibit steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and ER activity (5Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 6Zanaria E. Muscatelli F. Bardoni B. Strom T.M. Guioli S. Guo W. Lalli E. Moser C. Walker A.P. McCabe E.R. Meitinger T. Monaco A.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Camerino G. Nature. 1994; 372: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). DAX-1 is an atypical nuclear receptor containing an ssDNA/RNA binding domain in its N terminus and a multihelical C-terminal domain, a putative ligand binding domain (LBD) (7Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). DAX-1 is an X chromosomal gene, amplification of which results in XY sex reversal, a phenotype similar to AR inactivation (8Bardoni B. Zanaria E. Guioli S. Floridia G. Worley K.C. Tonini G. Ferrante E. Chiumello G. McCabe E.R. Fraccaro M. Zuffardi O. Camerino G. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Opposing effects of the gene dose of DAX-1 and AR as well as a similar pattern of expression suggested that DAX-1 might be an AR repressor. AR shares many common features with other steroid receptors but differs in some aspects. First, whereas ER and PR form parallel homodimers through interactions within their LBD (9Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 10Tetel M.J. Jung S. Carbajo P. Ladtkow T. Skafar D.F. Edwards D.P. Mol Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1114-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), AR forms antiparallel dimers that are stabilized by interaction between the N and C termini (11Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Second, while most steroid receptors such as TR or ER rely strongly on their activation function-2 (AF-2) in the receptor hormone binding domain for recruitment of coactivators (12Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), the N-terminal AF-1 function of AR is more important (13Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 14Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We have studied the functional and physical interactions of corepressors with AR and PR. We found that SMRT and DAX-1 were effective repressors of agonist-dependent activity of AR and PR, but DAX-1 did not repress the activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a class II nuclear receptor. Moreover, endogenous agonist-bound PR and AR each interact with DAX-1. To better understand the mechanism of repression by candidate corepressors we compared their effects on AR and PR. In this study we show that both AR and PR are repressed by DAX-1 in the presence of their respective agonists, but exhibit opposite co-regulation patterns when bound to their common partial antagonist RU486. In contrast, SMRT represses both AR and PR in the presence of either agonist or antagonist. During the preparation of this article, Holter et al. (15Holter E. Kotaja N. Makela S. Strauss L. Kietz S. Janne O.A. Gustafsson J.A. Palvimo J.J. Treuter E. Mol Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that DAX-1 represses AR activity and suggested that DAX-1 can cause mislocalization of AR to the cytoplasm in the presence of agonist. However, our studies using a promoter interference assay, suggest that DAX-1 does not disrupt the interaction of either AR or PR with DNA. We find that the DAX-1 mechanism of action includes interference with N/C-terminal interactions in AR and hormone binding domain interactions in PR.

The p53 mammalian expression vector and the MDM Luc reporter were provided by Dr. Guillermina Lozano, UT MD Andersen Cancer Center, Houston, TX (23Evans S.C. Viswanathan M. Grier J.D. Narayana M. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4041-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, mifepristone (RU486) from Siniwest Holdings (San Diego, CA), Methyltrienolone (R1881) and Promegestone (R5020) from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Monkey kidney COS-1 cells and HeLa (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Transient Cotransfection Experiments—Transient cotransfections were performed essentially as was described previously (24Nazareth L.V. Stenoien D.L. Bingman III, W.E. James A.J. Wu C. Zhang Y. Edwards D.P. Mancini M. Marcelli M. Lamb D.J. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2065-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa or COS-1 cells were plated the day before transfection at 50–60% confluency in DME media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The next day, the indicated amounts of DNA were transfected using polylysine-coupled adenovirus for 2 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). An equal volume of 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added to give a final concentration of 5% and cells were then treated with the indicated ligand or not for 24 h. Cells were harvested and assayed for reporter activity or used for Western blot analysis. For activity assays each data point was done in triplicate and the average and standard deviation calculated. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times and a representative example is shown. Immunoprecipitations—LNCaP (for AR interactions) or T47D (for PR interactions) cells were grown to 70% confluence on 10 cm dishes. Cells were treated for 1 h with the indicated hormone, harvested and protein extracted by 3 freeze/thaw cycles in TESH buffer (10 mm TRIS, 1 mm EDTA, 12 mm thioglycerol, pH 7.7) supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl and protease inhibitors (25Knotts T.A.

Protein extracts were spun at 100,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (540,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Fat was aspirated and the insoluble material discarded. Clarified protein lysate was dialyzed against TESH buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and precleared (incubated) with 70 μl of a 1:1 protein A-Sepharose suspension in TESH for 30 min at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were spun and discarded. For SMRT interaction, protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with either 3 μg of SMRT-1542 monoclonal antibody (Gene Tex, San Antonio, TX) and 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or RAM alone, and 1–4 mg of precleared protein extract overnight at 4 °C. For DAX-1 interaction, protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with 3 μg of DAX-1 K17 rabbit polyclonal antibody or 3 μg of RAM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 1–4 mg of precleared protein extract overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected by brief centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge and were washed three times with TESH/0.1 m NaCl. The samples were transferred to fresh tubes prior to the last centrifugation, centrifuged, and the beads eluted with 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Eluates were resolved by electrophoresis on 6.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and proteins detected by Western blot analysis. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and in Vitro Interaction—DAX-1 was translated in vitro using TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) exactly as described in the manufacturer's protocol. 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (1:1) and 100 μl of TESH/0.1 m NaCl were incubated with 3 μg of either DAX-1 or rabbit antimouse IgG for 1 h on the rocker at 4 °C. To measure binding of PR to DAX-1, beads were washed twice with TESH/0.1 m NaCl, and 50 μl of DAX-1, 100 μl of TESH/0.1 m NaCl, and 1 μg of purified baculovirus-expressed polyhistidine-tagged PR (25Knotts T.A. Orkiszewski R.S. Cook R.G. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8475-8483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were added. The mix was incubated for 2 h on a rocker at 4 °C, washed twice and proteins eluted. Protein eluates were then resolved on 6.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed for PR by Western blotting as described below. To measure DAX-1 binding to PR, 100 μl of a 1:1 protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) slurry in TESH and 100 μl of TESH/0.1 m NaCl were incubated with 5 μg of PR6 antibody (a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the B specific region of PR) (26Milad M. Sullivan W. Diehl E. Altmann M. Nordeen S. Edwards D.P. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 838-847PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were washed twice with TESH/0.1 m NaCl, and 100 μl of TESH/0.1 m NaCl, 50 μl of DAX-1 with or without 2 μg of purified polyhistidine-tagged PR were added. After a 2-h incubation on a rocker at 4 °C, samples were washed once in TESH/0.1 m NaCl, eluted with 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. DAX-1 coimmunoprecipitated with PR antibody was visualized following transfer to nitrocellulose by exposing the membrane to Kodak X—OMAT AR Film (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Western Blot Analysis—PR Western blot analysis was performed using the 1294 antibody (generously provided by Dr. Dean Edwards, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO) as described previously (27Clemm D.L. Sherman L. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Schrader W.T. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). AR Western blots were done with AR 441 antibody as described in Nazareth et al. (24Nazareth L.V. Stenoien D.L. Bingman III, W.E. James A.J. Wu C. Zhang Y. Edwards D.P. Mancini M. Marcelli M. Lamb D.J. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2065-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin Western blots were performed as was previously described (28Narayanan R. Smith C.L. Weigel N.L. Bone. 2002; 31: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Promoter Interference Assay—Cells were transfected with 15 ng of CMV GRE3 CAT, and 100 ng of GRE2-E1b-Luc reporters, the indicated receptor or not, and increasing concentrations of either DAX-1 or SMRT. Hormone (3 nm R1881 for experiments with AR and 10 nm R5020 in experiments with PR) was added 2 h after transfection, cells were harvested 24 h later, and cellular lysates were assayed for CAT and luciferase activity. Luciferase Assay—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline once and 200 μl of lysis buffer (provided by the manufacturer) added to each well in a 6-well plate. After a 15-min incubation, 20 μl of the lysate was used to measure luciferase activity as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). CAT Assay—CAT assays were carried out as was described previously (29Zhang Y. Bai W. Allgood V.E. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in TEN buffer (Tris, EDTA, NaCl), spun, and the buffer was removed. Cells were then lysed in 0.25 m Tris (pH 7.5), supplemented with 0.4 m NaCl if the lysates were later used for western as well as CAT assay, by freezing and thawing. 10–20 μg of the protein were used to determine CAT activity. β-Gal Assay—β-Galactosidase activity was measured to normalize activity of the receptors. The β-galactosidase gene cloned in the same expression vector (pCR 3.1) as PR and AR was used to aid in controlling both for transfection efficiency as well as any effects of treatment on the activity of the expression plasmid promoter. Ten percent of cellular lysates prepared for the luciferase assay was used to perform the β-galactosidase activity assay as previously described (30Bai W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12801-12806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tissue Microarray—Tissue arrays were made in the Baylor Prostate SPORE. Samples were harvested as previously described (31Wheeler T.M. Lebovitz R.M. Prostate. 1994; 25: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Tissue arrays containing cores from normal peripheral zone and areas of BPH were analyzed for intensity and labeling frequency. The intensity of the grading scale ranged from no detectable signal (0) to a strong signal seen at low power (3Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Two corresponds to a moderate signal seen at low to intermediate power, while one corresponds to a weak signal seen only at intermediate to high power. Labeling frequency was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1–33%), 2 (34–66%), or 3 (67–100%). Immunohistochemistry—Briefly, the slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then heated in 10 mm citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 30 min using a steamer. The slides were blocked with 10% normal rabbit serum for 30 min. After washing in PBS, the slides were incubated with the rabbit anti-DAX-1 polyclonal antibody (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG was applied for 30 min followed by 30 min of incubation with streptavidin peroxidase (LSAB kit, DAKO). After rinsing, slides were visualized by diaminobenzidine chromogen solution (DAKO) and counterstained with routine hematoxylin. DAX-1, SMRT, and NCoR Repress Both Agonist-and Partial Antagonist-dependent AR Activity—To characterize the effects of DAX-1, SMRT, and NCoR on AR activity, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with a constant amount of receptor and reporter expression plasmids and increasing amounts of repressor plasmid balanced with the corresponding vector control. As shown in Fig. 1A, DAX-1 inhibits agonist (R1881)-dependent activity of AR as recently reported (15Holter E. Kotaja N. Makela S. Strauss L. Kietz S. Janne O.A. Gustafsson J.A. Palvimo J.J. Treuter E. Mol Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as does SMRT. Both DAX-1 and SMRT also repress the activity of AR in the presence of the partial antagonist RU486 (Fig. 1B). Both of these cofactors repressed AR activity in HeLa and COS-1 cells to a similar extent (data not shown). Surprisingly, NCoR repressed AR activity in the presence of RU486 and R1881 but only in a cell-specific context. Under identical transfection conditions AR is repressed by NCoR in COS-1 (Fig. 1D) but not in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). To determine if changes in receptor activity are due to changes in receptor levels we performed Western blots using samples from the transrepression experiments. As previously reported (32Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), addition of agonist increases AR expression through stabilization of the protein. However, expression of repressors did not change levels of AR expression (Fig. 1E). DAX-1 and SMRT Repress PR Activity—It has been reported previously that SMRT preferentially represses partial antagonist bound PR activity (33Wagner B.L. Norris J.D. Knotts T.A. Weigel N.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, under our transfection conditions PR was repressed by SMRT in the presence of either an agonist or a partial antagonist to a similar extent in both HeLa (Fig. 2, A and B) and COS-1 (data not shown) cell lines. The effect of DAX-1 on PR activity has not been reported previously. Interestingly, DAX-1 appeared to be a much stronger repressor of PR than AR in transient cotransfection assays, since much less DAX-1 DNA was necessary to repress the agonist-dependent PR activity although repression by SMRT was similar to AR (Fig. 2A). While SMRT represses PR antagonist dependent activity as expected, most intriguing was the effect observed with increasing concentrations of DAX-1 on the PR bound to partial antagonists (Fig. 2B). DAX-1 slightly increased the RU486-dependent activity of PR. Note that although DAX-1 potentiates RU486-dependent activity of PR, the maximal activity is still less than that of agonist-bound PR treated with DAX-1. As seen from Fig. 2C, the expression of RU486-bound PR is slightly higher in the presence of increasing concentrations of DAX-1, which may explain the increase in activity of partial antagonist bound PR (compare Fig. 2, B and A). The opposite effect of DAX-1 on PR in the presence of different ligands suggests that its mechanism of repression may be different from that for AR. In contrast to AR, the expression levels of PR are reduced in response to agonist (34Nardulli A.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As in the case of AR, levels of agonist-bound PR are not reduced by the addition of increasing concentrations of DAX-1 and SMRT (Fig. 2C), and therefore this does not contribute to decreasing PR activity. DAX-1 Does Not Repress VDR and p53 Activity—To determine if DAX-1 shows specificity in repression of transcription factors we asked whether DAX-1 would repress the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor p53, or the activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) another member of the nuclear receptor family. As shown in Fig. 3A DAX-1 does not repress p53 activity (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, VDR which lacks an N-terminal domain and thus AF-1 is practically unaffected by increasing concentrations of DAX-1 with or without 1,25 D (Fig. 3B). We used protein levels to normalize the activity of VDR and p53, because VDR was endogenously expressed and p53 was in a different vector from that of β-Gal. However, as we observed from our previous experiments, neither DAX-1 nor SMRT affected β-galactosidase expression at any DNA level tested and therefore either protein concentration or β-galactosidase activity can be used to normalize the experiments. AR and PR Interact with DAX-1 and SMRT—Although other investigators have also shown functional interactions between AR and SMRT or DAX-1 and we have shown functional interactions between agonist-bound PR and both SMRT and DAX-1, the physical interactions are not as well characterized. Holter et al. (15Holter E. Kotaja N. Makela S. Strauss L. Kietz S. Janne O.A. Gustafsson J.A. Palvimo J.J. Treuter E. Mol Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) has shown in vitro interaction between AR and DAX-1, Dotzlaw et al. (35Dotzlaw H. Moehren U. Mink S. Cato A.C. Iniguez Lluhi J.A. Baniahmad A. Mol Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) has shown in vitro interaction between AR and SMRT and Liao et al. (36Liao G. Chen L.Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5052-5061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) has shown an in vivo interaction between AR and SMRT. In contrast, only the in vitro interaction between PR and SMRT has been shown (33Wagner B.L. Norris J.D. Knotts T.A. Weigel N.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To confirm that a physical interaction occurs between endogenous AR and DAX-1 in vivo we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the LNCaP cell line. As shown in Fig. 4A DAX-1 but not rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM) antibody immunoprecipitated AR. To determine if DAX-1 and PR are involved in direct protein-protein interactions we first incubated in vitro translated DAX-1 and purified polyhisidine-tagged PRB and performed coimmunoprecipitation with either DAX-1 or PR antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, PRB was co-precipitated much better by DAX-1 antibody than by RAM antibody. Conversely, DAX-1 was coimmunoprecipitated by PR antibody preferentially in the presence of PR (Fig. 4C). To confirm the physical interaction of endogenous PR with DAX-1 and SMRT in vivo we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using T47D cells. As shown in Fig. 4D DAX-1 but not RAM antibody precipitates PR. We were able to detect modest SMRT interaction with PR in extracts from both R5020 and RU486-treated cells relative to the control RAM (Fig. 4E). The fact that only the A isoform of PR is detectable is probably in part a result of a much lower level of isoform B expression in"
https://openalex.org/W2057291233,"Pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) are small helical proteins found in sensorial organs, particularly in the antennae, of moth and other insect species. They were proposed to solubilize and carry the hydrophobic pheromonal compounds through the antennal lymph to receptors, participating thus in the peri-receptor events of signal transduction. The x-ray structure of Bombyx mori PBP (BmorPBP), from male antennae, revealed a six-helix fold forming a cavity that contains the pheromone bombykol. We have identified a PBP (LmaPBP) from the cockroach Leucophaea maderae in the antennae of the females, the gender attracted by pheromones in this species. Here we report the crystal structure of LmaPBP alone or in complex with a fluorescent reporter (amino-naphthalen sulfonate, ANS) or with a component of the pheromonal blend, 3-hydroxy-butan-2-one. Both compounds bind in the internal cavity of LmaPBP, which is more hydrophilic than BmorPBP cavity. LmaPBP structure ends just after the sixth helix (helix F). BmorPBP structure extends beyond the sixth helix with a stretch of residues elongated at neutral pH and folding as a seventh internalized helix at low pH. These differences between LmaPBP and BmorPBP structures suggest that different binding and release mechanism may be adapted to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the pheromonal ligand.

The sexual behavior of insects, and in particular the mate choice, is triggered by small volatile molecules called pheromones. In Lepidoptera, more than in other insect species, olfaction is preeminent compared with other senses. This feature has led to the development of large antennae, which allow the males to perceive the sexual pheromone blend emitted by females and to respond to it (1Vogt R.G. Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1981; 293: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In this family of insects, pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, pheromone-binding protein; BmorPBP, B. mori PBP; CSP, chemosensory protein; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LmaPBP, L. maderae; SAD, single wavelength anomalous diffraction; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MbraCSP, M. brassicae chemosensory protein. produced in males antennae and secreted in the antennal lymph have been proposed to accommodate pheromones and ferry them from the air/antenna interface to their receptors. PBPs are acidic proteins containing an average of 120–150 amino acids with 6 conserved cysteines involved in three disulfide bridges (1Vogt R.G. Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1981; 293: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 2Vogt R.G. Prestwich G.D. Lerner M.R. J.

Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), unique until now of this class of proteins. In addition, the structure of a functionally related chemosensory protein (CSP) has been reported recently (5Lartigue A. Campanacci V. Roussel A. Larsson A.M. Jones T.A. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J.

BmorPBP three-dimensional structure revealed a six α-helices fold, which delineates a buried cavity containing the hydrophobic pheromone, bombykol, a C16 long chain alkene alcohol. Two three-dimensional structures of the apoprotein were further solved by NMR (7Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The one at low pH (pH 4.5) revealed that the C terminus (residues 125–137) has switched from an elongated stretch conformation to an α-helix. Amazingly, this seventh helix occupies the internal cavity filled with bombykol in the structure of the complex (7Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other apoform, solved at neutral pH, exhibits a three-dimensional structure close to that observed by x-ray diffraction in the complex, confirming thus the importance of the pH in triggering the seventh helix formation and internalization (8Lee D. Damberger F. Peng G. Horst R. Guntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since the pH is acidic near the membrane, the authors have proposed that the PBP may release the pheromone when reaching the membrane imbedded GPCR receptor using this mechanism (9Krieger J. Raming K. Dewer Y.M. Bette S. Conzelmann S. Breer H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The direct involvement of PBPs in olfaction has been described for the first time by Krieger and Ross (13Krieger M.J. Ross K.G. Science. 2002; 295: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) who identified in fire ants two PBP alleles governing alternative social behaviors. This finding suggested that different receptors might be activated by a specific PBP allele-social pheromone complex. In contrast with moths, in the cockroach Leucophaea maderae females perceive the sexual pheromone blend emitted by males (10Sirugue D. Sciences de la Vie et de la Santé. Faculté des Sciences de Bourgogne, Dijon, France1992Google Scholar). A protein of ∼13 kDa has been isolated from the antennae of the females and characterized (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on the dimorphism observed in its sex expression, its low, but significant, identity with moth PBPs (17% with BmorPBP, Fig. 1A) and its ability to bind some components of the pheromonal blend, this protein (LmaPBP) has been assigned to the PBP family (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sexual pheromone blend of L. maderae is known and its components have been previously identified and behaviorally tested (10Sirugue D. Sciences de la Vie et de la Santé. Faculté des Sciences de Bourgogne, Dijon, France1992Google Scholar). The blend is composed by four compounds: the 3-hydroxy-butan-2-one (H3B2) is the long range attracting pheromone; the butane-2,3-diol seems to have no behavioral response and might be the precursor of H3B2; senecioic acid (3-methylbutenoic acid) and (E)-2-octenoic acid are the pheromone compounds that stop the female at a close distance of the male. In contrast with moth pheromones, which are highly hydrophobic, these compounds are all very hydrophilic. We have shown recently, using ANS as a fluorescence reporter, that H3B2 and butane-2,3-diol are able to displace ANS and bind to LmaPBP, while the two acidic compound are not (11Riviere S.

Based on these binding results, we have crystallized LmaPBP alone or in complex with H3B2 (12Lartigue A. Rivière S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and in the presence of the fluorescent reporter ANS, which was used to test pheromone binding (11Riviere S. Lartigue A.

We report here the high resolution crystal structures of the apo-LmaPBP and of the two complexes, which suggest a mechanism of ligand binding and release differing drastically from that of BmorPBP. LmaPBP Cloning, Expression, and Purification—LmaPBP was cloned from female adult antennae and subcloned in pET-22b+ as described elsewhere (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and for other PBPs or CSPs (14Wojtasek H. Leal W.S. J. Biol.

In brief, expression was carried out in the periplasm of Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) at 18 °C after induction by 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The periplasmic proteins were released by osmotic shock and purified by anion exchange on ResourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences). Expression of selenomethionine substituted LmaPBP was performed using the method of methionine biosynthesis pathway inhibition (16Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Purification of the selenomethionine protein was performed as described above. Crystallization of LmaPBP—Single crystals of LmaPBP were obtained at 20 °C by the sitting drop vapor-diffusion method using nanodrops (17Sulzenbacher G. Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Spinelli S. Valencia C. Pagot F. Vincentelli R. Bignon C. Salomoni A. Grisel S. Maurin D. Huyghe C. Johansson K. Grassick A. Roussel A. Bourne Y. Perrier S. Miallau L. Cantau P. Blanc E. Genevois M. Grossi A. Zenatti A. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. 2002; D58: 2109-2115Google Scholar) in two different crystal forms as reported elsewhere (12Lartigue A. Rivière S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The crystals of form I, that of the apo-protein and the complex with ANS, belong to space group P1, with cell dimensions a = 43.2 Å, b = 45.1Å, c = 45.7Å, α = 118.6°, β = 93.0°, and γ = 106.9°, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.6 Å3/Da, 52% solvent). A second crystal form was obtained with the pheromone component H3B2, with space group P21, cell dimensions a = 38.2 Å, b = 62.2 Å, c = 45.1 Å, and β = 93.0° and two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Vm = 1.9 Å3/Da, 35% solvent). Diffraction and Data Collection—All data sets were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Diffraction images were indexed and integrated with DENZO (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (19Collaborative Computing Program Number 4 and Collaborative Computing Project for NMRActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). A Se-Met-substituted crystal of form 1 was exposed at ID29 beamline at three wavelengths tuned at the peak, inflection, and remote energies. The crystal used was cryocooled at 100 K within its crystallization mother liquor and with 25% of glycerol. Images were collected on an ADSC-Q4 detector, with a crystal to detector distance of 200 mm, using a 1° oscillation with 1-s exposure time. A complete data set has been carefully collected at 1.9 Å resolution using 528 images for the peak wavelength data set; the data at other wavelength were useless for structure resolution. The diffraction data have a R-merge of 4.7% and a completeness of 89% (Table I). In addition to this SAD data set, a second SAD data set has been recorded on BM14 beamline at the selenium peak energy. 720 images were collected at 1.7-Å resolution on a CCD camera with a crystal detector distance 100 mm and the same oscillation range as above. The R-merge and the completeness are 4.5 and 96%, respectively (Table I).Table IData reduction and refinement statistics of LmaPBP crystalsCrystalApo-Se1Apo-Se2ANSH3B2BeamlineID29BM14ID14-EH4BM14Data collectionaA space group P1: cell dimensions: a = 43.2 Å, b = 45.1 Å, c = 45.7 Å, α = 118.6°, β = 93.0°, λ = 106.9°; B space group P21: cell dimensions: a = 38.2 Å, b = 62.2Å, c = 45.1Å, β = 92.5° (last shell data into brackets)Crystal formIaIaIaIIbλ (Å)0.9792 (peak)0.97887 (peak)0.9392650.919214Resolution (Å)30 - 1.9 (1.9-2.0)25 - 1.7 (1.7-1.79)30 - 1.6 (1.6-1.69)30 - 1.7 (1.7-1.79)R sym (%)4.7 (11.4)4.5 (27.4)5.7 (12.2)4.6 (18.2)I/σ(I)9.0 (5.3)8.0 (2.4)7.6 (4.8)10.1 (3.7)Completeness88.9 (58.0)95.7 (94.8)84.4 (84.0)97 (93.1)Multiplicity4.2 (3.9)6.0 (5.8)1.9 (1.5)3.5 (3.4)Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)20 - 1.7 (1.7-1.74)20 - 1.6 (1.6-1.64)20 - 1.7 (1.7-1.74)Reflections/atoms26,680/201029,762/214420,755/2066R work/R free0.214/0.1810.208/0.1740.184/0.141Mean B (Å2)24.419.516Ligands B (Å2)52/5124.7/27.435/42r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)/angles (°)0.016/1.430.015/1.760.014/1.5Procheck zones 1 and 2 (%)95.7, 4.394.8, 5.295.7, 4.3a A space group P1: cell dimensions: a = 43.2 Å, b = 45.1 Å, c = 45.7 Å, α = 118.6°, β = 93.0°, λ = 106.9°; B space group P21: cell dimensions: a = 38.2 Å, b = 62.2Å, c = 45.1Å, β = 92.5° Open table in a new tab The crystal form I of LmaPBP obtained in presence of ANS was exposed at BM14 beamline. Two data sets were recorded for the high and low resolution, consisting of 180 images (1° oscillation) and 90 images (2° oscillation), respectively. The distance crystal detector was fixed to 150 and 250 mm. The crystal diffracts to 1.6-Å resolution, and the R-merge is of 5.7% with a completeness of 85% (Table I). The crystal form II obtained in the presence of H3B2 was collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility BM14 beamline, using a procedure similar to that of form I. Between 30- and 1.7-Å resolution, the R-merge was 4.6%, and the completeness was 97.0% (Table I). Structure Solution and Refinement—All attempts to solve the LmaPBP structure by molecular replacement using AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with BmorPBP as a search model failed. This is certainly due to the low sequence identity between the two proteins (Fig. 1A). The structure of apo-LmaPBP was finally solved from a Se-Met-substituted crystal (form I) using SAD method at the Se-K edge (λ = 0.9792Å, f = –8.3; Table I). Initial phases were obtained at 2.5 Å with a figure of merit of 0.468 using SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). A total of 9 sites out of the 12 selenium atoms per asymmetric unit were located. Phases were improved by solvent flattening using Resolve (19Collaborative Computing Program Number 4 and Collaborative Computing Project for NMRActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and led to a figure of merit of 0.707. The experimental density map after solvent flattening was clear enough to manually build two-thirds of the model using Turbo-Frodo (22Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar) and to locate the three disulfide bridges. Phase improvement was carried out at 1.7 Å using phases coming from the constructed model with ARP-wARP (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The good quality of the resulting map made it possible to finish building all missing parts of the model. The model was refined using Refmac (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex with ANS was obtained by isostructural replacement, while the complex with the H3B2 was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The two models were also refined using Refmac (22Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar). Statistics of refinement and model quality are reported in Table I. Protein geometry of the native, ANS complex, and H3B2 complex was assessed using Procheck (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showing 95.7, 94.8, and 95.7% residues in the most favorable region, respectively. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank at the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics as entries 1ORG, 1OW4, and 1P28, respectively. Crystallographic Results—The apo-LmaPBP and the ANS complex belong to the same crystal form (Form I) and contain two monomers in the asymmetric unit (12Lartigue A. Rivière S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The small interaction surface observed between the two monomers is in favor of a non-biological assembly, as expected from gel filtration results where a monomer was observed. The LmaPBP-H3B2 pheromone complex belongs to crystal form II, which also contains a non-biological dimer in the asymmetric unit (12Lartigue A. Rivière S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The complete polypeptide chain of the apoprotein was built in the electron density map between residues 1 and 118 for chains A and B. In addition, 186 water molecules and two glycerol molecules were identified. In the complex with ANS, besides the residues from the native gene sequence, two and one extra residues from the expression vector (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were visible in the electron density map, at the N terminus, for chains A and B, respectively. A molecule of ANS was readily identified in the electron density map, one per monomer. A positive residual electron density remained after refinement, which could be interpreted by fitting a glycerol molecule on top of the ANS molecule, with a 30:70 occupation ratio (glycerol:ANS). A total of 243 water molecules were also added in the electron density map. In the complex with the H3B2 pheromonal compound, the polypeptide chain is visible between residues –1 to 117 and 2 to 118 in chains A and B, respectively; 235 water molecules were added. A pheromone molecule was clearly visible in both monomers. Overall, the B-factors are quite low in the three structures (24.4, 19.5, and 16 Å2, respectively) taking into account their high resolution (Table I). LmaPBP Fold—LmaPBP is formed of six helices comprised between residues 1–16 (A), 24–31 (B), 39–52 (C), 68–74 (D), 80–96 (E), and 103–117 (F) (Fig. 1B). Three disulfide bridges are established between cysteine pairs 16/47, 43/104, and 92/113 and bridge together helices A/C, C/F, and E/F, respectively. They are located at the positions expected from the sequence alignment with BmorPBP (Fig. 1, A and B). The total helical amount of 65% observed in the three-dimensinal structure is significantly higher than the values from secondary structure prediction obtained from JPRED (45%) or those from circular dichroism (40%) (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Amazingly, helices are not connected by turns but by extended stretches of 5–7 residues in length (Fig. 1B). An exception occurs between helices C and D, where a segment of 15 non-helical residues forms a quasi-hairpin structure (residues 54–62) between two turns (Fig. 1B). Deviations between Monomers—The r.m.s.d. values calculated between each pair of monomer (A and B) in the three structures range between 0.40 and 0.84 Å for all Cα atoms. The apoprotein and the ANS complex present minor differences compared with those observed between their monomers A and B. In contrast, the complex with H3B2 exhibits slightly larger differences between monomers, 0.8 Å r.m.s.d. versus 0.48 Å and 0.40 Å for the two former structures. Monomer B seems to be responsible for this larger deviation, since its r.m.s.d. value calculated against monomers A and B of the apo and H3B2 structures are 0.1 Å higher in average than those originating from monomer A. Excluding monomer B of the H3B2 complex from the r.m.s.d. calculations lead to an average value of 0.55 ± 0.15 Å between the eight couples. Comparison with the BmorBPB Structures—Although sharing only 17% identity (Fig. 1A), LmaPBP and BmorPBP present similar folds (Fig. 2). We have compared the structure of apo-LmaPBP with the x-ray structure of Bmor-PBP bound to its pheromone, bombykol, at neutral pH (4Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. value involving 118 Cα atoms aligned in the two x-ray structures is 2.9 Å. Indeed, the six helices have similar orientations (Fig. 2A); helices A, C, D, and F have their main axes co-linear, whereas helices B and E diverge. Consequently, the two disulfide bridges established between the closely aligned helices A/C and C/F are within 0.8 Å (Cys Cα atom), whereas the third one, between helices E and F, has the Cα atoms of the Cys at a 1.4–1.9-Å distance. LmaPBP is 19 residues shorter than Bmor-PBP: 4 residues at the N terminus and 15 at the C terminus; the small differences in length observed in loops or helices, a total of 4 residues, cancel each other. The NMR structure of the apo-BmorPBP at acidic pH (7Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) is also well superposed to LmaPBP, with a r.m.s.d. value of 2.60 Å. Indeed, most of the differences between the two BmorPBP structures occur between residue 122 and the C terminus, a segment of residues absent in LmaPBP (Fig. 2B). The Apoprotein—The apo-LmaPBP structure presents an open pocket delineated by its six helices (Fig. 3A). This cavity is wide open to the bulk solvent (Fig. 3A) and is much smaller than that observed in BmorPBP where the cavity communicate with the solvent through a small opercula (Fig. 3B). In the apoprotein, the cavity contains a serendipitous glycerol molecule. Such molecules are often observed in small crevices at protein surfaces. A glycerol molecule, introduced as cryoprotectant, has also been observed nested in the pheromone binding cavity of a porcine PBP (28Spinelli S. Vincent F. Pelosi P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The glycerol molecules B-factors are higher than average, indicating a high positional mobility, as expected for weak ligands (Table I). In the apo-PBP, the cavity is about 15 Å deep and ∼10 × 15 Å in diameter. Its walls are covered by hydrophobic residues (Leu residues at positions 36, 45, 49, and 54, Ala46, Val89, Ile107, and Phe110), as in BmorPBP, but also by polar non-charged residues (Tyr residues at positions 5 and 75 and Thr111). The mouth of the cavity is an oval of 10 by 8 Å formed by 6 residues (Arg33, Asn34, Pro35, Lys85, Val114, and Arg115), among which three are positively charged. These charged side chains form the lips of the cavity and can provide potential binding sites for ligands. The Complex with H3B2—Amazingly, despite the considerable amount of glycerol brought into the crystal for cryocooling (25%, 2.7 m), the H3B2 molecule was not displaced as a result of its good affinity with LmaPBP (K d = 3.8 μm (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Indeed, the H3B2 pheromonal ligand being smaller than glycerol has room enough to bind in the LmaPBP cavity without perturbing the cavity wall side chains (Fig. 3C). The H3B2 electron density map was clearly defined. Some positive difference density remained after fitting the S-enantiomer, however, and the R-enantiomer was subsequently introduced to account for it. After refining the positions and the occupancies (50:50), no significant residual electron density was present. This indicates that LmaPBP does not select one of the H3B2 R- or S-enantiomer from the commercial racemic mixture, but binds both (Fig. 3D). The H3B2 molecule establishes interactions with polar, charged, and hydrophobic residues, which point inside the cavity: Tyr5 and Tyr75, Lys89 (lips), and Phe110 (Table II). As in the case of glycerol, interactions are mainly mediated by electrostatic forces.Table IIDistances (in Å) between the ligands in LmaPBP and the proteinGlycerol-AGlycerol-BH3B2-A SH3B2-A, RH3B2-B, SH3B2-B, RANS-AANS-BTyr5OH-O3 2.9OH-O3 2.9OH-O7 3.7OH-O7 3.6OH-O7 3.0OH-O7 3.1OH-C15 3.2OH-C15 3.1Arg33NE-O1 3.0NH1-O2 3.7NH2-O2 3.0NH1-O1 3.7Leu45CD2-C14 3.8Leu49CD2-C3 3.8CD2-C3 3.8CD2-C1 3.7CD2-C15 3.6CD2-C15 3.9Leu54CD2-C1 3.9CD2-C1 3.9Val70CG1-C3 3.9CG1-C3 3.8Met71CG-C6 3.6SD-C6 3.8Leu74CD1-C1 3.7CD1-C2 3.9Tyr75OH-O1 3.0OH-O1 3.0OH-O2 3.4OH-O2 2.9OH-O2 3.6OH-O1 2.5OH-O1 2.4Thr82O-C7 3.4O-C7 3.5Lys85CE-O1 3.8CE-O1 3.2CE-O2 3.6CE-O2 2.8CB-C8 3.9NZ-O2 3.6Ala86N-C7 3.8N-C7 3.7Val89CG2-O2 3.9CG2-C10 3.4CG2-C9 3.6Phe110CE2-C4 3.7CE2-C4 3.9CE2-C4 3.6Thr111CG2-C4 3.7CG2-C14 3.7CG2-C14 3.6Val114CG1-O2 3.2CG1-O2 3.1 Open table in a new tab The Complex with ANS—In contrast with the H3B2 ligand, the much larger fluorescent probe ANS (Fig. 3E) modifies largely the LmaPBP cavity yielding a volume increase of ∼50% (Fig. 3F). The ANS molecule contacts many more residues than the H3B2 ligand (Table II). The molecule is positioned with its hydrophobic phenyl and naphthyl groups imbedded within the cavity, the sulfate group emerging at the level of the cavity mouth (Fig. 3F)). If positioned in the apoprotein cavity, ANS clashes severely (d < 1 Å) with 2 residues: its naphthyl moiety with the Met71 side chain and its sulfate group with Lys85, an opercula residue. Consequently, in the complex the χ1 angle of Met71 has changed by 120°, yielding a larger space, but provoking an overlap of the rotated atoms with the ring atoms of Phe77. The χ1 angle of Phe77 had to change by 130°, bringing the phenyl ring in a position totally exposed at the protein surface. At the cavity mouth, Lys85 side chain rotates far from ANS, to a position 5.0 Å away from it. Meanwhile, Arg33, another mouth residue, has moved slightly in the direction of the ANS sulfate group, establishing two ion bonds (3.0 Å) through its Nη2 and Nϵ atoms with two sulfate oxygens. A hydrogen bond (2.5 Å) is also established between Tyr75 OH and a sulfate oxygen. The Lys85 short contact together with another short contact with Val89 (2.8 Å), perpendicular to the naphthyl ring, have been released by a main chain movement of the residue stretch 81–89, with a maximum displacement of 1.8 Å for the Cα atom of Thr82. The strength of the ANS interaction with LmaPBP seems to result from two antagonist features: the positive one is the strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction with the cavity, and the negative one is the strain induced by this large ligand on side-chains and partly on the main chain. The relatively low K d of 2.1 μm observed (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reflects well the partial cancellation of these antagonist forces. The sulfate group appears to be a key element for the binding. It is not surprising therefore that the fluorescent reporter AMA bearing a NH2 group could not bind to LmaPBP (11Riviere S. Lartigue A. Quennedey B. Campanacci V. Farine J.-P. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brossut R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conformations of LmaPBP unbound and bound to its pheromone are very close. Similarly, the BmorPBP pheromone complex (x-ray) and the apoprotein (NMR), both obtained at neutral pH, do not reveal significant changes considering the different techniques of determination. The helical structure of PBPs is probably rigidified by three interhelical disulfide bridges, the positions of which are remarkably conserved between Lma-and BmorPBP and very probably with all other classical hexacysteine PBPs. Despite its backbone rigidity, LmaPBP presents a cavity flexible enough to bind ANS, a ligand much larger than the pheromone; this flexibility is mainly due to the fluidity of the side chains.

The flexibility of MbraCSP may be due to the position of the disulfide bridges, located within loops, which provide thus little constraint to the whole protein structure (5Lartigue A. Campanacci V.

The ANS-LmaPBP complex structure is the first example of a fluorescence reporter observed in the binding site of an insect PBP. In a previous work, the binding site of fluorescent probes introduced to assess PBP binding capacity was questioned (15Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We indirectly demonstrated that the binding site was unique and was the internal cavity, as expected from structural considerations. The complex LmaPBP-ANS demonstrates that more generally, as for mammalian PBPs/OBPs (30Ramoni R. Vincent F. Grolli S. Conti V. Malosse C. Boyer F.D. Nagnan-Le Meillour P. Spinelli S. Cambillau C.

LmaPBP cavity walls and mouth, although containing a majority of hydrophobic side-chains, contain also a significant amount of polar or charged residues. These polar/charged residues make it possible to bind small hydrophilic ligands such as H3B2. The presence of polar and charged side chain forming the walls of the LmaPBP cavity is in contrast with the cavities of BmorPBP (4Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem.

J. 2003; 369: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which are almost exclusively formed of hydrophobic residues. Furthermore, sequence comparisons among PBPs from moth confirm the hydrophobic nature of their cavity, in agreement with the largely hydrophobic nature of their pheromonal compounds: long alkyl chains (C14–C18) alcohols, aldehydes, or acetyl esters. However, the low sequence similarity observed between PBPs from moth and those from other classes of insects prevents any clear identification of the nature of their binding cavity; this should await the resolution of more three-dimensional structures. Indeed, the fact that LmaPBP has a cavity including several polar side chains fits nicely with the hydrophilic nature of Leucopheae maderae pheromonal blend. Interestingly, both insect or mammal PBPs have been proposed to ferry hydrophobic compounds, mostly insoluble in the peri-receptor fluid, from air to the GPCR receptors. The fact that LmaPBP binds H3B2, a compound highly soluble in water, raises doubts about a unique role of PBPs as transport proteins and reinforces the hypothesis of a wider function in which they would trigger their receptors once bound to the pheromone (9Krieger J.

Science. 2002; 295: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this context, the crown of positive residues around the cavity mouth of LmaPBP might interact with a negatively charged GPCR receptor. It has been postulated that bombykol, the very hydrophobic pheromone of BmorPBP, would interact with the cell membrane around the receptor. It has also been proposed that the formation of a seventh internalized helix at low pH (near the membrane) might be used to expel the pheromone in the vicinity of the receptor. In LmaPBP the absence of the amino acid stretch corresponding to this seventh helix together with the evidence of an hydrophilic cavity binding an hydrophilic ligand suggest that another, more classical, mechanism of direct ligand release might be used."

In the osmoregulated ABC transporter (OpuA) from Lactococcus lactis, ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation are tightly coupled, and the activity of right-side-in and inside-out reconstituted OpuA can be determined accurately. Although the ATP/substrate stoichiometry determined from the uptake of glycine betaine and intravesicular ATP hydrolysis tends to increase with decreasing average size of the liposomes, the data from inside-out reconstituted OpuA indicate that the mechanistic stoichiometry is 2. Moreover, the two orientations of OpuA in proteoliposomes allowed possible contributions from substrate (glycine betaine) inhibition on the trans-side of the membrane and inhibition by ADP to be determined. Here we show that OpuA is not inhibited by up to 400 mm glycine betaine on the trans-side of the membrane. ADP is an inhibitor, but accumulation of ADP was negligible in the assays with inside-out-oriented OpuA, and potential effects of the ATP/ADP ratio on the ATP/substrate stoichiometry determinations could be eliminated.

Despite the diversity of functions and substrates of the ABC transporters, all members fuel the translocation process by ATP hydrolysis. Also, the basic architecture of ABC transporters is remarkably similar among members in the superfamily. Always present are two cytoplasmic-exposed nucleotide-binding domains, the ATP-binding cassettes, and two hydrophobic domains that are predicted to span the membrane multiple times in an α-helical conformation (2Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The conserved assembly and arrangement of these domains have been clearly demonstrated in the recently determined structure of BtuCD, the ABC transporter that mediates uptake of vitamin B12 in Escherichia coli (5Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1038-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic ABC transporters involved in solute uptake use an additional substrate-binding protein that delivers the substrate to the translocator. The ABC transporter, OpuA, from Lactococcus lactis belongs to a subfamily of the OTCN family of which members have the substrate-binding domain fused to the translocator (6Heide van der T. Poolman B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the dimeric complex and presumably functional state, two of these chimeric substrate-binding/translocator proteins and two ATPase subunits are present. Extensive characterization of OpuA has revealed that this protein responds to osmotic stress, which is sensed at the cytoplasmic face as a change in ionic strength (7Heide van der T. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Heide van der T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The issue of ATP/substrate stoichiometry for members of the ABC transport family is still a subject of debate.

Given the similarity in architecture between different members of the ABC superfamily, it is likely that a universal mechanistic stoichiometry is applicable to all members. The large variations observed are most likely the result of experimental flaws, differences in the setup of the experiments, and/or the need to correct for uncoupled ATP hydrolysis and/or substrate leak pathways. The OpuA system affords optimal conditions for determination of ATP/substrate stoichiometries because ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to the osmotic signal and the presence of substrate. In this report, we perform stoichiometry measurements on proteoliposomes in which OpuA has been functionally reconstituted. We have performed two independent assays to derive the stoichiometries and conclude that 2 molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed per molecule of glycine betaine translocated. Materials—M17 broth was purchased from Difco, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was obtained from Qiagen Inc., Biobeads SM-2 were from Bio-Rad, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was purchased from Anatrace, Triton X-100 was obtained from Roche Applied Science. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]-sodium salt (DOPG) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Radiolabeled [N-methyl-14C]choline chloride (55 mCi/mmol) and [N-methyl-3H]choline chloride (80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and used as precursors to synthesize [N-methyl-14C]glycine betaine and [N-methyl-3H]glycine betaine, respectively, as described (21Landfald B. Strom A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Unlabeled glycine betaine was purchased from Sigma, and its purity was confirmed by proton-NMR spectroscopy. Creatine kinase, mono-phosphate creatine-disodium salt, tetracaine, ATP-disodium salt, and carnitine were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. ATP and Pi commercial standards were from ATPlite™-M (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Sigma, respectively. Isolation of Membrane Vesicles and OpuA Purification—L. lactis strain NZ9000 (22De Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown semi-anaerobically at 30 °C, and large scale isolation of membranes was performed as described (9Heide van der T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Poolman B. Konings W.N. Robillard G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). OpuA was purified from membrane vesicles as described previously (9Heide van der T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The resulting protein fractions were assayed for purity and concentration via SDS-PAGE and A 280 UV-visible spectroscopy, respectively. Membrane Reconstitution of OpuA—OpuA was incorporated into liposomes consisting of synthetic DOPG and DOPE at a 1:1 ratio. Equal amounts of DOPG and DOPE in chloroform were mixed, dried in a rotary evaporator, and, subsequently, resuspended to 20 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0. For optimal hydration, lipids were sonicated with a point tip sonicator (S&M Inc., Danbury CT) for three cycles of 15 s on and 45 s off. Sonicated liposomes were then subjected to three rounds of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 4 °C. Subsequently, the liposomes were extruded through 400-nm pore size polycarbonate filters (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada), after which the extruded liposomes were destabilized by titration with Triton X-100. Destabilization was monitored by measuring the turbidity at 540 nm, and Triton X-100 was added to just beyond the point of “detergent saturation” (24Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At this point, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside solubilized, and purified OpuA was added to the lipids at 1:100 or 1:50 protein to lipid ratio (w/w), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation; a protein to lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w) corresponds to 1 to ∼30,000 on a molar basis. The proteoliposomes were formed by removal of detergent by the stepwise addition of polystyrene beads (Biobeads SM2, Bio-Rad). To the mixture of protein and lipid, 40 mg/ml polystyrene beads were added in a series of steps: 15 min at room temperature, 15 min at 4 °C, 30 min at 4 °C, overnight at 4 °C, and 60 min at 4 °C. The polystyrene beads were removed by filtration, and the proteoliposome mixture was diluted 4× with 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, after which the proteoliposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min. The proteoliposomes were washed twice and finally resuspended to 20 mg/ml lipid weight and stored in liquid nitrogen. ATP-driven Glycine Betaine Uptake in Proteoliposomes—For uptake or efflux, 9 mm ATP/Mg2+ or an ATP-regenerating system (2.4 mg/ml creatine kinase, 9 mm ATP/Mg2+, 24 mm sodium-mono-phosphate creatine) was enclosed in the proteoliposomes during three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were made homogeneous via extrusion through polycarbonate filters of various pore size (400, 200, or 100 nm) (Avestin Inc.). Following extrusion, the proteoliposomes were washed with 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, and pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g for 12 min to remove external ATP/Mg2+. In some experiments, a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-50 medium, 20 × 0.7-cm column) was used to wash proteoliposomes or to exchange potassium-phosphate for potassium-Hepes. Finally, the proteoliposomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g for 12 min and resuspended to 20 mg/ml lipid weight. To initiate uptake, proteoliposomes were diluted into buffers of varying osmolality (iso-osmotic to hyper-osmotic) and containing [14C]glycine betaine (62 μm, final concentration unless stated otherwise) at 30 °C. At various time points, a portion of the proteoliposome mixture was taken, diluted with assay buffer at 4 °C, and filtered rapidly through 0.45-μm pore size cellulose nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell). The use of cellulose nitrate filters allowed trapping of the proteoliposomes on the filters for nearly 100%. The proteoliposomes were washed with 2 ml of assay buffer (at 4 °C) to remove external [14C]glycine betaine. The radioactivity on the filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. ATP-driven Glycine Betaine Efflux from Proteoliposomes—Measurement of efflux was made by first subjecting proteoliposomes, loaded with 9 mm ATP/Mg2+, to an osmotic upshift to stimulate uptake of [14C]glycine betaine as described above. After a plateau of glycine betaine was reached (after ∼10 min.), the proteoliposomes were diluted into a volume of buffer of similar osmolality containing 9 mm ATP/Mg2+, which activates inside-out-oriented OpuA and allows exit of preaccumulated [14C]glycine betaine. Proteoliposome samples were collected and treated as described above. Measurement of ATP Hydrolysis—In addition to measurement of glycine betaine uptake and efflux, ATP hydrolysis was measured directly by determining the changes in concentration of ATP (luciferineluciferase assay) or indirectly by determining the changes in concentration of phosphate (malachite green-based phosphate assay) (25Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). For measurement of ATP levels inside the proteoliposomes, identical proteoliposome samples were assayed for [14C]glycine betaine uptake at 30 °C. At the appropriate time points, samples of proteoliposomes were placed in a lysis buffer that halts ATP hydrolysis. Following incubation with the luciferine-luciferase solution (ATPlite™-M, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 60 min, the chemiluminescence was measured for each sample and compared with an ATP standard curve. The ADP levels were determined from the difference in ATP concentration after conversion of ADP into ATP, using 18 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and the actual ATP concentration. To quantify the ATP hydrolysis upon the addition of ATP/Mg2+ to the exterior of proteoliposomes, the malachite green phosphate assay was used, and the efflux reactions were performed in phosphate-free buffers. The activity of OpuA was comparable in phosphate and Hepes buffers (date not shown). To determine the phosphate levels, the assay buffer was collected after rapid filtration of the proteoliposomes on cellulose nitrate filters. A portion of the assay buffer was mixed with the malachite green solution, and the reaction was completed with the addition of 34% citric acid. The amount of phosphate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm and compared with a phosphate standard curve. Control experiments were performed with liposomes not containing OpuA to correct for background phosphate levels. Miscellaneous—The osmolalities of media and buffers were measured by freezing point depression with an Osmostat 030 (Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Protein concentration determinations were made with the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumen as a standard. UV-visible measurements of protein concentration and titration of lipids were made using a Cary Spectrophotometer (Cary 100 Bio, Varian) Transport and ATP Hydrolysis by Right-side-in- and Inside-out-oriented OpuA—Assays of OpuA activity were made for right-side-in and inside-out reconstituted molecules (Fig. 1, A and B). Uptake of glycine betaine was performed with proteoliposomes containing ATP/Mg2+ or the ATP-regenerating system (Fig. 1A). In the absence of enclosed ATP/Mg2+, no glycine betaine uptake was observed (data not shown). The ATP-regenerating system allowed a higher level of uptake because the ATP level remained high (and the ADP level remained low) for longer a period than with ATP/Mg2+ alone. Under iso-osmotic conditions, little or no glycine betaine uptake was observed when OpuA was incorporated into liposomes composed of 50% DOPG/50% DOPE. The transporter is in the inactive state under these conditions (7Heide van der T. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Heide van der T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Osmotic upshift activated the OpuA transporter, and the final level of glycine betaine uptake was reached after ∼10 min. Efflux of [14C]glycine betaine was observed upon the addition of ATP/Mg2+ to the proteoliposomes that had preaccumulated glycine betaine for 10 min (Fig. 1B). This efflux results from the stimulation of the inside-out-oriented OpuA molecules. Consistent with the osmotic activation mechanism, involving activation by ionic strength at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (9Heide van der T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), efflux of glycine betaine occurred with high (>200 mm) concentrations of KCl, NaCl, or methyl glucamine-chloride and not with alanine or sucrose. Efflux did not occur in the absence of ATP/Mg2+ or in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (data not shown). The apparent rate of glycine betaine efflux by inside-out-oriented OpuA in the presence of saturating amounts of ATP was lower than the rate of uptake by right-side-in-oriented OpuA (and ATP or an ATP-regenerating system inside the vesicle lumen), which reflects the non-random incorporation of the molecules with this reconstitution method (24Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). With different preparations of proteoliposomes, we observed that the fraction of right-side-inoriented OpuA is in the range of 65–80%. The changes in internal ATP and ADP concentrations as a result of glycine betaine uptake are shown in Fig. 2A. The data indicate that minimal ATP hydrolysis had occurred during the overnight preparation of the proteoliposomes. Fig. 2B clearly shows that both glycine betaine and ionic activation are needed for ATP hydrolysis, indicating that ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation are tightly coupled. This tight coupling, generally not observed for other ABC transporters, enables a higher degree of certainty for interpretation of results regarding stoichiometry measurements. Inhibition of OpuA Substrate Translocation—The limitation of glycine betaine uptake after 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B), despite a residual level of ∼3 mm ATP (Fig. 2A), is most likely due to depletion of ATP in proteoliposomes with right-side-out OpuA and a fraction of liposomes without OpuA and thus a constant ATP level. However, the inhibition of uptake could partly have a kinetic origin, that is, it could be a consequence of the accumulation of ADP and/or glycine betaine. ADP is known to inhibit the ATPase activity of ABC transporters, and inhibition by high concentrations of substrate, accumulated on the trans-side of the membrane, has been observed for glycine betaine uptake in Lactobacillus plantarum and Listeria monocytogenes (27Glaasker E. Heuberger E.H.M.L. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5540-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Verheul A. Glaasker E. Poolman B. Abee T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6979-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is difficult to measure the effects of inhibition by ADP or glycine betaine with right-side-in-oriented OpuA because it would require manipulation of the lumen contents (and reconstitution conditions). Therefore, we measured possible inhibitory effects of ADP and substrate on the activity of the inside-out-oriented OpuA molecules. In Fig. 3A, we report the effect of ATP and different ADP concentrations on the rate of efflux of glycine betaine from the proteoliposomes. Without the addition of ATP, no efflux of glycine betaine was observed. Under typical conditions of efflux with 9 mm ATP/Mg2+, the rate of efflux was almost maximal. The apparent K m for ATP stimulation of efflux was ∼3 mm (data not shown). Importantly, there was a significant reduction of glycine betaine efflux when ADP/Mg2+ was added together with ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 3A); the K i for ADP inhibition of ATP-stimulated (9 mm) efflux was ∼12 mm (data not shown). Thus, ADP has a limiting effect on the rate and extent of glycine betaine efflux, which, together with a reduction in ATP concentration, will reduce the uptake with right-side-out-oriented OpuA. To determine possible inhibitory effects by trans-substrate, [14C]glycine betaine efflux was measured with up to 400 mm glycine betaine on the outside. In Fig. 3B, we show that high concentrations of glycine betaine on the trans-side of the membrane did not inhibit glycine betaine translocation. Also, carnitine, a substrate analogue of glycine betaine, did not inhibit the efflux of glycine betaine stimulated by ATP/Mg2+. Carnitine is not a substrate of OpuA but has been shown to exert trans-inhibitor effects on the glycine betaine-specific transporter of L. monocytogenes (28Verheul A. Glaasker E. Poolman B. Abee T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6979-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that trans-inhibition by substrate is not a factor that reduces the uptake rate as the cells (or, here, proteoliposomes) accumulate glycine betaine. A fraction of proteoliposomes without right-side-in-oriented OpuA, together with the inhibition by ADP, must be the cause for the inhibition of glycine betaine uptake despite the presence of an apparent ∼3 mm ATP in the ensemble of (proteo) liposomes. Similarly, the incomplete efflux of glycine betaine suggests that a significant fraction of the proteoliposomes that has accumulated glycine betaine (via right-side-in-oriented OpuA) does not have inside-out OpuA to expel the substrate. ATP/Substrate Stoichiometry Determination—ATP/substrate stoichiometries can be obtained from comparisons of the rates and extent of ATP hydrolysis and glycine betaine uptake or efflux. In Fig. 4, we show the results of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4A) and glycine betaine uptake measurements (Fig. 4B), performed on proteoliposomes of different average diameter and made by extrusion through polycarbonate filters of 400-, 200-, and 100-nm pore size in the presence of 9 mm ATP/Mg2+. We used proteoliposomes of different size with the anticipation that the internal volume may present a limitation on the amount of ATP that can be included, thereby limiting the amount of glycine betaine that can be taken up. Indeed, the amount of ATP in the vesicles decreased with the pore size of the filters through which the proteoliposomes were extruded. Moreover, the ratio of ATP hydrolysis and glycine betaine uptake, that is, the ATP/substrate stoichiometry, tended to be higher in proteoliposomes of smaller diameter and volume (Fig. 4C). In these proteoliposomes with a smaller volume to surface ratio, the concentration of ATP will decrease faster as a result of ATP-dependent translocation. An alternative method for stoichiometry determination, not limited by a decrease in ATP or accumulation of ADP, involves measurement of external ATP hydrolysis and efflux of glycine betaine. In this experiment, the concentration of external ATP was kept constant (∼9 mm), and the ATP hydrolysis by inside-out-oriented OpuA was determined from the appearance of inorganic phosphate. This more sensitive detection method for measurement of phosphate, liberated as a function of ATP hydrolysis, required phosphate-free buffers. A series of control experiments, measuring OpuA activity in phosphate-free buffer, showed no significant differences in terms of activity, ATP hydrolysis coupled to glycine betaine transport, or ionic activation (data not shown). There was no detectable hydrolysis of ATP when glycine betaine was not present in the vesicle lumen or when the translocator was not osmotically activated. In Fig. 5, we show the phosphate release (Fig. 5A) and glycine betaine efflux (Fig. 5B) from proteoliposomes extruded through polycarbonate filters of 400-, 200-, and 100-nm pore size. The ratio of both measurements is presented in Fig. 5C and shows that the ATP hydrolysis/glycine betaine transport stoichiometry is approximately 2 and is now independent of the vesicle diameter and volume. The data presented in Fig. 5C (and Fig. 4C) represent the average of three independent experiments, carried out with three independent protein preparations/membrane reconstitutions. In this report, we have addressed the issues of substrate translocation inhibition and ATP/substrate stoichiometry for the osmoregulated ABC transporter OpuA. The inhibition of substrate translocation is of importance for the control of glycine betaine levels, the major osmoprotectant in L. lactis. OpuA accumulates compatible solutes such as glycine betaine to submolar intracellular concentrations (7Heide van der T. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Heide van der T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, thermodynamically, the hydrolysis of 1 or 2 ATP molecules per molecule of substrate transported would be sufficient to allow more than a 108-fold concentration of substrate, corresponding to unrealistically high cytoplasmic concentrations. The discrepancy between the theoretical and observed levels of substrate translocation can be explained by inhibition of the transport process. One possible mechanism involves blockage of the transporter by previously accumulated substrate. Studies on glucose transporters, a neutral amino acid transporter, and a transport system for leptin have shown that the corresponding transporters are inhibited by trans-substrate with apparent inhibition constants in the submolar range (29Klip A. Tsakiridis T. Marette A. Ortiz P.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Maresh G.A. Maness L.M. Zadina J.E. Kastin A.J.

Physiol. 1989; 141: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Trans-inhibition by substrate has also been observed for glycine betaine uptake in the closely related transport systems from L. plantarum and L. monocytogenes (27Glaasker E. Heuberger E.H.M.L. Konings W.N. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5540-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Verheul A. Glaasker E. Poolman B. Abee T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6979-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings here clearly eliminate trans-inhibition as a mechanism that limits substrate uptake. Glycine betaine present at submolar concentrations at the cytoplasmic face of OpuA has no effect on the transport activity. Data presented here suggest that accumulation of ADP plays a significant role in the inhibition of substrate translocation, at least in proteoliposomes. Whether ADP or the ATP/ADP ratio plays a role in the osmotic regulation of the glycine betaine pools in vivo remains to be established. We favor the hypothesis that cytoplasmic ionic strength is the main determinant of OpuA activity, which controls the glycine betaine accumulation levels (9Heide van der T. Stuart M.C. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7022-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To date, there is no consensus on the ATP/substrate stoichiometry for members of the ABC transport family. Quite the opposite is true, with variations in stoichiometries ranging from 1 to 50 even when measured on the same ABC transporter (10Ambudkar S.V. Cardelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Are the values determined representative or real variations of stoichiometries within the members of the ABC transporter family? Among the members of the ABC superfamily, there are differences in the number and location of substrate binding sites, and variations in the number of ATP binding sites are possible; therefore, one cannot rule out the possibility that different members of the ABC superfamily have different ATP/substrate stoichiometries. However, given the likelihood of conservation of biochemical mechanisms, it is likely that the large variations in stoichiometry are due to experimental artifacts. We have explored possible sources of experimental error in previous estimates of ATP/substrate stoichiometries for ABC transporters. An early work compared the growth yields of bacteria on different sugars under anaerobic conditions, and this suggested that only one ATP was expended per maltose or maltodextrin transported (18Muir M. Williams L. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1237-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disadvantage of this in vivo approach relates to the multiple biological processes that are difficult to monitor and control. Another potential error relates to poor coupling of ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation. ATP hydrolysis without translocation of substrate will result in increased stoichiometries. One can correct for poor coupling by subtracting the value for ATP hydrolysis in the absence of substrate from the measured value in the presence of substrate, but this could lead to an underestimation of the ATP/substrate stoichiometry. The futile hydrolysis of ATP in the absence and presence of substrate is not necessarily the same. Most likely, the futile hydrolysis of ATP is diminished in the presence of substrate because the formation of a ternary enzyme·ATP·substrate complex will lower the fraction of the binary enzyme·ATP complex and thus lower the futile hydrolysis of ATP. Poor coupling in P-glycoprotein resulted in findings of 50 ATP/molecule of Hoechst 33342 due to both a high basal rate of ATP hydrolysis and futile cycling of Hoechst 33342 between the lipid and aqueous phase (20Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis with and without substrate was reported in uptake studies on the histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium, and the stoichiometry of 5 was attributed to poor coupling of ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation (17Bishop L. Agbayani Jr., R. Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For the maltose transport system from E. coli, ATP/substrate stoichiometries up to 17 were attributed to differences in protein subunit association, due to subtle variations in the preparation of proteoliposomes, that lead to increased futile cycling of the ATPase (12Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4254-4260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the substrate poses additional problems in the reported stoichiometry measurements. A hydrophobic substrate leaks out of a vesicle relatively easily, resulting in inflated stoichiometries. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the P-glycoprotein substrates has been shown to result in high non-specific binding to the membrane of proteoliposomes, leading to underestimation of the ATP/substrate stoichiometry (16Mimmack M.L. Gallagher M.P. Pearce S.R. Hyde S.C. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8257-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this work, we could avoid the above errors by taking advantage of the exceptional coupling of ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation in the OpuA system (substrate and osmotic activation are necessary for ATP hydrolysis) and the absence of glycine betaine leakage on the time scale of the measurements. We strongly feel that membrane-reconstituted OpuA with its high, regulatable, and reproducible activity currently provides the best ABC system to assess ATP/substrate stoichiometry measurements. In our initial stoichiometry measurements performed with right-side-out-oriented OpuA, we observed variations in stoichiometries in different batches of proteoliposome that were beyond our control. By sizing the proteoliposomes through 400-, 200-, and 100-nm polycarbonate filters, we could demonstrate a systematic increase in stoichiometry with decreasing size of the proteoliposomes. Measurement of stoichiometries on the population of inside-out-oriented OpuA proved that the size of the proteoliposome does not affect the stoichiometry. In each sample, we observed an ATP/substrate stoichiometry of approximately 2 with no deviation with respect to proteoliposome size. With right-side-out OpuA, the ATP/substrate stoichiometry was determined from the decrease in luminal ATP levels, and the ATP concentration (and ATP/ADP ratio) decreased significantly in the course of the experiment. With inside-outoriented OpuA, the ATP is present on the outside and could be kept constant at ∼9 mm, and this apparently ensures a better coupling than when the ATP and the ADP concentrations vary. Although the internal glycine betaine decreased in the efflux assays, the concentration always stayed 3 orders of magnitude above the K d for glycine betaine binding (K d is <1 μm). At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that the higher curvature of the smaller proteoliposomes affect the coupling of right-side-in-oriented OpuA, resulting in the somewhat higher stoichiometry values. Recent studies on P-glycoprotein are consistent with a mechanism of two ATPs/substrate translocated. Eytan et al. (13Eytan G.D. Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3172-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have analyzed the transport of an ATP-driven, valinomycin-dependent, 86Rb+-ionophore complex in proteoliposomes, which circumvented the problems posed by the hydrophobicity of most P-glycoprotein substrates. They simultaneously measured the ATPase and transport activities of P-glycoprotein under identical conditions and observed 1.3–2.0 ATP/ionophore molecule transported. Sauna and Ambudkar (14Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), exploiting the vanadate-induced transition state conformation of P-glycoprotein, measured the effects of ATP binding and hydrolysis on substrate binding affinity. On the basis of these and previous studies, it was concluded that two ATP hydrolysis events occur in a single catalytic cycle, one for substrate translocation and one for resetting the protein for the next catalytic cycle (14Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). They suggest a catalytic cycle with the translocation of one substrate leading to an ATP/substrate stoichiometry of 2. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that 2 molecules of substrate are translocated per catalytic cycle. Our finding of a stoichiometry of two ATPs/substrate stoichiometry reported here will aid the formulation of a kinetic mechanism for the function of the OpuA transporter and is most likely relevant for ABC transporters in general. A simple mechanism may involve binding of glycine betaine to the substrate binding domains followed by a two-step binding of ATP to the ATPase subunits. One ATP may be hydrolyzed to interconvert the OpuA from the cis to trans conformation, allowing the substrate to be released at the cytoplasmic face. The second ATP may be used to reset the system, that is, to convert OpuA from the trans to cis state, resulting in completion of the translocation cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1973066430,"Loss of tight association between epidermis and dermis underlies several blistering disorders and is frequently caused by impaired function of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Here we describe a new protein in mouse, Fras1, that is specifically detected in a linear fashion underlying the epidermis and the basal surface of other epithelia in embryos. Loss of Fras1 function results in the formation of subepidermal hemorrhagic blisters as well as unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis during mouse embryogenesis. Postnatally, homozygous Fras1 mutants have fusion of the eyelids and digits and unilateral renal agenesis or dysplasia. The defects observed in Fras1-/- mice phenocopy those of the existing bl (blebbed) mouse mutants, which have been considered a model for the human genetic disorder Fraser syndrome. We show that bl/bl homozygous embryos are devoid of Fras1 protein, consistent with the finding that Fras1 is mutated in these mice. In sum, our data suggest that perturbations in the composition of the extracellular space underlying epithelia could account for the onset of the blebbed phenotype in mouse and Fraser syndrome manifestation in human."
https://openalex.org/W2098510636,"Chemokine-driven migration is accompanied by polarization of the cell body and of the intracellular signaling machinery. The extent to which chemokine receptors polarize during chemotaxis is currently unclear. To analyze the distribution of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 during SDF-1 (CXCL12)-induced chemotaxis, we retrovirally expressed a CXCR4-GFP fusion protein in the CXCR4-deficient human hematopoietic progenitor cell line KG1a. This KG1a CXCR4-GFP cell line showed full restoration of SDF-1 responsiveness in assays detecting activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, actin polymerization, adhesion to endothelium under conditions of physiological flow, and (transendothelial) chemotaxis. When adhered to cytokine-activated endothelium in the absence of SDF-1, CXCR4 did not localize to the leading edge of the cell but was uniformly distributed over the plasma membrane. In contrast, when SDF-1 was immobilized on cytokine-activated endothelium, the CXCR4-GFP receptors that were present on the cell surface markedly redistributed to the leading edge of migrating cells. In addition, CXCR4-GFP co-localized with lipid rafts in the leading edge of SDF-1-stimulated cells, at the sites of contact with the endothelial surface. Inhibition of lipid raft formation prevents SDF-1-dependent migration, internalization of CXCR4, and polarization to the leading edge of CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 surface expression and signaling requires lipid rafts. These data show that SDF-1, immobilized on activated human endothelium, induces polarization of CXCR4 to the leading edge of migrating cells, revealing co-operativity between chemokine and substrate in the control of cell migration.

Recent studies on interactions between peripheral blood leukocytes and vascular endothelium have provided much insight into the molecular details of chemokine-induced cell trafficking from the circulation to the tissues (1Springer T.A.

Although much is known about the migration of granulocytes and T cells, the factors that control the transendothelial migration of primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells, i.e. CD34+ cells, are still poorly understood. In the process of homing, transplanted CD34+ cells migrate from the peripheral blood across the endothelium back to their niche in the bone marrow. Stromal cell-derived factor-1α (CXCL12) is the major chemokine involved in the homing of primary human CD34+ cells but is also a chemoattractant for other leukocytes, such as monocytes and B and T lymphocytes (3Aiuti A.

It has been shown that SDF-1 stimulates integrin-mediated arrest of CD34+ cells and also of T lymphocytes on vascular endothelium under flow, and that SDF-1 is constitutively expressed on human bone marrow endothelium (2Cinamon G.

Thus, the interplay between SDF-1, presented on the bone marrow endothelium, and adhesion molecules on the CD34+ cells represents the main driving force for the homing process.Although directional migration of leukocytes is accompanied by polarization of the cell body and of the actin cytoskeleton, redistribution of chemokine receptors has been the subject of contradictory reports.

Recent evidence indicates that differential distribution of Gβγ-subunits leads to amplification of the chemokine receptor signaling (11Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Other chemokine receptors, such as the formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine receptor on neutrophils and CCR2 and CCR5 on T lymphocytes, are distributed to the leading edge upon exposure to their corresponding chemokines (12McKay D.A.

In addition, it has been reported that SDF-1 can bind to fibronectin and subsequently induces a polarized distribution of CXCR4 on adherent T lymphocytes (15Pelletier A.J. van der Laan L.J. Hildbrand P. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Dawson P.E. Torbett B.E. Salomon D.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 2682-2690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies were all performed with artificial substrates, and to our knowledge it is unclear whether leukocytes that adhere to activated endothelial cells redistribute chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4, over their surface to drive directional migration. In addition, there is no information on the distribution and localization of CXCR4 in human hematopoietic progenitor cells.To study SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling and the distribution of CXCR4 during the interaction of human hematopoietic progenitor cells with human bone marrow endothelium in more detail, we generated a CXCR4-GFP fusion construct and retrovirally expressed the protein into the CXCR4-deficient CD34+ progenitor cell model KG1a. The CXCR4-GFP protein was functionally expressed at the cell surface and mediated SDF-1-dependent actin polymerization, ERK1/2 activation, adhesion to endothelium under flow, and directional migration. By using this cell model, we found that SDF-1, immobilized on activated human bone marrow endothelium to mimic the in vivo situation, induced formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles and a marked redistribution of surface-expressed CXCR4 to the leading edge of the cell. In addition, CXCR4 co-localized with lipid rafts at the leading edge, at the sites of contact with the endothelial apical surface. In conclusion, these findings suggest that SDF-1, when presented by the endothelium, induces CXCR4 polarization during directional and transendothelial migration of human hematopoietic progenitor cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ); calcein-acetoxymethyl, Texas Red phalloidin, membrane-dye DiI, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)-Alexa 594, Alexa 488/568-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig, and Alexa 488/568-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibodies (Abs) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands).

CXCR4 expression on the cell surface was detected with PE-labeled anti-human CXCR4; for CLSM imaging, unlabeled anti-human CXCR4 mAb (both 12G5) from Pharmingen was used when indicated. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) was from Sigma. ICAM-3 mAb conjugated to PE was obtained from Beckman Coulter (Mijdrecht, The Netherlands).Isolation of CD34 + Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells—Cord blood was collected after delivery, according to the guidelines of Eurocord (Leiden, The Netherlands). Cord blood CD34+ cells were isolated with the VarioMacs system (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Gladbach, Germany) as described (4Voermans C. Gerritsen W.R. von dem Borne A.E.G.Kr. van der Schoot C.E. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1806-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At least 95% of the cells from cord blood expressed CD34 as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter with CD34 mAb (number 581, Beckman Coulter).Cell Cultures—The human bone marrow endothelial cell line-60 (HBMEC) has been described previously (16Rood P.M. Calafat J. von dem Borne A.E.G.Kr. Gerritsen W.R. van der Schoot C.E. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 30: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in FN-coated culture flasks (NUNC, Invitrogen) in Medium 199 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) pooled, heat-inactivated human serum, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 units/ml heparin, 300 μg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After reaching confluency, the endothelial cells were passaged by treatment with trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen). In all experiments, HBMEC monolayers were pretreated with TNF-α for 4 h. HL60 and KG1a cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (BioWhittaker, Brussels, Belgium) containing l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °Cat5%CO2. All experiments were performed in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA), hereafter termed assay medium.Construction of the CXCR4-GFP—The full-length cDNA encoding CXCR4 was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, operated by McKesson Bioservices (Rockville, MD). The CXCR4 cDNA was subcloned as an EcoRI-ApaI fragment into the N2pEGFP vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The insert was then cloned into the EcoRI-NotI sites of the modified vector LZRS-IRES-Zeocin (17Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The resulting construct, LZRS-CXCR4-GFP-IRES-Zeocin, was transfected into amphotropic Phoenix packaging cells (18Riviere C. Subra F. Cohen-Solal K. Cordette-Lagarde V. Letestu R. Auclair C. Vainchenker W. Louache F. Blood. 1999; 93: 1511-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by means of the calcium-phosphate transfection system (Invitrogen) to produce retroviruses. KG1a cells were transduced with virus-containing supernatant in the presence of 10 μg/ml N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Roche Applied Science) and were centrifuged twice at 2000 rpm for 30 min. After 6 h, the supernatant was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were allowed to recover overnight. This procedure was repeated twice on 2 consecutive days. Transduced cells were sorted for GFP expression by FACStar (BD Biosciences).Transmigration Assay—Transmigration assays were performed in 6.5-mm, 5-μm pore Transwell plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). HBMEC were plated at 50,000 cells/Transwell on FN-coated filters. Non-adherent cells were removed after 18 h. HBMEC were cultured to confluency and stimulated overnight with TNF-α (10 ng/ml). Freshly isolated CD34+ cells or cell line cells (100,000) were added to the upper compartment, and the assay was performed as described previously (19Van Buul J.D. Voermans C. Van den Berg V. Anthony E.C. Mul F.P. van Wetering S van der Schoot C.E. Hordijk P.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After the assays, the filters were fixed and stained with Texas Red-phalloidin to confirm the integrity of the HBMEC monolayer by CLSM.Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with Abs or DiI as indicated in figure legends, followed by staining with fluorescently labeled secondary Abs (10 μg/ml) when necessary. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 when indicated. F-actin was visualized with Texas Red-phalloidin (1 unit/ml). Images were recorded with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) with appropriate filter settings. Cross-talk between the green and red channel was avoided by the use of sequential scanning. Time-lapse microscopy was performed at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled incubation chamber. FN-coated glass coverslips or confluent endothelial monolayers cultured on FN-coated glass coverslips and stimulated overnight with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) were used. FN or endothelium was preincubated for 30 min with 100 ng/ml SDF-1 at 37 °C, and medium was refreshed at the start of the experiments, as described previously (2Cinamon G. Shinder V. Alon R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 8Peled A. Kollet O. Ponomaryov T. Petit I. Franitza S. Grabovsky V. Slav M.M. Nagler A. Lider O. Alon R. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Blood. 2000; 95: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDF-1 presence on endothelium was checked by CLSM with anti-SDF-1 polyclonal Ab (PeproTech). 200,000 KG1a wild type (wt) or KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells were added to the incubation chamber, and cell migration was recorded for at least 30 min. Imaging interval between recordings was ∼10 s.Quantification of CXCR4 Polarization—Cells were incubated on activated endothelium, which was coated or not with SDF-1, for 30 min at 37 °C. Then cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with ICAM-3-PE mAbs. ICAM-3 was used to determine the back end in polarized cells, and four different microscopic fields per glass coverslip were counted. By determine the back end with ICAM-3 expression and the leading edge with CXCR4-GFP expression, the amount of polarized CXCR4-GFP cells was quantitated.CXCR4 Internalization—Following the indicated preincubations, the cells were fixed and not permeabilized, subsequently washed and kept in PBS containing 0.25% BSA and 1 mm calcium with CXCR4-PE Ab (1:4) for 30 min at 4 °C, and then washed with a 30-fold excess of ice-cold PBS with 0.25% BSA. The relative fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences).Adhesion of Cells under Flow—Perfusions under steady flow (0.4 dynes/cm2) were performed in a modified version of a transparent parallel plate perfusion chamber as described previously by Ulfman et al. (20Ulfman L.H. Kuijper P.H. van der Linden J.A. Lammers J.W. Zwaginga J.J. Koenderman L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar). The endothelial monolayer was cultured to confluency on a gelatin-coated glass coverslip. Monolayers were pretreated overnight with TNF-α (10 ng/ml). Additional incubation with SDF-1 (100 ng/ml) was done at 37 °C for 30 min. Migration medium with 2 × 106 KG1a wt or KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells/ml was perfused. After 5 min, the chamber was flushed with migration medium to wash out all non-adhered cells, and thereafter at least 20 areas of the perfusion surface were analyzed with the image analysis software Optimas 6.1 (Media Cybernetics Systems, Silver Spring, MD). Adhesion of CD-treated cells to TNF-α-treated endothelium was determined under static conditions, after three washing steps with migration medium and by counting the adhered cells per field of view, and 4 fields of view were analyzed per experiment.Actin Polymerization Assay—Cells were washed three times in assay medium and resuspended in a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Prior to the experiment, the cells and SDF-1 were incubated separately at 37 °C for 10 min. SDF-1 (100 ng/ml) was added to the cell suspension, and at indicated time points 100 μl of cell solution was transferred to 100 μl of fixation solution (Intraprep Permeabilization Reagent, Beckman Coulter). Cells were incubated in the fixation solution for at least 15 min. Thereafter, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μlof permeabilization reagent (Intraprep Permeabilization Reagent). After 5 min, 1 unit/ml Texas Red-phalloidin was added to visualize the F-actin. After 20 min the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS with 0.25% BSA. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured by FACScan. The distribution of F-actin was analyzed on cytospins of 50,000 cells. Images were analyzed by CLSM.Statistics—Student's t test for paired samples (two-tailed) was used for statistical analysis. Student's t test for independent samples was used where indicated.RESULTSTo gain insight in the dynamics and distribution of the receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4, during hematopoietic progenitor cell-endothelium interactions, we generated a cell line that stably expressed a CXCR4-GFP fusion protein. For this approach we used the human hematopoietic progenitor cell line KG1a, which lacks endogenous expression of CXCR4 but does express the progenitor cell marker CD34 (21Möhle R. Bautz F. Rafii S. Moore M.A.S. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 872: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of cells transduced with the CXCR4-GFP encoding retrovirus confirmed stable expression of the CXCR4-GFP protein in the KG1a cells (Fig. 1A). CLSM revealed that the CXCR4-GFP was localized both at the plasma membrane and in sub-membranous vesicles (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the CXCR4-GFP fusion protein was recognized by monoclonal antibodies against CXCR4. Moreover, SDF-1 induced rapid internalization of CXCR4-GFP (Fig. 1C).Chemokine-induced intracellular signaling via G-protein-coupled receptors, including CXCR4, has been studied extensively (9Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 22Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To confirm that the transduced CXCR4-GFP fusion protein was functional in mediating intracellular signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 following SDF-1 stimulation (23Tilton B. Ho L. Oberlin E. Loetscher P. Baleux F. Clark-Lewis I. Thelen M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We observed rapid maximal phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells after 1 min of SDF-1 treatment (Fig. 2). Medium changes did not induce increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in either cell type, whereas fetal calf serum, used as a positive control, induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the KG1a wt cells as well as in the KG1a CXCR4-GFP-transduced cells (data not shown). p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was observed in KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells after 15–30 min of SDF-1 stimulation, whereas the wt cells did not show p38 phosphorylation upon SDF-1 stimulation (data not shown). These findings indicate that the transduced fusion protein is capable of inducing intracellular signaling toward ERK1/2 and p38.Fig. 2SDF-1 induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2. KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells were serum-starved overnight and subsequently exposed to 100 ng/ml SDF-1 for the indicated times. Western blot analysis shows phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK) at 1–2 min in KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells, whereas the KG1a wt cells did not induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon SDF-1 exposure. Addition of medium alone did not influence the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both cell types. Lower blots for total ERK2 confirm equal protein loading. Results are representative for two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chemokine-induced directional migration is accompanied by localized actin polymerization, mainly at the leading edge of the cell, to induce lamellipodial protrusions and to drive directional migration (24Voermans C.

Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells showed a rapid and significant actin polymerization upon exposure to SDF-1, whereas the KG1a wt cells did not (Fig. 3A). The kinetics and extent of SDF-1-induced actin polymerization in the KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells were similar as in primary human CD34+ cells (24Voermans C. Anthony E.C. Mul E. van der Schoot E. Hordijk P. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 1456-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CLSM analysis confirmed these results (Fig. 3B) and underscored the observation that only the CXCR4-GFP-positive cells responded to SDF-1 by polymerizing and polarizing their actin cytoskeleton. The above data show that transduction of CXCR4 is sufficient to restore SDF-1-responsiveness in these cells.Fig. 3SDF-1 induces rapid actin polymerization in KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells. A, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1 and immediately fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa-488-labeled phalloidin and analyzed by flow cytometry. SDF-1 induced a significant and rapid (after 15 and 30 s) increase in F-actin in KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells (♦) but not in KG1a wt cells (▴). Untreated KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells are indicated by ▪. Data are mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. *, p < 0.01. B, following the actin polymerization assay, cytospins were prepared from the fixed KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells and analyzed by CLSM. CXCR4-GFP is shown in a and c and F-actin in b and d. Exposure of SDF-1 for 15 s induced a rapid polarization of F-actin (c and d). a and b show KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells without SDF-1. CLSM analysis revealed that SDF-1-induced actin polymerization and polarization only occurred in CXCR4-GFP-positive cells, indicated by the asterisks.

Analysis of CXCR4-GFP redistribution on immobilized SDF-1 on fibronectin-coated surfaces showed polarization of CXCR4-GFP (Fig. 4A). Labeling of the cells with the membrane probe DiI showed that the polarization of CXCR4-GFP is not simply due to accumulation of plasma membrane, because large parts of the cell that stained strongly positive for DiI were negative for CXCR4-GFP (Fig. 4B). Thus, SDF-1, immobilized on fibronectin, induces redistribution of CXCR4 at the plasma membrane.Fig. 4SDF-1-induced redistribution of CXCR4-GFP. A, CLSM analysis of KG1a CXCR4-GFP on a FN-coated glass coverslip showed diffuse staining of CXCR4-GFP on the cell membrane of resting cells (control, a). Preincubation for 30 min of the FN surface with 100 ng/ml SDF-1 induced a marked CXCR4-GFP redistribution (SDF-1, b). a and b, bar, 30 μm. Right panels show magnification of KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells, exposed to SDF-1, immobilized on FN (c, bar, 10 μm). B, KG1a CXCR4-GFP cells were incubated for 30 min on FN-coated glass coverslips (control, a–c) or on FN- and SDF-1-coated glass coverslips (SDF-1, d–f) and subsequently fixed and stained with lipid marker DiI to visualize the plasma membrane. Cell membrane labeling with DiI is shown in red (a and d), CXCR4-GFP in green (b and e), and co-localization appears in yellow (c and f). Bar, 10 μm.

https://openalex.org/W2069852588,"As many prokaryotic molybdoenzymes, the trimethylamine oxide reductase (TorA) of Escherichia coli requires the insertion of a bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum cofactor in its catalytic site to be active and translocated to the periplasm. We show in vitro that the purified apo form of TorA was activated weakly when an appropriate bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum source was provided, whereas addition of the TorD chaperone increased apoTorA activation up to 4-fold, allowing maturation of most of the apoprotein. We demonstrate that TorD alone is sufficient for the efficient activation of apoTorA by performing a minimal in vitro assay containing only the components for the cofactor synthesis, apoTorA and TorD. Interestingly, incubation of apoTorA with TorD before cofactor addition led to a significant increase of apoTorA activation, suggesting that TorD acts on apoTorA before cofactor insertion. This result is consistent with the fact that TorD binds to apoTorA and probably modifies its conformation in the absence of cofactor. Therefore, we propose that TorD is involved in the first step of TorA maturation to make it competent to receive the cofactor.

The molybdenum cofactor is a ubiquitous molecule associated with a wide range of redox enzymes and is found in most organisms from bacteria to humans (1Hille R. Chem.

Except for nitrogenase, the metal in molybdoenzymes is coordinated to a pterin derivative called molybdopterin (MPT) 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, molybdopterin; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide; bis(MGD)Mo, bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum; TMAO, trimethylamine oxide; BMH, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane; BSA, bovine serum albumin. to form the MPT-Mo cofactor (3Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, the basic form of the molybdenum cofactor is generally modified by the attachment of a nucleotide moiety to the phosphate group of MPT-Mo. In many cases, the final step of the cofactor synthesis is the linkage of GMP to MPT-Mo, giving rise to molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD-Mo) (3Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, it is now clearly established that the conversion of MPT-Mo to MGD-Mo is catalyzed by the MobA protein and can occur in vitro in the presence of GTP and MgCl2, even in the absence of any apoenzyme (4Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

The determination of the crystal structure of several MGD-containing enzymes has revealed that the molybdenum atom is in fact coordinated to two MGD molecules, leading to the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor (6Schindelin H.

Among these families, the Me2SO reductase family is made up of bis(MGD)-Mo-containing enzymes that share a conserved overall tertiary structure (6Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V.

They are organized in four domains and form compact molecules with a deep funnel-like depression on one side where the bis(MGD)Mo is buried. The cofactor is associated to the protein by a single covalent linkage to a serine residue and a network of hydrogen bonds. The insertion of the molybdenum cofactor is a cytoplasmic event required for the translocation of periplasmic molybdoproteins. As with a variety of periplasmic redox enzymes, their leader sequence exhibits the twin arginine consensus motif (RRXFLK) specifically recognized by the twin arginine translocation system, exporting metalloenzymes through the membrane in a folded conformation (11Weiner J.H.

Consequently, in a molybdenum cofactor-deficient context, the apoenzymes remain in the cytoplasm of the bacteria where they can be subsequently degraded (13Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The related operons, torECAD and dorCDA (also called dmsCBA), were characterized in Shewanella and Rhodobacter species, respectively, and they encode E. coli TorC, TorA, and TorD homologous proteins (19Shaw A.L. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Mouncey N.J. Choudhary M. Kaplan S. J.

Biol. 1998; 284: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We showed previously that the TorD proteins from E. coli and Shewanella massilia bind specifically to their cognate TorA enzymes (22Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Tranier S. Mortier-Barrière I. Ilbert M. Birck C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Méjean V. Samama J.P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of TorD in E. coli leads to a significant decrease of the amount of TorA (22Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in Rhodobacter capsulatus the absence of DorD results in a complete loss of DorA (24Shaw A.L. Leimkuhler S. Klipp W. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, in an E. coli MGD-deficient strain, an excess of TorD limits the proteolytic degradation of the TorA cytoplasmic apo form (22Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All these results suggest that the proteins of the TorD/DorD family play the role of chaperones dedicated to molybdoenzymes of the Me2SO reductase family. However, they can act either passively by protecting the reductases against cytoplasmic proteases or more actively during the folding of the enzymes or even during the insertion of the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. The x-ray structure of TorD of S. massilia was recently solved (25Tranier S. Iobbi-Nivol C. Birck C. Ilbert M. Mortier-Barrière I. Méjean V. Samama J.P. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It reveals that the protein presents an all helical architecture organized in a globular domain showing no similarity with any known protein structures. Based on sequence homologies, proteins of the TorD/DorD family could share a similar all helical three-dimensional fold. This new protein fold lets us imagine that this protein family might play an original role during molybdoenzyme biosynthesis. Moreover, DmsD, an E. coli TorD homologue, was proposed to act as an escort protein targeting periplasmic molybdoenzymes to the twin arginine translocation machinery through its binding to their leader sequence (26Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This chaperone family could, therefore, possess a dual function in the maturation process of the enzyme and the targeting to the export machinery. In this study, using an in vitro approach we showed that TorD is required for the efficient maturation of the apo form of TorA and that it probably acts just before the bis(MGD)Mo cofactor insertion. We thus propose that TorD binds the apo form of TorA to favor a conformation of the apoenzyme that is competent for acquiring the cofactor. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains used in this study are MC4100 (araD139 Δ (lacIPOZYAargF) U169 rpsL thi), LCB436 (MC4100 Δ(torSTRCAD) Kmr) (27Gon S. Patte J.C. Dos Santos J.P. Méjean V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), LCB504 (MC4100 torC2::Ω Spcr Δdms Kmr) (28Gon S. Patte J.C. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5779-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), RK5208 (araD139 Δ (lacIPOZYA-argF) U169 rpsL gyrA mobA207::Mucts) (29Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and BL21(DE3) (F– ompT hsdS B (rB– mB–) dcm gal (DE3)) (Novagen). The strains were grown in Luria broth medium at 37 °C, except strain RK5208, which was grown at 30 °C. To maintain plasmid selection, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; kanamycin, 10 μg/ml. When necessary isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce gene expression. Constructions of Plasmids—To construct plasmid pTorA, allowing the synthesis of His6-tagged holoand apoTorA, the complete torAcoding sequence was amplified by PCR, performed with MC4100 chromosomal DNA as template, and primer TorAN, which corresponds to an XbaI site followed by the Shine-Dalgarno motif of torA and its 5′-coding sequence, and primer TorAC, which corresponds to a HindIII site followed by a sequence encoding a C-terminal His6 tag and the complementary sequence of the 3′ end of torA. The purified PCR product was digested by the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of expression vector pJF119EH (30Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene. 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was then introduced into strains LCB436 and RK5208. To construct plasmid pTorD, allowing the synthesis of His6-tagged TorD, the same cloning strategy was used except that one primer (TorDN310) corresponds to an XbaI site followed by a Shine-Dalgarno consensus motif and the torD 5′ sequence, and the other (TorDC310) corresponds to a HindIII site followed by a sequence encoding a Cterminal His6 tag and the complementary sequence of the 3′ end of torD. The digested and purified PCR product was cloned into the corresponding sites of vector pET28 (Novagen). The recombinant vector pTorD was introduced into strain BL21(DE3). All PCR products and fusion sites were confirmed by sequencing. Transformations were carried out according to the method of Chung and Miller (31Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—His6-tagged TorD was produced from strains BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pTorD. The recombinant strain was grown aerobically until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8 unit. Overproduction of the protein was then induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 4 h. TorD was purified from the soluble fraction after French press treatment of the cells in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) and two successive centrifugations (18,000 × g for 10 min and 120,000 × g for 90 min). The supernatant was equilibrated in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing NaCl (500 mm) and imidazole (5 mm) and loaded onto a HiTrap™-chelating Ni2+ column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a step gradient of imidazole ranging from 20 to 500 mm. TorD was recovered in the 150 mm imidazole fraction mainly in a monomeric form. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The purification of His6-tagged apoTorA was carried out from the soluble fraction of strain RK5208, harboring plasmid pTorA. Overproduction and purification of apoTorA were performed as described for TorD. Strain LCB436 containing plasmid pTorA, grown as described above, was used to produce the mature form of His6-tagged TorA (holoTorA). HoloTorA was purified from the periplasmic fraction of the cells prepared by the lysozyme-EDTA procedure (32Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The periplasm was then diluted in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing NaCl (500 mm) and imidazole (5 mm) and loaded onto a HiTrap™ chelating Ni2+ column to perform the purification as described for TorD. ApoTorA and holoTorA were eluted with 150 mm imidazole. For subsequent uses, apoTorA, holoTorA, and TorD were dialyzed against phosphate buffer 20 mm, pH 7. Purified MobA was a C-terminal His6-tagged recombinant protein kindly provided by the Giordano's group (Laboratoire de Chimie Bactérienne, CNRS). Preparation of Supernatant Fraction (SN504) of Strain LCB 504 — Cells of strain LCB504 grown anaerobically were harvested at late exponential phase, resuspended in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7), and disrupted by French press. The extract was centrifuged twice, and the soluble fraction obtained (SN504) was kept at a protein concentration of 40 mg/ml. All steps were performed at 4 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Release of MPT-Mo from mobA Soluble Fraction—Cells were grown anaerobically in presence of KNO3 (10 mm) to increase the amount of MPT-Mo (33Hasona A. Self W.T. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The supernatant fraction (40 mg/ml), obtained as described for SN504, was heated for 5 min at 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and centrifuged 10 min at 18,000 × g. Native Gel Experiments—ApoTorA (1.68 μm) and TorD (21 μm) in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7, final volume of the sample, 20 μl) were incubated together or separately for 90 min at 37 °C. Before loading the samples onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel, both samples were treated with 10 μl of either native sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue) or denaturing-reducing sample buffer (66% native sample buffer, 6% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1.7% β-mercaptoethanol). When indicated, the samples were heated at 70 °C for 5 min before loading. The migration patterns were revealed by Western blots using TorA or TorD antisera. Analytical Procedure—Purified proteins were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane, and the ECL+ Plus Western blotting System was used as recommended by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were measured by the technique of Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.L. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 93: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). TMAO reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 37 °C by following the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen at 600 nm coupled to the reduction of TMAO (35Silvestro A. Pommier J. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interaction Study by Biosensor Experiments—The surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore apparatus, Biosensor) was used to analyze the binding between TorD (M r 22,427) and apoTorA (M r 94,263). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. TorD in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, was immobilized on a sensor chip CM5 (BIAcore) through amine coupling. ApoTorA was diluted in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7) and injected over the test and control (no protein immobilized) surfaces at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Analysis of interactions was carried out by using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. Chemical Cross-linking Studies—These experiments were carried out by using 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH) as a cross-linker. Proteins (apoTorA, 1.6 μm; TorD, 28 μm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline with BMH (1 mm). The interactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot detection was performed with TorA antibodies. Activation of Purified ApoTorA—In the assays apoTorA (0.55 μm) was mixed with 100 μl of SN504 (40 mg/ml) and various concentration of TorD (from 0 to 2.1 μm), and phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7) was added to bring the total volume to 150 μl. All solutions were oxygendepleted. The mixture was incubated from 0 to 240 min at 37 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. To monitor the extent of activation, the TMAO reductase activity recovered in the samples was measured as a function of incubation time and was expressed as a percentage of the activity measured with holoTorA (0.55 μm). As a control, the same assays were performed using bovine serum albumin (BSA) (20 μm) either instead of TorD or in addition of TorD (2.1 μm). The experimental data that correspond to at least three assays for each point were fitted to exponential curves. As a control, the same assays were performed in the absence of either apoTorA or SN504, and no activity was detected. ApoTorA and TorD Preincubation Experiments—Three assays were performed. ApoTorA (3.3 μm, 25 μl) and TorD (12.5 μm, 2.5 μl) were mixed together and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C before the addition of SN504 (100 μl, 40 mg/ml) and phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7) to bring the final volume to 150 μl. As a control, the same assay was performed except that no TorD was added. In a last assay, apoTorA (3.3 μm, 25 μl) and TorD (1.25 μm, 25 μl) were incubated separately and pooled just before the addition of SN504. Activation was monitored as a function of time, as described above. Defined in Vitro Assays—The assays (150 μl) performed in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, contained apoTorA (0.55 μm), TorD (0 or 2.1 μm), and the bis(MGD)Mo source made up of MobA (0.06 μm), GTP (1 mm), and MgCl2 (1 mm) and 96 μl of a solution containing MPT-Mo released from heat denatured supernatant of mobA cells. All these compounds were added at the same time and kept under a nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C, and the extent of activation was measured as described above. As a control, assays containing all the compounds except either apoTorA, MobA, or MPT-Mo source were incubated in the same conditions as indicated above and led to no TMAO reductase activity. Purification of TorD and of the Holo and Apo Forms of TorA—To investigate the putative role of TorD during the maturation process of TorA, we produced and purified each protein as C-terminal His6-tagged recombinant proteins. The different forms of His6-tagged TMAO reductase were obtained from an expression plasmid harboring the coding sequence of tagged TorA. The plasmid was introduced either into a tor strain or into a mobA strain, allowing production of the mature holo form (active) or the immature apo form (non-active) of His6-tagged TorA, respectively. Tagged-holoTorA was purified from the periplasmic fraction of the tor mutant. The specific activity (65 μmol of TMAO reduced/min/mg) was close to that observed with untagged TorA, indicating that the addition of the His6 tag modifies neither the activity of the enzyme nor its maturation. ApoTorA, the inactive tagged protein devoid of bis(MGD)Mo, was synthesized in the mobA strain and was purified from the cytoplasm. The TorD protein was also produced as a His6-tagged recombinant protein. HoloTorA, apoTorA, and TorD were purified near to homogeneity, as checked by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE of the proteins (Fig. 1). TorD Interacts with ApoTorA—To characterize a possible binding between apoTorA and TorD, we studied the formation of an apoTorA-TorD complex using various complementary techniques. We first analyzed a potential interaction between the two proteins using a surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) technique, and for this purpose, the purified TorD protein was coupled to the dextran matrix of a sensor chip, and apoTorA was injected over it. The sensorgram obtained reflected the association and dissociation of two proteins, indicating that apoTorA directly interacts with TorD (Fig. 2A). The apoTorATorD interaction was also revealed by cross-linking experiments using BMH or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide as chemical ligands (Fig. 2B and data not shown). TorD and apoTorA alone or together were incubated with BMH, and the mixtures were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was then carried out with TorA antibodies. An additional band was detected in the track containing the two proteins, compared with those with TorD or apoTorA alone. The mobility of this band is consistent with the molecular mass of a TorD (22.5 kDa)-apoTorA (94 kDa) heterodimer complex (Fig. 2B). Another approach to confirm the interaction was to analyze the behavior of these proteins by loading an apoTorA-TorD mixture previously incubated at 37 °C onto a 10% polyacrylamide native gel. After electrophoresis under native conditions, the migration patterns were revealed by Western blot using antibodies specifically raised against each of the proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). When TorA-specific antibodies were used, a new band below that of apoTorA alone, appeared in the lane corresponding to the mixture of both proteins (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no additional band other than that corresponding to the migration pattern of TorD alone was revealed using TorD antibodies (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that the additional band corresponds either to a specific proteolysis of apoTorA mediated by TorD or to a new migrating form of apoTorA induced by TorD. To draw a distinction between the two possibilities, the samples were treated with a non-denaturing or a reducing-denaturing loading buffer and heated at 70 °C before being loaded on native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3, C and D). The fact that the band was still present after heating the sample in non-reducing buffer but disappeared in reducing conditions indicates that this band corresponds to a new fold of apoTorA stabilized by at least one disulfide bridge and discards the possibility of apoTorA proteolysis mediated by TorD. We suspect that the conformational change in apoTorA induced by TorD brings in vicinity two cysteine residues, allowing the formation of a disulfide bridge in some cases. Altogether, these results suggest that TorD not only interacts with apoTorA but also modifies the conformation of apoTorA. TorD Increases the Activation of ApoTorA in Vitro—The fact that TorD interacts with apoTorA and apparently induces apoTorA conformational change prompts us to study whether TorD contributes to the maturation of this enzyme and possibly to the bis(MGD)Mo insertion. Because apoTorA has no TMAO reductase activity but can be activated upon bis(MGD)Mo insertion, we measured apoTorA activation in the presence and in the absence of TorD. The bis(MGD)Mo source used in this experiment was the supernatant fraction of strain LCB504 (referred as SN504). This strain, mutated on both tor and dms operons is devoid of TMAO reductase activity and does not synthesize TorD. On the other hand, this strain produces a complete bis(MGD)Mo and can, thus, be used as a convenient cofactor source for the assay. ApoTorA (0.55 μm) was mixed with SN504 (100 μl, 40 mg/ml of proteins) under anaerobic conditions and incubated at 37 °C. The extent of apoTorA activation was determined by measuring the TMAO reductase activity generated in the sample as a function of the incubation time (Fig. 4A). In this assay, the amplitude value of the recovered activity reached about 20% of the activity of the same amount of holoTorA. Because the activity measured corresponds to the quantity of active enzyme obtained in the sample, we conclude that only one-fifth of apoTorA can be activated even after a long time of incubation. To check whether the amount of SN504 was or was not limiting in the assay, increasing it did not lead to a change in the recovered activity, whereas decreasing it led to a decrease in the level of apoTorA activation (data not shown). To assess a possible role of TorD in the TorA maturation process, increasing amounts of TorD were added to the assay defined above. As shown in Fig. 4A, the recovered TMAO reductase activity increased from 20 to 80% that of holoTorA when TorD concentration was raised from 0 to 2.1 μm. TorD concentration higher than 2.1 μm did not further increase the apoTorA activation (data not shown). In conclusion, in the absence of TorD, only a fraction of apoTorA could be activated in the assay, whereas the presence of TorD allowed the maturation of most of the apoprotein. The fact that TorD seems to facilitate the bis(MGD)Mo insertion into apoTorA strongly suggests that it plays an active role in the maturation process of the apoenzyme. To verify that TorD has a specific action toward apoTorA, it was substituted by the BSA. As expected, the apoTorA activation was not increased in the presence of a high concentration of BSA compared with that obtained in absence of TorD (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when both TorD and BSA were added together in the same assay, no decrease of apoTorA activation was observed compared with that measured with TorD alone (data not shown). These experiments show that the increase of apoTorA activation is specifically due to the presence of TorD in the assay. TorD Acts on ApoTorA before the Insertion of the Molybdenum Cofactor—So far we showed that TorD interacts with apoTorA, induces a conformational change of apoTorA, and greatly increases activation of the apoprotein in our in vitro assay. If the role of TorD is to modify the apoTorA conformation to allow a better cofactor insertion, preincubation of apoTorA with TorD before the addition of the cofactor source should lead to a better incorporation of bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. ApoTorA (0.55 μm, concentration in the final assay) was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C alone as well as with a limiting concentration of TorD (0.21 μm, concentration in the final assay) before SN504 was added, and then the extent of apoTorA activation was measured as a function of time. Interestingly, preincubation of the two proteins together before the addition of the bis(MGD)Mo source improves the maturation of apoTorA since the recovered activity was raised from 26 to 38% that of holoTorA (Fig. 4B). In a similar experiment, the increase of TorD concentration allowed the activation of apoTorA to reach about 80% of holoTorA activity but abolished the effect of the preincubation of both proteins, observed above (data not shown). In contrast, whatever the TorD concentration, preincubation of TorD with SN504 did not modify the apoTorA activation, and curves similar to that of Fig. 4A were obtained (data not shown). As a control, we also checked that the recovered activity was lower in the absence of TorD than in its presence (Fig. 4B). These results are in agreement with our previous experiments showing that TorD interacts with apoTorA even in the absence of the cofactor and supports the idea that TorD induces a conformational change of apoTorA, turning it into a competent state to receive the molybdenum cofactor. Maturation of apoTorA could, thus, involve an additional step before bis(MGD)Mo insertion. Active Role of TorD during the ApoTorA Maturation Process—In the reconstitution assays we used so far, the bis(MGD)Mo was provided by the supernatant fraction of strain LCB504. In this case, an indirect effect of TorD over one constituent of SN504, a passive role of TorD against proteases, or the involvement of another protein present in the extract could not be excluded. To check whether TorD does not need another partner to facilitate the apoTorA maturation, we performed a defined in vitro system. In this defined system the bis(MGD)Mo is synthesized directly in the sample from MPT-Mo, GTP, MgCl2, and the purified MobA protein, which catalyzes the conversion of MPT-Mo to bis(MGD)Mo cofactor. The MPT-Mo source was provided by a heated supernatant fraction of mobA strain (100 °C, 5 min). As observed in the experiments performed with SN504, when TorD (2.1 μm) was added to the defined system, the activation of apoTorA strongly increased compared with that obtained in the absence of the chaperone (Fig. 5). The amplitude value reached a maximum corresponding to 63% that of the activity of holoTorA after 4 h of incubation, whereas it corresponds to only 13% of holoTorA activity in the absence of TorD. The plateau value obtained in the presence of TorD is, thus, almost five times higher than that obtained in the absence of TorD. As a control, we verified by Western blot that the quantity of the TorA polypeptide in the samples was still the same in the presence or not of TorD (data not shown). The fact that the proteins of the supernatant fraction were previously denatured in our reconstitution system rules out the involvement of a protein different from TorD and MobA during the in vitro TorA maturation process and also excludes a passive role of TorD in apoTorA protection against proteases. Moreover, assuming that MobA is only involved in the biosynthesis of the bis(MGD)Mo, TorD alone is sufficient to allow an efficient maturation of apoTorA. The E. coli TorA protein is a TMAO reductase containing a bis(MGD)Mo cofactor in its catalytic site, and we showed in this study that TorD is the mate chaperone of TorA, allowing its efficient maturation. Indeed, the TMAO reductase activity that is recovered in vitro from immature apoTorA mixed with a source of molybdenum cofactor, increased as a function of TorD concentration. It reached an amplitude value corresponding to the activation of 63–80% of the apoTorA present in the assays, whereas only 13–20% of apoTorA was matured in the absence of TorD (Fig. 4A and 5). Because preincubation of apoTorA with TorD before the cofactor addition significantly increased the quantity of recovered TMAO reductase activity (Fig. 4B), we suggest that TorD acts in a first step onto apoTorA to favor insertion of the bis(MGD)-Mo cofactor (Fig. 6). This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that TorD binds to apoTorA in the absence of any other compound and probably modifies to some extent apoTorA conformation (Figs. 2 and 3). It would be interesting to define the TorD and apoTorA binding regions and to determine whether the conformational change induced by TorD is restricted or not to the region of the TorA catalytic site. To explain that only a small fraction of apoTorA was matured in the absence of TorD even after a long incubation time, we propose that a large fraction of apoTorA evolves to a stable non-activable conformation, whereas the remainder turns spontaneously into a competent form able to receive the molybdenum cofactor. In this line of thought, the presence of TorD could shift the equilibrium toward the competent state of apoTorA and, thus, allows the maturation of the majority of the apoenzyme (Fig. 6). However, our results do not exclude an additional role for TorD during or even after the cofactor insertion. Using a defined in vitro system, we observed that the efficient activation of apoTorA is obtained in the presence of only two functional proteins, TorD and MobA (Fig. 5). Although this latter is required for the conversion of MPT-Mo into bis(MGD)-Mo (5Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it remains possible that MobA plays some role during TorA maturation, for example by escorting the cofactor during its insertion into apoTorA. To clarify this point, it would be necessary to perform defined in vitro assays without MobA but unfortunately, pure bis(MGD)Mo is unstable, and MobA is always required for this kind of in vitro experiment (3Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the presence of E. coli-soluble proteins in the cofactor-containing extract does not significantly change the pattern of activation of apoTorA compared with the experiment carried out with the defined in vitro assays (Fig. 4A and 5). This observation indicates that, at least in vitro, no soluble protein can efficiently substitute for TorD during the maturation process of TorA. However, it was demonstrated that GroEL is required for the final insertion of the iron-molybdenum cofactor into the nitrogenase of Azotobacter vine-landii (36Ribbe M.W. Burgess B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5521-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that a general chaperone may also be involved in the maturation process of apoTorA should be considered. The TorD family is a large family of proteins (25Tranier S. Iobbi-Nivol C. Birck C. Ilbert M. Mortier-Barrière I. Méjean V. Samama J.P. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but except for TorD of E. coli, the putative role of these proteins in the maturation process of molybdoenzymes remains to be defined. Interestingly, disruption of the dorD gene, which encodes a TorD homologue in R. capsulatus, leads to the disappearance of the molybdoenzyme DorA (24Shaw A.L. Leimkuhler S. Klipp W. Hanson G.R. McEwan A.G. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This result points out a relationship between DorD and DorA and suggests that immature DorA is rapidly degraded unless DorD binds to it and allows maturation. It was recently shown that 73% of apoDorA can be activated in vitro after 7 h of incubation (5Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This experiment was carried out in the absence of DorD, and it would, thus, be interesting to test whether the presence of DorD will accelerate and/or increase the maturation of DorA. There is little evidence for the implication of chaperones in the maturation process of molybdoenzymes, and in addition to TorD, only two proteins, NarJ and XDHC, have been proposed to play such a role toward their cognate molybdoprotein. Although both proteins do not belong to the TorD family, NarJ was shown to act as a specific chaperone of the bis(MGD)Mo-containing subunit of the membranous nitrate reductase of E. coli, and XDHC was suspected to be involved in the maturation of MPT-Mo containing xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) of R. capsulatus (37Palmer T.

Because several homologues of these proteins are found in different organisms, we postulate that many molybdoenzymes need a mate chaperone during their maturation process to improve cofactor insertion.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has anabolic effects on proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts via diverse signal transduction systems. Because PGE2 increases the proportion of functional osteoblasts in fetal rat calvarial cell cultures, we investigated the regulation of BSP, as an osteoblastic marker, by PGE2. Treatment of rat osteosarcoma UMR 106 cells with 3 μm, 300 nm, and 30 nm PGE2 increased the steady state levels of BSP mRNA about 2.7-, 2.5-, and 2.4-fold after 12 h. From transient transfection assays, the constructs including the promoter sequence of nucleotides (nt) –116 to +60 (pLUC3) were found to enhance transcriptional activity 3.8- and 2.2-fold treated with 3 μm and 30 nm PGE2 for 12 h. 2-bp mutations were made in an inverted CCAAT box (between nt –50 and –46), a cAMP response element (CRE; between nt –75 and –68), a fibroblast growth factor 2 response element (FRE; nt –92 to –85), and a pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 motif (between nt –111 and –105) within pLUC3 and pLUC7 constructs. Transcriptional stimulation by PGE2 was almost completed abrogated in constructs that included 2-bp mutations in either the CRE and FRE. In gel shift analyses an increased binding of nuclear extract components to double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing CRE and FRE was observed following treatment with PGE2. These studies show that PGE2 induces BSP transcription in UMR 106 cells through juxtaposed CRE and FRE elements in the proximal promoter of the BSP gene.

Bone. 2001; 28: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Treatment of male, female, and overiectomized mice with PGE2 increases bone mass in vivo (14Opas E.E. Gentile M.A. Rossert J.A. de Crombrugghe B. Rodan G.A. Schmidt A. Bone. 2000; 26: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas PGE2 stimulates collagen and DNA synthesis and induces bone growth in calvarial organ (15Raisz L.G. Fall P.M.

However, PGE2 can either stimulate or inhibit cellular growth and differentiation of osteoblastic cells depending on PGE2 concentration (15Raisz L.G. Fall P.M.

Recent cloning of four subtypes of the PGE receptor has made it possible to analyze the PGE receptor subtypes (EP1–EP4) on osteoblasts (3Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y.

An EP1 agonist stimulated cell growth and inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas an EP4 agonist reduced cell growth and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells (23Suda M.

These studies indicate that osteoblasts express multiple subtypes of the PGE receptor and that each subtype is might be linked to different aspects of PGE2 action. Thus, activation of the EP4 receptor stimulates bone formation and prevents bone loss (24Yoshida K. Oida H. Kobayashi T. Maruyama T. Tanaka M. Katayama T. Yamaguchi K. Segi E. Tsuboyama T. Matsushita M. Ito K. Ito Y. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubo F. Ohchida S. Kondo K. Nakamura T. Narumiya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S.

Collectively, these results show that PGE2 has anabolic effects on bone formation.Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a highly sulfated, phosphorylated, and glycosylated protein that is characterized by its ability to bind to hydroxyapatite through polyglutamic acid sequences and to mediate cell attachment through an RGD sequence (26Oldberg Å.

A. 1993; 90: 8562-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) indicate a potential role for this protein in the initial mineralization of bone, dentin, and cementum. Recent studies have shown that BSP is also expressed by osteotropic cancers, suggesting that BSP might play a role in the pathogenesis of bone metastases (32Waltregny D. Bellahcène A. de Leval X.

Thus, regulation of the BSP gene appears to be important in the differentiation of osteoblasts, in bone matrix mineralization, and in tumor metastasis. The rat, human, and mouse BSP genes have been cloned and partially characterized (34Li J.J. Sodek J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Kerr J.M. Fisher L.W.

Our studies show that PGE2 increases transcription of the BSP gene through cAMP-dependent protein kinase, tyrosine kinase, and MAP kinase pathways and that the effects are mediated via CRE and FRE transcriptional elements in the proximal promoter of the rat BSP gene.EXPERIMRNTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, LipofectAMINE, penicillin and streptomycin, SuperScript one-step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq, and trypsin were obtained from Invitrogen.

The cells were first grown to confluence in 60-mm tissue culture dishes in α-MEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, then cultured in α-MEM without serum, and incubated with prostaglandin E2. RNA was isolated from triplicate cultures and analyzed for expression of BSP mRNA by RT-PCR and real time PCR as described below.RT-PCR and Real Time PCR—Following treatment total RNA was extracted from UMR 106 cells with guanidium thiocyanate at different times, as described previously (44Ogata Y. Niisato N. Furuyama S. Cheifetz S. Kim R.H. Sugiya H. Sodek J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and 1 μg was used as a template for one-step RT-PCR and cDNA synthesis. cDNA was prepared using random hexamer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H–. Conventional one-step RT-PCR was performed using a SuperScript one-step RT-PCR kit. The primers were synthesized on the basis of the reported rat cDNA sequences for BSP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Sequences of the primers used for PCR were as follow: BSP forward, 5′-CTGCTTTAATCTTGCTCTG-3′; BSP reverse, 5′-CCATCTCCATTTTCTTCC-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-CCATGTTTGTGATGGGTGTG-3′; and GAPDH reverse, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCT-3′. cDNA synthesis and predenaturation was performed for 1 cycle at 50 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min, and amplification was carried out for 30 (BSP and GAPDH) cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and final extension was 94 °C for 10 min in a 50-μl reaction mixture. After amplification, 10 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The expected size of the PCR products for BSP and GAPDH were 211 and 264 bp, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the following primer sets: BSP-R-T forward, 5′-TCCTCCTCTGAAACGGTTTCC-3′; BSP-R-T reverse, 5′-CGAACTATCGCCATCTCCATT-3′; GAPDH-R-T forward, 5′-AGATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTC-3′; and GAPDH-R-T reverse, 5′-ATTGAACTTGCCGTGGGTAG-3′ using the SYBR Green qPCR Kit in a DNA Engine Opticon 2 continuous fluorescence detection system (MJ Research Inc.). The expected size of the PCR products for BSP and GAPDH were 73 and 167 bp, respectively. The amplification reactions were performed in 20 μl of final volume containing 1× SYBR Green Master Mix, 0.25 μm primer mixture, and 10 ng of cDNA. To reduce variability between replicates, PCR premixes, which contain all of the reagents except for cDNA, were prepared and aliquoted into 0.2-ml thin wall strip tubes (MJ Research Inc.). The thermal cycling conditions were 40 cycles of the following protocol: 15 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 50 s of annealing at 64 °C, followed by 12 s of extension at 77 °C. Post-PCR melting curves confirmed the specificity of single-target amplification, and fold expression of BSP relative to GAPDH was determined in triplicate (50Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1372-1379PubMed Google Scholar).Transient Transfection Assays—Exponentially growing UMR 106 cells were used for transfection assays. 24 h after plating, the cells at 50∼70% confluence were transfected using a LipofectAMINE reagent. The transfection mixture included 1 μg of a luciferase (LUC) construct (45Ogata Y. Nakao S. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. Sodek J.

Two days post-transfection, the cells were deprived of serum for 12 h, and 3 μm or 30 nm PGE2 or 3 μm of the respective EP agonists were added for 12 h prior to harvesting. The luciferase assay was performed according to the supplier's protocol (picaGene; Toyo Inki) using a Luminescence reader BLR20 (Aloka) to measure the luciferase activity. The protein kinase inhibitorsH89 (5 μm) and H7 (5 μm) were used to inhibit protein kinase A and C. Herbimycin A (1 μm) and PP1 (10 μm) were used for tyrosine kinase and Src tyrosine kinase inhibition, respectively (42Shimizu-Sasaki E. Yamazaki M. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. Sodek J. Ogata Y. J. Biol.

Nuclear protein was extracted by the method of Dignam et al. (55Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9142) Google Scholar) with the addition of extra proteinase inhibitors (the extraction buffer was 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.9). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (56Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing the inverted CCAAT (nt –61 to –37, 5′-CCGTGACCGTGATTGGCTGCTGAGA), cAMP response element (CRE; nt –84 to –59, 5′-CCCACAGCCTGACGTCGCACCGGCCG), and FGF2 response element (FRE; nt –98 to –79, 5′-TTTTCTGGTGAGAACCCACA) in the BSP promoter were prepared by Bio-Synthesis, Inc., whereas consensus CRE (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG) was purchased from Promega. For gel shift analysis the double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear protein extracts (3 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature (21 °C) with 0.1 pm radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Following incubation, the protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels (38:2 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) run at 150 V at room temperature. For competition experiments unlabeled oligonucleotides for the CRE, mutation CRE (5′-CCCACAGCCcGACGcCGCACCGGCCG), FRE, and mutated FRE (5′-TTTTCTGGcaAGAACCCACA) were used at 20- and 40-fold molar excess. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and the autoradiograms were prepared and analyzed using an image analyzer. Supershift experiments were performed with 1–2 μl of antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against CRE-binding protein (CREB-1; sc-58), c-Jun (sc-44), c-Fos (sc-253), Pit-1 (sc-442), Oct-1 (sc-232), NFκB p65 (sc-109), NFκB p50 (sc-7178), and phospho-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; 06-519) separately to each gel shift reaction. The extracts were incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody before electrophoresis was performed under the same conditions as described above.[Ca2 + ] i Determination—Confluent cells were preincubated with 2 μm fura-2/acetoxymethylester in α-MEM for 30 min at 37 °C. After they were loaded with fura-2/acetoxymethylester, the cells were detached from tissue culture flasks with the trypsin-EDTA solution, washed twice, and suspended in fresh α-MEM. Just before [Ca2+]i determination, the cells were washed again and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 0.2% glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm CaCl2). The fluorescence of fura-2-loaded cells was measured with a CAF-110 spectrofluorometer (Nihon Bunkou, Tokyo, Japan) with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the measurement of the ratio of fluorescence intensities (57Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

All of the experiments were performed three times with different cell batches.Statistical Analysis—Triplicate samples were analyzed for each experiment, and the experiments were replicated to ensure consistency of the responses to PGE2. Significant differences between control and PGE2 treatment were determined using Student's t test.RESULTSStimulation of BSP mRNA Expression in UMR 106 Cells— BSP gene expression was investigated at 6 and 12 h after PGE2 stimulation by conventional (Fig. 1A) and real time PCR (Fig. 1B). When osteoblastic UMR 106 cells were exposed to 3 μm, 300 nm, and 30 nm PGE2, expression of BSP mRNA was increased 2.3-, 2.0-, and 2.2-fold at 6 h and 2.7-, 2.5-, and 2.4-fold at 12 h, respectively, as shown by conventional RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). To further confirm the PGE2 effects on BSP transactivation, we applied real time PCR to examine the mRNA expression level of BSP. As Fig. 1B shows, PGE2 (3 μm, 300 nm, and 30 nm) can induce the mRNA expression of BSP.Transient Transfection Analysis of Rat BSP Promoter Constructs—To determine the site of PGE2-regulated transcription in the 5′-flanking region of the BSP gene, various sized promoter constructs ligated to a luciferase reporter gene were transiently transfected into UMR 106 cells, and their transcriptional activity was determined in the presence of PGE2. With the construct pLUC3, encompassing BSP promoter nucleotides –116 to +60, transcription was increased 3.8-fold with 3 μm PGE2 and 2.2-fold with 30 nm PGE2 after 12 h of treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). PGE2 also increased transcription of pLUC4 (–425 to +60), pLUC5 (–801 to +60), pLUC6 (–938 to +60), and pLUC7 (–1149 to +60). In shorter constructs (pLUC1, –18 to +60; pLU"

In the bacterial membrane closed MS channels must maintain the cation impermeability of the membrane, which is an essential requirement for energy transduction. Open MS channels in Escherichia coli exhibit conductances of 0.3–3 nanosiemens (5Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), consistent with the formation of large pores in the membrane of at least an 11-Å diameter (1Bass R.B. Strop P.

Clearly MS channels must undergo large conformational changes in the protein structure during the transition from the closed to the open state. The recent crystal structures of the bacterial MS channels, MscL and MscS, have been achieved for the closed and open states, respectively (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C.

Model building, coupled with biochemical analysis of single cysteine mutants, has supported molecular dynamics-based analyses of the structural transitions that may open MscL (6Sukharev S.

However, the two proteins are so individual that there is little from the one structure that informs the possible mechanism of the other. The MscS protein has been much less intensively studied as a result of the relatively recent discovery of the structural gene (12Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses established that the protein has three transmembrane (TM) helices and a large carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by resolution to 3.8 Å of a crystal structure of the MscS channel that also showed the protein to be a homoheptamer (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The large cytoplasmic domain was demonstrated to form a 40-Å diameter chamber perforated by eight holes, seven of which arise at the boundary between pairs of monomers and the eighth from the formation of a β barrel by the carboxyl-terminal 15 residues. In the crystal structure the TM3 helix bends at Gly113, such that the carboxyl-terminal part of this helix lies parallel to the membrane surface. The loop between TM2 and TM3 (residues 91–95) forms an extended chain that is part of the wall of the open pore. Helices TM1 and TM2 are close packed to each other but are displaced away from TM3. It has been suggested that channel closure might be effected by closer packing of TM1 and TM2 with TM3 with propagation of this change through the TM2-TM3 loop into TM3 and the cytoplasmic domain (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that in the closed channel the transmembrane helices and residue 267 at the base of the carboxyl-terminal domain can be in close proximity to each other. These data support recent electrophysiological data suggesting that a rearrangement of the carboxyl-terminal domain is essential for channel gating (14Koprowski P. Kubalski A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11237-11245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). E. coli strains MJF455 (MscL–MscS–) and MJF465 (MscL–-MscS–MscK–) were used throughout for this analysis and have been described previously (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Plasmids pMscS and pMscSH6 were described previously (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Strains were grown routinely at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (LB) containing per liter: 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, and 5 g of yeast extract. Medium was supplemented with ampicillin (25 μg/ml) if required. Agar plates contained 1.4 g/liter agar. Analysis of survival after downshock was essentially as described previously (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Survival assays were performed in MJF465, and both induced and uninduced cell preparations were tested. The single Cys mutants were created using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol using the primers listed in Table I. Six single Ser to Cys mutants at residues 9, 26, 49, 58, 95, and 267 were created in pMscSH6. The mutant plasmids were verified by sequencing on both strands and were transformed into MJF465. Mutant S267C was also constructed in pMscS to eliminate potential interference in the analysis by the His tag.Table IPrimers designed for creation of single Cys mutantsMutationPrimersS9C5-gAATgTTgTggATTgCATAAACggCgCg-35-CgCgCCgTTTATgCAATCCACAACATTC-3S26C5-gCTAACCAggCACTgCTgCTATgTTATgCAg-35-CTgCATAACATAgCAgCAgTgCCTggTTAgC-3S49C5-CgCgCggATgATTTgCAACgCggTg-35-CACCgCgTTgCAAATCATCCgCgCg-3S58C5-CCTgATgATCTgCCgTAAAATTgATgCCACTg-35-CAgTggCATCAATTTTACggCAgATCATCAgg-3S95C5-gggTgTACAAACCgCATgCgTCATTgCTgTAC-35-gTACAgCAATgACgCATgCggTTTgTACACCC-3S267C5-gCCgCCggCATATgCTTCCCgTACC-35-ggTACgggAAgCATATgCCggCggC-3 Open table in a new tab Membranes harvested from transformants that had been induced for 30 min using 0.3 mm IPTG as described previously (13Miller S.

Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.12Google Scholar). Protein concentration in membrane preparations was assayed by the Folin-Ciocalteau method (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described previously using either anti-His6 antibodies (mouse IgG2a isotype) (Sigma) or peptide antibodies-specific for MscS (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Preformed SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) were used to separate the proteins prior to transfer onto nitrocellulose. Membrane preparations derived from cells expressing the S267C mutant (1.5 mg/ml membrane protein) were incubated with 31.25 μm oPDM for 15 min at 25 °C and the reaction stopped by the addition of DTT (5 mm final concentration). A sample was retained for Western blotting to verify that reaction with oPDM was as observed in earlier experiments. The treated membranes were harvested by centrifugation (50,000 rpm, Beckman TLA100.4 rotor, for 1 h at 4 °C) and the pellets weighed to calculate the total protein present. The pellets (∼0.2 g) were suspended in 5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 2% Triton X-100 (membrane grade, Roche Diagnostics). The membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and were shaken at intervals. The solubilized protein was centrifuged (50,000 rpm, Beckman TLA100.4 rotor, for 1 h at 4 °C) and the clear supernatant retained. In previous experiments it had been established that 2% Triton X-100 gave efficient solubilization (>95%) of MscS (data not shown). The supernatant was mixed with 0.25 ml nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), placed in Qiagen 1-ml polypropylene columns, and the columns were capped and placed on a rocking platform at room temperature for ∼16 h. The columns were then allowed to settle and the unbound protein collected. The column was then washed four times with 2.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10% ethanol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% membrane-grade Triton X-100. The buffer also contained 1 Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics) per 50 ml of solution. The membrane protein was eluted by addition of four 0.25 ml volumes of the above wash buffer amended to contain 0.3 m imidazole. Eluted protein fractions were treated to remove excess detergent prior to gel electrophoresis using the Pierce PAGEprep™ product following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were separated on Novex NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels run in MES buffer. Protein bands corresponding to the monomer through to the heptamer were excised from the SDS-PAGE gels and were reduced, S-alkylated, and in-gel-digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel piece, and an aliquot of the mixture was desalted using a GELoader tip containing POROS R2 sorbent (PerSeptive Biosystems). The peptides were then eluted onto a sample plate with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma, Poole, UK) in 70% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. Mass spectra were acquired with a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer operated in reflectron-delayed extraction mode. Spectra were calibrated with trypsin auto-digestion products and proteins identified by interrogation of protein databases using MASCOT and MS-Fit data base searching programs. All cross-linking protocols were based on published methods (17Wu J.H. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Struct. Fold.

Copper/Phenanthroline—Prewarmed (37 °C) membranes, containing 1.5 mg of membrane protein/ml, were treated with freshly prepared copper/phenanthroline reagent at 37 °C for 10 min. The final concentrations of Cu2+ and o-phenanthroline were 0.167 and 0.5 mm, respectively. The reagent was made by mixing equal volumes of freshly prepared 30 mm phenanthroline (dissolved in ethanol) and aqueous 10 mm CuSO4. This stock was diluted to give the appropriate concentrations of Cu2+ and o-phenanthroline (see above). Control incubations were performed with ethanol. Reactions were stopped by addition of NEM (10 mm final concentration). MTS-1-MTS—This reagent was dissolved in Me2SO to provide a 1 mm stock solution and was used at a final concentration of 100 μm. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h and quenched with NEM (as above). Controls contained an equivalent volume of Me2SO. o-Phenylenedimaleimide—oPDM was dissolved in Me2SO to provide a 250 mm stock solution, which was kept at room temperature in a foil-wrapped tube and was discarded after each experiment. The final concentration of oPDM was between 15 and 250 μm. Similar data were obtained at all concentrations of oPDM and 31.25 μm oPDM was adopted for routine analysis of cross-linking. Membranes (1.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated at either 4 or 25 °C for up to 1 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of DTT (5 mm final concentration). For cross-linking in whole cells, strains MJF465/pMscSH6 wild type and Cys mutant S267C were grown to mid-exponential phase (OD650 = 0.5) in minimal medium (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) containing 0.3 m NaCl with IPTG (0.3 mm) present for 30 min prior to addition of oPDM (100 μm final concentration). Cells were incubated for 20 min in oPDM and the reaction quenched with 5 mm DTT. For direct detection of MscS in whole cells, 15–25 μg of total cell protein (equivalent to 100–170 μl of cell suspension at OD650 = 0.6) in Laemmli loading buffer (19Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol were loaded onto a Novex NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel and run in MES buffer. Western blotting was carried out as described previously using anti-His6 antibodies. To prepare membranes from the oPDM-treated cells, approximately 17 ml of cell suspension (OD650 = 0.6) was harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, Jouan MR22i, 10 min, 4 °C) and suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed by French press (18,000 lb/inch2) and the membranes harvested by centrifugation as described previously (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Creation and Physiology of Single Cysteine Mutants of MscS—Single cysteine mutants were created in the 286-residue E. coli MscS protein, which is Cys-free, by replacing selected serine residues (Ser9, Ser26, Ser49, Ser58, Ser95, and Ser267). Residues Ser9 and Ser26 are not visible in the crystal structure, which starts at residue Tyr27. However, we can estimate the separation of S26C residues from the position of Tyr27. In adjacent subunits of the crystal structure, which is proposed to depict the open channel, the mutated residues are 10–33 Å apart (Fig. 1a). Both basal and induced expression of the mutant proteins protected the triple MS channel-deficient mutant (MJF465; mscL – mscK – mscS –) (12Levina N. Totemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) against downshock (Fig. 1b; data not shown for induced channels as this was found to be 100% in all cases). Protection by the basal expression of the MscS channel is a strong indicator of normal organization and function in the channel (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The resultant proteins were expressed at similar levels to the Cys-free parent after induction with 0.3 mm IPTG (Fig. 2, a and b). These data suggest that the cysteine mutations do not significantly disturb the MscS channel organization. In non-reducing gels S9C mutants were detected as dimers, even prior to incubation with an oxidising agent (Fig. 2a), but were converted to monomers by DTT (Fig. 2b). Neither S26C nor S95C, which are also located on the periplasmic face of the channel, were observed as dimers in the absence of oxidising agents. In the crystal structure, S9C is not visible (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) but is predicted to be periplasmic (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R.

It alone has sufficient conformational flexibility to form disulfide bridges without addition of any oxidizing agent.Fig. 2Disulfide bond formation in MscS Cys mutants using copper/phenanthroline. Membranes derived from MJF465 expressing MscS (either wild type or site-specific cysteine mutants) were harvested after induction for 30 min using 0.3 mm IPTG as described previously (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Membranes (1.5 mg of membrane protein/ml) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to addition of freshly prepared copper/phenanthroline reagent (0.167 mm copper/0.5 mm phenanthroline) and the incubation continued for 10 min. Control tubes were incubated with ethanol (10%), the solvent used for the copper/phenanthroline. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm NEM. Samples of the completed reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing (a) or reducing conditions (b) (Novex NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels run in MES buffer), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and MscS proteins detected by Western blotting using anti-His6 tag primary antibodies (Sigma) and anti-mouse HRP conjugate secondary antibodies (Sigma). Perbio Supersignal West Dura Substrate was used for a standard ECL method of detection.

Des. 1999; 7: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar) generated dimers for all of the proteins except the wild type, which is a Cys-free protein, and S49C (Fig. 2a). The monomer and dimer of MscS have slightly faster mobility than expected from the theoretical mass, as is frequently observed with membrane proteins. Higher oligomers (usually proteins with mobility consistent with a tetramer) were observed for control incubations of S9C and for the copper/phenanthroline-treated S26C and S58C. The effect was very marked in the latter where the tetramer was observed more often than the dimer and the dimer was only visible on longer exposures of the Western blot. All of the disulfide bridges could be reduced by incubation with DTT except that for S95C, which proved to be quite resistant to the reducing agent (Fig. 2b). Incubation with the disulfide bridge-generating reagent MTS-1-MTS (17Wu J.H. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) also resulted in dimer formation for all the Cys mutants, except S49C, and incubation with DTT reduced the dimers to the monomer (data not shown). Cross-linking with oPDM—oPDM cross-links cysteine residues that are capable of adopting positions within ∼10 Å of each other (range 9.4 ± 0.4 Å) (22Green N.S. Reisler E. Houk K.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Exposure of the MscS single Cys mutants led to S26C, S58C, S95C, and S267C forming higher order oligomers that were stable to SDS (Fig. 3a). Only S95C formed solely the dimer, whereas tetramers and hexamers were evident for S26C on extended exposure of the Western blot and the dominant form obtained with S58C had the mobility of the tetramer (Fig. 3a). The most startling result was seen with S267C, which formed multiple oligomeric forms from dimer through to the heptamer (Fig. 3a). The multimeric forms were seen to proceed via formation of the dimer followed by the appearance of trimers, then tetramers, pentamers, and finally the hexamer and heptamer (Fig. 3b). This observation was only made with the S267C mutant after incubation with oPDM. All of the cross-linked forms observed with S267C after oPDM treatment exhibited unusually fast mobilities suggesting that the protein might exhibit a more compact conformation. Incubation at high temperature or with urea-containing loading buffer, immediately prior to loading the gel, did not breakdown the multimers. These data give the clearest support to the heptameric form seen in the crystal structure (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and suggests that this organization is maintained in the closed state. The observation of the heptamer was made prior to the crystal structure being available, at a time when the protein was thought to be hexameric (21Sukharev S. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 290-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This led us to perform a number of controls to eliminate the possibility of artifacts. The cloned MscS protein has a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag to facilitate detection and purification. To ensure that this extra sequence was not responsible for the formation of the higher oligomers, the cross-linking was repeated in a MscS S267C construct lacking the His6 tag and was detected using antibodies to the native MscS protein. The same result was obtained, separate and distinct bands up to the heptamer (Fig. 4a). We expect the MscS channel to be closed in membrane preparations (21Sukharev S. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 290-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To confirm that the cross-linking effected was between subunits of the closed channel, reactions were performed in growing cells where the channel must be closed. Bands up to the heptamer were visible in Western blots of whole cells and in membranes purified from the cross-linked cells (Fig. 4b). The wild type protein, which lacks cysteine residues, was not affected by oPDM, which suggests that the observed pattern of oligomers was not caused by reaction of the cross-linker with other residues. E. coli cells express a MscS-related protein MscK that contains a number of cysteine residues. However, the results shown here were obtained in MJF465, which lacks MscK, and identical patterns of cross-linking were observed in strains that possessed MscK. To determine whether the higher molecular mass oligomers arose by cross-linking to other proteins, we performed tryptic peptide fingerprinting on the purified protein. The MscS S267C protein was purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography after treatment of the membranes with oPDM and the purified material resolved by SDS-PAGE. A clear pattern of seven bands was seen (Fig. 4c). Peptide fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry demonstrated that no other protein was linked to MscS in any of the seven bands. Mowse scores of ≥1e + 005 were observed for MscS in all seven protein bands, with no other significant hits. All seven proteins gave similar tryptic digest patterns, suggesting that no further cross-links were formed in the higher order oligomers. Furthermore, no evidence was found for other intra-MscS cross-links that could account for the higher order oligomers. Eleven of the 16 potential tryptic peptides were observed. Two of the missing peptides correspond to large (4.2 and 4.9 kDa) molecular mass hydrophobic peptides (TM1 and TM3) that are not readily detected by mass spectrometry. One of the missing peptides contained the cross-linked residue, S267C, and could be detected as an oPDM-modified peptide, but the cross-linked peptide itself was not observed in the MS. These data support a model in which the oligomeric state is probably formed by stabilization of the multimeric state rather than by additional cross-linking. This suggestion is supported by the observation that oxidation of single cysteine residues in several mutants also stabilized higher order oligomers (Figs. 2a and 3a). The native MscS protein, when expressed to very high levels in E. coli, also forms multiple molecular forms up to the heptamer, 2R. Bass, personal communication. suggesting that this property is intrinsic to MscS and that cross-linking merely stabilizes this tendency. The analysis reported here is of cross-linking of specific residues in the closed state of the MscS channel. Previous workers have established that MS channels in isolated membranes are in the closed state (11Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Most of our studies were conducted on isolated membranes and represent analysis of the closed state. Additional studies showed that identical patterns of cross-linking of S267C were observed in isolated membranes and in whole cells, where for physiological reasons the channel must be closed (Fig. 4). MscL represents the most in-depth analysis of the closed and open configurations of an MS channel, with the former observed in the crystal state and the latter by molecular dynamics simulations (6Sukharev S. Betanzos M. Chiang C.S. Guy H.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Chang G. Spencer R.H. Lee A.T. Barclay M.T. Rees D.C.

All the models envisage the transition from a compact protein to an expanded state as the channel moves from the closed to the open state. Cross-linking data has been used extensively to support these models. In the MscS crystal structure, which is proposed to represent the open state of the channel (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), the distance between the residues selected for mutagenesis range from 10 to 33 Å (Fig. 1a). None should easily form disulfide bonds, yet the majority do so in the closed state of the channel (Fig. 2a). Our data suggest that spontaneous cross-linking, which could trap a rare conformation of a flexible MscS protein, does not take place to any significant extent except for S9C (Fig. 2). The latter may be a substrate for the periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase system (24Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conformational flexibility is known to influence the apparent distance between residues, as revealed by cross-linking experiments (25Falke J.J. Koshland D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Generally it is considered that proximity and cross-linking efficiency are correlated, but if a polypeptide chain exhibits significant flexibility then residues can be cross-linked, although far apart in the native structure. Most of the mutants were cross-linked by oPDM, suggesting that these residues can readily adopt positions within the distance required for efficient cross-linking. oPDM has been estimated to bridge 9.4 ± 0.4 Å (22Green N.S. Reisler E. Houk K.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and, with the possible exception of S95C, would be expected to react poorly with the Cys mutants in the open channel configuration. The only residue that did not form either disulfide bridges or react with oPDM, S49C, is predicted to be the least favorably arranged for cross-linking. The crystal structure suggests that the S49C side chains are not positioned in a way that would easily facilitate reaction. The lack of reactivity of S49C provides an internal control for nonspecific cross-linking, since the absence of cross-links involving this residue under any of the conditions tested suggests that those that are formed by other residues are specific and a realistic indication of proximity or dynamics in the closed structure. S58C readily formed disulfides with copper/phenanthroline and cross-linked oligomers with oPDM, suggesting that in the closed structure these residues can be located as few as ∼3 Å apart compared with up to ∼33 Å in the crystal structure. Rees and colleagues (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the gating of MscS that envisaged a significant lateral movement within the plane of the membrane during the transition from the closed to the open state. The data presented here are consistent with such a model, since residues that are distant in the crystal are cross-linked in a manner predicted from the model. In this case, the cross-linking data would predict that transmembrane helices 1 and 2 undergo a displacement of up to 30 Å during the transition from the closed to the open state. The most COOH-terminal mutant studied, S267C, lies at the base of the large carboxyl-terminal domain of the channel, at the boundary between the αβ domain and the final β barrel that completes the protein. Adjacent S267C residues are separated by ∼20 Å in the crystal structure but readily form disulfide bridges and are cross-linked by oPDM (Fig. 3, a–c). These data suggest that the cytoplasmic domain may undergo a significant conformational change during the closed to open transition. Support for this suggestion comes from the observed inhibition of gating of MscS by cross-linking of carboxy-terminal His tags by Ni2+ (14Koprowski P. Kubalski A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11237-11245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The inhibition required high concentrations of Ni2+, suggesting that multiple cross-links were needed to block the re-organization of the carboxyl-terminal domain. Second, small deletions affecting the carboxyl terminus of MscS prevent the stable insertion of the protein into the membrane, consistent with the importance of this domain for the structure of the channel (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The data presented here strongly support the published model for MscS, which is derived from the crystal structure (1Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and supporting genetic work (13Miller S. Bartlett W. Chandrasekaran S. Simpson S. Edwards M. Booth I.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of S267C provides the first biochemical evidence for the heptameric structure of MscS. The progressive formation of higher oligomers, most evident with S267C treated with oPDM, suggests that the MscS protein can form SDS-stable complexes similar to those seen for K+ channels (26Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Heginbotham L. Odessey E. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cross-linking data, particularly for S267C, suggest that when two subunits are linked by an inflexible bond, the interactions with other subunits are strengthened, i.e. a conformational change consequent upon cross-linking of pairs of subunits is transmitted to adjacent subunits such that higher oligomers become stable. The rate of dimer formation is rapid relative to the formation of non-covalently linked oligomers (0.5–3 min compared with 9.5–12 min, although the trimer is evident after 3-min incubation), suggesting that a significant conformational change is required for the stabilization of the contact between the subunits. In conclusion, we believe our data support the heptameric model for MscS and suggests significant flexibility in the protein that may be essential for the transition between the closed and open states. We greatly appreciate discussions with W. Bartlett, R. Bass, D. C. Rees, P. Blount, C. J. Deutsch, N. A. Booth, and I. Stansfield. We also thank The Aberdeen Proteomics Unit (I. Davidson and E.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxgyenase (IDO) is a cytosolic heme protein which, together with the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the major pathway of tryptophan metabolism, the kynurenine pathway. The physiological role of IDO is not fully understood but is of great interest, because IDO is widely distributed in human tissues, can be up-regulated via cytokines such as interferon-γ, and can thereby modulate the levels of tryptophan, which is vital for cell growth. To identify which amino acid residues are important in substrate or heme binding in IDO, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the IDO gene was undertaken. Because it had been proposed that a histidine residue might be the proximal heme ligand in IDO, mutation to alanine of the three highly conserved histidines His16, His303, and His346 was conducted. Of these, only His346 was shown to be essential for heme binding, indicating that this histidine residue may be the proximal ligand and suggesting that neither His303 nor His16 act as the proximal ligand. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp274 also compromised the ability of IDO to bind heme.

With the induction of IDO being implicated in several disease states, its suppression may be of potential pharmacological importance. To date there are no potent therapeutic inhibitors of IDO; however, an understanding of the structure of IDO will aid in the development of such compounds. Heme proteins, such as IDO, are the most extensively studied of all metalloproteins. All heme proteins carry iron coordinated to protoporphyrin IX. The four coordination sites provided by the porphyrin ring are not sufficient to satisfy the coordination requirements of the iron. Normally, groups from the heme-binding protein occupy the remaining coordination sites. The common coordinating functional groups are the imidazole nitrogen of histidine, the phenoxide group of tyrosine, the sulfur of methionine and cysteine, and the carboxylate group of aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In both myoglobin and hemoglobin, the heme is attached to the protein through a histidine residue to the 5th coordination position on the iron (the proximal ligand). A second histidine (the distal ligand) occupies space immediately above the 6th coordination position of the iron, and coordination is through an oxygen molecule, not directly to the iron. Although only the primary structure of IDO has been determined (22Dai W. Gupta S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1990; 168: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Tone S. Takikawa O. Habara-Ohkubo A. Kadoya A. Yoshida R. Kido R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 367Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), there have been extensive equilibrium studies undertaken to investigate the binding properties of both substrate and oxygen with the additional objective of identifying the proximal and distal heme ligands. Dioxygenases, such as IDO, catalyze the oxidative cleavage of a substrate and, as such, both oxygen and the substrate need to bind to the enzyme. A common property of oxygenases is that the binding of the substrate precedes that of dioxygen, and this has been shown to be the case with tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (24Ishimura Y. Nozaki M. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3593-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Hirata et al. (25Hirata F. Ohnishi T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4637-4642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that IDO could bind oxygen to form a relatively stable complex that has catalytic activity. In later investigations it was determined that ferrous IDO binds l-tryptophan, followed by molecular oxygen (26Sono M. Taniguchi T. Watanabe Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following mechanism was proposed for the IDO catalyzed conversion of tryptophan to N′-formylkynurenine. (i) IDO-Fe2+ is bound by the substrate. (ii) The IDO-Fe2+-tryptophan complex is then bound by oxygen to form an IDO-Fe3+O2- complex (ternary complex); and (iii) this complex is converted to N′-formylkynurenine, releasing IDO-Fe2+. Other studies have used EPR, MCD, and CD spectroscopy to determine the properties of the IDO heme pocket and the nature of the proximal and distal heme ligands. MCD spectra of ferric and ferrous IDO closely resembled that of myoglobin and horseradish peroxidase (27Sono M. Dawson J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Uchida K. Shimizu T. Makino R. Sakaguchi K. Iisuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 2519-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the environment of the IDO heme pocket is similar to, but the size is considerably larger than, the prototypical binding heme pocket of myoglobin. This observation is supported by data showing that the heme pocket of IDO allows access to the inhibitors norharman and 4-phenylpyridine (30Sono M. Biochem. 1990; 29: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the basis of EPR studies, Shimizu et al. (31Shimizu T. Nomiyama S. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4700-4706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the 5th (proximal) ligand of the heme was nitrogen, probably from a histidine imidazole ring. The 6th (distal) ligand in substrate-free IDO was proposed to be a histidine imidazole ring nitrogen by Uchida et al. (28Uchida K. Shimizu T. Makino R. Sakaguchi K. Iisuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2526-2533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Uchida K. Shimizus T. Makino R. Sakaguchi K. Iisuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 2519-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that, in the substrate-bound ferric IDO, the 6th ligand was also a histidine (28Uchida K. Shimizu T. Makino R. Sakaguchi K. Iisuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2526-2533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Uchida K. Shimizus T. Makino R. Sakaguchi K. Iisuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2519-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasted with Sono and Dawson (27Sono M. Dawson J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who showed that the observed changes in MCD upon substrate binding were most consistent with a hydroxide ion being the 6th ligand in substrate-bound ferric IDO (27Sono M. Dawson J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The findings suggested that both of the proximal and distal heme ligands in substrate free IDO were histidines, as in hemoglobin and myoglobin. In this study, we report the use of site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues important in heme binding and enzymatic activity. Mutation of the three highly conserved histidines His16, His303, and His346 identified only His346 as essential for heme binding, indicating that this histidine residue may be the proximal ligand and suggesting that neither His303 nor His16 act as the proximal ligand. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp274 compromised the ability of IDO to bind heme. Thus, both His346 and Asp274 appear essential for the binding of heme and thus for IDO enzymatic activity.

Jamie J.F. Walker M.J. Truscott R.J.W. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (32Littlejohn T.K. Takikawa O. Skylas D. Jamie J.F. Walker M.J. Truscott R.J.W. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All liquid cultures were agitated at 200 rpm during incubation in an orbital-shaking incubator. Cultures (1 liter) were inoculated with a one-tenth volume of starter culture and grown to a density of 0.6 OD at 600 nm. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (200 mm), hemin (3.5 mm in 10 mm NaOH), and PMSF (200 mm in isopropanol) were then added at a final concentration of 10 μm, 7 μm and1mm, respectively. The cultures were then shaken for a further 3 h. EDTA (500 mm, pH 8.0) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3,600 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The pellet from a 1 liter culture was resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing PMSF (1 mm) and EDTA (1 mm) and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was stored at –20 °C for up to 2 months. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the IDO Expression Plasmid pQE9-IDO—Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Plasmid Midi-Prep kit or the Plasmid Spin-Prep kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis of pQE9-IDO was undertaken using the GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. All primers were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Castle Hill, Australia). Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: His16 to Ala16, 5′-ATC AGT AAA CAG TAC GCT ATT GAT GAA GAA GTG-3′; His 303 to Ala303, 5′-AGA AGA TAT ATG CCA CCA GCT GCT AGG AAC TTC CTG TGC TCA TTA-3′; His346 to Ala346, 5′-TCC CTG AGG AGC TAC GCT CTG CAA ATC GTG ACT-3′; Val104 to Ala104, 5′-AAT ATT GCT GCT CCT TAC TGC-3′; Asp274 to Ala274, 5′-GTC TTT CAG TGC TTT GCT GTC CTG CTG GGC ATC-3′; and Lys352 to Ala352, 5′-CTG CAA ATG GTG ACT GCG TAC ATC CTG ATT CCT-3′.

Plasmid DNA was routinely digested with the restriction enzyme SalI to confirm the presence of the IDO gene insert. Dye terminator DNA sequence analysis was performed using an ABI-PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) to confirm mutations. Sequences were analyzed using the Auto Assembler and MacVector programs. Purification of IDO Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—Potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm PMSF was used in the following experiments. All procedures were conducted at 0–4 °C unless stated otherwise. The pellet from 2 liters of bacterial culture was suspended in 20 ml of PBS containing Complete™ inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), sonicated on ice with a Branson Sonifier 250 for 4 min at maximum power, and centrifuged (27,000 × g, 15 min). Phosphocellulose (P11) resin was activated per the manufacturer's instructions. The crude supernatant from lysed cells was applied to a phosphocellulose (P11) column with a specification of 2.5 × 4 cm equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm). After washing with 50 mm buffer (150 ml) and 100 mm buffer (100 ml), proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer (100–500 mm, 100 ml of each) at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. Fractions that had an absorbance peak at 280 nm were pooled. Imidazole and glycerol were then added to a final concentration of 10 mm and 10% (v/v), respectively. The buffer used for affinity chromatography consisted of potassium phosphate buffer (250 mm, pH 6.5), glycerol (10% v/v), and PMSF (1 mm) with varying concentrations of imidazole (10–250 mm). Ni-NTA agarose resin was washed with MilliQ water and equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. The pooled fractions from the phosphocellulose column were applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column (2.5 × 3 cm). After washing with 10 mm imidazole buffer (100 ml) and 50 mm imidazole buffer (100 ml), IDO wild type and mutant proteins were eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (50–250 mm imidazole, 100 ml each) and monitored by absorbance at 280 and 406 nm. The samples containing high 406- and/or 280-nm absorbances were pooled. Analysis of IDO Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—Protein concentration was determined from A 280 measurement or with Bio-Rad dye reagent using bovine serum albumin (0–1 mg/ml) as the standard. The colored product was measured at 595 nm using a SPECTRAmax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Proteins were visualized using SDS-PAGE analysis by the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was conducted by the method of Burnette (35Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5916) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody raised against native human IDO (36Takikawa O. Kuroiwa T. Yamazaki F. Kido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2041-2048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultraviolet spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), with 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvettes. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvettes. Sensitivity was 100 millidegrees, and the scanning speed was 50 nm/min for an accumulation of 5 scans. Further analysis of CD data was undertaken using the K2D program (37Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 38Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Kinetic Studies—IDO activity was determined as described by Takikawa et al. (36Takikawa O. Kuroiwa T. Yamazaki F. Kido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2041-2048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a minor modification. In brief, the standard reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.5), ascorbic acid (20 mm, neutralized with NaOH), catalase (200 μg/ml), methylene blue (10 μm), l-tryptophan (400 μm), and IDO. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 10–60 min and was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (100 μl of 30%, w/v). After heating at 65 °C for 15 min, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (125 μl) was transferred into a well of a 96-well microplate and mixed with 2% (w/v) p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (125 μl) in acetic acid. The yellow pigment derived by reaction of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (Ehrlich's reagent) with kynurenine was measured at 480 nm using a SPECTRAmax 250 microplate reader. l-Kynurenine (1–100 μm) was used as the standard. Using this assay, the kinetic activity of wild type and the IDO mutants was determined against three substrates, i.e. l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan. Apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (K m) were determined using between 5 and 7 varying concentrations of these substrates. The concentration ranges for l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan are 3.6–288 μm, 0.72–10.8 mm, and 0.072–3.6 mm, respectively. The amount of wild type and mutant protein was adjusted to give initial velocity for each substrate where the percentage of conversion of substrate at each concentration was less than 10%. Each reaction was conducted in triplicate. Kinetic parameters (K m, V max) were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. As the content of heme varied between mutants, the data is presented as a function of the holoenzyme. Mutagenesis of the IDO Expression Plasmid pQE9-IDO— Alignment of IDO and IDO-like myoglobins (Fig. 1) showed that there are three conserved histidines, namely His16, His303, and His346. The conserved nature of these residues is indicative of an important role in the function of the enzyme, such as a coordinating residue involved in heme binding. Suzuki et al. (39Suzuki T. Takagi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) proposed that His303 and His346, two histidines close to the C terminus, were likely to be either the proximal or distal heme-coordinating histidines because of their proximity to each other. These two histidine residues were therefore selected as mutagenesis targets. In addition, the conserved residues His16, Val104, Asp274, and Lys352 were also selected as targets for mutagenesis. In each case, residues were converted to alanine, and the IDO genes encoding mutant proteins were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Purification and Structural Analysis of Wild Type and Mutant IDO Species—Following the purification of the wild type and mutant IDO proteins, the products obtained were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and Western blot analyses (Fig. 2B). As determined by SDS-PAGE, only one homologous band was observed for each isolated protein with a molecular mass of ∼45 kDa and confirmed as IDO by a positive reaction with the anti-IDO monoclonal antibody. CD spectrums were acquired to determine whether the selected mutations affected the protein secondary structure of IDO. Far UV CD spectra were obtained (Fig. 3) and further analyzed using the K2D deconvolution program (data not shown). This analysis showed that the wild type IDO protein exhibited a structure consisting of 31% α-helical, 11% β-sheet, and 58% random coil. The mutant IDO proteins exhibited similar structural compositions (28–31% α-helical, 10–18% β-sheet, and 53–59% random coil). These data indicate that site-directed mutagenesis of individual residues did not grossly affect protein secondary structure.Fig. 3Circular dichroism analyses of wild type and mutant IDO proteins. Circular dichroism spectra were conducted in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA) buffer. The far UV region from 200–250 nm is shown.

The His346 and Asp274 mutants have very low or no absorbance at 406 nm, indicating that they do not bind heme. The His16, His303, Val109, and Lys352 mutants maintained the ability to bind heme, and all give the same Soret band of heme with a peak at 406 nm, although, in the case of His16, His303, and Lys352, the binding was diminished compared with wild type. This may reflect a slight batch-by-batch difference in incorporation of heme into wild type and mutant IDO but indicates that these residues are not critical for heme coordination or binding. Biochemical Analysis of Wild Type and Mutant IDO Species—The enzymatic activity of wild type protein and each mutant was analyzed using l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan as substrates. Because mutant samples were a mixture of active holoenzyme (heme-containing IDO) and inactive apoenzyme (heme-free IDO), the reaction velocity was determined as a function of concentration of holoenzyme. The concentration of holoenzyme for each mutant was determined using the extinction coefficient at 406 nm determined for rabbit intestinal IDO of ϵ = 140 mm–1cm–1 (31Shimizu T. Nomiyama S. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4700-4706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate concentration (S) versus velocity (V) plots were constructed for the wild type and each mutant protein for each substrate. The number of substrate concentrations for l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan were 5, 7, and 6, respectively. Double reciprocal plots were constructed, and linear trend lines were fitted by the least squared method from which the constants K m and V max were determined (results not shown). The kinetic parameters of wild type and mutant IDO for l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan are given in Table I. Each of the mutants was analyzed for its ability to oxygenate l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan. Only the Asp274 and His346 mutants were unable to convert each of these substrates to N′-formyl kynurenine.Table IKinetic parameters of wild type and mutant IDO for l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophanIDOl-Tryptophand-Tryptophan5-Hydroxy-l-tryptophanV maxTONaTON, turnover number (mol of product/mol of holoenzyme/min).K mV max/K mV maxTONK mV max/K mV maxTONK mV max/K mm-1μ mμ m-1 m-1m-1mmμ m-1 m-1m-1μ mμ m-1 m-1Wild type12020616050.0325.34000.013His1636.35.66.556.72.40.0243.31400.008Val1098.38.90.942.75.30.00811000.01Asp274NDbND, not determined.NDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDHis30336.79.43.963.91.90.03421000.02His346NDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDLys35225.420.11.348.64.40.0114.11700.024a TON, turnover number (mol of product/mol of holoenzyme/min).b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab IDO is an enzyme that is widely distributed in humans. The role of IDO in metabolizing tryptophan, the least abundant amino acid, is implicated in numerous disease states (40Saito K. Lankner A. Markey S.P. Heyes M.P. Brain Res. 1991; 540: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41Widner B. Leblhuber F. Walli J. Tilz G.P. Demel U. Fuchs D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 467: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IDO structural information is required to aid the development of IDO inhibitors, which, in turn, may provide information on the etiology of a variety of diseases as well as possible treatment leads. To investigate the hypothesis that the proximal heme ligand was an imidazole nitrogen, we undertook alanine replacement site-directed mutagenesis of the three highly conserved histidines residues. In addition to His16, His303, and His346, three other residues, Val109, Asp274, and Lys352 in highly conserved regions were selected for alanine replacement mutagenesis. Each of the IDO mutant proteins was expressed and purified by the protocol established for IDO (1Takikawa O. Yoshida R. Kido R. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3648-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yields of the purification for most mutants were comparable with that obtained for IDO of ∼500 μg/liter of culture. However, the yield for the His346 IDO mutant was lower at ∼125 μg/liter of culture. Wild type and mutants proteins remained soluble after storage at 4 °C and retained initial enzymatic activity, suggesting that the folding of each protein and stability were not affected. Wild type and mutant IDO proteins exhibited CD spectra with minima at 208 and 225 nm, which is characteristic of predominantly α-helical structure. The CD spectra were further analyzed using the K2D deconvolution program. This analysis indicated that the wild type and each of the IDO mutant proteins contained similar levels of α-helical, β-sheet, and random coil structure. From this CD analysis it can be concluded that all of the mutants maintained secondary structure and that any loss of enzymatic activity can therefore be attributed to the affect of the residue change and not from a loss of secondary structure. UV and visible spectroscopy were conducted on all wild type and mutant IDO proteins. From the ratio of the absorbance maxima at 406:280 it can be deduced that the heme content of mutant proteins was highly variable. His346 and Asp274 have very low or no absorbance at 406 nm, indicating that these mutant IDO proteins do not bind heme. This confirms the observation made during purification that these proteins had no visible red coloration. The wild type 406:280 ratio was 1.7. The 406:280 ratio for the His16, Val109, His303, and Lys352 mutants were 1.0, 1.6, 0.9, and 0.8, respectively. These data indicate that these protein preparations contained varying amounts of apoprotein; nonetheless, each of these IDO mutant proteins retained the ability to bind heme. Furthermore, these mutations did not markedly compromise enzymatic activity of the holoprotein. Each of the mutants was analyzed for its ability to oxygenate l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan. Each mutant, excluding Asp274 and His346, was able to convert each of these substrates to N′-formyl kynurenine. The K m and V max values obtained were compared with those obtained for wild type IDO and placental human IDO, as reported in Takikawa et al. (1Takikawa O. Yoshida R. Kido R. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3648-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For l-tryptophan, the mutant K m values were between 6 and 20 μm. These are comparable with those of wild type (20 μm) and placental human IDO (21 μm). For d-tryptophan, the K m values ranged between 2 and 5 mm, and these are comparable with that determined for wild type (5 mm) but are low in comparison to that reported for placental IDO (K m = 14 mm). Because mutagenesis was carried out on the recombinant protein, values of ∼5 mm were expected. The reported K m values for wild type (440 μm) and native IDO (400 μm) were approximately double that obtained for the mutants. The mutants had the highest affinity for l-tryptophan, followed by d-tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan. This agrees with both the wild type IDO result and the previously reported data for the human placental enzyme (2Botting N.P. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1995; 24: 401-412Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The V max/K m values for l-tryptophan, d-tryptophan, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan exhibited less than a 8-fold variance between the enzymatically active mutant and wild type proteins. This indicates that each of the mutant enzymes, except His346 and Asp274, maintained enzymatic ability with similar enzyme efficiency. Conversion of His346 to Ala resulted in a total loss of heme content in IDO, although the secondary structure of the protein was maintained. This IDO mutant therefore provides strong evidence for the proposal that this histidine is the proximal heme ligand in IDO. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Asp274 is also required for maintaining heme binding in IDO. The role of His346 and Asp274 in the binding of heme in IDO may be direct; i.e. they may act as the proximal and distal heme ligands. It may be, however, that these residues act indirectly by providing support to the structure of the heme pocket or that these residues are important in influencing the coordination of other residues that act as the heme ligands. Crystallization of wild type IDO or these mutants will directly determine their role in heme binding by IDO. The proximal ligand in hemoproteins is important for maintaining the basic and rigid structure of the heme; however, the distal ligand is more easily replaced by other ligands. It is therefore proposed that the removal of the proximal ligand by site-directed mutagenesis should remove the ability of the enzyme to bind heme, whereas the removal of the distal ligand may not totally prevent heme binding. Previous EPR and magnetic CD studies have indicated that the proximal ligand of IDO is a histidine residue such as is found in a wide range of other hemoproteins. It had been previously proposed that either His346 or His303acts as the proximal residue (3Stone T.W. Connick J.H. Neuroscience. 1985; 15: 597-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The mutation of His303 produced a protein that retained significant heme binding ability, which suggest that His303 is not the proximal ligand. It does not, however, indicate whether or not this residue is the distal ligand. This is because the distal ligand is more flexible and can be replaced by other ligands, including other amino acids. For example if His303 is the distal ligand in the native protein, its removal may allow residues such as Met295, Tyr298, or Met299, which are located near His303 in the primary sequence and are able to coordinate to heme, to act as the distal ligand. The His303 replacement mutation does, however, show that this residue is not essential for heme binding or IDO activity. This is the first study to show the importance of two specific residues, Asp274 and His346, in the enzymatic activity of the human IDO. By contrast, residues His303, His16, Lys352, and Val109 were found to not be essential for heme binding in IDO. This supports the hypothesis that the highly conserved His346 residue may act as the proximal heme ligand in IDO. We thank Dr. Joanne Jamie for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2073174207,"The molecular organization of microsomal cytochromes P450 (P450s) and formation of complexes with P450 reductase have been studied previously with isolated proteins and in reconstituted systems. Although these studies demonstrated that some P450s oligomerize in vitro, neither oligomerization nor interactions of P450 with P450 reductase have been studied in living cells. Here we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study P450 oligomerization and binding to P450 reductase in live transfected cells. Cytochrome P450 2C2, but not P450 2E1, forms homo-oligomeric structures, and this self-association is mediated by the signal-anchor sequence. Because P450 2C2, in contrast to P450 2E1, is directly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), these results could suggest that oligomerization may prevent transport from the ER. However, P450 2C1 signal-anchor sequence chimera defective in ER retention also formed oligomers, and chimera containing the cytoplasmic domain of P450 2C2, which is directly retained in the ER, did not exhibit self-oligomerization, which indicates that oligomerization is not correlated with direct retention. By using FRET, we have also detected binding of P450 2C2 and P450 2E1 to P450 reductase. In contrast to self-oligomerization, the catalytic domain can mediate an interaction of P450 2C2 with P450 reductase. These results suggest that microsomal P450s may differ in their quaternary structure but that these differences do not detectably affect interaction with the reductase or transport from the ER."

Here, we report a study of heat- and pressure-induced unfolding of human Q26 and murine Q6 ataxin-3 using spectroscopic methods. UV absorbance and fluorescence revealed that heat and pressure induced a structural transition of both proteins to a molten globule conformation. The unfolding pathway was partly irreversible and led to a protein conformation where tryptophans were more exposed to water. Furthermore, the use of fluorescent probes (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate and thioflavin T) allowed the identification of different intermediates during the process of pressure-induced unfolding. At high temperature and pressure, human Q26, but not murine Q6, underwent concentration-dependent aggregation. Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that these aggregates are characterized by an increased β-sheet content. As revealed by electron microscopy, heat- and pressure-induced aggregates were different; high temperature treatment led to fibrillar microaggregates (8–10-nm length), whereas high pressure induced oligomeric structures of globular shape (100 nm in diameter), which sometimes aligned to higher order suprastructures. Several intermediate structures were detected in this process. Two factors appear to govern ataxin unfolding and aggregation, the length of the polyglutamine tract and its protein context.

In turn, expansion of polyGln tract results from instability of the encoding trinucleotide (CAG) repeats (1Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P.

Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and Huntington's disease belong to this superfamily of polyglutamine-associated diseases. Among these, an expanded polyGln tract located at the C-terminal part of the 42-kDa ataxin-3 protein triggers spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). The repeat normally consists of 15–30 consecutive glutamines, whereas up to 55–84 glutamines are found in pathological variants (6Cummings C.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 281-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The expansion of the glutamine repeat destabilizes the native α-helix-rich protein, which aggregates into amyloid-like β-fibrils (7Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This event is considered to play a crucial role in early pathological steps leading to the disease (8Orr H.T.

Nature. 2001; 412: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the normal, non-expanded form of ataxin-3 also appears to be involved in aggregation processes. Indeed, recent studies (11Fujigasaki H. Uchihara T. Koyano S. Iwabuchi K. Yagishita S. Makifuchi T. Nakamura A. Ishida K. Toru S. Hirai S. Ishikawa K. Tanabe T. Mizusawa H. Exp.

It has also been hypothesized that the pathogenic effects of marinesco bodies could be because of these aggregates (14Ono S. Inoue K. Mannen T. Mitake S. Shirai T. Kanda F. Jinnai K. Takahashi K. Acta Neuropathol. 1989; 77: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Tatton N.A. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Chai et al. (16Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) found nuclear inclusions containing normal ataxin-3. This led them to postulate that not only the polyGln tract, but also other parts of the protein, are involved in the aggregation mechanism. Moreover, an ill-folded conformation of ataxin-3 where the glutamine domain is solvent-exposed could represent the starting point of neuronal dysfunction in SCA3/MJD, as suggested by Perez et al. (17Perez M.K. Paulson H.L. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to study and examine the role of the polyGln chain length and its protein environment on structural stability and aggregate formation of normal, non-pathologic ataxin-3. In the present study, we used as models a non-pathological variant of human ataxin-3, which includes a tract of 26 consecutive glutamines (Q26), and its murine counterpart, which has only six residues (Q6). These proteins display high sequence homology (Fig. 1) with 99% identity in the N-terminal part, called Josephin domain. The C-terminal region is more divergent. A three-dimensional structural model of ataxin-3 has been proposed recently (18Albrecht M. Hoffmann D. Evert B.O. Schmitt I. Wullner U. Lengauer T. Proteins. 2003; 50: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting a common structure for the two proteins. To study the mechanism of ataxin-3 structural changes and aggregation, we used heat and pressure as thermodynamic perturbants. Whereas heat is widely used as a structure perturbing agent, high pressure techniques are not applied extensively. Nonetheless, hydrostatic pressure, in combination with spectroscopic methods, is a powerful tool to study protein structural changes, such as folding-unfolding, oligomer dissociation equilibrium, and aggregation (19Mombelli E.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is because of its specific effects on non-covalent interactions. Indeed, this property sometimes facilitates trapping of thermodynamically stable intermediates. In contrast, application of high temperature or treatment by chemical denaturants often results in irreversible protein structural changes, which may not be relevant to the physiological process. Using intrinsic probes, specific for the Josephin domain, and extrinsic fluorescent probes, as well as FTIR and CD, we studied the role of the polyGln chain length and of other protein structural features in both protein stability and aggregation. Using electron microscopy, discrete aggregation steps could be identified leading to the formation of fibrillar structures. Gene Cloning and Protein Production—cDNA encoding human and murine ataxin-3 were obtained from the RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH. The sequences were then cloned into plasmid pGEX6P-1. Ataxin-3 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 codon plus RIL as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing a PreScission Protease recognition site (Amersham Biosciences). Mature proteins were obtained by cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase affinity tail with the PreScission protease. Details of the purification procedure will be published elsewhere. UV Absorbance Spectroscopy—For all experiments, we used a thermostated high pressure cell, equipped with sapphire windows, allowing experiments from atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) to 650 MPa (32Lange R. Frank J. Saldana J.-L. Balny C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 277-283Google Scholar). The cell was connected at 180° through focalized optical quartz fibers (200-μm-diameter) to a Jobin-Yvon-Spex 30W Deuterium lamp and to a Jobin-Yvon-Spex 270M spectrograph coupled to a UV-coated back-thinned Spectrum ONE™ 512/512 array detection CCD 3500 camera (Jobin-Yvon-Spex Inc.) Another fiber served as a reference beam. The upper part of the chip was used for the sample beam, and the lower part was used for the reference beam. A grating of 1200 traits was used, producing a dispersion from 266 to 303 nm. The pixels were fully binned vertically (for intensity) and two by two horizontally (for dispersion). The set up produced data points distant by 0.15 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 0.6 nm. For each measurement, 50 transmission spectra (1.5-s integration time each) were accumulated. The absorbance was computed with the reference beam and corrected for the baseline (buffer). High pressure and temperature experiments were performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl and 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, respectively. The concentration of proteins was 1.5 mg·ml–1. Fourth derivative spectra were computed as described (32Lange R. Frank J. Saldana J.-L. Balny C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 277-283Google Scholar, 33Lange R. Bec N. Mozhaev V.V. Frank J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 284-292Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Light Scattering Measurements—The fluorescence experiments and light scattering measurements were carried out at 25 °C using an SLM Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (Aminco Bowman) modified to accommodate a high pressure cell. For intrinsic protein fluorescence, excitation at 280 and 295 nm gave similar emission spectra. To obtain the greatest signal of protein fluorescence, the wavelength excitation was set to 280 nm (4-nm slit). Emission spectra (8 nm slit) were recorded, in triplicate accumulation, from 300 to 400 nm. Fluorescence spectral changes were quantified by determining the center of spectral mass <v> (34King L. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3637-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Silva J.L. Miles E.W. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5780-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using the equation, 〈νp〉 = Σ(νi × F i)/ΣF i, where F i is the intensity of fluorescence emitted at wavenumber νi. This parameter reflects the mean exposure of tryptophan residues to water (35Silva J.L. Miles E.W. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5780-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Ruan K. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2144-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) and thioflavin T (ThT) binding was measured by excitating at 350 and 450 nm (4-nm slit), respectively, and emission spectra (8-nm slit) were recorded from 400 to 600 nm and from 460 to 600 nm, respectively. The concentrations were 0.35 mg protein ml–1, 700 μm ANS, and 80 μm ThT. Pressure-induced aggregation was followed by monitoring the light scattering intensity at 350 nm (0.5-nm excitation and emission slits). Determination of Thermodynamic Parameters—The thermodynamic parameters of heat- and pressure-induced spectral changes were determined by fitting spectral amplitudes at characteristic wavelengths to two- or three-state transitions as described (22Torrent J. Connelly J.P. Coll M.G. Ribo M. Lange R. Vilanova M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15952-15961Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This was possible, because under each condition microreversibility was attained (the spectra did not change further as a function of time). Nevertheless, the pressure- and temperature-dependent spectral changes were not always fully reversible, and in some cases (as specified under “Results”) a hysteresis phenomenon was observed. The deduced thermodynamic parameters are therefore meaningful only within our experimental conditions. They are used to compare the stability of murine and human ataxin-3. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were performed on a Jasco model 810 polarimeter. 0.1- and 0.5-cm optical path length quartz cells were used, respectively, to record spectra in the far-UV (188–260 nm) and near-UV (250–300 nm) range. Baseline corrected spectra were acquired in triplicate at a scan speed of 20 nm·min–1, using a bandwidth of 1 nm with a response time of 1 s. For temperature experiments in the far-UV and near-UV ranges, proteins were dissolved at concentrations of 0.24 and 1.2 mg·ml–1, respectively, in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Spectra were recorded in steps of 5 °C from 25 to 90 °C. At each temperature the solution was allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. FTIR Spectroscopy—FTIR spectra were recorded with an IFS28 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. The spectra resulted from an accumulation of 100 scans, which were collected at a resolution of 2 cm–1. To compare soluble and aggregated proteins, spectra were recorded with dry samples. Aliquots were applied onto fluorine plates, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate at room temperature. For comparison, spectra were normalized using the program OPUS/IR2. Electronic Microscopy—Aggregates were obtained by pressurization (650 MPa) or heating (90 °C) of human Q26 ataxin-3 protein solution at 2mg·ml–1. The aggregates were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.2 mg·ml–1, deposited onto formwar-carbon-coated grids, and negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. The grids were examined using a JEOL 1200EX2 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Pressure-induced Unfolding Studies using UV Absorbance and Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence Show a More Complex, Multi-step Unfolding Mechanism for Q26 Ataxin-3, as Compared with That of the Q6 Form—At atmospheric pressure, human Q26 and murine Q6 ataxin-3 exhibited identical UV absorption and fluorescence spectra at pH 7.4 and 25 °C (see Figs. 2 and 3). To compare the conformational stability of the two proteins, pressure-induced unfolding experiments were performed under the same conditions. Using fourth derivative UV absorbance spectroscopy, significant spectral changes were observed for human Q26 and murine Q6 ataxin-3. As shown in Fig. 2, increasing pressure up to 650 MPa induced a red shift from 290.5 to 291.7 nm in the area corresponding to tryptophan residues. Taking the spectral amplitude at 290.3 nm as the signal of the transition, the change of the fourth derivative value with pressure exhibited a sigmoid profile for the murine protein (Fig. 2). This conformational destabilization was characterized by a free energy of unfolding, ΔG U = 13.5 kJ/mol, and a standard volume change of ΔV = –36.9 ml/mol with a half-transition pressure, P ½, of 366 MPa (Table I). The analysis of the corresponding profile for the human Q26 ataxin-3 was more complicated; the presence of an intermediate was required to accurately fit the experimental data (Fig. 2) as suggested by the residuals of the global fit (data not shown). This yielded values of ΔG U of 5.9 and 25 kJ/mol and ΔV of –40.7 and –61.3 ml/mol, with P ½ values of 145 and 409 MPa (Table I). Although reversibility was attained at each pressure (no further spectral evolution as a function of time), for both proteins the spectral change attained at 650 MPa was not fully reversible. After pressure release, their spectra did not return to their initial levels, as indicated by the incomplete recovery of the pressure-induced red shift of the tryptophan band from 291.7 (650 MPa) to 291 nm (10 MPa).Fig. 3Pressure effect on the intrinsic protein fluorescence of ataxin-3 at pH 7 and 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab The effect of hydrostatic pressure on ataxin-3 fluorescence spectra is shown in Fig. 3. For the murine Q6, the protein fluorescence is affected in two phases in the pressure range from 10 to 650 MPa (Fig. 3, inset). From 10 to 300 MPa, a gradual decrease in fluorescence intensity at 329 nm was observed upon compression. At higher pressure, the fluorescence intensity increased. Concomitantly with the fluorescence intensity increase, a red shift of the maximum emission wavelength was observed, indicative of a pressure-dependent exposure of tryptophan residues to water. These spectral changes were not fully reversible. In the case of human Q26, the fluorescence intensity changed in a similar way as that of murine Q6. However, the pressure-dependent red shift was observed already in the low pressure range. Again, these spectral changes were only partly reversible; as illustrated in Fig. 4, the maximum of fluorescence intensity after pressure release was red-shifted. This indicates that the tryptophan residues became more exposed to water. The partly irreversible character of the unfolding process was confirmed by a significant decrease of the near-UV CD signal (Fig. 4). However, far-UV CD and infrared spectra were identical before and after compression (Fig. 4). Altogether, these results indicate that the pressure-induced unfolding process did not change irreversibly the protein secondary structure but modified their tertiary structure. For the murine Q6, the transition can be ascribed to a two-state model, whereas at least three states are involved in the pressure-dependent unfolding of the human Q26 protein (Fig. 3). The calculated thermodynamic parameters are listed in Table I. NaCl Abolishes the Biphasic Denaturation Profile of Human Q26 Ataxin-3—To determine whether salts affect the stability of proteins as described previously (37Nandi P.K. Leclerc E. Marc D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11017-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for murine prion protein, UV absorbance and fluorescence experiments were carried out in the pressure range from 0.1 to 650 MPa in the presence of 1 m NaCl. For human Q26, the former double-sigmoid UV absorbance and fluorescence profiles became two-state transitions, preceded and followed by near-linear slopes (see Figs. 2 and 3). The thermodynamic parameters (Table I) indicate that NaCl did not affect the unfolding process at high pressure (300–650 MPa). These results suggest a destabilization by NaCl of one region of the protein at low pressure. In contrast, a pronounced increase in stability of the murine Q6 protein was observed under pressure; the presence of 1 m NaCl induced an increase of P ½ by about 50 MPa for both absorbance and fluorescence pressure-dependent profiles (Table I). 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate and Thioflavin T Binding Fluorescence—The environment-sensitive fluorescent dye ANS was used to characterize the pressure-induced unfolding of ataxin-3.

As shown in Fig. 5, ANS fluorescence intensity increased with hydrostatic pressure for both proteins. In the experimentally available pressure range, no plateau was attained, indicating that the pressure-induced structural changes were incomplete even at 650 MPa. Again, this process was only partially reversible. Comparing the two proteins, ANS bound to human Q26 at lower pressure than to murine Q6 (100 and 250 MPa, respectively) indicating that the human protein is less resistant to pressure treatment. For a further characterization of the pressure-induced conformational states, the ability of ataxin-3 to bind ThT was studied. This fluorophore is frequently used to detect amyloid (40LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) or oligomeric protein structures (41Carrotta R. Bauer R. Waninge R. Rischel C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, its binding was characterized by a fluorescence increase at 483 nm (Fig. 5). For the human Q26 protein, a plot of the emission amplitude at 483 nm versus pressure was best fitted by a two-state transition model, whereas a multi-step process described the profile obtained for the murine counterpart (Fig. 5). This process was completely reversible with hysteresis in the pressure range from 400 to 200 MPa. The thermodynamic parameters deduced from these profiles are listed in Table II. ThT binding was also observed in the presence of 1 m NaCl. The observed sigmoid profiles were characterized by similar values of ΔG U, ΔV, and P ½ for both proteins (see Fig. 5 and Table II).Table IIThermodynamic parameters calculated from pressure-induced ThT binding curves for ataxin-3 at 25 °C and 0.1 MPaΔVΔGuP1/2ml·mol-1kJ·mol-1MPaHuman Q26-53.3 ± 3.923.9 ± 1.5447Human Q26 + 1 m NaCl-71.7 ± 5.227.9 ± 2.0390Murine Q6-45.2 ± 4.9(1)aThe parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experimental data, according to a bisigmoid model.7.6 ± 0.9(1)aThe parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experimental data, according to a bisigmoid model.168(1)aThe parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experimental data, according to a bisigmoid model.-80.5 ± 6.9(2)aThe parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experimental data, according to a bisigmoid model.36.2 ± 3.2(2)aThe parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experimental data, according to a bisigmoid model.450(2)aThe parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experimental data, according to a bisigmoid model.Murine Q6 + 1m NaCl-67.0 ± 4.628.6 ± 1.8423a The parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of Fig. 4 experiment"

Total lipid isolated from exponentially growing Staphylococcus aureus cells facilitated the release of ATP bound to S. aureus DnaA protein, whereas that from stationary phase cells was inert. Fractionation of total lipid from stationary phase cells revealed that the basic phospholipid, lysylphosphatidylglycerol (LPG), inhibited PG- or CL-facilitated release of ATP from DnaA protein. There was an increase in LPG concentration during the stationary phase. A fraction of the total lipid from stationary phase cells of an integrational deletion mprF mutant, in which LPG was lost, facilitated the release of ATP from DnaA protein. A zwitterionic phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, also inhibited PG-facilitated ATP release. These results indicate that interaction of DnaA protein with acidic phospholipids might be regulated by changes in the phospholipid composition of the cell membrane at different growth stages. In addition, the mprF mutant exhibited an increased amount of origin per cell in vivo, suggesting that LPG is involved in regulating the cell cycle event(s).

Chromosomal DNA replication in bacteria is regulated at the initiation step (1Cooper S. Helmstetter C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 2Donachie W.D. Nature. 1968; 219: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), where the activity and quantity of the initiator DnaA protein is critically controlled (3Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 4Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DNA replication in Escherichia coli is initiated by the binding of DnaA protein to the DnaA boxes in the oriC, the origin of chromosomal DNA replication, followed by melting of the duplex at the three AT-rich 13-mers that locate close to the DnaA boxes. Loading of DnaB helicase in complex with DnaC protein leads to priming by DnaG primase, and DNA is synthesized by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (3Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd ed. W.

Based on biochemical and molecular genetic research in E. coli, DnaA protein activity is proposed to be regulated by its binding of adenine nucleotides. DnaA protein has a high affinity for ATP and ADP, and the ATP binding form of DnaA protein (ATP-DnaA) initiates DNA replication in vitro, whereas the ADP binding form (ADP-DnaA) does not (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In E. coli cells, the majority of DnaA protein is present as ADP-DnaA, and ATP-DnaA increases at the time of initiation (8Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 9Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The ratio of ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA is regulated by at least four elements, including de novo synthesis of DnaA protein accompanied by formation of ATP-DnaA, an intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity that generates ADP-DnaA from ATP-DnaA, a stimulation factor for the ATP hydrolysis named RIDA 1The abbreviations used are: RIDA, regulatory inactivation of DnaA; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin; LPG, lysylphosphatidylglycerol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; TLC, thin layer chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; LB, Luria Bertani.1The abbreviations used are: RIDA, regulatory inactivation of DnaA; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin; LPG, lysylphosphatidylglycerol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; TLC, thin layer chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; LB, Luria Bertani. (for regulatory inactivation of DnaA), and an exchange reaction of bound adenine nucleotide. RIDA requires Hda protein and a β-clamp of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme as essential components and stimulates DnaA ATPase coupling with progressive DNA replication by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (8Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, RIDA suppresses the initiation of DNA replication (5Katayama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Acidic phospholipid is a well characterized factor that facilitates the exchange reaction of ADP to ATP bound to DnaA protein (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acidic phospholipids in a fluid membrane facilitate dissociation of ADP bound to DnaA protein in vitro, and the resultant free form of DnaA protein is reactivated through binding to ATP, which is present at high concentrations under physiological conditions. In the conditional pgsA deletion mutant that is defective for the synthesis of acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), initiation of replication at oriC does not occur (15Xia W. Dowhan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, the growth defect of the pgsA mutant is restored by expression of DnaA proteins possessing certain mutations (16Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). E. coli DnaA protein is located at the cell membrane (17Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Newman G. Crooke E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2604-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, there is direct evidence of an exchange reaction of ADP to ATP bound to DnaA protein in the cells (9Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that reactivation of DnaA protein by acidic phospholipids is indispensable for the initiation of DNA replication at oriC. DnaA protein of other bacteria was purified (19Fukuoka T. Moriya S. Yoshikawa H. Ogasawara N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Majka J. Messer W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and its interaction with acidic phospholipids has been investigated (23Yamamoto K. Rajagopalan M. Madiraju M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). How the reactivation of DnaA protein by phospholipids is coordinated with cell cycle progression remains uncertain. All previous studies of the interaction of E. coli DnaA protein with acidic phospholipids used chemically synthesized lipids or those isolated from eukaryotic cells. Little attention has been paid to alterations of lipid composition caused by physiological changes in the growth condition. In the present study, we focused on a Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, in which lipid composition is altered from the exponential phase to the stationary growth phase (24Houtsmuller U.M.T. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 564-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of domains 3 and 4 of S. aureus DnaA protein has 49% identity with that of E. coli DnaA protein (25Katayama H. Mizushima T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This region is responsible for ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, membrane interaction, and DNA binding properties of the E. coli DnaA protein (26Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, the properties of DnaA protein for ATP binding and interaction with acidic phospholipids are expected to be conserved between the two bacterial species. Here we describe that total lipid isolated from exponentially growing S. aureus cells releases ATP from ATP-DnaA, whereas total lipid isolated from stationary phase cells does not. Moreover, in the stationary phase, the activities of the acidic phospholipids, PG and CL, are inhibited by a basic phospholipid, lysylphosphatidylglycerol (LPG). Reagents—[α-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol), and [32P]orthophosphate (370 MBq/ml) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [2,8-3H]ADP (1.48 TBq/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (egg yolk) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipid Inc. PG (egg yolk) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipid Inc. or from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories. CL (bovine heart) was purchased from Sigma. Bacteria and Plasmids—S. aureus strain RN4220 (27Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Kenichi Hiramatsu (Juntendo University). S. aureus strain CK1001 was constructed as described below. S. aureus strain Cowan I (28Steele Jr., G. Ankerst J. Sjogren H.O. Vang J. Lannerstad O. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and E. coli strain KA450 (ΔoriC1071::Tn10, dnaA17(Am), rnhA199(Am)) (9Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) were from our laboratory stock. Shuttle vectors between E. coli and S. aureus, pHY300PLK and pND50 (29Inoue R. Kaito C. Tanabe M. Kamura K. Akimitsu N. Sekimizu K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), were from Takara (Japan) and Dr. Matsuhisa Inoue (Kitasato University), respectively. S. aureus DnaA-overproducing plasmid was constructed as follows. The coding region of the S. aureus dnaA gene (1.4 kbp) (25Katayama H. Mizushima T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 5′-gggaattccatatgtcggaaaaaaagaaatttggg-3′ and 5′-ccggaattcttatacatttcttatttctttttc-3′ and chromosomal DNA extracted from S. aureus Cowan I as template. EcoRI and NdeI restriction sites or the EcoRI site were added to the 5′ or 3′ ends of the coding region, respectively. The EcoRI fragment of the PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI site of M13mp19. The NdeI-EcoRI fragment of the resultant plasmid containing the S. aureus dnaA coding region was replaced with the E. coli dnaA coding region of E. coli DnaA overproducer pMZ001, which contains an arabinose promoter (30Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, named pSAdnaA002, was used for overproduction of S. aureus DnaA protein. pHYmprF was obtained by insertion of the DNA fragment, which was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-tgaaacgagtatttgccacttga-3′ and 5′-tccaagcgcttcaggcataa-3′ and chromosomal DNA extracted from S. aureus RN4220 as template, into the SmaI site of pHY300PLK in the same orientation as the tetracycline resistance gene. Bacterial Culture Conditions—E. coli and S. aureus cells were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium (1% tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), and 1% NaCl). Thymine, up to 50 μg/ml, ampicillin, up to 50 μg/ml, tetracycline, up to 5 μg/ml, or chroramphenicol, up to 12.5 μg/ml, was added if required. For S. aureus lipid preparations, a 0.5-ml aliquot of overnight culture was diluted into 100 ml of LB medium in a 225-ml round tube (Falcon), capped tightly, and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at the exponential phase (OD660 of 0.3) or at the stationary phase (20 h incubation with an OD660 of ∼2.5). Purification of S. aureus DnaA Protein—E. coli strain KA450 harboring pSAdnaA002 was grown in 3 liters of LB medium containing thymine and ampicillin at 30 °C. When the OD660 value reached 0.5, 60 ml of 50% l-(+)-arabinose was added (final 1%), and the culture was further incubated for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in buffer C′ (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 20% glycerol) containing 0.25 m KCl (1 ml/1 g of cell paste), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. After thawing the frozen cell suspension on ice, lysozyme and spermidine were added up to 0.3 mg/ml and 20 mm, respectively. The suspension was mixed by inversion, placed on ice for 30 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed on ice. After brief sonication, the extract was collected by centrifugation in a Beckman 80Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant up to 0.2 g/ml with stirring. After additional stirring for 3 h, precipitates were collected by centrifugation in an 80Ti rotor at 30,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, dissolved in buffer C′ containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, and dialyzed for 12 h against 1.6 liters of buffer C′ containing 10 mm magnesium acetate with replacement of the buffer once. After centrifugation in an 80Ti rotor at 30,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to a MonoS HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography) equilibrated with buffer C′ containing 10 mm magnesium acetate. DnaA protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m KCl in buffer C′ containing 10 mm magnesium acetate. The DnaA protein fraction that was active for ATP binding was used as purified S. aureus DnaA fraction. This fraction had a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10.5%) electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purification of E. coli DnaA Protein—E. coli DnaA protein was purified as described previously (32Kubota T. Katayama T. Ito Y. Mizushima T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), except for using an E. coli DnaA overproducer, pBAD-dnaA, 2T. Ogawa, unpublished data. that was kindly provided from Dr. T. Ogawa (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan). Isolation of S. aureus Lipid—Exponentially growing cells and stationary phase cells were prepared as described above. Total lipid was extracted by a modified Bligh-Dyer method as described previously (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dried with a rotary evaporator, and suspended in water by sonication (Branson Sonifier 450). The S. aureus phospholipids were purified from total lipid obtained during either the exponentially growing phase or the stationary phase as indicated. LPG was purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v) using a silica gel plate (Silicagel 60, type PK6F, Whatman). PG and CL were further subjected to a second TLC with chloroform, methanol, and 29% ammonium (65:35:5, v/v/v). Re-extraction of the lipid from the thin layer plate was performed as follows. One of the TLC plates was sprayed with 100 mg/ml CuSO4 containing 8% phosphoric acid and heated to detect lipids (33Entezami A.A. Venables B.J. Daugherty K.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1987; 387: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The region containing PG, CL, and LPG was scraped off the other thin layer plates, and lipids were extracted by stirring for 30 min at 4 °C in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Methanol and distilled water were added to the samples up to a chloroform/methanol/water ratio of 1:1:0.9 (v/v/v) followed by vigorous mixing. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min, the lower phase was collected, dried with a rotary evaporator, dissolved in a small amount of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and stored at –20 °C. All procedures, except for evaporation, were performed at 4 °C. Each purified phospholipid fraction had a single spot by TLC (Silicagel 60, Merck) with three different solvent systems; chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v), chloroform/methanol/29% ammonium (65:35:5, v/v/v), and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v). Quantification of Phospholipids—The amount of phosphorus was determined (34Chen J.P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5824) Google Scholar), and the concentration of phospholipids was calculated assuming an average molecular weight of 750 for total lipid, 750 for PG, 850 for LPG, 1400 for CL, and 750 for PE. ATP (ADP) Binding of DnaA Protein—The standard reaction (50 μl) contained 1 μm [α-32P]ATP (44,000 cpm/pmol) or [3H]ADP (18,700 cpm/pmol), purified S. aureus DnaA protein (50–250 ng), 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 40 μm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% sucrose. DTT was added just before use. Specific radioactivities of [α-32P]ATP or [3H]ADP were kept constant (Fig. 1). Purified S. aureus DnaA protein (5 pmol) was mixed with various concentrations of [α-32P]ATP (1.5–50 nm, 15 Ci/mmol) or [3H]ADP (1.8–100 nm, 32 Ci/mmol) in 100× volume of the standard reaction (5 ml) for ATP binding or 10× volume (500 μl) for ADP binding (Fig. 1). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the solution was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore HA 0.45 μm, 24 mm diameter) presoaked in the wash buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 152 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol). The filter was washed with 20 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and dried under an infrared lamp. Radioactivity retained on the filter was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. ATP binding assay for E. coli DnaA protein was performed as described previously (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Exposure of ATP-DnaA to Lipids—For S. aureus DnaA protein, the [α-32P]ATP-DnaA complex (0.2–0.5 pmol) was formed as described above in 50 μl of standard reaction buffer and magnesium acetate was added to 10 mm. Lipid suspension and excess cold ATP (final 1 mm) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 14 min or as indicated. Reactions were also performed at 37 °C for indicated time periods (Fig. 4). Samples were filtered as described above and radioactivity retained on the membrane was measured. When basic or zwitterionic lipids were mixed with PG, each lipid was mixed in organic solvent, dried, and suspended in 250 μl of water (PG, 1.2 mg/ml). Lipid suspensions were sufficiently sonicated before use. An ATP releasing assay for E. coli DnaA protein was performed under conditions for E. coli DnaA protein, as described previously (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP binding and ATP releasing assays for both S. aureus DnaA protein and E. coli DnaA protein were performed under conditions for S. aureus DnaA protein, and releasing reactions were performed on ice or at 37 °C for various time periods (Fig. 4). Construction of S. aureus mprF Mutant—The S. aureus mprF mutant was constructed by integrational disruption through a single-crossover event (35Lindsay J.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as follows. An 804-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the internal region of the mprF gene was amplified by PCR using 5′-gcaatcacattgtatcgggag-3′ and 5′-cgggatccggtacaaaatagtacgcaa-3′ primers and chromosomal DNA extracted from RN4220 as template, then cloned into the SmaI site of the plasmid, pCK20. pCK20, containing both the E. coli pUC19-derived origin and the chloramphenicol-resistant gene, was constructed by self-ligation of the AflII-AvaII fragment of pND50 (29Inoue R. Kaito C. Tanabe M. Kamura K. Akimitsu N. Sekimizu K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to delete the S. aureus pUB110-derived origin. The resultant plasmid (pCK20-mprF) was electroporated into S. aureus RN4220, and homologous recombinants were selected on LB-agar plates containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and named CK1001. Southern blot hybridization was performed to ensure a single integration of pCK20-mprF into the chromosomal mprF locus. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometry analysis of S. aureus cells was performed as described previously (36Skarstad K. Bernander R. Boye E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The exponentially growing cells at 37 °C with an OD660 of 0.2 were treated with 100 μg/ml rifampicin and 10 μg/ml cephalexin for 4 h. The samples were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of wash buffer. Fixing solution (1 ml) was added to the suspensions and mixed by vortex. The fixed cells were treated with 800 μg/ml RNase A at 50 °C for 2 h and sonicated for 30 s to disrupt conjugation of the cells. After washing with TE buffer, samples were stained with a combination of ethidium bromide and mithramycin. Cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Effects of Total Lipid Isolated from S. aureus Cells on the Dissociation of ATP-DnaA—S. aureus DnaA protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. Purified protein had a single band of ∼50 kDa judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. S. aureus DnaA protein has a high affinity for ATP and ADP with K d values of 1 and 5 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). One molecule of DnaA protein bound to 0.1–0.3 molecules of ATP (Fig. 1), depending on the different preparations. Lipids from S. aureus were isolated during the exponential phase and stationary growth phase to compare their ability to facilitate the release of ATP from ATP-DnaA. Total lipid isolated from exponentially growing cells facilitated the release of ATP from DnaA protein (Fig. 2). The activity was dependent on the lipid dose and exposure time (Fig. 2). On the other hand, total lipid from stationary phase cells did not have this activity (Fig. 2). Unlike S. aureus, there was little difference in the action of the E. coli lipids between the two growth phases as described before (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PG Facilitates the Dissociation of ATP-DnaA—To determine the mechanism underlying the alterable interaction of DnaA protein with lipids, we examined which lipid was responsible for facilitating the dissociation of ATP-DnaA. Total lipid isolated from exponentially growing cells was fractionated by two-dimensional TLC and separated into eight fractions (Fig. 3A). In S. aureus cells, PG, CL, and LPG are the major phospholipids that form ∼98% of the total phospholipids (37White D. Frerman F. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 94: 1854-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Staining with Dittmer-Lester reagents revealed that fractions 4, 5, and 7 contained lipid phosphates (data not shown). Staining with ninhydrin reagent revealed that fraction 7 also contained amino groups (data not shown), indicating that fraction 7 contained LPG. The R F value of the lipid in fraction 5 on one-dimensional TLC was much the same as that of PG isolated from egg yolk (data not shown). Mass spectrometric analyses indicated that the molecular mass of the most abundant lipid in fraction 5 was 736, which corresponded to PG. Lipid in fraction 4 was determined to be CL by comparing the R F value from one-dimensional TLC with CL from bovine heart. Mass spectrometric analyses supported this conclusion (data not shown). Lipid in each fraction was isolated from the thin layer silica gel plate, suspended in water, and subjected to assay for the release of ATP from ATP-DnaA. Fraction 5 (PG) had the most potent activity (Fig. 3C). Fraction 8, which contained lipids from the entire region except for fractions 1–7, had weak, but significant activity (Fig. 3C). It remains uncertain which lipid(s) is responsible for the activity in fraction 8. There was no activity in fraction 4 (CL), possibly caused by the small amount of CL in the exponentially growing phase. CL purified from stationary phase cells had releasing activity as shown below (Fig. 5). PG purified from Fraction 5 facilitated the release of ATP bound to DnaA protein in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown) and the recovery of the activity from total lipid in fraction 5 was ∼45%. PG also facilitated the dissociation of ADP-DnaA (data not shown). These results suggest that PG was mainly responsible for facilitating the release of the ATP bound to DnaA protein in the total lipid of exponentially growing S. aureus cells, and confirmed the importance of PG in bacterial cell membranes for interaction with DnaA protein. There is a possibility that the PG-induced release of the nucleotide from S. aureus DnaA protein was the result of irreversible denaturation of the protein. Thus, we examined the ATP binding activity of S. aureus DnaA protein in the presence of PG. DnaA protein (4.2 pmol) was incubated on ice for 15 min in 5 μl of reaction buffer with PG (egg yolk; 3.1 μg) and 0.5–10 μm [α-32P]ATP (44,000 cpm/pmol), and bound nucleotides were then determined. The results indicated that DnaA protein binds to ATP in the presence of PG with a higher K d value (1.5 μm; data not shown) than in the absence of PG (1 nm; Fig. 1). The stoichiometry of bound ATP to DnaA protein in the presence of PG was 0.1, which was equivalent to that without PG. The results suggest that PG-induced dissociation of the nucleotide from S. aureus DnaA protein is not the result of irreversible denaturation of the protein, but rather of a decreased in affinity for the nucleotides. Effects of Temperature on the Dissociation of ATP-DnaA— Dissociation of the nucleotide form of E. coli DnaA protein by acidic phospholipid membrane required a temperature above the phase transition point (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the nucleotide dissociation from S. aureus DnaA protein proceeded on ice (Fig. 2). To examine whether the difference in these results was the result of a difference in the assay conditions, dissociation of ATP from S. aureus DnaA was compared with that from E. coli DnaA under the same assay conditions. When the dissociation of E. coli DnaA-ATP was performed under the conditions for S. aureus DnaA used in Fig. 2, dissociation of ATP from E. coli DnaA protein by PG did not occur on ice, but was observed at 37 °C (Fig. 4, C and D), consistent with the results under the conditions for E. coli DnaA protein (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, dissociation of ATP from S. aureus DnaA protein by PG took shorter time periods at 37 °C than on ice (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, facilitation of the"

For the first time the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima is shown here to contain such a MiaB tRNA-modifying enzyme, named MiaBTm, and to synthesize ms2i6A-37 as demonstrated by an analysis of modified nucleosides from tRNA hydrolysates.

Its amino acid sequence shares the CysXXX-CysXXCys sequence with MiaB from E. coli as well as with biotin synthase and lipoate synthase. This sequence was shown to be essential for chelation of an iron-sulfur center and for activity in these enzymes. As isolated, MiaBTm contains both iron and sulfide and an apoprotein form can coordinate up to 4 iron and 4 sulfur atoms per polypeptide chain. UV-visible absorption, resonance Raman, variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism, and EPR spectroscopy of MiaBTm indicate the presence of a [4Fe-4S]+2/+1 cluster under reducing and anaerobic conditions, whereas [3Fe-4S]+1 and [2Fe-2S]+2 forms are generated under aerobic conditions. The redox potential of the [4Fe-4S]+2/+1 transition is –495 ± 10 mV (versus the normal hydrogen electrode).

Grojean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1998: 441-469Google Scholar). They are formed by enzymatic modifications of the polynucleotide transcripts during the complex process of tRNA maturation (2Björk R.G. Söll D Rajbhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 23-85Google Scholar). Changes in the degree of tRNA modification have been invoked as a possible global regulatory mechanism by which cells respond to certain environmental stresses (3Björk R.G. Rasmuson T. Grojean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1998: 471-491Google Scholar). The importance of these modifications is well demonstrated by the fact that as much as 1% of the bacterial genome is devoted to tRNA modification (4Esberg B. Björk R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modified bases are located throughout the tRNA molecule, but the greatest variety is found in the anticodon loop. Some of these reactions of modification consist in the introduction of a sulfur atom to generate thionucleosides in tRNAs. The chemistry of the biological reactions leading to the synthesis of sulfur-containing metabolites is still not well understood and remains a very active field of research for bio-inorganic and bio-organic chemists. Among the metabolic pathways requiring further elucidation are those leading not only to sulfur-containing bases in RNA but also to iron-sulfur clusters (5Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), biotin (6Marquet A. Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 51-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), molybdopterin (7Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Our laboratories are investigating several of these biosynthetic reactions, and we report here our results on sulfur atom insertion reactions in tRNAs. In Escherichia coli four different thiolated nucleosides have been characterized. The best characterized biosynthetic pathway is that of 4-thiouridine, which is formed from uridine through a reaction catalyzed by the ThiI protein (10Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The tRNA modification leading to 2-methylthio-N-6-isopentenyl adenosine (ms2i6A-37) involves a chemically intriguing and difficult aromatic C-H to C-S bond conversion, the mechanism of which has yet to be investigated. The modified nucleoside ms2i6A-37 is found at position 37, next to the anticodon on the 3′ position in almost all eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs that read codons beginning with U except tRNAI,V Ser (11Grosjean H. Nicoghosian K. Haumont E. Söll D. Cedergren R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5697-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The postulated pathway for the synthesis of ms2i6A-37 and the proteins involved are shown in Fig. 1 (2Björk R.G. Söll D Rajbhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 23-85Google Scholar, 12Björk G.R. Hatfield. D.L. Lee. B.J. Pirtle R.M. Transfer in Protein Synthesis.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology, Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 861-886Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of ms2i6A-37 requires at least two enzymatic activities, and the corresponding genetic loci are designated miaA and miaB. A third gene, miaC, has been postulated but has not been identified (Fig. 1). In E. coli, the first step of the biosynthesis of ms2i6A-37 is the addition of the isopentenyl group to the N-6 nitrogen of adenosine. This reaction is catalyzed by the well characterized tRNA-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase enzyme, encoded by the miaA gene (14Moore J.A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 604-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Leung E.H.-C. Chen Y. Winkler M.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6546-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The second step, which is dependent on iron, cysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), consists of both sulfur insertion and methylation at position 2 of the base moiety but it is still unknown whether each reaction is catalyzed by a single enzyme (MiaB+MiaC) or both by the same enzyme MiaB (17Rosenberg A.H. Gefter M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Gefter M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 36: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Agris P.F. Armstrong D.J. Schäfer K.P. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1975; 2: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, tRNAs from mutant strains lacking a functional miaB gene have been shown to contain only i6A-37, the product of the first step of the pathway, suggesting that the MiaB protein is involved at least in C-S bond formation (20Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C.T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main feature of MiaB protein sequences, which has emerged from the first sequence determination (20Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C.T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been strongly substantiated when significant comparisons became possible (21Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 215-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is the presence of highly conserved motifs. The N-terminal half of all MiaB enzymes contains a strictly conserved canonical cysteine triad CysXXXCysXXCys, which is also found in biotin and lipoate synthases. In these two enzymes, which also catalyze C-H to C-S bond conversion reactions, this motif was shown to provide cysteine ligands for a catalytically essential [4Fe-4S]+2/+1 cluster. Furthermore, it is the signature for a superfamily of iron-sulfur enzymes involved in a great variety of biosynthetic pathways and metabolic processes that function via radical mechanisms (22Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetsler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Because we recently showed that MiaB from E. coli was an iron-sulfur protein with one [4Fe-4S] cluster per polypeptide chain and that the three cysteines of the CysXXXCysXXCys motif were required for activity (23Pierrel F. Björk G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it is very likely that MiaB, biotin synthase, and lipoate synthase employ similar radical mechanisms for activation of sulfur and its insertion into their respective substrates. Thermotoga maritima is a hyperthermophilic bacterium with an optimal growth temperature of 80 °C and is one of the deepest and most slowly evolving eubacterial lineage (24Boccheta M. Gribaldo S. Sanangelantoni A. Cammarano P. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The genomic sequence of T. maritima shows an ORF (TM0653) encoding a putative MiaB tRNA-methylthiotransferase. Because MiaB from E. coli proved quite difficult to manipulate and characterize and to gain more insight into the structure of the MiaB enzymes, we have extended our work on thiolation of tRNAs by investigating the MiaB protein from T. maritima. We report its purification and characterization, and show that it displays some properties (stability and homogeneity of the ironsulfur cluster) that have not been observed with other enzymes of the “radical-SAM” superfamily. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protein is indeed a MiaB enzyme because its expression in an E. coli strain lacking its own miaB gene (20Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C.T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in the formation of ms2i6A. Finally, we show that the modified nucleoside ms2i6A is actually present in tRNA from T. maritima. E. coli DH5α was used for routine DNA manipulations. E. coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL™ (Stratagene), which contains extra copies of genes encoding tRNA with codons rarely used in E. coli (argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes) was used to produce the recombinant protein. T. maritima (strain DSMZ3109) was a gift from the laboratory of Professor Robert Huber (University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). E. coli strain TX3346 miaB– was a gift of Professor Malcolm E. Winkler (University of Texas, Houston, TX). All DNA manipulations were as described previously (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France). T4 DNA ligase was from Promega, Inc. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase and plasmid DNA purification kit, Flexiprep™, were from Amersham Biosciences. DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gel and purified with the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express Co. (Grenoble, France). The TM0653 gene, encoding the MiaB protein named MiaBTm, was identified from the GenBank™ data base using the BLAST search algorithm (26Atschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59416) Google Scholar). The open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method using genomic DNA of T. maritima as a template. The following primers were used: 5′-gggaggtcgcatATGagattttacataaag-3′ (NdeI site underlined, ATG codon in uppercase) hybridized to the noncoding strand at the 5′ terminus of the gene and 5′-gacaagggaagaaagcttgtccaccgtcgtg-3′ (HindIII site underlined) hybridized to the coding strand, ∼25 bp after the TGA stop codon. PCR was run on a Stratagene RoboCycler Gradient 40 machine as follows. Genomic DNA (0.5–1 μg) was denatured for 4 min at 95 °C in the presence of the primers (0.5 μm each). The Pwo DNA polymerase (2 units) and deoxynucleotide mix (0.2 mm each) were added, and 25 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) were then performed followed by a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase into the pT7-7 plasmid previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The cloned gene was entirely sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced during PCR reaction. The plasmid was then named pT7-MiaBTm. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL™. The transformation of competent cells was carried out following the instructions of the manufacturer. Then a single colony from a LB plate was transferred into 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). The bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C, and 50 ml of this culture were used to inoculate 10 liters of fresh LB medium supplemented with the same antibiotics. Bacterial growth proceeds at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.4, the time at which protein expression was induced by adding 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected after 3 h of culture at 37 °C by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 10 °C, then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 200 mm NaCl and stored at –70 °C until use. The frozen cells were thawed, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 220,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min. The cell-free extracts were heated at 75 °C for 15 min, and the denatured E. coli proteins were eliminated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The nucleic acids were partially eliminated by adding 0.04% polyethyleneimine. The proteins present in the supernatant were precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8; 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1.5 m ammonium sulfate was added to reach a final concentration of 1 m ammonium sulfate. The solution was then loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted by a linear gradient from 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon cell fitted with a YM30 (Spectrapor) membrane. The protein was then loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT. The colored fractions that contained the protein were pooled, and DTT was removed from the protein solution by using Centricon 30 devices (Amicon). The pure protein was divided into aliquots and stored frozen at –70 °C until use. Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration with a Superdex 200 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used for size determination. The running buffer was 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with a gel filtration calibration kit (calibration proteins II, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein-bound iron was removed by overnight exposure to EDTA (10 mm) under reducing conditions (10 mm sodium dithionite) at 4 °C. After incubation, the colorless protein was loaded onto a Sephadex NAP-25 gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl. The apoMiaBTm was then washed and concentrated with the same buffer using Centricon 30 devices (Amicon). All the following procedures were carried out anaerobically inside a glove box containing less than 2 ppm O2. The apoMiaBTm was treated with 2 mm DTT for 20 min and then a 6 m excess of Na2S and FeCl3, from a solution containing DTT, were added. The mixture was incubated for 3 h and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column. The dark brown fractions were collected and concentrated using an Amicon cell. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) and also checked using a Bicinchonic Acid Protein Kit Assay (Sigma) with the same standard. Iron was determined by the method of Fish (28Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and inorganic sulfide was quantified as described by Beinert (29Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Total tRNA from T. maritima (strain DSMZ3109) was prepared essentially as described by Buck et al. (30Buck M. Connick M. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). tRNA samples were digested to nucleosides by the method of Gehrke et al. (31Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Journal of Chromatography Library. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: A3-A71Google Scholar) by using nuclease P1 and bacterial alkaline phosphatase. 50–100 μg of tRNA was loaded onto LC-18 HPLC column (Vydac) connected to a HP-1100 HPLC system. The gradient profile developed by Gehrke and Kuo was used to separate the different nucleosides (31Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Journal of Chromatography Library. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: A3-A71Google Scholar). DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed using the DNA Strider 1.3 software package. Sequence comparisons and homology searches implemented the BLAST program (26Atschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59416) Google Scholar) at the NCBI server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (32Higgins D.G.

Light Absorption—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)—X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Brucker Instruments ESP 300D spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 flow cryostat (4.2–300 K). Spectra were quantified under non-saturating conditions by double integration against a 1 mm CuEDTA standard. Resonance Raman (RR)—RR spectra were recorded using an Instruments SA U1000 spectrometer fitted with a cooled RCA 31034 photo-multiplier tube with 90° scattering geometry. Spectra were recorded digitally using photon-counting electronics, and improvements in signal-to-noise were achieved by signal averaging multiple scans. Band positions were calibrated using the excitation frequency and CCl4 and are accurate to ±1 cm–1. Lines from a Coherent Sabre 10-W argon ion laser were used for excitation, and plasma lines were removed using a Pellin Broca prism premonochromator. For each sample, ∼200 mW of incident laser power was used, and slit widths were adjusted for each excitation wavelength to give 8.0 cm–1 spectral resolution. Scattering was collected from the surface of a frozen 18-μl droplet of sample using a custom designed anaerobic sample cell (33Drozdzewski P.M. Johnson M.K. Appl. Spectrosc. 1988; 42: 1575-1577Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) attached to the cold finger of an Air Products Displex model CSA-202E closed cycle refrigerator. This enables samples to be cooled down to 17 K, which facilitates improved spectral resolution and prevents laser-induced sample degradation. A linear ramp fluorescent background has been subtracted from each spectrum shown in this work. Variable Temperature Magnetic Circular Dichroism (VTMCD)—VT-MCD measurements were made on samples containing 60% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 1-mm cuvettes using a Jasco J-715 (180–1000 nm) spectropolarimeter mated to an Oxford Instruments SM4000 split-coil superconducting magnet. The experimental protocols for measuring anaerobic MCD spectra over the temperature range 1.5–300 K with magnetic fields up to 6 T have been described elsewhere (34Johnson M.K. Que L., Jr. Metal Clusters in Proteins. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1988: 326-342Google Scholar, 35Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. George S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The MCD intensities are expressed as Δϵ(ϵLCP– ϵRCP), where ϵLCP and ϵRCP are the molar extinction coefficients for the absorption of left and right circularly polarized light, respectively. Electrochemical experiments were performed in a closed three-electrode cell as described previously (36Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The three-electrode design included a saturated Ag/AgCl reference micro-electrode MI-401F from Microelectrode Inc, a platinum wire counter electrode from EG&G Instruments, and a gold working electrode from Radiometer. The three electrodes were connected to a EG&G Instruments model 273A potentiostat/galvanostat controlled with model software. The gold disc tip of the working electrode was hand-polished with Al2O3 and cleaned with distilled water before each analysis of sample. Reconstituted protein (200 μm) was prepared under anaerobic conditions in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 200 mm NaCl. The solution (10–20 μl) was transferred with a Hamilton gas-tight syringe on the working electrode, and other electrodes were positioned to contact the drop. The measurement was carried out anaerobically at 25 °C, with a pulse height of 80 mV, a frequency of 20 Hz, and a potential increment of 2 mV. Amino Acid Sequence Comparisons—Using the BLAST search algorithm against the protein data base with the sequence of MiaB from E. coli as a query, we were able to identify three putative MiaB proteins in the genome of T. maritima (37Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M.

Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). We selected the protein encoded by the gene TM0653, which we named MiaBTm, because it displays the highest alignment score E value (E = 3 × 10–87) to MiaB from E. coli. As shown below, it proved to be catalytically competent for biosynthesis of ms2i6A. The function of the two other miaB-like genes, which display much lower E values, remains to be determined. MiaBTm contains the canonic cysteine residue pattern CysXXXCysXXCys (Cys shown as open triangles in Fig. 2), which has been shown to be important for the activity of the E. coli enzyme (23Pierrel F. Björk G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment also shows that the three additional strictly conserved cysteines in the sequence of MiaB from E. coli and closely related organisms (Cys shown as black triangles in Fig. 2) were present in the three proteins (21Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 215-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These additional conserved cysteines occur near the beginning of the N-terminal region (∼100 amino acids), which is highly conserved, and in the case of E. coli were shown to be also essential for activity (20Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C.T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2F. Pierrel, G. R. Björk, M. Fontecave, and M. Atta, unpublished results. Furthermore, MiaBTm shares with the other MiaB enzymes a sequence of 60–80 residues, in the C-terminal part, which is proposed to form a domain reminiscent of the β-barrel RNA-binding domains (21Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 215-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The five predicted β strands of this domain are marked with black boxes in Fig. 2. This domain was named TRAM (for TRM2 and MiaB) and is most likely the domain of MiaB that binds the tRNA substrate. MiaBTm thus consists of 443 amino acids, and the molecular mass of the apoprotein as calculated from the sequence is 50,710 Da, comparable with that of the E. coli enzyme (53,600 Da). Analysis of tRNA Nucleoside Composition from T. maritima by HPLC—Total tRNA from T. maritima cells was prepared and digested with nuclease P1 and phosphatase, and the released nucleosides were analyzed by HPLC. The elution profile of a tRNA hydrolysate is shown in Fig. 3. A nucleoside with a retention time (84 min) corresponding to the one of ms2i6A was detected. Moreover, this modified nucleoside has a UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 3, inset) identical to that of ms2i6A from E. coli (31Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Journal of Chromatography Library. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: A3-A71Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the tRNA from T. maritima contains the ms2i6A modified nucleoside and that as a consequence these bacteria have a MiaB enzyme for introduction of the sulfur atom. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of the MiaB Protein from T. maritima—The open reading frame (ORF) TM0653 was amplified from the genomic DNA by PCR reaction technology and cloned into a pT7-7 vector. The E. coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL™ strain was transformed with the resulting expression vector, named pT7-MiaBTm, which establishes control over TM0653 gene expression with the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of the transformed E. coli cells resulted in the over-production of a protein that migrates at ∼50 kDa on SDS gels (Fig. 4, lane 2) and was found mainly in the soluble fraction of cell free extracts (Fig. 4, lane 3). After the final step of purification, the purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE to be over 95% (Fig. 4, lane 7). Typical yields were ∼40 mg of pure protein from a 10-liter culture. The apparent molecular mass of MiaBTm determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200) showed that the protein is mainly a monomer in solution (data not shown). Indeed, whereas the pure protein eluted in different peaks corresponding to multimeric, dimeric, and monomeric states, the latter was by far the major one. When 5 mm DTT was added in the protein solution and in the eluting buffer, only the monomer was observed. The TM0653 Gene from T. maritima Complements the m"

We have therefore investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin in the regulation of fructose absorption by PKC βII phosphorylation. In isolated jejunal loops, stimulation of fructose absorption by PMA was inhibited by preperfusion with wortmannin or rapamycin, which blocked GLUT2 activation and insertion into the brush-border membrane. Antibodies to the last 18 and last 10 residues of the C-terminal region of PKC βII recognized several species differentially in Western blots. Extensive cleavage of native enzyme (80/78 kDa) to a catalytic domain product of 49 kDa occurred. PMA and sugars provoked turnover and degradation of PKC βII by dephosphorylation to a 42-kDa species, which was converted to polyubiquitylated species detected at 180 and 250+ kDa. PMA increased the level of the PKC βII 49-kDa species, which correlates with the GLUT2 level; wortmannin and rapamycin blocked these effects of PMA. Rapamycin and wortmannin inhibited PKC βII turnover. PI3-kinase, PDK-1, and protein kinase B were present in the brush-border membrane, where their levels were increased by PMA and blocked by the inhibitors. We conclude that GLUT2-mediated fructose absorption is regulated through PI3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent pathways, which control phosphorylation of PKC βII and its substrate-induced turnover and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms for short term control of intestinal sugar absorption by insulin and amino acids.

Intestinal glucose absorption comprises two components (for a review, see Ref. 1Kellett G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 585-595Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is well established that one of these is an active component mediated by the Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1. We have proposed that the other is a facilitated component mediated by glucose-dependent activation and recruitment of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane. GLUT2 recruitment correlates with SGLT1-dependent activation of PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PKB, protein kinase B; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PKB, protein kinase B; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. βII (2Kellett G.L. Helliwell P.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) so that SGLT1 is now seen to exert an important regulatory role in addition to its established functions as a scavenger and transporter (1Kellett G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 585-595Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Regulation of the facilitated component may also involve mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase- and PI3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways (3Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The K a and Jmax of the facilitated component are 2- and 3-fold, respectively, of those for SGLT1 in vivo. After a meal, the average concentration across the luminal contents of rat jejunum reaches 48 mm (4Ferraris R.S. Yarshapour S. Lloyd K.C.K. Mirzayan R. Diamond J. Amer. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G822-G837PubMed Google Scholar), close to the K m of the facilitated component, and much higher concentrations may well be present locally at the brush-border membrane, as a result of the hydrolysis of complex dietary sugars (5Pappenheimer J.R. Amer. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G409-G417PubMed Google Scholar). The facilitated component therefore appears to provide the major route by which glucose is absorbed immediately after a meal. Moreover, the activation of GLUT2 and its rapid trafficking to and from the brush-border membrane in response to changing glucose concentrations provides a cooperative mechanism by which absorptive capacity is matched precisely to dietary intake.GLUT2 transports not only glucose but also fructose (6Cheeseman C.I. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1050-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Fructose absorption across the brush-border membrane is therefore mediated by both GLUT5, which is specific for fructose, and GLUT2 (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Phloretin, which inhibits GLUT2 but not GLUT5, may be used separate out the contributions of each transporter to fructose transport. In this way, we were able to show that a 4-fold stimulation of fructose absorption by PMA in isolated loops in vitro was matched by a 4-fold increase in the level of GLUT2 at the brush-border membrane and correlated with the activation of PKC βII (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The level of GLUT5 and its contribution to absorption did not change significantly.Support for the model of rapid, GLUT2-mediated up-regulation of sugar absorption has been provided by the observation that glucagon-like peptide 2 promotes rapid insertion of GLUT2 into the brush-border membrane (8Au A. Gupta A. Schembri P. Cheeseman C.I. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, a definitive confirmation of the model has recently been provided by the observation that when the intestine of wild type mice is challenged with sugars by gastric intubation, a large increase in fructose transport occurs within minutes; the increase in transport does not occur in GLUT2-null mice and is attributable entirely to GLUT2 (9Gouyon F. Caillaud L. Carrière Dalet V. Dalet D. Citadelle A. Leturque A. Thorens B. Brot-Laroche E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 58: 274Google Scholar).The intrinsic activity of PKC βII is controlled by phosphorylation at three sites, one in the activation loop and two in the C-terminal region, located at Thr-500, Thr-641, and the hydrophobic site Ser-660, respectively (10Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation at all three sites serves to lock the enzyme into a catalytically competent conformation, which is then regulated by membrane-bound phosphatidylserine and also by second messengers Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. The first step in the production of mature PKC βII is phosphorylation of Thr-500 by PDK-1, which is blocked by inhibitors of PI3-kinase, since the latter regulates PDK-1 (13Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 14Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-500 then permits autophosphorylation of Thr-641 and Ser-660 (16Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC βII is tightly coupled to phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site Ser-660, which greatly increases affinity for Ca2+ (17Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site in PKC δ and PKC ϵ is sensitive to rapamycin (18Ziegler W.H.

Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-43764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for mTOR in controlling phosphorylation at this site, possibly by regulating the activity of a phosphatase (12Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).In our previous work, we implicated PKC βII in the PMA-induced stimulation of the GLUT2-mediated component of fructose absorption by using chelerythrine, which inhibits PKC βII activity by binding directly to the catalytic site (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have now used inhibitors of PI3-kinase and mTOR, wortmannin and rapamycin, respectively, to inhibit the activities of the intracellular signaling pathways that stimulate the phosphorylation and intrinsic activity of PKC βII. Using this quite different approach, we have reproduced and extended our previous results to confirm the involvement of PKC βII in the regulation of GLUT2 trafficking to the brush-border membrane. The data suggest new mechanisms for the regulation of fructose and glucose absorption by insulin and amino acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Male Wistar rats (240–260 g) were fed ad libitum on standard Bantin and Kingman rat and mouse diet with free access to water.Perfusion of Jejunal Loops—Rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 ml of Hypnorm (Janssen) and 0.4 ml of Hypnovel (Roche Applied Science) per kg of body weight. The systems for the luminal perfusion of jejunal loops in vitro and in vivo have been described in detail previously (2Kellett G.L. Helliwell P.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Corpe C.P. Basaleh M.M. Affleck J. Gould G.W. Jess T.J. Kellett G.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because PKC activators and inhibitors take some time to become effective in whole tissue and because there is a limit to the time of viability for isolated loops in vitro, the following procedure for the treatment of jejunum with drugs was adopted. Jejunum was first perfused luminally in vivo with 5 mmd-fructose (plus 1 mm β-hydroxybutyrate as an energy source) in the presence or absence of drugs; the perfusion system was a gas-segmented, single pass system with perfusate and gas flow rates of 0.75 and 0.38 ml min–1, respectively. For each and every perfusion, fructose was present in the perfusate throughout the entire perfusion. Jejunum was perfused with 200 nm PMA for 30 min or with chelerythrine for 45 min; when they were perfused in combination, PMA was added to the perfusate 15 min after the inhibitors. At the end of the in vivo treatment period, the cannulated loop was then excised and perfused in vitro using the gas-segmented, recirculated flow system: 5 mmd-fructose and the combination of drugs at the end of in vivo treatment period were perfused luminally through the jejunum for 60 min; the flow rates of perfusate and gas were 7.5 and 3.4 ml min–1, respectively. Control perfusions were performed in which no drugs were present; these showed that there was no falling off in the d-fructose uptake rate after the initial approach to the steady-state, confirming that this approach to drug treatment and perfusion ensured that the jejunum was viable for the whole experimental period from the start of the in vivo perfusion to the finish of the in vitro perfusion. Samples (0.05 ml) were taken from the perfusate at 5-min intervals throughout the in vitro perfusion. After measurement of fructose concentration with a COBAS automatic analyzer using a test kit (Roche Applied Science), the amount of fructose remaining in the perfusate was calculated with correction for losses in perfusate volume caused by water transport. Because the perfusate is recirculated, the concentration of fructose decreases with time; it was therefore necessary to limit the period over which the rate of transport was measured to one in which the concentration decreased by no more than 20%. Over such periods, plots of luminal perfusate content versus time are effectively linear. The rate of fructose transport, expressed as μmol min–1 (g of dry weight)–1, was therefore determined by linear regression analysis as the average rate of disappearance over this period from the luminal perfusate in vitro.Membrane Vesicle Preparation—Brush-border membrane vesicles were made as described previously (20Corpe C.P. Basaleh M.M. Affleck J. Gould G.W. Jess T.J. Kellett G.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); every stage of the preparation was performed at 0–4 °C to prevent changes in trafficking after the intestine had been excised. Briefly, the jejuna of two rats were perfused with drugs as described above. The timing of the final in vitro perfusion was such as to get as direct a correspondence as possible between rates of transport and extent of trafficking; perfusions for vesicle preparations were therefore terminated at a time point corresponding to half the time period over which the average rate of transport was determined as described above. Immediately after perfusion, each jejunum was flushed with ice-cold buffered mannitol (20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm mannitol and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to arrest trafficking of GLUT2 and to trap any labile intermediates of PKC βII at the membrane. Jejunum was then placed on an ice-cold glass plate and slit longitudinally so that the muscle of the jejunum flattened out on to the cold plate. Mucosal scrapings were taken with an ice-cold glass slide and homogenized immediately at 4 °C in buffered mannitol using a Kinematica Polytron homogenizer (4× 30-s bursts using the large probe at setting 7). The rest of the preparation and its detailed characterization for purity are as described by Corpe et al. (20Corpe C.P. Basaleh M.M. Affleck J. Gould G.W. Jess T.J. Kellett G.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At the end, the preparation was revesiculated and rinsed three times to ensure that all cytosolic contaminants were removed. Enrichment of sucrase activity in these highly purified preparations ranged from 16- to 20-fold; there was no significant enrichment of Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Dephosphorylation of brush-border membrane vesicles with protein phosphatase 1A (PP1A) was performed as described by Keranen et al. (10Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Affinity Purification of PKC βII—All procedures took place at 4 °C. C10 antibody was coupled to protein A-Sepharose 4B fast flow resin (Sigma) with disuccinimidyl suberate and packed into a Bio-Rad Econocolumn (0.5 × 0.5 cm). The column was washed and stored in phosphate buffered saline (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) until use. Brush-border membrane vesicles were solubilized to 0.5 mg of protein/ml–1 in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2VO3,25mm NaF, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, plus 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.2% (w/v) SDS and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. The soluble fraction was diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and precleared on an antibody-free protein A column. The flow-through (protein eluate) from this column was loaded onto the antibody column at <0.2 ml min–1, after which the column was washed (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were then eluted with 1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), plus 0.2% (w/v) SDS. The collected fractions were precipitated with 6% (v/v) perchloric acid and then spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Separated samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by Western blotting and immunoblotted using a polyclonal antibody to ubiquitin raised in rabbit kindly supplied by Professor R. J. Mayer (Nottingham).Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed as described previously using ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Corpe C.P. Basaleh M.M. Affleck J. Gould G.W. Jess T.J. Kellett G.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). C10 antibody to the last 10 C-terminal amino acids of PKC βII (Fig. 1) was raised in rabbit by Professor N. Groome (Oxford Brookes University). A C18 antibody to the last 18 amino acids of PKC βII (Fig. 1, not phosphorylated at Ser-660) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Antibodies to the last 14 amino acids at the C terminus of GLUT2 and GLUT5 were raised in rabbits. All antibodies were polyclonal. Neutralization of each antibody by preincubation with excess of the corresponding antigenic peptide abolished labeling, confirming the specificity of the antibodies. Quantitation of Western blots was performed using a Flowgen AlphaImager 1200 analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Protein levels (as indicated by band intensities) determined in vesicle preparations from jejunum were expressed relative to those in control preparations. A liver GLUT2 standard was routinely used in blotting experiments. The linear range of intensity response in ECL photographs was established using a 20-fold range of the amount of an actin standard (2–40 μg). After background correction, the response was linear (correlation coefficient 0.996) for integrated density values ranging from 13,024 to 465,029. As much as possible, exposures were such that the intensity values fell within the middle third of the linear response range. The same loading of 15 μg of protein was used for all samples. Comparison of relative levels of target proteins was made on a total protein basis to minimize potential complications that might be caused by the trafficking of other proteins in response to the same stimuli that affect the trafficking of target proteins.Statistical Analysis—Values are presented as means + S.E. and were tested for significance using Student's t test.RESULTSFor each and every perfusion, fructose (5 mm) was present in the perfusate throughout the entire perfusion. To establish the effect of an inhibitor on the stimulation of the absorption of fructose by PMA, isolated loops of rat jejunum in vitro were perfused with PMA (200 nm) in the absence or presence of inhibitor. The concentrations of rapamycin and wortmannin were 25 and 200 nm, respectively; at these concentrations, the action of the inhibitors on their target enzymes are thought to be relatively specific. Since the drugs take some time to work and isolated loops of jejunum in vitro have limited viability, jejunum was preperfused in vivo with inhibitor for 45 min before in vitro perfusion was commenced, and PMA was introduced into the perfusate 15 min after inhibitor (for full experimental details, see Ref. 7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Phloretin (0.2 mm), which inhibits GLUT2 but not GLUT5, was used to resolve the two absorption components. This was achieved by perfusing in vitro for a control period in the absence of phloretin and then for a further 30 min in its presence; the final steady state rate over the last 15 min was measured. Fig. 1 shows that PMA increased the rate of fructose transport to 1.7-fold (p < 0.001) as compared with untreated control jejunum. Stimulation reflected a 4-fold increase in the GLUT2-mediated component and was completely blocked by preperfusion with either rapamycin or wortmannin, each of which alone had no effect on overall fructose absorption and its components. Thus, rapamycin and wortmannin had effects on PMA-stimulated fructose transport similar to those found for chelerythrine (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ro-31-8220 exerts similar effects to chelerythrine (data not shown).In that previous work with chelerythrine, we provided evidence that the increase in GLUT2-mediated absorption induced by PMA is matched by a corresponding increase of GLUT2 in the brush-border membrane. These changes correlated with activation of PKC βII, and there was little change in GLUT5-mediated transport and GLUT5 level (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Vesicles were therefore prepared from jejunum perfused first in vivo and in vitro to determine the levels of transporters and PKC βII in response to rapamycin and wortmannin. Protein trafficking was arrested by flushing with ice-cold perfusate immediately before excision of jejunum (7Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J.A. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Helliwell P.A. Kellett G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 579-589Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The timing of the final in vitro perfusion was such as to get as direct a correspondence as possible between rates of transport and extent of trafficking. Perfusions for vesicle preparations were therefore terminated at a time point corresponding to half the time period over which the average rate of absorption was determined as described above. Vesicles were then Western blotted using antisera to the C-terminal 14 amino acids of GLUT5 or GLUT2. GLUT5 appeared as a triplet from 53 to 58 kDa and GLUT2 as a tightly spaced doublet from 61 to 63 kDa (Fig. 2). The distinct banding patterns confirmed that there was no cross-reactivity between antibody to one transporter and the other transporter; in addition, antibody to a sequence within the extracellular loop of GLUT2 gave similar results to the C-terminal antibody (8Au A. Gupta A. Schembri P. Cheeseman C.I. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All bands were eliminated by preincubation of antiserum with excess of the corresponding antigenic peptide, confirming the specificity of GLUT5 and the GLUT2 antisera for their target transporters (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that PMA increased the level of GLUT2 3.9 ± 0.6-fold as compared with control. Rapamycin blocked PMA-induced trafficking of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane so that GLUT2 remained at control levels. GLUT5 levels were not significantly different from control levels in any other condition. Wortmannin behaved similarly to rapamycin.Fig. 2The effect of PMA, rapamycin (rap), and wortmannin (wort) on the levels of GLUT5 and GLUT2 and on the turnover of PKC βII. Brush-border membrane vesicles were prepared from rat jejunum perfused with 5 mmd-fructose in the presence and absence of PMA and/or inhibitor, either rapamycin or wortmannin as described in the legend for Fig. 1. Perfusion was terminated by flushing with ice-cold perfusate to arrest trafficking and to trap all intermediates at the membrane. For full details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Vesicle protein (15 μg) was then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blotted for GLUT5, GLUT2, and PKC βII using C18 and 10 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Western blots were performed with C18 antibody raised against the C-terminal sequence residues 656–673 of PKC βII. C18 antibody recognized a doublet at 80 and 78 kDa and a single band at 49 kDa. All bands were eliminated by preincubation of antiserum with excess C18 peptide (data not shown). PMA strongly increases the intensity of the 49-kDa band. It also increases the intensities of the doublet, although to a lesser extent. Translocation of conventional PKC isoenzymes to a target membrane is widely taken as an indicator of activation, which is often accompanied by calpain-dependent cleavage in the hinge region to a constitutively active catalytic domain of ∼50 kDa. The activity of this form is independent of any activators, such as diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and Ca2+ because of the separation of the catalytic unit from the regulatory domain and coincidentally from the pseudosubstrate in the N-terminal sequence (22Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4088-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schaap D. Hsuan J. Totty N. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 431-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since the 80-/78-kDa bands correspond to those for two control standards (rat brain homogenate and a postnuclear liver membrane preparation, data not shown) and the standards either do not show or show only a light 49-kDa band, the 80-/78-kDa species must represent native (uncleaved) forms of the enzyme, and the 49-kDa band must represent the C-terminal catalytic domain. PKC βII in intestine appears to be particularly susceptible to cleavage, a phenomenon we have seen under many other conditions. The catalytic domain does not possess binding sites for diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine in the membrane, yet is found in vesicles. It should therefore be noted that at the end of a preparation, vesicles are revesiculated several times through a 21-gauge needle so that the presence of the catalytic domain in vesicles is not caused by simple, physical trapping of cytosolic proteins as vesicles reseal during preparation. That we detect the catalytic domain strongly in vesicles most likely reflects the fact that jejunum is flushed with ice-cold perfusate immediately before excision to prevent the rapid trafficking of GLUT2 away from the membrane. Coincidentally, this procedure traps the catalytic domain cleavage product in association with its (unknown) substrate. Rapamycin completely blocks the PMA-induced increase in the intensity of the 49-kDa species and, on its own, decreases band intensity as compared with control. Wortmannin decreased the PMA-induced increase in the intensity of the 49-kDa species, although not as effectively as rapamycin. When perfused alone, wortmannin had no effect on band intensity as compared with control. PKC βII activation, as indicated by the intensity of the 49-kDa band, correlates with the increase in brush border GLUT2 level, as reported previously (2Kellett G.L. Helliwell P.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3Helliwell P.A. Richardson M. Affleck J. Kellett G.L. Biochem.

The banding pattern with C10 antibody was very different from that with C18 antibody. The C10 antibody detects the 80-/78-kDa doublet only very weakly. However, it recognizes the catalytic domain at 49-kDa strongly; in addition, it also"

We investigated the contribution of this protein in normal β-cell function by using a viral gene transfer approach to alter Cx36 content in the insulin-producing line of INS-1E cells and rat pancreatic islets. Transcripts for Cx43, Cx45, and Cx36 were detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR in freshly isolated pancreatic islets, whereas only a transcript for Cx36 was detected in INS-1E cells. After infection with a sense viral vector, which induced de novo Cx36 expression in the Cx-defective HeLa cells we used to control the transgene expression, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and freeze-fracture analysis showed a large increase of Cx36 within INS-1E cell membranes. In contrast, after infection with an antisense vector, Cx36 content was decreased by 80%. Glucose-induced insulin release and insulin content were decreased, whether infected INS-1E cells expressed Cx36 levels that were largely higher or lower than those observed in wild-type control cells. In both cases, basal insulin secretion was unaffected. Comparable observations on basal secretion and insulin content were made in freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets. The data indicate that large changes in Cx36 alter insulin content and, at least in INS-1E cells, also affect glucose-induced insulin release.

Gap junction channels provide enclosed conduits for direct exchange of signaling molecules, such as ions and metabolites, between cells. These conduits have pore diameters large enough to ensure passage of metabolites and signaling molecules with a mass as high as 1000 Da (1Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). This type of intercellular communication permits coordinated cellular activity and allows cells to review the functional state of their neighbors (1Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J.

Exp. Dermatol. 2000; 9: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Six Cx molecules, arranged so that their third transmembrane domain lines the channel lumen, compose the hemichannels, or connexons, that are contributed by each cell of a coupled pair. Previous studies have shown that the presence of gap junctions between β-cells is required for proper control of insulin secretion. Thus, single β-cells, which are not coupled by Cx channels, exhibit poor insulin gene expression, release low amounts of the hormone, and barely increase these functions after stimulation (6Bosco D. Meda P. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Restoration of β-cell contacts is paralleled by a rapid improvement of both insulin biosynthesis and release (7Meda P. Bosco D. Chanson M. Giordano E. Vallar L. Wollheim C. Orci L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Meda P. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 1996; 57: 481-483PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-cells expressing Cx43 show increased insulin content, suggesting that cell-cell communication might be important for β-cell function (9Vozzi C. Ullrich S. Charollais A. Philippe J. Orci L. Meda P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice expressing exogenous Cx32 in their β-cells, reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin content were also observed (10Charollais A. Gjinovci A. Huarte J. Bauquis J. Nadal A. Martin F. Andreu E. Sanchez-Andres J.V. Calabrese A. Bosco D. Soria B. Wollheim C.B. Herrera P.L. Meda P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Cx36 is the major Cx expressed in neuronal cells (11Condorelli D.F. Parenti R. Spinella F. Trovato Salinaro A. Belluardo N. Cardile V. Cicirata F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 12Condorelli D.F. Belluardo N. Trovato-Salinaro A. Mudo G. Brain Res.

Brain Res. 2000; 865: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies against Cx36, we found recently that this Cx is also the predominant, if not the sole, Cx isoform expressed by insulin-producing β-cells of pancreatic islets (14Serre-Beinier V. Le Gurun S. Belluardo N. Trovato-Salinaro A. Charollais A. Haefliger J.A. Condorelli D.F. Meda P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To study whether Cx36 may contribute to control insulin secretion and content, we first searched for a line of insulin-producing cells that retains glucose-induced insulin secretion and expresses Cx36. We used the recently developed INS-1E cell line (15Janjic D. Maechler P. Sekine N. Bartley C. Annen A.S. Wolheim C.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which was derived from parental INS-1 cells (16Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). We then modified Cx36 content of INS-1E cells using an adenoviral gene transfer approach. Insulin content and glucose-induced insulin release were decreased in INS-1E cells, which expressed amounts of Cx36 largely higher or lower, respectively, than those observed in native INS-1E cells. These results were confirmed in isolated rat pancreatic islets with regard to insulin content. Cell Line and Rat Islet Isolation—Clonal INS-1E cells (15Janjic D. Maechler P. Sekine N. Bartley C.

This medium has long been preferred for cultures of pancreatic islets and insulin-producing cell lines derived thereof, because it preserved, better that other culture media, normal β-cell functions, including insulin content and secretion (17Nielsen J.H.

INS-1E cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator, gassed with air and CO2 to maintain medium pH at 7.4, fed at 3-day intervals, and passed by trypsinization once per week. Our institutional review committee for animal experiments approved all of the procedures for rat care, surgery, and euthanasia. Adult rats weighing 250–350 g were anesthetized by inhalation of 5% halothane (Arovet AG), sacrificed, and immediately used for pancreas sampling. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreas of male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion. After purification on a Ficoll gradient (Sigma), the isolated islets were washed twice in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 110 units/ml penicillin, 110 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For static experiments, batches of 10 islets were handpicked under a microscope. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and Northern Blot Analysis—INS-1E cells were homogenized in Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science), and total RNA was extracted using the kit procedure. For RT-PCR, total RNA was treated 30 min in the presence of DNase I (DNA-free kit, Ambion, Cambridge, UK). One-μg aliquots of DNase-treated RNA were reverse-transcribed using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega), as described in the kit procedure. One-half of the reverse-transcribed products was used for PCR reaction in the presence of 20 ng of sense and antisense primers, using recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The products obtained after 30 PCR cycles (Biometra) were analyzed on an agarose gel. Negative controls included amplification of INS-1E samples that had not been reverse-transcribed. The following primers were used: 5′-CACAGCGATGGGGGAATGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCCCTTTCACACATAGGCA-3′ (antisense) to detect endogenous Cx36 mRNA, amplified as a 980-bp fragment; 5′-GCTCTAGACTTACTTCAATGGCTGCTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGAATTCAGGTCTGCTGCTGGCG-3′ (antisense) to detect Cx43 mRNA, amplified as a 321-bp fragment; 5′-CGGGTCTAGAATGAGTTGGAGCTTCCTGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCATGGCATAGGGTTTGCTC-3′ (antisense) to detect Cx45 mRNA, amplified as a 358-bp fragment; 5′-AGTCAGTGCTTCTGACACA-3′ (sense primer facing the intron sequence of viral DNA) and 5′-CTATATGGCTTCAGTGTCC-3′ (antisense primer in the rat Cx36 sequence) to detect adenoviral Cx36 mRNA of Ad-asCx36, amplified as a 550-bp fragment; and 5′-CGGAATTCCTGGTTCTGTCTCCTTACTGG-3′ (antisense primer for Cx36) and 5′-AGTCAGTGCTTCTGACACA-3′ to detect Ad-sCx36, amplified as a 730-bp fragment. As positive control, samples of DNA prepared by overnight digestion of purified viral particles were also amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA was visualized on agarose gels after ethidium bromide staining. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses and Cell Infection—To modulate Cx36, we generated recombinant adenoviruses (21Vozzi C. Formenton A. Chanson A. Senn A. Sahli R. Shaw P. Nicod P. Germond M.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 385-393PubMed Google Scholar) comprising the complete cDNA of rat Cx36 (11Condorelli D.F. Parenti R. Spinella F. Trovato Salinaro A. Belluardo N. Cardile V. Cicirata F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) in either a sense (Ad-sCx36) or antisense orientation (Ad-asCx36). The recombinant adenoviruses allowed for expression of either Cx36, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or Cx36 antisense RNA under control of the immediate, early cytomegalovirus promoter. The cDNAs were inserted into plasmid pXC15 (23Schaack J. Langer S. Guo X. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3920-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the adenoviruses were then generated by cotransfecting 293 cells with this plasmid and plasmid pJM17, using a calcium phosphate procedure. Viruses were plaque-purified three times on HER911 cells (IntroGene, Leiden, The Netherlands). Stocks were further purified by two successive CsCl centrifugations, after which the virus band (1.5 ml) was collected and dialyzed at 4 °C against three changes (at least 200 volumes each) of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, in a Slide-A-Lyzer (0.5–3.0-ml capacity), γ-irradiated 10K dialysis cassette (Pierce). INS-1E cells were seeded at an initial density of 8 × 105 cells/well into 6-well dish plates (Falcon) and cultured for 48 h, at which time they were 80% confluent. For infection, cells were incubated for 60 min with different dilutions (multiplicity of infection, MOI = 5, 10, and 25) of a stock of the recombinant adenoviruses Ad-asCx36, Ad-sCx36, or Ad-GFP and then cultured in RPMI 1640 for 24 h before any experiment. Batches of 150–200 isolated rat pancreatic islets were also infected with either Ad-asCx36, Ad-sCx36, or Ad-GFP, according to the same protocol. Batches of 10 handpicked islets were used for secretion experiments. Immunofluorescence—Peptides corresponding to amino acids 289–303 (peptide B: AKRKSVYEIRNKDLP) (14Serre-Beinier V. Le Gurun S. Belluardo N. Trovato-Salinaro A. Charollais A. Haefliger J.A. Condorelli D.F. Meda P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), 155–168 (peptide C: QNTETTSKETEPDC), and 114–127 of Cx36 (peptide D: LALDRDPAESIGGP) were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits (Eurogentec, Herstal, Belgium). Site-directed antibodies were affinity-purified by passing the sera diluted in PBS through HiTrap affinity columns (HiTrap NHS-activated Sepharose; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB) that had been coupled with the respective COOH-terminal tail peptides. The columns were washed sequentially with PBS, 0.5% PBS-Tween 20, and PBS. Antibody solutions were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, in a 1.5 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, to reach neutrality. For immunofluorescence labeling, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed for 3 min in –20 °C acetone, air-dried, rinsed in PBS, and incubated in a buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then exposed for 20 h at room temperature in the presence of different rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat Cx36, which were either mixed at a 1:1:1 ratio to increase the signal or which were used separately. In all cases, the sera were diluted 1:20. After repeated washing, cells were incubated a second time for 1 h at room temperature, using fluorescein-conjugated antibodies against rabbit immunoglobulins, diluted 1:250. After additional rinsing, cells were counterstained with Evans blue, coverslipped, and viewed on a microscope (Leica) fitted with filters for fluorescein detection. In these experiments, controls included use of wild-type (negative control) and Cx36-transfected positive control HeLa cells (a gift from Dr. K. Willecke). Western Blotting—For preparation of total extracts, INS-1E cells and rat pancreatic islets were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 5% SDS and 5 mm EDTA. For preparation of membrane proteins, INS-1E cells were homogenized in a 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, which was supplemented with 20 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml anti-pain (Merck), 1 mm benzamidine (Merck), 40 KIU/ml aprotinin (Bayer), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Aldrich). The homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 20% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA. Protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of islets and cells were heated at 50 °C in loading buffer, fractionated by electrophoresis in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted overnight onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) at a constant voltage of 20 V. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antiserum against either amino acids 289–303 (peptide B) (14Serre-Beinier V.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the horseradish peroxidase Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In these experiments, controls included use of wild-type HeLa (negative control) and Cx36-transfected, positive control HeLa cells. Electron Microscopy—Wild-type and infected INS-1E cells were fixed for 60 min at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For freeze-fracture, samples were infiltrated for 60 min in 30% phosphate-buffered glycerol and frozen in Freon 22 that had been cooled with liquid nitrogen. Cells were fractured and shadowed in a Balzers BAF 301 apparatus (High Vacuum Corp., Balzers, Lichtenstein). The replicas were washed in a sodium hypochlorite solution, rinsed in distilled water, mounted on Formvar- and carbon-coated copper grids, and examined in a Philips CM 10 (Philips Electron Optics, Mahwah, NJ) electron microscope. Insulin Secretion—Wild-type and infected INS-1E cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 8 × 105/well and tested 2 days later at a confluence of about 80%. To this end, cells were maintained at 37 °C for 2 h in glucose-free RPMI 1640, washed, and preincubated in a glucose-free (0 mm) Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate medium (pH 7.4) containing (in mm): 135 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 HEPES (KRBH buffer). After a 30-min preincubation, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of either a basal (2.8 mm) or a stimulatory (16.7 mm) concentration of glucose. At the end of each incubation period, medium was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,500 × g and 4 °C to remove cell debris. To measure protein and insulin content, INS-1E cells were extracted within the wells with 1 ml of 75% ethanol/0.2 m HCl. Supernatant and cell samples were immediately stored at –20 °C until insulin determination by radioimmunoassay, using rat insulin as standard, and as per the instructions of the kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Total protein content was measured by the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Insulin secretion was expressed as a percentage of cell insulin or protein content. Batches of 10 isolated islets were also tested for insulin secretion and content as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between means were assessed by Student's t test and/or analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined at a value of: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. Adenoviruses Induce de Novo Cx36 Expression in Connexin-defective HeLa Cells—By immunofluorescence, we did not detect Cx36 in wild-type HeLa cells (data not shown), confirming that these cells are Cx-deficient (24Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In contrast, the protein was detected in Cx36-transfected HeLa cells using the different Cx36 antibodies we tested in this study (Fig. 1A). After infection with Ad-sCx36, the same antibodies immunolabeled Cx36 at sites of membrane contacts between HeLa cells (Fig. 1E). The amount of staining increased with the MOI used in each infection experiment but, in all cases, had a pattern like that observed in Cx36-transfected cells (Fig. 1). Expression of Cx36 and Gap Junctions Are Regulated by Gene Transfer in INS-1E Cells—RNAs coding for Cx43, Cx45, and Cx36 were detected by RT-PCR in freshly isolated pancreatic islets, whereas only a transcript for Cx36 was detectable in INS-1E cells (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR of RNA extracted from cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses showed the transcription of either a sense or an antisense Cx36 RNA 24 h after the infection of cells with Ad-sCx36 and Ad-asCx36, respectively (Fig. 2B). The sense Cx36 RNA and the cognate protein were already detectable 3 h after the infection, and their levels of expression increased during the first 24 h (Fig. 2, C and D). Cx36 was barely detectable in wild-type, non-infected INS-1E cells (Fig. 1B), and the levels of the protein were decreased after infection with two different doses (MOI = 10 and 25) of Ad-asCx36 (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, INS-1E cells infected with similar doses of Ad-sCx36 showed a drastic increase in Cx36 expression (Fig. 1, F–H). Western blots of membrane extracts confirmed the absence of Cx36 in wild-type HeLa cells but immunolocated a protein of 36 kDa in HeLa cells transduced with three different doses (MOI = 5, 10, and 25) of Ad-sCx36 (Fig. 3A). The levels of this protein increased with the adenoviral dosage (Fig. 3A). Large levels of Cx36 were also observed in INS-1E cells infected with Ad-sCx36, contrasting with the low levels detected in both wild-type cells and cells infected with 10 MOI of the Ad-GFP vector (Fig. 3A). Western blots of total proteins (Fig. 3B) also showed a dose-dependent reduction of Cx36 content in INS-1E cells infected with 5, 10, or 25 MOI of Ad-asCx36 vector and, conversely, a dose-dependent increase in Cx36 in cells infected with the Ad-sCx36 vector (Fig. 3B). Quantitative assessment demonstrated that, relative to the levels of tubulin, those of Cx36 were reduced by 80% in cells infected with the Ad-asCx36 vector and increased 14-fold in cells infected with the Ad-sCx36 vector (Fig. 3C). Freeze-fracture electron microscopy confirmed that cells overexpressing Cx36 formed typical gap junction plaques that were not observed in wild-type, non-infected INS-1E cells (Fig. 4). Quantitative assessment showed that the number of membranes containing junctions increased 3–4-fold in cells infected with Ad-sCx36 compared with non-infected cells, whereas the number of gap junctions increased 6-fold (Table I).Fig. 4Gap junction plaques increase in the membranes of Ad-sCx36 INS-1E cells. A, freeze-fracture electron microscopy revealed several clusters of gap junctions (arrowheads) in the membranes of INS-1E cells that had been infected with Ad-sCx36. Some of these gap junctions were intermingled with linear aggregates of junctional particles (C), whereas others occurred as isolated plaques (B). Whereas the first type of arrangement was occasionally observed in the membranes of wild-type INS-1E cells (D), typical gap junction plaques, such as those shown in A and B, were never seen in non-infected controls.

Open table in a new tab Alterations in Cx36 Impair Insulin Content and Secretion of INS-1E Cells—No difference in protein content was observed between wild-type INS-1E cells and cells infected with the different adenoviral constructs (Fig. 5, A and E). In contrast, insulin content was reduced by 15–35% in Cx36-transduced (antisense and sense) cells, at the end of a 30-min incubation in the presence of either 2.8 mm (p < 0.05) or 16.7 mm (p < 0.01) glucose. This decrease was not observed in cells infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 5, B and F). Wild-type, non-infected cells and cells infected with Ad-GFP showed a 3–4-fold increase (p < 0.001) in insulin secretion when the glucose concentration of the incubation medium was raised from 2.8 to 16.7 mm (Fig. 5, C and G). Compared with these controls, cells infected with Ad-asCx36 showed a significant reduction in glucose-induced secretion, which depended on the viral dose. Thus, after exposure to 16.7 mm, Ad-asCx36-infected cells failed to significantly increase insulin secretion over the basal levels measured in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose (Fig. 5C). Overexpression of Cx36 in INS-1E cells infected with Ad-sCx36 also resulted in a 40–50% reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion (Fig. 5G). When expressed as percentage of insulin content, the glucose (16.7 mm)-induced insulin secretion of INS-1E cells infected with either Ad-asCx36 or Ad-sCx36 was reduced by about 30% (Fig. 5, D and H). Alterations in Cx36 Expression Affect Insulin Content of Rat Pancreatic Islets—Western blots of extracts of rat pancreatic islets revealed that, compared with the levels of tubulin, those of Cx36 were reduced up to 50% in islets infected with Ad-asCx36 (MOI = 20/islet). Conversely, these levels were increased 3–4-fold (p < 0.001) in islets infected with Ad-sCx36 (Fig. 6). Compared with the secretion observed in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose, control non-infected islets and islets infected with Ad-GFP showed a 2-fold increase (p < 0.001) in insulin release when exposed to 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 7A). In contrast, islets infected with either Ad-asCx36 or Ad-sCx36 failed to exhibit glucose-induced insulin release (Fig. 7A). In the presence of 16.7 mm glucose, their secretion was 40–60% of the control value, depending on the adenovirus dose used (Ad-asCx36 or Ad-sCx36, Fig. 7A). However, when expressed as a percentage of insulin content, the glucose (16.7 mm)-induced insulin secretion of infected islets was similar to that of controls, whether an Ad-asCx36 or Ad-sCx36 vector had been used (Fig. 7B). In contrast, insulin content was significantly decreased in infected islets, representing 25 and 60% of control levels in islets infected with Ad-asCx36 and Ad-sCx36, respectively (Fig. 7C).Fig. 7Altered levels of Cx36 affect insulin content of native pancreatic islets. A, basal insulin release, evaluated in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose, was similar in all islets. Control and GFP-infected islets increased their insulin output 2–3-fold during a 30-min stimulation by 16.7 mm glucose. This increase was decreased by 40–50% in islets infected with either Ad-sCx36 or Ad-asCx36. B, when expressed as a percentage of insulin content, the glucose (16.7 mm)-induced insulin secretion of islets infected with either Ad-asCx36 or Ad-sCx36 was similar to that of both non-infected islets and islets infected with Ad-GFP. Columns represent mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, which were performed in triplicate. C, insulin content was similar in control (open column) and GFP-infected islets (solid column) but was reduced 24 h after infection with either Ad-sCx36 or Ad-asCx36 (gray and hatched columns). Data are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments that were performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies on primary pancreatic islet cells and tumoral insulin-producing cells have indicated a relationship between Cx-dependent communication and secretory function, particularly with regard to the ability of cells to control insulin release in response to glucose (8Meda P.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent experiments further suggest that an excess of Cx may be detrimental for insulin secretion (10Charollais A. Gjinovci A. Huarte J. Bauquis J. Nadal A. Martin F. Andreu E. Sanchez-Andres J.V. Calabrese A. Bosco D. Soria B. Wollheim C.B. Herrera P.L. Meda P. J. Clin.

Here, we have first investigated the expression of different connexins in the insulin-producing line of INS-1E cells (15Janjic D. Maechler P. Sekine N. Bartley C. Annen A.S. Wolheim C.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Compared with freshly isolated rat islets, which express Cx43, Cx45, and Cx36 transcripts (14Serre-Beinier V. Le Gurun S.

Because the distribution of this protein is restricted to cells involved in the control of glucose levels and nutrient metabolism (11Condorelli D.F. Parenti R. Spinella F. Trovato Salinaro A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we have studied the role of Cx36 on the content and secretion of insulin. Using an adenoviral gene transfer approach (21Vozzi C. Formenton A. Chanson A. Senn A. Sahli R. Shaw P. Nicod P. Germond M. Haefliger J.A. Reproduction. 2001; 122: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to transduce a Cx36 antisense cDNA, we have first reduced the expression of Cx36 and observed a marked decrease of insulin content in both INS-1E cells and native rat islets. This effect was not accounted for by a major decrease in the transcription of the insulin gene (data not shown) nor to the viral load itself, inasmuch as adenovirus coding for GFP had no functional consequence. These data indicate that large, although not complete, loss of the native levels of Cx36 is detrimental to proper function of tumoral as well as primary β-cells, particularly with regard to one of their main physiological functions, which is to synthesize and store insulin. The reduced expression of Cx36 was also associated with a marked decrease in the glucose-induced insulin release of INS-1 cells, suggesting a further implication of the Cx in the multistep pathway that couples a glucose stimulation to insulin release. However, this effect was not clearly seen in isolated islets, the secretion of which was barely affected after infection with Ad-asCx36 vectors. In view of previous studies, which have documented a limited efficiency of adenoviral vectors for the infection of intact islets (27Csete M.E. Benhamou P.Y. Drazan K.E. Wu L. McIntee D.F. Afra R.

Indeed, alterations in glucose-induced insulin release of primary β-cells have been reported recently in another model after the expression of Cx36 was sizably increased (31Caton D. Calabrese A. Mas C. Serre-Beinier V. Charollais A. Caille D. Zufferey R. Trono D. Meda P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2285-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have further demonstrated that INS-1E cells, which after transduction expressed amounts of Cx36 much higher than those of normal β-cells, also featured reduced insulin secretion. Thus, Cx36 shares the property of other, Cx-unrelated proteins, the overexpression of which in β-cells blunts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (32Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C.

It remains to be elucidated by which mechanism Cx36 functions as a negative regulator of insulin biosynthesis and release and, hence, whether the Cx may affect the same steps of the secretory pathway that are targeted by either uncoupling proteins (34Nakazaki M.

Tight control of insulin secretion is critical for glucose homeostasis. This control is exerted in part by circulating nutrients and particularly glucose. The metabolism of this sugar causes a rise in the ratio of ATP/ADP, which induces the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. The resulting decrease in K+ conductance leads to membrane depolarization and to a subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, which ultimately triggers the exocytosis of insulin granules (37Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 38Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 39Seino S.

Previous studies have suggested that gap junctions may provide the structural and functional basis for coordinating the oscillatory increase of Ca2+ that is induced by glucose in β-cells (41Gylfe E.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: S144-S151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this model has received direct experimental support in the insulin-producing cells of the MIN6 line (45Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Indeed, loss of Cx36 was shown to abolish the synchronization of glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations in adjacent cells (46Calabrese A. Serre-Beinier V. Zhang M. Caton D. Mas C. Satin L.S. Meda P. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that a large overand underexpression of Cx36 may alter the synchronization of β-cells that is required for a normal control of insulin biosynthesis and release. In conclusion, the data provide novel evidence for an implication of the gap junction protein Cx36 in the control of insulin content and secretion in both tumoral and primary β-cells. Specifically, the data demonstrate that proper storage of insulin requires that the levels of Cx36 be maintained within a 10-fold range of native values. They further suggest that larger changes in this protein may also alter the regulation of insulin release. In view of these findings, it will be important to assess whether Cx36 participates in the loss of glucose sensitivity, which β-cells exhibit in type 2 diabetes.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of gp2.5 to ssDNA is critical because it affects both specific DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions in the replisome (14Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this regard it is essential for coupling leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in vitro (14Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). gp2.5 is also essential for recombination in T7 phage-infected cells, and in addition to the interactions described above, it also mediates homologous base pairing (11Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S Patent 5534407Google Scholar). Despite a lack of sequence homology, T7 gp2.5 is functionally similar to the extensively studied SSB protein of E. coli and the gene 32 protein of bacteriophage T4. Like gp2.5, they are both ssDNA-binding proteins, a class of ubiquitous proteins that are not only essential in DNA replication but also play key roles in DNA recombination and repair (7Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that these proteins, like T7 gp2.5, interact with other proteins at the replication fork. E. coli SSB protein interacts with E. coli DNA polymerase II, exonuclease I, and other proteins involved in replication (22Sigal N. Delius H. Kornberg T. Gefter M.L. Alberts B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3537-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 23Molineux I.J. Gefter M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T4 gene 32 protein physically interacts with at least 10 T4-encoded proteins, including T4 DNA polymerase, that are involved in T4 metabolism (25Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a carboxyl-terminal deleted T7 gp2.5 reveals a conserved oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold, similar to that of T4 gene 32 protein and E. coli SSB protein. The structure also suggests models for DNA binding and dimerization of gp2.5 (26Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical experiments suggest that the physical interactions of gp2.5 are specific, as neither E. coli SSB protein nor T4 gene 32 protein can functionally replace gene 2.5 protein in vivo (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). T7 gene 4 primase-helicase is unable to load onto ssDNA coated with gene 32 protein, a reaction that occurs readily with T7 gp2.5 protein-coated DNA (9Kong D. Nossal N.G. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8380-8387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). E. coli SSB protein, on the other hand, can stimulate T7 DNA polymerase activity, support strand displacement DNA synthesis (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rigler M.N. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8910-8919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Myers T.W. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17006-17015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as permit T7 primase-helicase to load onto ssDNA. Moreover, gp2.5 increases the frequency of initiation by T7 primase-helicase, whereas E. coli SSB protein does not (6Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9831-9839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This specificity for gp2.5 is not surprising as there is little sequence homology between the proteins, and gp2.5 differs from the other proteins significantly in a number of biochemical properties. For instance, the T7 protein binds to ssDNA with a lower affinity than E. coli SSB protein or T4 gene 32 protein (7Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of these proteins also differs with gp2.5 existing as a stable dimer in solution (7Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas E. coli SSB protein forms a tetramer (29Weiner J.H. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1972-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T4 gene 32 protein is a monomer that forms multimers at high concentrations (30Von Hippel P.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. Paul L.S. Stormo G.D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 795-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Carroll R.B. Neet K. Goldthwait D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A number of genetic and biochemical studies have focused on the carboxyl-terminal region of gp2.5 (14Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an essential domain of the protein. The carboxyl-terminal tail is quite acidic and is required to mediate interactions with the T7 replication proteins described above (32Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated gene 2.5 protein, gp2.5-Δ21C, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids, cannot support T7 phage growth (32Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified gp2.5-Δ21C does not form a dimer and does not interact with T7 DNA polymerase or T7 primase-helicase (32Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the wild-type protein, gp2.5-Δ21C does not support the coordination of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in vitro (14Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The similar arrangement of domains in E. coli SSB protein, T4 gene 32 protein, and T7 gp2.5 suggests that the acidic carboxyl-terminal domains of these three proteins are functionally homologous (20Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the carboxyl-terminal acidic region of either E. coli SSB protein or T4 gene 32 protein replace the acidic tail of gp2.5, the chimeric proteins can substitute for T7 gene 2.5 protein to support the growth of phage T7, albeit less efficiently. In contrast, chimeric proteins in which the carboxyl-terminal tail of gp2.5 replaces that of E. coli SSB protein or T4 gene 32 protein cannot support growth of T7 phage (20Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results show that although the carboxyl terminus of gp2.5 is essential for protein-protein interaction, it alone cannot account for the specificity of the interaction. To address further the role of gp2.5 in T7 DNA metabolism, we recently examined mutations in gene 2.5 from a random mutagenic screen of gp2.5 (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together with the crystal structure, these studies have provided insight into DNA binding and dimerization of the protein (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7247-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this mutagenic screen, several amino acid changes were identified in the carboxyl-terminal tail. However, except for one mutant, all had multiple amino acid changes that accounted for their lethality. One mutant, however, had a single amino acid substitution, leucine replacing phenylalanine at position 232. This altered gp2.5-F232L could not complement T7 Δ2.5 lacking gene 2.5. In this paper we show that gp2.5-F232L binds more tightly to ssDNA and enables T7 DNA polymerase to catalyze strand displacement DNA synthesis. These studies, taken together with studies on gp2.5-Δ26C, support a role of the carboxyl terminus in modulating ssDNA binding and in interacting with T7 DNA polymerase. Bacterial Strains, Bacteriophages, and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3)- (F– ompT hsdS B (rB–mB–) gal – dcm (DE3)) (Novagen) was used as the host strain to express T7 gene 2.5 and to purify wild-type and mutant gp2.5. Wild-type and mutant gene 2.5 are expressed from the pET17b plasmid (Novagen) containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. DNAs encoding His-tagged gene 2.5 proteins were cloned into the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of modified pET19bPPS vector as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Details of the cloning procedure have been described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). T7 gp2.5-Δ26C was obtained from Edel Hyland (Harvard Medical School). DNA and Oligonucleotides—The 70-mer oligonucleotide GACCATATCCTCCACCCTCCCCAATATTGACCATCAACCCTTCACCTCACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC-3′ (14Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), provided by J. Lee (Harvard Medical School), was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays for assessing binding of gp2.5 to ssDNA. M13mp18(+) and poly(dA)390, templates used for DNA synthesis, were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. 5′-33P-End-labeled primer was annealed to M13mGP1-2, a 9950-nucleotide derivative of vector M13mp8 (35Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar), and used for DNA synthesis. Oligonucleotide 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′ and poly(dT)22 used as primers for DNA synthesis were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The 34-oligonucleotide TG, 5′-CTAATCAGGAGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGAA-3′ that can be partially annealed to M13mp18 (unannealed nucleotides are underlined in the primer sequence), was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. For cloning purposes the following oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc: T72.5 NdeI, 5′-CGTAGGATCCATATGGCTAAGAAGATTTTCACCTC-3′; and T72.5BamHI, 5′-CGTAGGATCCACTTAGAGGTCTCCGTC-3′. The oligonucleotides pET17b upstream, 5′-CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATG-3′, and pET17b downstream, 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′, used for DNA sequencing were synthesized by the Biopolymer Facility, Harvard Medical School. All radioactive nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Proteins, Enzymes, and Chemicals—Restriction enzymes, polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestinal phosphatase were purchased from New England Biolabs. E. coli SSB protein was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Donald Johnson (Harvard Medical School) supplied T7 DNA polymerase. All chemicals and reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Mutagenesis of T7 gp2.5—pET17b plasmids expressing lethal mutations in gene 2.5 were generated by a random mutagenesis as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasmid harboring the altered gene 2.5 (694T→ C) from which gp2.5-F232L was expressed was isolated from this library as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of gp2.5—wt and gp2.5-F232L were purified as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the following changes. The plasmids pETGp2.5 and pETGp2.5-F232L were transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Eight liter cultures were grown in LB with 60 μg/ml ampicillin to an A 595 of 1.0. Cells harboring pETGp2.5 were induced at 37 °C for 4 h after adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells harboring pETGp2.5-F232L were induced at 30 °C for 6 h after adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Purified wt gp2.5 and gp2.5-F232L were greater than 99% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining by Coomassie Blue. Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometric absorbance at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient of 2.58 × 104m– 1cm–1 calculated according to Gill and Hippel (36Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Molecular Weight Approximation by Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration analysis was performed as described previously (7Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). gp2.5, gp2.5-F232L, and gp2.5-Δ26C were applied to a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in buffer G (50 mm KPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C. The fractional retention, K av, was calculated for each of the standard proteins using the equation K av = (V e – V 0)/(V t – V 0). A plot of K av value versus log10 M r generated an equation, and from this the molecular weight of each gene 2.5 variant could be approximated based on its peak elution volume. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The binding of gp2.5 to ssDNA was performed on a 70-mer oligonucleotide using a modification of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Methods in Molecular Biology: DNA-Protein Interactions: Principles and Protocols. Vol. 30. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 263-279Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was radioactively labeled at its 5′ terminus with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled oligonucleotide was purified using micro Bio-Spin P-30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The reactions (15 μl) for measuring the mobility shift contained 3.3 nm32P-labeled 70-mer oligonucleotide and various concentrations (from 0 to 16,000 nm) of gp2.5 diluted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction buffer contained 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue. Reactions were performed on ice for 15 min, loaded onto 10% TBE pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad), and run at 300 V for 10 min and 170 V for 40 min at 4 °C using 0.5× Tris-glycine running buffer (12.5 m Tris base, 95 mm glycine, 0.5 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to a FujiX PhosphorImager plate, and the fraction of DNA bound by gp2.5 was measured using ImageQuant software. Binding of gp2.5 ssDNA for Electron Microscopy—wt and altered gp2.5 were diluted to 50 ng/ml in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol and then mixed with wt M13 ssDNA at 10 ng/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl final concentration. Binding reactions with protein to DNA ratios (g/g) ranging from 40:1 for wt gp2.5 protein to 10:1 for mutant protein were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a 10-μl total reaction volume. Electron Microscopy—gp2.5 bound to ssDNA was fixed with an equal volume of 1.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Sample volume was increased to 50 μl with a buffer containing spermidine (38Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 42: 215-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quickly applied to a mesh copper grid coated with a thin carbon film, glow-charged shortly before sample application. Following adsorption of the samples to the EM support for 1–2 min, the grids were subjected to a dehydration procedure in which the water content of the washes was gently replaced by a serial increase in ethanol concentration to 100% and then air-dried. The samples were then rotary shadowcast with tungsten at 10–7 torr and examined in a Philips CM 12 TEM instrument at 40 kV. Micrographs, taken at ×46,000, were scanned using a Nikon LS-4500AF film scanner, and panels were arranged using Adobe Photoshop. Expression and Purification of Gene 2.5 Histidine Fusion Proteins— pET19bPPS2.5, pET19bPPS-F232L, and pET19bPPS-Δ26C were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells. One-liter cultures of each were grown in LB media containing ampicillin, and the cells induced at 37 °C were harvested as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 70 mm imidazole). Following three freeze-thaw cycles, the cells were lysed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with lysozyme at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm bottle top filter. The resulting filtrate was introduced onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) with a bed volume of 5 ml. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B, and the protein was eluted in 8 ml of buffer B containing 500 mm imidazole. Each protein was then dialyzed against buffer S and stored at –20 °C. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of T7 DNA Polymerase-gp2.5 Interaction—The interaction of gp2.5 with T7 DNA polymerase was examined using surface plasmon resonance as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNA Synthesis Catalyzed by T7 DNA Polymerase—The assay for T7 DNA polymerase was a modification of one described previously (14Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 100 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and the indicated ssDNA-binding proteins. For the assay of stimulation of DNA synthesis by ssDNA-binding proteins, poly(dA)390-(dT)22 was used as a primer-template. A final concentration of 10 nm T7 DNA polymerase was added in the reaction. The reactions were carried out at 25 °C as described previously (15Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the assay of stimulation of strand displacement activity of T7 DNA polymerase by ssDNA-binding proteins, primed M13 ssDNA was used as template. A final concentration of 100 nm T7 DNA polymerase was added in the reaction. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 5 min, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of T7 DNA polymerase. Five-μl aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and the reactions quenched by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The reaction mixture was transferred to Whatman DE81 filter, dried at room temperature for 30 min, and then washed with 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, four times and once with 95% ethanol. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by scintillation counting. Alkaline-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Alkaline-agarose gels were prepared as described (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.12-6.21Google Scholar). Ten μl of DNA synthesis reaction samples were added to 5 μl of alkaline loading buffer containing 0.25% bromphenol, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, 30% glycerol, 50 mm NaOH, and 1 mm EDTA. The sample was loaded onto the gel and electrophoresed at 25 V for 14–18 h at room temperature. The gel was dried and exposed to a FujiX PhosphorImager plate, and the fraction of DNA bound by gp2.5 protein was measured using ImageQuant software. gp2.5-F232L Is a Dimer—wt gp2.5 is a homodimer in solution with a molecular weight of 51,124 (7Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). gp2.5-Δ21C, lacking the 21 carboxyl-terminal residues, on the other hand, is a monomer in solution (32Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain whether gp2.5-F232L is a monomer or dimer, we estimated its molecular weight by gel filtration analysis. wt gp2.5 and gp2.5-F232L eluted from a Superdex 75 column at almost the same volume, whereas gp2.5-Δ26C eluted in a considerably larger volume. By using a standard curve derived from the elution volume of four commercially available proteins standards, the molecular weight of gp2.5-F232L was estimated to be 58,000 (Fig. 1), consistent with the protein being a dimer.

https://openalex.org/W2045063401,"T4 RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1) exemplifies an ATP-dependent RNA ligase family that includes fungal tRNA ligase (Trl1) and a putative baculovirus RNA ligase. Rnl1 acts via a covalent enzyme-AMP intermediate generated by attack of Lys-99 Nζ on the α phosphorus of ATP. Mutation of Lys-99 abolishes ligase activity. Here we tested the effects of alanine mutations at 19 conserved positions in Rnl1 and thereby identified 9 new residues essential for ligase activity: Arg-54, Lys-75, Phe-77, Gly-102, Lys-119, Glu-227, Gly-228, Lys-240, and Lys-242. Seven of the essential residues are located within counterparts of conserved nucleotidyltransferase motifs I (99KEDG102), Ia (118SK119), IV (227EGYVA231), and V (238HFKIK242) that comprise the active sites of DNA ligases, RNA capping enzymes, and T4 RNA ligase 2. Three other essential residues, Arg-54, Lys-75 and Phe-77, are located upstream of the AMP attachment site within a conserved domain unique to the Rnl1-like ligase family. We infer a shared evolutionary history and active site architecture in Rnl1 (a tRNA repair enzyme) and Trl1 (a tRNA splicing enzyme). We determined structure-activity relationships via conservative substitutions and examined mutational effects on the isolated steps of Rnl1 adenylylation (step 1) and phosphodiester bond formation (step 3). Lys-75, Lys-240, and Lys-242 were found to be essential for step 1 and overall ligation of 5′-phosphorylated RNA but not for phosphodiester bond formation. These results suggest that the composition of the Rnl1 active site is different during steps 1 and 3. Mutations at Arg-54 and Lys-119 abolished the overall RNA ligation reaction without affecting steps 1 and 3. Arg-54 and Lys-119 are thereby implicated as specific catalysts of the RNA adenylation reaction (step 2) of the ligation pathway.

RNA ligases join 3′ OH and 5′ PO4 RNA termini via a series of three nucleotidyl transfer steps similar to those of DNA ligases: (i) RNA ligase reacts with ATP to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)–AMP intermediate plus pyrophosphate; (ii) AMP is transferred from ligase-adenylate to the 5′ PO4 RNA end to form an RNA-adenylate intermediate (AppRNA); and (iii) ligase catalyzes attack by an RNA 3′ OH on the RNA-adenylate to seal the two ends via a phosphodiester bond and release AMP (1Silber R.

Bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1) is the founding member of the RNA ligase family (1Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The function of Rnl1 in vivo is to repair a break in the anticodon loop of Escherichia coli tRNALys triggered by phage activation of a host-encoded anticodon nuclease (6Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). T4 Rnl1 is a 374-amino acid polypeptide (7Rand K.N. Gait M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gait and co-workers (8Thogerson H.C. Morris H.R. Rand K.N. Gait M.J. Eur. J.

The active site lysine of Rnl1 is located within a conserved sequence element (KX(D/N)G; motif I in Fig. 1) that defines a superfamily of covalent nucleotidyltransferases, which includes DNA ligases and mRNA capping enzymes (10Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 11Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). DNA ligases and capping enzymes have a common tertiary structure composed of five conserved motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, and V) that contain amino acid functional groups responsible for nucleotide binding and catalysis (12Subramanya H.S.

Cell,. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that DNA ligases and capping enzymes evolved from a common ancestral nucleotidyltransferase (11Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar), possibly from an ancient RNA strand-joining enzyme like Rnl1, in which case the fold and active site of Rnl1 should resemble that of DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes. This model remains speculative because there is no atomic structure available for Rnl1, and no mutational analysis has been conducted outside of the KXDG motif. We recently identified and characterized a second T4 RNA ligase (Rnl2) encoded by bacteriophage T4 gene 24.1 (17Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Rnl2 exemplifies a novel family of RNA ligases that contain all five motifs found in DNA ligases and capping enzymes, plus a set of unique and essential structural “signatures” (17Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Yin S. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17601-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Rnl2-like ligase family includes the RNA-editing ligases of Trypanosoma and Leishmania and a group of putative RNA ligases encoded by eukaryotic viruses and many species of Archaea. Thus, the Rnl2-like ligases are present in all three phylogenetic domains. In contrast, T4 Rnl1 exemplifies a distinct subfamily of RNA ligases with a narrow phylogenetic distribution. The Rnl1-like proteins include a putative RNA ligase/polynucleotide kinase of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV, 1The abbreviation used is: AcNPV, A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. a baculovirus) and the tRNA ligases of fungi (19Durantel D.

Jennings S. Kienzle B.K. Gorman J.A. Kelly R. McCullough J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The primary structures of the Rnl1-like and Rnl2-like ligases are quite dissimilar (no cross-recognition by multiround Psi-Blast searches), with the only shared features being the presence of three of the nucleotidyltransferase motifs (I, IV, and V) that comprise the NMP-binding site of DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes (Fig. 1). Alignment of the primary structures of the Rnl1-like ligases highlights three notable features as follows: (i) an absence of obvious counterparts of nucleotidyltransferase motifs III and IIIa shared among DNA ligases, capping enzymes, and Rnl2-like ligases; (ii) the presence of clusters of conserved residues upstream of the motif I lysine nucleophile that are not found in Rnl2-like ligases or in DNA ligases and capping enzymes; and (iii) sequence similarity between Rnl1 and the AcNPV ligase in the segment separating motifs I and IV, which is not found in the tRNA ligases of the Rnl1-like group (Fig. 1). In order to delineate which of the conserved side chains are functionally relevant, we have performed a mutational analysis of 20 positions of T4 Rnl1 (indicated by • in Fig. 1), focusing on motifs I, IV, and V, the segment proximal to motif I, and the region separating motifs I and IV. We find that motifs IV and V are essential for covalent nucleotidyl transfer by Rnl1. We also identify essential residues outside the nucleotidyltransferase motifs, suggesting that Rnl1-like enzymes have distinct signature components of their active sites. Recombinant T4 Rnl1—A DNA fragment containing the gp63 open reading frame (hereafter RNL1) was amplified by PCR from T4 genomic DNA (a gift of Ken Kreuzer, Duke University) with oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the translation start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the pET16b (Novagen) to generate the expression plasmid pET-RNL1. Amino acid substitution mutations were introduced into the RNL1 gene by PCR using the two-stage overlap extension method (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The mutated genes were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pET16b. The inserts of the wild-type and mutant RNL1 plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. Wild-type and mutant pET-RNL1 plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cultures (100 ml) of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-RNL1 were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A 600 reached 0.5. The cultures were adjusted to 0.3 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 7 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.2 m NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). Lysozyme, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml, 0.2 mm, 1 mm, and 0.2%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 17,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extracts were applied to 0.8-ml columns of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 2 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 0.6-ml aliquots of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm imidazole in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol). The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant His-Rnl1 adsorbed to the column and was recovered predominantly in the 300 mm imidazole eluates, which contained 0.5–3 mg of protein. The Rnl1 preparations were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad dye reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Adenylyltransferase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm [α-32P]ATP, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 μg of Rnl1 were incubated for 12 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with SDS, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ligase-[32P]AMP adduct was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and quantitated by scanning the gel with a Fuji Film BAS-2500 PhosphorImager. Adenylyltransferase specific activity was calculated from the slope of the titration curve. RNA Ligase Assay—An 18-mer oligoribonucleotide (5′-AUUCCGAUAGUGACUACA) was 5′ 32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled 18-mer was purified by electrophoresis through a nondenaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. RNA ligation reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer RNA (pRNA), 20 μm ATP, and Rnl1 as specified were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The ligation products were visualized by autoradiography of the gel and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Sealing of Preformed RNA-Adenylate—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled RNA-adenylate strand AppAUUCCGAUAGUGACUACA (synthesized and gel-purified as described previously (18Yin S. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17601-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)), and Rnl1 as specified were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with formamide/EDTA, and the products were analyzed by PAGE. Recombinant T4 Rnl1—Wild-type Rnl1 was produced in E. coli as a His10-tagged fusion protein, and the 45-kDa recombinant protein was purified from the crude soluble bacterial extract by adsorption to Ni-agarose and elution with buffer containing imidazole (Fig. 2, WT). The adenylyltransferase activity of recombinant Rnl1 (step 1 of the ligation pathway) was evinced by label transfer from 20 μm [α-32P]ATP to the Rnl1 polypeptide to form a covalent enzyme-adenylate adduct (not shown). The reaction was magnesium-dependent (optimal at 1–5 mm MgCl2), and the yield of Rnl1-[32P]AMP was optimal at pH 8.0 (not shown). We calculated that ∼70% of the input Rnl1 protein was adenylated with [32P]AMP. The remaining ∼30% of the Rnl1 preparation may consist of pre-formed Rnl1-AMP intermediate. Reaction of recombinant Rnl1 with a 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer RNA oligonucleotide (pRNA) and magnesium in the presence of 20 μm ATP resulted in the formation of two new radiolabeled RNAs (Fig. 3, lane WT). The major product, migrating ∼1.5 nucleotide steps faster than the input 18-mer pRNA strand, corresponds to a covalently closed 18-mer circle formed by intramolecular ligation of the 5′-PO4 and 3′-OH termini of the substrate strand (1Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A minor labeled product, migrating ∼1 nucleotide step slower than the input 18-mer, corresponded to the RNA-adenylate (AppRNA) generated by AMP transfer from Rnl1-AMP to the 5′ end of the input 18-mer RNA (3Sugino A. Snopek T.J. Cozarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 252: 1732-1738Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 17Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutational Analysis of Rnl1 Motifs I, IV, and V Identifies Residues Essential for Catalysis—The presence of putative counterparts of nucleotidyltransferase motifs I, IV, and V in Rnl1 raises the question of whether and how they contribute to RNA ligase function. Heaphy et al. (9Heaphy S. Singh M. Gait M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed previously that mutating Lys-99 of motif I to asparagine abolished overall ligation and the ability to form the Rnl1-AMP intermediate, as expected from the assignment of Lys-99 as the site of covalent adenylylation (8Thogerson H.C. Morris H.R. Rand K.N. Gait M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Changing Glu-100 to glutamine or threonine was well tolerated, which is consistent with the lack of side chain conservation at this position (Fig. 1). Several different mutations of Asp-101 (to asparagine, serine, or glutamate) abolished the composite ligation reaction but had no effect on formation of the Rnl1-AMP intermediate (9Heaphy S. Singh M. Gait M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The lack of a requirement of the aspartate residue in motif I for the first nucleotidyl transfer step is a property shared with DNA ligase (14Odell M. Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nikolov D. Mol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and Rnl2 (17Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Yin S. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17601-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Yet the finding that Rnl1 cannot tolerate asparagine at this position for subsequent reaction steps is notable given that asparagine is naturally present at the equivalent position in yeast tRNA ligases (Fig. 1), and the equivalent residue is a histidine in Rnl2 (17Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12709-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The glycine position of motif I is invariant in all RNA ligases, DNA ligases, and cellular capping enzymes, but the contribution of this residue in RNA ligation has not been addressed. Thus, we substituted Gly-102 with alanine. To query the roles of the defining residues in motifs IV (consensus (D/E)Gϕϕϕ, where ϕ is a hydrophobic side chain) and V (consensus ϕϕKϕK), we introduced alanine substitutions at Glu-227 and Gly-228 in motif IV and Lys-240 and Lys-242 in motif V. We also mutated Asp-244 of motif V to alanine, and an acidic side chain is present at the equivalent positions in Ac-NPV ligase and S. cerevisiae tRNA ligase and in several DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes. As a control we also changed Lys-99 to Ala. The K99A, G102A, E227A, G228A, K240A, K242A, and D244A mutants were expressed in bacteria and purified from soluble lysates by Ni-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2). Mutational effects on RNA ligation are shown in Fig. 3. The proteins were assayed under conditions of enzyme excess in order to illuminate the most severe catalytic defects. We found that mutants K99A, G102A, E227A, G228A, K240A, and K242A failed to form either ligated circular RNAs or the RNA-adenylate intermediate. D244A retained strand joining activity. The ability of the Rnl1-Ala mutants to form the enzyme-AMP intermediate was assayed by protein titration; the adenylyltransferase-specific activities were normalized to that of wild-type Rnl1 (Fig. 4). As expected, the K99A mutant was inert in the ligase adenylylation reaction. The instructive findings were that the G102A, E227A, G228A, K240A, and K242A mutants were either inert or severely defective (≤2% of wild-type activity) in ligase adenylylation, thereby explaining their inability to perform the composite pRNA ligation reaction. In contrast, the D244A mutant retained near wild-type adenylyltransferase activity, consistent with its near wild-type activity in pRNA ligation. We conclude that the conserved motif I glycine and the defining residues of motifs IV and V are essential for Rnl1 function. Mutational Analysis of Other Conserved Amino Acids—The fact that Rnl1 and its baculovirus and fungal homologs contain only three of the five covalent nucleotidyltransferase motifs raises the prospect that either (i) the active site of Rnl1-like ligases is simpler than that of DNA ligases, capping enzymes, and Rnl2-like ligases or (ii) Rnl1 incorporates into its active site additional functional groups that are unique to this branch of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. To explore the latter scenario, we introduced single alanine changes at 13 additional amino acids of Rnl1, 9 of which (Arg-54, Gly-55, Arg-71, Lys-75, Phe-76, Phe-77, Asn-78, Glu-81, and Lys-119) are conserved in the putative baculovirus RNA ligase and the fungal tRNA ligases and 4 of which (Arg-166, Arg-182, Asn-184, and Glu-185) are conserved only in the baculovirus protein (Fig. 1). We focused in particular on basic residues, which we viewed as potential ligands for the ATP or RNA substrates, acidic residues as potential ligands for a divalent cation cofactor, and aromatic residues as candidates to engage in π stacking interactions with the purine base of the NTP (12Subramanya H.S.

The R54A, G55A, R71A, K75A, F76A, F77A, N78A, E81A, K119A, R166A, R182A, N184A, and E185A mutants were expressed in bacteria and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by Ni-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2). Their adenylyltransferase specific activities were assayed by protein titration and then normalized to that of wild-type Rnl1 (Fig. 4). We classified the mutational effects as follows. Residues Lys-75 and Phe-77 at which alanine substitution reduced activity to <10% of wild-type were deemed essential for adenylyltransferase activity. Residues Gly-55, Arg-71, Phe-76, Asn-78, Lys-119, Arg-166, Asn-184, and Glu-185 at which alanine changes had either no effect or resulted in specific activities within a factor of 2 of the wild-type Rnl1 were deemed nonessential. Three other mutations (R54A, E81A, and R182A) reduced adenylyltransferase activity to between 10 and 30% of the wild-type level (Fig. 4). Consistent with their severe step 1 defects, the K75A and F77A mutants were either unreactive or severely impaired in RNA ligation (Fig. 3). Mutants G55A, R71A, F76A, N78A, N184A, and E185A that were active in step 1 were also active in the composite ligation reaction. The striking finding was that K119A was inert in RNA ligation (Fig. 3), despite being fully active at the ligase adenylation step. The R54A mutant was also unreactive in strand joining, although it retained 30% of wild-type activity in ligase adenylation. We infer that Arg-54 and Lys-119 are essential for step(s) of the ligation pathway subsequent to formation of the Rnl1-AMP intermediate. Mutants E81A and R182A were active in overall RNA ligation (Fig. 3), even though they displayed reduced activity in ligase adenylation. (Note that the use of excess enzyme in the ligation reactions may mask modest mutational effects on strand joining.) R166A was fully active in step 1 but displayed a partial defect in strand joining, characterized by reduced yield of RNA circles and enrichment of the AppRNA intermediate (Fig. 3). Mutational Effects on Phosphodiester Formation at a Preadenylated RNA 5′ End—We synthesized and purified a preadenylated 18-mer RNA substrate (AppRNA) for analysis of step 3 of the ligation pathway in isolation. Rnl1 was reacted with AppRNA in enzyme excess in the absence of ATP. The ability of wild-type Rnl1 to form a phosphodiester at the activated 5′ end was manifest by the appearance of a sealed circular RNA product (Fig. 5). 90% of the AppRNA substrate was converted to circular RNA, and essentially no 5′-PO4 RNA strand (pRNA) was formed by wild-type Rnl1; thus the reaction was biased toward ligation (step 3) and away from deadenylation (the reverse of step 2 of the ligation pathway). Circularization of RNA-adenylate required a divalent cation cofactor (data not shown). Mutant proteins G55A, R71A, F76A, N78A, E81A, N184A, R166A, E185A, and D244A all retained step 3 activity (Fig. 5), consistent with their ability to perform the composite pRNA ligation reaction (Fig. 3). The K99A mutant was unreactive with AppRNA, indicating that the motif I lysine is essential for phosphodiester formation even though the step 3 reaction does not entail a covalent intermediate. This result is consistent with the earlier report that mutation of Lys-99 to asparagine abrogated the step 3 activity of T4 Rnl1 (9Heaphy S. Singh M. Gait M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutants G102A and G228A were unreactive in sealing AppRNA (Fig. 5), just as they were unreactive in the ligase adenylation step (Fig. 4) and overall pRNA ligation (Fig. 3). The F77A mutant displayed feeble step 3 activity, consistent with its impairment at the enzyme adenylation step and in overall pRNA ligation. Mechanistically instructive findings emerged from the apparent lack of effect of the K119A, K240A, and K242A changes on the isolated step 3 reaction (Fig. 5), which contrasts sharply with their abrogation of the overall pRNA ligation reaction (Fig. 3). Note that K119A retained step 1 activity, whereas K240A and K242A were defective. These results provide evidence that different constellations of side chain functional groups are responsible for catalysis of the three separate steps of the ligation pathway. Differential sparing of step 3 function was also observed for mutants K75A and E227A, which were capable of sealing the preadenylated substrate (albeit less effectively than wild-type Rnl1; Fig. 5) despite being unreactive in ligation of pRNA (Fig. 3). The R54A mutant was poorly active in circularizing AppRNA and was distinguished from the other mutants in that it generated deadenylated pRNA in roughly equal proportion to sealed RNA circles (Fig. 5). A surprising finding was that the R182A enzyme was defective in the isolated step 3 reaction, while retaining apparently wild-type activity in ligase adenylation and overall pRNA ligation. This result suggested that the sealing of exogenous pre-formed AppRNA may differ in some respects from the sealing of the AppRNA intermediate formed in situ on the enzyme (see below). Structure-Activity Relationships at Essential Residues of Rnl1—The present results highlight 9 individual amino acids in addition to the motif I lysine nucleophile (Lys-99) that are essential for Rnl1 activity: Arg-54, Lys-75, Phe-77, Gly-102, Lys-119, Glu-227, Gly-288, Lys-240, and Lys-242. To better evaluate the contributions of these residues to the RNA ligase reaction, we tested the effects of conservative substitutions at 7 of the essential positions (all except the glycines, for which alanine is already construed to represent a conservative change). Arginine was replaced by lysine and glutamine, glutamate by glutamine and aspartate, lysine by arginine and glutamine"
https://openalex.org/W2046003114,"A growing body of evidence suggests that establishment of sister chromatid cohesion is dependent on replication fork passage over a precohesion area. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this process involves an alternative replication factor C (RFC) complex that contains the four small RFC subunits as well as CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1. Here, we show that an evolutionarily conserved homologous complex exists in the nucleus of human cells. We demonstrate that hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 interact with each other as well as with the p38 subunit of RFC. This alternative RFC-containing complex interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen but not with the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like clamp involved in the DNA damage response. hCTF18 preferentially binds chromatin during S phase, suggesting a role during replication. Our data provide evidence for the existence of an alternative RFC complex with a probable role in mammalian sister chromatid cohesion establishment.

Our data provide evidence for the existence of an alternative RFC complex with a probable role in mammalian sister chromatid cohesion establishment. Sister chromatid cohesion plays an integral role in the maintenance of genomic stability. Cohesion proteins help prevent premature sister chromatid separation and facilitate the correct orientation of chromatids on the metaphase plate. This allows the kinetochore of each chromatid to capture microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. During a normal cell division, the cohesive force prevents premature separation of sisters by opposing the splitting force of the spindle. The correct chromosomal alignment and balance of tensions send a signal to the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This permits activation of the metaphase-anaphase transition and results in segregation of each sister chromatid to the appropriate daughter cell (1Cohen-Fix O.

As expected, abnormalities in sister chromatid cohesion interfere with this process, resulting in an increased rate of aneuploidy in daughter cells (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol.

Although the role of cohesion in the metaphase-anaphase transition is relatively well understood, there is comparatively little information about the establishment of cohesion. It is known that this process occurs during S phase and presumably is linked to the replication fork (1Cohen-Fix O. Cell. 2001; 106: 137-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Lee J.Y. Orr-Weaver T.L. Annu. Rev. Dev.

In addition, it is thought to involve a polymerase switch analogous to the one mediated by the replication factor C (RFC) 1The abbreviations used are: RFC, replication factor C; CTF, chromosomal transmission fidelity; DCC, defective in sister chromatid cohesion; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, SMC, structural maintenance of chromosomes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. complex during lagging strand DNA synthesis (10Carson D.R. Christman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8270-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RFC functions by loading the processivity factor PCNA onto DNA and mediating the switch from DNA polymerase α to DNA polymerase δ. A novel DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase σ (8Wang Z. Castano I.B. De Las Penas A. Adams C. Christman M.F. Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), initially named DNA polymerase κ (9Burgers P.M.J. Koonin E.V. Bruford E. Blanco L.

Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43487-43490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), has recently been described. This novel polymerase is thought to mediate DNA synthesis over areas bound to cohesion proteins, but the mechanism of recruitment of this polymerase is unknown. Presumably, DNA polymerase σ relocates to replication forks with the aid of RFC or a related clamp loader complex. This alternative clamp loader may be a recently described complex consisting of RFC2–5 and CTF18/Chl12, identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 6Hanna J.S. Kroll E.S. Lundblad V. Spencer F.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5838-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two additional proteins, CTF8 and DCC1, were also shown to interact with CTF18 in this complex (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 form part of a clamp loader complex that tethers an unidentified clamp to precohesion areas of DNA, resulting in the recruitment of DNA polymerase σ. The passage of polymerase σ over the precohesion area coincides with cohesion establishment, suggesting that the replication fork plays an active role in this process (10Carson D.R. Christman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8270-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There is evidence that polymerase σ recruitment depends on the CTF18/CTF8/DCC1-containing complex. In yeast, mutation of any of these three proteins resulted in precocious sister chromatid separation, increased rates of chromosome loss, and synthetic lethality with mutations in cohesion proteins such as SCC1 and SMC3 (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 6Hanna J.S. Kroll E.S. Lundblad V. Spencer F.A. Mol. Cell.

Here, we describe the cloning and the initial characterization of this evolutionary conserved alternative RFC complex in Homo sapiens. The three proteins, which we designate hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1, show the same pattern of association in humans as in S. cerevisiae. This suggests a high degree of conservation between yeast and humans in the machinery of cohesion establishment. Predicted Protein Features and Homology—scCTF18 (NP_013795.1), scCTF8 (NP_012061), and scDCC1 (NP_009913) sequences were used to identify human homologs by BLAST search (NCBI). The DNA sequences were translated into hypothetical proteins, whose theoretical characteristics were obtained using several programs in the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (www.expasy.ch/tools/). The protein sequences were entered into MotifScan (pattern searches), PSORT (sorting and localization signal identification), and ProtParam (chemical features). Yeast and human CTF18 amino acid sequences were aligned using the PileUp feature of WebSeq, available at mutant.mayo.edu. Antibodies—We used two complementary methods for antibody production. Most of our antibodies were obtained from synthetic peptides selected for maximum antigenicity. These peptide sequences were CKRTRDEVDATLQIAKLNAAE (hDCC1-N), CQNGVKVYNSRRPIS (hDCC1-C), CKDKILFKTRPKPIITSVPKKV (hCTF8-C), EEMEEPPPPDSSPTDITPPPSPEDC (hCTF18-A), HERPSRKDRPSVEPARVSKEC (hCTF18-C), CAPRNHEQRLEHIMRRAAREEQPEK (hCTF18-D), CNIQQKTDEKVDESGPPAPSK and CPRRGRRPKSESQGNATKND (hPds5); CKRKRGRPGRPPSTNKKPRKS and CSSSSKTSSVRNKKGRPPLHKKR (SA1); and CSSRGSTVRSKKSKPSTGKRKVV and CDLPPSKNRRERTELKPDFFD (SA2). Solutions of these peptides coupled to mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) were used for rabbit polyclonal antibody production. Antibodies recognizing hDCC1 (αhDCC1–4, αhDCC1–5, and αhDCC1–6) were produced from different glutathione S-transferase-fused DCC1 protein fragments. hDCC1 cDNA was amplified via reverse transcription-PCR (Titan System; Roche Applied Science) from RNA isolated from HBL-100 cells. The sequences were subcloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector, which was then transformed into competent BL21 codon + cells. Following induction of BL21 codon + cells with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads and eluted with 5 mm glutathione. Eluates were used for rabbit polyclonal antibody production following standard procedure. All of the antibodies were affinity-purified with protein/peptide-conjugated Sepharose bead columns. Immunoprecipitation—The cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed with 1× NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 10 min. Some experiments were repeated using a gentler lysis buffer (11Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.A. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation, 200 μl of whole cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) on a shaker at 4 °C for 90 min. Following three washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were fractionated via SDS-PAGE (10% gel). The proteins were then transferred to an Immobilon-P™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of primary antibody and 1:1000 dilutions of protein A-horseradish peroxidase and were developed using SuperSignal chemoluminescent solution (Pierce). Selected membranes were stripped with 7 m guanidine hydrochloride for 30 min and reblotted. Cell Culture and Synchronization—MCF-7, T24, and HeLa cells were cultured in 10-cm plates with either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% 10,000 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. T24 cells were synchronized by contact inhibition. They were released into the cell cycle after 4 days by subculturing in a 1:4 ratio and harvested at selected time points. HeLa cells were synchronized by drug treatment. S phase fractions were obtained either by a 24-h treatment with 1 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma) or a double block with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma). The cells were treated with thymidine for 17 h, given fresh medium for 10 h, retreated with thymidine for 19 h, and then harvested. M phase fractions were obtained either by treatment with 10 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) or by agitating plates of normally cycling cells and harvesting the nonadherent mitotic fraction. In all cases, cell cycle distribution was verified by fluorescence automated cell sorting. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown to 20% confluence on glass slides affixed to the bottom of 6-well plates. They were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min, and blocked with 5% milk in PBS for a minimum of 3 h at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated in affinity-purified primary antibody (αPC-10 PCNA and either αhCTF18-D or αhDCC1-N) and 5% goat serum with PBS for4hat4 °C. Immune complexes were detected with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) in 5% goat serum with PBS. Chromatin was counterstained with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 30 s. Stained cells were analyzed with a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope. Cell Fractionation—To verify subcellular CTF18 localization and to determine the affinity of CTF18 for chromatin at different stages of the cell cycle, HeLa cells were fractionated using a protocol modified slightly from Méndez and Stillman (13Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were synchronized as described above, harvested, and resuspended in PBS to equalize cell concentration. The cells were first treated with a nonionic detergent (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 5 min on ice to isolate nuclei. Nuclei were spun down at 1300 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was clarified at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Isolated nuclei were either directly lysed with nuclear lysis buffer (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), or pretreated with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease to release chromatin-bound proteins. Nuclease treatment was performed in nuclear isolation buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) for 1 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched with 1 mm EGTA. The supernatant from this reaction was then clarified by high speed centrifugation. Untreated nuclei were lysed with nuclear lysis buffer for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. The nuclear lysate was clarified with high speed centrifugation. The Alternative RFC Complex Containing CTF8, CTF18, and DCC1 Is Evolutionarily Conserved—A BLAST search of the NCBI data base revealed candidate human homologs of S. cerevisiae CTF8, CTF18, and DCC1. Relevant GenBank™ accession numbers are BC018700 (hCTF8), BC006437 (hCTF18), and BC001316 (hDCC1). We translated these sequences into hypothetical proteins and compared them with the known sequences of S. cerevisiae CTF8, CTF18, and DCC1. Overall amino acid homologies between S. cerevisiae and humans are 27.7% (CTF18), 29.7% (CTF8), and 30.0% (DCC1), with areas of much greater homology for certain conserved domains. We analyzed the amino acid sequences of hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 with various pattern search programs to determine whether their structural motifs might provide insight into protein function. hDCC1 does not contain any known functional domains. However, the alignment of human and S. cerevisiae DCC1 reveals two areas with over 50% conservation, which may correspond to novel domains. One is N-terminal (consensus sequence DKDXXXXVLCSXDKTXXLK), and the other is C-terminal (consensus sequence LPXDXXERFXXLFX- LXXXWXXEDIXPXI). The motifs present in hCTF18 indicate a structural similarity to clamp loader proteins such as RFC1 and Rad17. These include an RFC conserved domain and an NTP-binding motif/NTPase domain (Fig. 1). The RFC conserved domain is also present in yeast CTF18/Chl12, all five subunits of replication factor C and its homolog AC1 (eukaryotic activator 1), Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad17/S. cerevisiae Rad24, Drosophila germline transcription factor 1 (GFN1), and two subunits of bacterial DNA polymerase III. It is thought that this domain mediates DNA binding. In addition, two leucine zipper motifs of unknown significance are present in the C-terminal region of hCTF18 but not in its S. cerevisiae homolog. Structural motif searches of hCTF8 reveal another leucine zipper, which has been noted previously by Mayer et al. (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 Form a Complex in the Cell—To confirm that these putative human homologs of yeast CTF8/CTF18/DCC1 do form a complex in mammalian cells, we generated multiple rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 (Fig. 2A). hDCC1 immunoprecipitates contained a band migrating at ∼45 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass for hDCC1 of 44.8 kDa. hCTF18 immunoprecipitates contained a band near 110 kDa, consistent with the theoretical molecular mass for hCTF18 of 110.2 kDa. To determine whether these three proteins interact in humans, we immunoprecipitated MCF-7 whole cell lysates with αhDCC1-C, αhCTF18-C, and αhCTF8-C and immunoblotted with αhCTF18-D or αhDCC1-N antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B, all three proteins associated with each other, suggesting that a complex containing hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 does exist in human cells. The Expression of hCTF18 and hDCC1 Is Cell Cycle-regulated—Because hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 may be involved in cohesion establishment during S phase in humans, we examined whether the expression of these proteins might be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We analyzed hDCC1 and hCTF18 protein levels in T24 cells that were grown to confluence (arrested by contact inhibition at G0 phase). After 4 days, the cells were trypsinized, replated in fresh medium, and harvested at various time points. As shown in Fig. 3, hDCC1 and hCTF18 protein levels are undetectable at 0 and 8 h after replating. In contrast, the proteins are expressed at low levels as cells enter S phase (24 h), and expression increases dramatically as cells progress through S phase. These data suggest that hDCC1 and hCTF18 are expressed only in actively dividing cells, consistent with their potential role in cohesion establishment in S phase. hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 Associate with RFC3—S. cerevisiae CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 have been shown to interact with all four small RFC subunits. We next examined whether the human homologs would show similar interactions with RFC subunits. As shown in Fig. 4A, the p38 small subunit of replication factor C co-immunoprecipitated hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 and vice versa. Thus, it is likely that hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 form an alternative RFC complex similar to that observed in yeast. The hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1-containing Complex Co-immunoprecipitates with PCNA but Not the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 Complex—Because the hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1-containing RFC complex is likely to function as a clamp loader complex, we sought to determine whether it interacts with any known DNA clamps. These include PCNA, which is involved in DNA synthesis, and the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex, which is involved in the DNA damage response. We immunoprecipitated hCTF18, PCNA, and p38 RFC (as positive control) and Western blotted with αPCNA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B (top panel), PCNA co-immunoprecipitated with p38 or hCTF18-C. As a negative control, rabbit IgG did not immunoprecipitate PCNA. Conversely, hCTF18 also co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). However, only a very small amount of PCNA co-immunoprecipitated with hCTF18, leading us to speculate that PCNA may not be the clamp primarily associated with CTF18/CTF8/DCC1. Therefore, we performed similar experiment to look for an interaction with the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 clamp. The Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex forms a PCNA-like clamp structure and is believed to be involved in DNA damage responses. We failed to detect any stable interaction between hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1 and the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex (Fig. 4C and data not shown). As a positive control, we readily detected the interaction between Rad17 and the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex (11Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.A. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In summary, these results show that hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1 selectively binds PCNA. This finding is supported by a recent paper that identified the putative hCTF18/RFC2–5 complex as a PCNA-binding partner through a proteomics approach (14Ohta S. Shiomi Y. Sugimoto K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out that the hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1 complex may associate with another yet unidentified alternative clamp, which may be functionally redundant with PCNA under certain conditions. hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 Do Not Stably Associate with Cohesin Subunits—Because CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 are thought to be involved in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in yeast, we next examined whether their human homologs interact with proteins in the cohesin complex. These include SMC1, SMC3, Pds5, and the two human SCC3 homologs SA1 and SA2. As shown in Fig. 4D, we failed to detect any stable interaction with members of the cohesin complex. Equivalent experiments in S. cerevisiae also failed to find a physical interaction of CTF18/CTF8/DCC1 with cohesion proteins (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is possible that this alternative RFC complex does not directly interact with cohesion proteins or that this interaction may be very transient. hCTF18, hCTF8, and hDCC1 Are Predominantly Nuclear Proteins—We used immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the subcellular localization of hCTF18 and hDCC1. The proteins had a very similar staining pattern. They localized to nuclear heterochromatin in a diffuse manner and appeared less abundant in nucleoli. Their distribution did not appear to change over the cell cycle, except during mitosis, when hCTF18 and hDCC1 redistributed throughout the entire cell. S phase cells, identified by co-immunostaining with αPCNA (not shown), did not appear noticeably different in terms of hCTF18/hDCC1 staining when compared with non-S phase cells. hCTF18 Preferentially Associates with Chromatin during S Phase—Because we hypothesize that hCTF18 and hDCC1 may form part of an RFC-containing alternative clamp loader complex, we investigated whether its putative S phase function correlates with chromatin binding. Using a cell fractionation assay, we compared protein localization in HeLa cells arrested at different phases of the cell cycle. Whole cell lysate shows that hCTF18 protein level remains stable in actively cycling cells, regardless of the cell cycle stage. We collected mitotic cells by mitotic shake-off and S phase cells by synchronization using thymidine block or hydroxyurea treatment (see “Materials and Methods” for details). In mitotic cells, hCTF18 is present in the initial lysate, suggesting that the complex does not remain associated with chromatin during mitosis. However, only small amounts of hCTF18 are readily extractable from the nucleus during S phase. When S phase nuclei are treated with micrococcal nuclease to release chromatin-bound proteins, the majority of hCTF18 becomes solubilized. This result strongly suggests that hCTF18 associates with chromatin, not with the nuclear matrix, during S phase. To verify the integrity of the fractionation assay, we also blotted with αhOrc2p, one of the chromatin-associated proteins studied by the original authors using this fractionation assay (13Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Finally, we reblotted with anti-β-actin as a loading control for whole cell and cytoplasmic fractions and with anti-CREB1 as a loading control for nuclear extracts (Fig. 5). The findings described above support the existence of a human alternative RFC complex composed of hCTF18, hCTF8, hDCC1, and RFC2–5. Because of its degree of evolutionary conservation, it is likely that the human complex is structurally and functionally similar to its S. cerevisiae homolog. We have shown that this complex binds PCNA but not the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex, suggesting a certain degree of specificity. In addition, these novel human proteins strongly bind the p38 small subunit of replication factor C. The association of hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1 with both PCNA and p38 RFC provide strong evidence that these proteins may function as an alternative RFC-containing clamp loader complex. As expected, these proteins are nuclear and associate preferentially with chromatin during S phase. To date, this is the third known clamp loader complex to be described in humans. In the other two clamp loader systems (RFC1–5/PCNA and hRad17/RFC2–5/Rad9/Rad1/Hus1), there is a remarkable conservation of function between yeast and mammals. Further research will show whether this pattern holds true for the CTF18-containing complex. Despite many recent advances, the mechanism of sister cohesion establishment remains largely unknown. As reviewed by Carson and Christman (10Carson D.R. Christman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8270-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), cohesion establishment appears to involve a polymerase switch from DNA polymerase δ to the newly described DNA polymerase σ (formerly polymerase κ). This switch is probably analogous to the polymerase α/polymerase δ switch mediated by RFC-PCNA during Okazaki fragment synthesis (12Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The novel clamp loader complex hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1/RFC (2Lee J.Y. Orr-Weaver T.L. Annu. Rev. Dev.

Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) may replace RFC during replication over cohesin-bound DNA and associates with PCNA. However, it is not clear whether PCNA is the clamp preferentially bound by this novel complex or whether RFC(hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1) can recruit an additional clamp-like structure. Here, we have shown that there is no detectable association of hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1 with the hRad9/hRad1/hHus1 complex, a PCNA-like complex involved in the DNA damage response (15Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, there are other proteins such as CTF7 that genetically interact with CTF18 and may form a PCNA-like clamp structure. The function of PCNA appears to overlap with that of CTF7, because overexpression of POL30 (PCNA) in yeast rescues the lethal phenotype of a temperature-sensitive mutant of CTF7 (16Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Mayer et al. (5Mayer M.L. Gygi S P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) noted that CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 are excellent candidate genes for cancer predisposition, because their loss leads to an abnormal yet viable phenotype. If hCTF18/hCTF8/hDCC1 proves to be functionally as well as structurally equivalent to its S. cerevisiae homologs, it is likely that alterations of this complex may play a role in human disease. One of the earliest stages of tumor progression is the loss of genomic stability (17Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 386: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Indeed, 80–90% of solid tumors are highly aneuploid, and this aneuploidy is thought to arise before frank transformation takes place. Therefore, genes that mediate chromosomal stability are potential early mutational targets in cancer. It remains to be determined whether the members of this novel RFC-containing complex are mutated in human malignancies or whether their loss can contribute to genomic instability. Further study of this novel replication factor C-containing complex will provide much needed insight into the poorly understood mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment in humans. In addition, it may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of aneuploidy during human carcinogenesis. We thank Drs. Scott Kaufmann and Ralf Janknecht for comments on the manuscript and Dr. Jun Qin for providing anti-SMC1 and anti-SMC3 antibodies."

In addition, Gab family proteins contain multiple conserved tyrosine residues within consensus binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, as well as proline-rich regions that interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Gab proteins play a crucial role in transmitting signals from variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and T and B cell antigens, to downstream effectors involved in normal growth, differentiation, and development programs (reviewed in Ref. 4Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder 1) was the first mammalian gab gene cloned and was originally identified as a Grb2-binding protein in an interaction screen using a cDNA library prepared from glioblastoma (5Holgado-Madruga M.

Gab1 is widely expressed and is phosphorylated downstream from numerous receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, and antigen receptors. In vivo, Gab1 is critical for embryonic development, because gab1-deficient mice die in utero displaying defects in the heart, placenta, and skin, as well as reduced liver size (6Sachs M. Brohmann H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Grb2-independent recruitment of Gab1 requires an 83-amino acid, proline-rich region of Gab1, termed the Met binding domain (MBD). This interaction was initially identified in a yeast-two hybrid interaction assay and requires the kinase activity of the Met receptor and phosphorylation of tyrosine 1349 in the Met receptor C terminus (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Together, tyrosines 1349 and 1356 are required for the full recruitment of Gab1 to the Met receptor (12Nguyen L. Holgado-Madruga M. Maroun C. Fixman E.D. Kamikura D. Fournier T. Charest A. Tremblay M.L. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that docking proteins of the IRS, Dok, and FRS2 families all contain phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)-like domains, the Gab1 MBD has been proposed to be a PTB-like domain that would bind directly to a phosphotyrosine-containing motif involving Tyr-1349 in the Met receptor C terminus (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of interaction between the Gab1 MBD and Met has not been addressed. Previous studies had identified a 13-amino acid sequence, GMQVPPPAHMGFR, within the MBD, as critical for the MBD-Met interaction (15Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Lock L.S. Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2132-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We show that this sequence is sufficient for interaction with the Met receptor, indicating that it is unlikely that the 83-amino acid Gab1 MBD forms a structured PTB-like domain. Moreover, we show that the structural integrity of the Met receptor, and residues upstream of tyrosine 1349 located in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, are required for the Grb2-independent interaction with the Gab1 MBD. These results support the interpretation that the Gab1 MBD interacts with the Met receptor in a novel and previously unsuspected manner, where, instead of the expected interaction of a phosphotyrosine binding domain in Gab1 with a phosphotyrosine-containing motif in the Met receptor, we propose that the activated kinase domain of Met and the negative charge of phosphotyrosine 1349 engage the Gab1 MBD as an extended peptide ligand. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The generation of GST-MBD, GST-MBDΔGrb2, and MBDΔGrb2-myc was previously described (18Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol.

GST-MBD16 and GST-MBD16 R499A were generated by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX 2TK; MBD16-F, GATCCTTTGGAATGCAAGTACCTCCTCCTGCTCATATGGGCTTTAGAAGTTG; MBD16-R, AATTCAACTTCTAAAGCCCATATGAGCAGGAGGAGGTACTTGCATTCCAAAG. Alanine-scanning mutations in Tpr Met-PXM were generated via the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Met C-terminal truncation mutants were generated by insertion of stop codons at amino acids 1348 and 1353, respectively. Tpr Met A and B mutants were p85 and Shc binding variants, respectively, and are described in a previous study (23Saucier C. Papavasiliou V. Palazzo A. Naujokas M.A. Kremer R. Park M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1800-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All mutants were sequenced prior to use. Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and Total Cell Extracts—293T cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm Petri dish and transfected 24 h later by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (24Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and harvested in either 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer for co-immunoprecipitation assays (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2) or in RIPA buffer for GST-pull-down assays (0.05% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate). Inhibitors (10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) were included in each lysis buffer. Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. GST Fusion Proteins, in Vitro Association Assays, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—Fusion proteins were produced in the DH5α, or BL21 gold Escherichia coli strain, by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins (0.5–1 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times prior to a 1-h incubation with the indicated cell lysates (lysed in RIPA buffer). For some experiments, the following peptides were added at the indicated concentrations: Gab1 MBD16 (FGMQVPPPAHMGFRSS) or Gab1 MBD16 R499A (FGMQVPPPAHMGFASS). The peptides were synthesized at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as previously described (10Maroun C.

Far Western Assay—Lysates prepared from 293T cells transiently expressing Tpr Met mutants (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met 144 antibody, loaded on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to membrane, and blocked overnight in 10% milk in TBST containing 1 mm sodium vanadate. GST-Grb2 and GST-MBD were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads with reduced glutathione, and the concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Purified protein (20 μg) was incubated with 2 μl of glutathione-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (G-6400, Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Washed membranes were then incubated with this reaction mixture in 10 ml of TBST for 30 min, prior to washing and ECL. Membranes were stripped and Western-blotted with anti-Met 144 antibody. The protocol is described in a previous study (25Nollau P. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against the extreme C terminus (144 Met (26Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) and the extracellular domain (DL-21, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) of human Met protein were used. RC20H was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, anti-GST and anti-Grb2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-pY1349Met was from Cell Signaling (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and anti-Gab1 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Three-dimensional Modeling of Met—The catalytic domain of Met was modeled using Swiss Model Comparative Protein Modeling Server and was visualized with Swiss-Pdb viewer (27Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar, 28Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 29Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Met kinase domain was modeled on available structures of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors (Protein Data Bank ID codes, 1K3AA, 1IRK, 1IR3A, and 1GAGA). A Peptide Motif within the Gab1 MBD Is Sufficient to Interact with the Met Receptor—The mechanism of interaction between the Gab1 MBD and the Met receptor, as defined from yeast two-hybrid analyses, is still undefined. This is complicated by the fact that one of the Grb2 SH3 domain binding sites is located within the MBD, which contributes to the indirect recruitment of Gab1 to Met. To define the requirements for an interaction that is independent of Grb2, we have utilized a GST fusion protein derived from the MBD region of Gab1 that is lacking the Grb2 binding site (MBDΔGrb2) (18Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous studies had identified 13 amino acids within the MBD as essential for Grb2-independent recruitment of Gab1 (15Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Lock L.S. Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2132-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate the requirements for Met receptor binding, we first established whether a 16-amino acid peptide containing these 13 amino acids (MBD16, FGMQVPPPAHMGFRSS (Fig. 1A)) would act as a competitor in association studies in vitro. Addition of increasing levels of this peptide (10–250 μm) was able to compete the association of GST-MBDΔGrb2 from Met in an in vitro association assay (Fig. 1B). This was specific for the interaction of Met with the Gab1 MBDΔGrb2, because the peptide failed to compete the association of a GST-Grb2 fusion protein with Met (Fig. 1B) or the association of a WT Gab1MBD fusion protein with Grb2 (Fig. 1C). Our previous studies had shown that Arg-499 within the Gab1MBD was required for the interaction of MBD with Met. Arg-499 is located within this 16-amino acid peptide, and a peptide where Arg-499 was converted to Ala (Gab1MBD16-R499A) failed to compete the association of the Gab1 MBDΔGrb2 with Met (Fig. 1D). We had previously demonstrated that insertion of these 16 amino acids into Gab2 was sufficient to confer the capacity for Grb2-independent Met binding on Gab2 (17Lock L.S. Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2132-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear if this short sequence was sufficient to interact with Met independently in a direct manner, or if surrounding amino acids in Gab2, which share homology with the Gab1 MBD, were also required. To investigate this, we created a fusion protein containing only these 16 amino acids fused to GST (GST-MBD16). When used in an in vitro association assay, the GST-MBD16 fusion protein was sufficient to associate with Met, albeit at a lower efficiency than the full-length MBDΔGrb2. Moreover, consistent with our previous studies, the conversion of Arg-499 to Ala abolished the ability of the GST-MBD16 fusion protein to bind to Met (Fig. 1E). No association of Met was detected with GST alone, indicating that binding was specific to the 16 amino acids in the Met binding domain, referred to as the Met binding motif (MBM). Structural Integrity of Met Is Required for Interaction with the Gab1 MBD—The observation that a 16-amino acid peptide derived from Gab1 can bind to Met is inconsistent with the Gab1 MBD forming a structured domain in a manner similar to a PTB or SH2 domain. In general, an interaction between two proteins requires at least one of the interacting regions to form a structured domain. To assess whether the structural integrity of the Met receptor, rather than the Gab1 MBD, is required for this interaction, we performed in vitro association assays with denatured Met protein. Proteins from lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with Met expression plasmids were immunoprecipitated with Met antibody, boiled in 1% SDS to promote protein unfolding, and boiled proteins were then added to the in vitro association assay. As a control, the same assay was performed using the same lysates that were not previously boiled. Importantly, GST-Grb2 and GST-Grb2 SH2 domain fusion proteins bound equally to denatured or non-denatured Met proteins (Fig. 2A). This was not surprising, because the interaction of Grb2 with Met requires only a short phosphotyrosine motif corresponding to Tyr-1356 (YVNV) in the Met C terminus and the structured SH2 domain of Grb2 (30Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In contrast, although the GST-MBDΔGrb2 fusion protein associated with non-denatured Met protein, it failed to bind Met from the boiled lysate containing denatured protein (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the interaction of the Gab1 MBD with the Met receptor requires the structural integrity of Met. This is further supported by the inability of the MBD to bind a denatured Met protein following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane in a Far Western blot assay. In contrast, a GST-Grb2 fusion protein efficiently binds Met in a far Western assay (Fig. 2B). Delineation of the Gab1 MBD Binding Site on Met—To define the requirements in Met for interaction with the Gab1 MBM, we undertook a structure-function approach using previously characterized mutants of Met. The substitution of tyrosine 1349 with phenylalanine severely reduced the association between GST-MBDΔGrb2 and Met in an in vitro association assay (Fig. 3A) or by co-immunoprecipitation when both proteins are transiently overexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the substitution of tyrosine 1356 with phenylalanine had little effect on MBDΔGrb2 binding by either assay, whereas, as expected, a mutant with both Tyr-1349 and Tyr-1356 substituted with phenylalanine residues or a kinase inactive mutant (K1110A) were both unable to bind to a MBDΔGrb2 fusion protein (Fig. 3, A and B). This identifies an important role for phosphotyrosine 1349 in the Grb2-independent interaction with the Gab MBD and supports previous data obtained using a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To determine whether amino acids upstream or downstream from Tyr-1349 are required for Grb2-independent recruitment of the Gab1 MBD, we used existing mutants of the Met oncoprotein where amino acids 1353–1362 of Met were replaced with amino acids distinct from those in the Met receptor but still capable of recruiting signaling proteins. Mutant A contained amino acids derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and mutant B contained amino acids derived from the TrkA receptor, with binding sites for the p85 subunit of PI3′K and the Shc adapter protein, respectively (23Saucier C. Papavasiliou V. Palazzo A. Naujokas M.A. Kremer R. Park M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1800-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When subjected to an in vitro association assay, both the A and B variants were capable of associating with the MBDΔGrb2 fusion protein. As expected, substitution of Tyr-1349 to Phe in either of these variants abolished binding (Fig. 3C). Because the sequence of the A and B inserts are distinct from Met, and B adds additional amino acids, this indicates that residues 1353–1362 are not essential for association with the Gab1 MBDΔGrb2. To determine whether residues in Met C-terminal to 1362 are required, we constructed C-terminal truncation mutants in the Met receptor (Fig. 3E). A Met protein lacking the last 38 amino acids (Δ1353–1390) associated with MBDΔGrb2 to similar levels as WT, as revealed using an antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain of Met. As expected, a Met protein that lacks the last 43 amino acids, including Tyr-1349, (Δ1348–1390) failed to bind (Fig. 3D). This indicates that residues in the C terminus of Met, downstream of Asn-1353 are not required for interaction with the Gab1 MBD, and suggests that residues upstream of Tyr-1349 may be required. Residues Upstream of Tyr-1349 Are Required for Association with the Gab1 MBD—To test this hypothesis, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis on residues surrounding Tyr-1349 and upstream of 1353. Amino acids 1340–1352 were individually substituted with alanine residues and tested for their ability to associate with a GST-MBDΔGrb2 fusion protein. Substitution of several residues upstream of Tyr-1349 in Met was found to significantly decrease the association with the GST-MBDΔGrb2 fusion protein. Notably, substitution of Phe-1341, Phe-1344, Ile-1345, Gly-1346, and His-1348 severely diminished the association, and as shown, the Y1349F Met mutant protein failed to associate with the GST-MBDΔGrb2 fusion protein (Fig. 4B), even though all mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels. Importantly, mutant Met proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated and capable of associating with GST-Grb2 to similar levels as WT Met (Fig. 4C). Hence, the reduction in their association with GST-MBDΔGrb2 was not due to a change in the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutants. We conclude that these mutations specifically alter the ability of Met proteins to associate with Gab1 MBDΔGrb2, without affecting the ability of Met to associate with other interacting partners such as Grb2. This also implies that the structure of the Met receptor kinase domain is not compromised, such that it could no longer phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the C terminus. Indeed, as shown using a phospho-specific Tyr-1349 antibody, all mutant proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated on Tyr-1349 (Fig. 4C), indicating that the diminished association of GST-MBDΔGrb2 is not due to the inability of Met mutant proteins to phosphorylate Tyr-1349. These data identify that residues upstream of Tyr-1349 are required for binding to the Gab1 MBD. A Negative Charge at Residue 1349 Is Sufficient for MBD Binding—Phosphorylation of Tyr-1349 is required for binding to the MBDΔGrb2 (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the role of this phosphorylation is unclear, because the association of the Gab1 MBDΔGrb2 requires structural integrity"

Trichomonas vaginalis is a deep-branching protist that lacks archetypal eukaryotic “aerobic” organelles, specifically mitochondria and peroxisomes. This microaerophilic human-infective parasite carries out fermentative carbohydrate metabolism within hydrogenosomes. Hydrogenosomes are bounded by double membranes and produce ATP by substrate level phosphorylation (1Muller M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Hydrogenosomes are also found in certain chytrids, ciliates, and fungi, in lineages that are phylogenetically distant to the Parabasalian lineage to which trichomonads belong (1Muller M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 2Fenchel T. Finlay B.J. Ecology and Evolution in Anoxic Worlds.

Currently, several lines of evidence support a common endosymbiotic ancestry for hydrogenosomes and mitochondria, despite their distinct metabolic pathways (3Martin W. Müller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 5Dyall S.D. Johnson P.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Embley T.M.

Although the origin of hydrogenosomes within ciliate and fungi lineages is debated, these lineages branch with mitochondria-containing groups and the hydrogenosomes confined therein exhibit strong similarity to ciliate and fungal mitochondria (7Akhmanova A.

Trichomonad hydrogenosomes, on the other hand, are markedly less similar to mitochondria. These organelles lack a genome (9Clemens D.L. Johnson P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) which would have provided a means to investigate their endosymbiotic origin as has been elegantly and convincingly done for mitochondria (10Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). In lieu of this, we and others have attempted to define the relationship between trichomonad hydrogenosomes and mitochondria by examining the origin of their chaperonins, metabolic enzymes, and membrane proteins.

Sci. 2002; 27: 148-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which is typically found in anaerobic bacteria, present a far more ambiguous picture. Phylogenetic analyses of another metabolic enzyme, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, revealed a clustering of all eukaryotic sequences known to date but failed to reveal a relationship to any particular eubacterial group (6Embley T.M. Van Der Giezen M. Horner D.S. Dyal P.L. Foster P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Only one trichomonad hydrogenosomal membrane protein, Hmp31, has been analyzed to date, and it was shown to be a distant homologue of the ADP/ATP carrier, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family (18Dyall S.D. Koehler C.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Bradley P.J. Plumper E. Leuenberger D. Turck C.W. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have continued to study hydrogenosomal membrane proteins to gain further information on the nature of the endosymbiont that gave rise to the trichomonad hydrogenosome, and to further examine the possibility that the same endosymbiont gave rise to both mitochondrion and trichomonad hydrogenosomes. Organellar membrane proteins may originate from pre-existing proteins from the endosymbiont that evolve to fulfill new functions in the emerging proto-organelle. For instance, the Toc75 protein pore translocase in chloroplasts has a homologue of unknown function in cyanobacteria that shows similar pore characteristics (19McFadden G.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, “new” protein families may have emerged such as the mitochondrial carrier family proteins that translocate ATP and various solutes across the organellar membrane in mitochondria (20Kuan J. Saier Jr., M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Likewise, most of the protein translocases in mitochondria have no distinguishable homologues in prokaryotes and appear to have evolved with organelles (21Herrmann J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 74-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel hydrogenosomal membrane protein, Hmp35, that has no known homologue in prokaryotes or eukaryotes to date. It is a relatively abundant membrane protein that exists as an integral membrane complex. The exceptional stability of the complex under stringent salt, urea, and protease treatment is similar to that of bacterial and organellar outer membrane protein pores. Although it has no primary sequence homology to those proteins, Hmp35 has a predominant predicted β-sheet structure similar to that found in the outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids (22Gabriel K. Buchanan S.K. Lithgow T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest a similar function for Hmp35. Finally, we demonstrate that despite the absence of a homologue in yeast or of a recognizable mitochondrial targeting sequence, the Hmp35 can be heterologously expressed in yeast and is targeted to yeast mitochondrial membranes in vivo. Organisms and Strains—T. vaginalis T1 (gift from J. F. Alderete) and C1 (ATCC 30001) strains were used where indicated in this study. Saccharomyces cerevisiae MB2-22 wild-type strain (23Maarse A.C.

Isolation of Hydrogenosomes and Subfractionation—Hydrogenosomes were isolated from T. vaginalis as described previously (24Bradley P.J. Lahti C.J. Plümper E. Johnson P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Isolated hydrogenosomes were stored at –80 °C in freezing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, 8% glycerol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), pH 8). Hydrogenosomes were washed in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 8 (SM) prior to any manipulation. Hydrogenosomes were subfractionated into integral membrane and soluble proteins by sodium carbonate extraction as described before (18Dyall S.D. Koehler C.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Bradley P.J.

Sequencing of MP40 Proteins—Hydrogenosomal membrane proteins were size-separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye R-250, and a gel slice containing 5 μg of the 35–40-kDa proteins was excised, washed with 50% acetonitrile, and subjected to tryptic digest and peptide sequencing at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA). Generation of Antisera against Endogenous Membrane Proteins and Recombinant Hmp35—Polyclonal antisera against 35–40-kDa hydrogenosomal membrane proteins (MP40) were raised in rabbits by 4 injections of 100 μg each. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Hmp35 antisera were raised against purified recombinant His-tagged Hmp35 protein. Screening of cDNA Library with anti-MP40 Antisera—105 phage from a previously described (18Dyall S.D. Koehler C.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Bradley P.J. Plumper E. Leuenberger D. Turck C.W.

Briefly, XL1-MRF′ bacteria infected with 105 phage were grown in top agar at 42 °C until plaques started appearing. Protein expression was induced by placing nitrocellulose membranes saturated with 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside on the plates and further incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. Duplicate membranes were applied for a further 5 h at 37 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes with induced proteins were screened with anti-MP40 antisera, and the bound antibodies were detected by 125I-labeled protein A. Positive phage were excised and sequenced to select those that matched the peptides obtained from sequencing endogenous MP40 proteins. A positive cDNA clone, CD40.31, with a 1.1-kb insert was selected for further analyses. Construction and Screening of an EcoRI T. vaginalis C1 Genomic Library—A genomic library was constructed in the λZAP II vector (Stratagene) from T. vaginalis C1 genomic DNA completely digested with EcoRI. The library was screened with a 640-bp EcoRI/HindIII probe from the cDNA clone CD40.31, yielding a positive clone, MP40.1, with a 2-kb EcoRI fragment bearing the complete hmp35 open reading frame. Plasmid Construction—A 969-bp fragment was generated by PCR from the genomic clone MP40.1 using the primers MP40F and MP40R (Table I) to introduce a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ SalI restriction enzyme site, respectively, for subsequent ligation into the vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to yield the expression construct pEP40.17 with an in-frame hexahistidine tag situated at the N terminus of the hmp35 open reading frame.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimerSequenceMP40F5′-CGCGGATCCGAACCAAAGACATTCGAAACTGT-3′MP40R5′-ACGCGTCGACGTTCAACTCAACGAGGAATGAGT-3′MP40B5′-CGCGGATCCATGGAACCAAAGACATTCG-3′MP40S5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAGTTCAACTCAACGAGG-3′Nhmp35H5′-GTTCCATATGGAACCAAAGACATTCGAAAC-3′BAhmp35H5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGTACCGTTCAACTCAACGAGGAATG Open table in a new tab For construction of the yeast transformation plasmid pRS313-hmp35, the genomic DNA clone MP40.1 was amplified with the PCR primers MP40B and MP40S (Table I) to generate the open reading frame of hmp35 with a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ SalI site, respectively, to allow cloning into the pRS313 vector. For generation of the pHmp35H plasmid, we used the previously described (18Dyall S.D. Koehler C.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Bradley P.J. Plumper E. Leuenberger D. Turck C.W. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) plasmid construct pHmp31-(HA)2 which carries a neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) cassette that allows selection of transformants in T. vaginalis (25Delgadillo M.G. Liston D.R. Niazi K. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4716-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The hmp35 open reading frame was amplified from the genomic clone MP40.1 using the forward primer Nhmp35H (Table I) to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end of the PCR product and the reverse primer BAhmp35H (Table I) to introduce a hexahistidine codon at the 3′ end, followed by a BamHI restriction site. Following restriction digest with NdeI and BamHI, the purified PCR product was introduced into the corresponding sites in the restricted pHmp31-(HA)2 plasmid. Expression and Purification of His 6 -Hmp35—The pEP40.17 plasmid was transformed into E. coli M15 (pREP4) cells and selected with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml kanamycin in LB media. A 500-ml culture was grown at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.8 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Harvested cells were solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, for 1 h at room temperature. The insoluble material was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting lysate applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The column was washed four times with 8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris, pH 6.3. Specifically bound proteins were eluted with 8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.25 m imidazole, 10 mm Tris, pH 4.5, and neutralized. Modification of Cysteine Residues with AMS—200 μg of isolated hydrogenosomes were initially boiled for 5 min in SM, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS and cooled to 37 °C. Controls with His-tagged Hmp35 recombinant protein (3 μg per assay) were processed in parallel. Each sample was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without 5 mm EDTA or 10 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), or 5 mm H2O2, or a mixture of these reagents as indicated. All samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 100 μl of alkylating solution (100 mm iodoacetamide, 100 mm Tris, 100 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 9.5), and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and all samples were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm TCEP, 100 mm Tris, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, pH 9.5, and incubated for 1 h at 44 °C. Some samples were further treated with 4-acetamide-4-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (AMS) at a final concentration of 25 mm, and all samples were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C. Finally, all samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and resuspended in reducing Laemmli sample buffer for 12% SDS-PAGE separation and Western analysis. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis of Organelles—Hydrogenosomes were solubilized at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml for 30 min on ice in n-dodecyl maltoside or Triton X-100 at indicated concentrations in the presence of 20 mm MOPS, 0.2 m or 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 8.0. Sodium carbonate-extracted hydrogenosomal membranes were solubilized at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for 30 min on ice in 0.5% n-dodecyl maltoside or 0.5% Triton X-100 in the presence of 20 mm MOPS, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm PMSF, pH 8.0. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Denatured samples were generated by heating hydrogenosomes (1 mg/ml protein concentration) at 95 °C for 5 min in 0.5% SDS, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm PMSF, pH 8.0. The solubilized proteins were analyzed by blue native electrophoresis on a 6–16% linear polyacrylamide gradient (26Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Solubilization of mitochondria (2.5 mg/ml protein concentration) was performed in 0.5% digitonin as described previously (27Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Schmidt E. Koehler C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Protease Treatment of Hydrogenosomes—Hydrogenosomes (200 μg of total protein) were incubated in SM buffer for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of TCEP and/or 10 mm EDTA as indicated and treated with 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 0 °C. The digestion was inhibited with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) for 10 min on ice. Samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. A similar protease treatment was performed on hydrogenosomes initially solubilized at 1 mg/ml protein concentration in 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, and samples were processed for SDS-PAGE. Sodium carbonate-extracted hydrogenosomal membranes were resuspended at 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration in SM and treated with 0.1 mg/ml or 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min on ice. Following inhibition with 2 mm PMSF, the membranes were recuperated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and resuspended in SM for trichloroacetic acid precipitation before resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Transformation of Yeast—The S. cerevisiae wild-type strain MB2-22 was transformed with the plasmid pRS313-hmp35 under the manipulation of the histidine marker. Standard genetic techniques were used for growth and for transformation of yeast strains (28Guthrie C. Fink GR. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). Selectable Transformation of T. vaginalis—T. vaginalis T1 cells were electroporated with 50 μg of pHmp35H as described previously (25Delgadillo M.G. Liston D.R. Niazi K. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4716-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and transformants (35H) harboring the plasmid were selected with 200 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Crude Fractionation of T. vaginalis 35H Transformants—Cells from cultures of the 35H transformants were broken in a cell disruptor (Energy Service Co.) and fractionated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g into a crude cytosolic fraction and a crude organellar fraction as described previously (18Dyall S.D. Koehler C.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Bradley P.J. Plumper E. Leuenberger D. Turck C.W. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Crude Fractionation of Yeast Cells and Isolation of Mitochondria— Clones from pRS313-hmp35-transformed yeast cells (h35) and from the wild-type MB2-22 strain (wt) were grown in the presence of lactate. The harvested cells were converted to spheroplasts by incubation in 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with zymolase-20T (Seikagaku Corp.), at a concentration of 3 mg/g cells, and subjected to a cell disruptor to break the cellular wall. After an initial 1000 × g spin to discard cellular debris, a crude organellar fraction was separated from the cytosolic supernatant fraction by pelleting the sample at 10,000 × g. For further analyses, highly purified mitochondria were obtained by the Nycodenz gradient procedure (29Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Subfractionation of Purified Mitochondria—250 μg of total protein of mitochondria were used for each of the following sub-localization treatments. Intact mitochondria were treated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were osmotically shocked at 250 μg/ml in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C to generate mitoplasts in the presence or absence of 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. Following the protease or mock treatment, samples were treated with 2 mm PMSF for 10 min on ice to inhibit proteinase K and spun at 16,000 × g to separate the supernatant from the pellet. Both fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and resuspended in equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer. Mitochondria were separated into integral membrane protein and soluble fractions by incubation for 30 min on ice at 250 μg/ml in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Both fractions were resuspended in equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were separated by 10% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Isolation of the HMP35-His 6 Complex from Transformed 35H Hydrogenosomes—Purified 35H hydrogenosomes (1 mg of total protein) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mm MOPS, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and sonicated as described previously (24Bradley P.J. Lahti C.J. Plümper E. Johnson P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was recuperated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of solution A (0.5% n-dodecyl maltoside, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0). Following a preclearing centrifugation step at 40,000 × g, the lysate was incubated with 100 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Novagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The recuperated beads were washed three times each in 1 ml of solution B (0.25% n-dodecyl maltoside, 1 m NaCl, 2 m urea, 20 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0) and in 1 ml of solution C (0.25% n-dodecyl maltoside, 0.5 m NaCl, 4 m urea, 20 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0). The washed beads were divided into 2 aliquots, one of which was eluted in 0.2 ml of solution D (0.25% n-dodecyl maltoside, 0.2 m NaCl, 4 m urea, 20 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m imidazole, 2 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0). The second aliquot was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 0.2 ml of solution E (0.25% n-dodecyl maltoside, 0.2 m NaCl, 6 m urea, 20 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0), and the resulting eluate was collected by centrifugation. The eluates were divided into 2 aliquots that were either subjected directly to blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) or trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and processed for SDS-PAGE. Miscellaneous—Following separation by PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes for Western analysis. Hexahistidine tags were detected with anti-His tag mouse monoclonal antibody. Detection of bound primary antibodies was carried out by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies raised against mouse or rabbit IgG (The Jackson Laboratories), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence with the ECL+ detection system (Amersham Biosciences). DNA and protein sequences were assembled and analyzed using the MacVector program (Accelrys). Isolation and Characterization of Hmp35, a Hydrogenosomal Membrane Protein—To pursue the identification of hydrogenosomal membrane proteins from T. vaginalis, we targeted a number of proteins in the 35–40-kDa range (Fig. 1A, lane 3, MP40) that are of intermediate abundance. The MP40 proteins were microsequenced on a small scale and isolated on a larger scale to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies, anti-MP40. A positive cDNA clone, CD40.31, was isolated by screening an expression T. vaginalis cDNA library. Four of the peptide sequences obtained from the MP40 proteins exactly matched stretches in the translated CD40.31 sequence, confirming that a gene encoding one of the MP40 proteins had been cloned (Fig. 2A). This gene was named hmp35, for hydrogenosomal membrane protein 35. From Northern and Southern analyses performed with the CD40.31 insert (data not shown), the hmp35 gene appeared to be unique. A probe from the CD40.31 clone was used to screen a T. vaginalis genomic DNA library to isolate a clone, MP40.1, that bore the complete hmp35 gene sequence. The gene is flanked by a double initiator sequence 18 bases upstream of the initial methionine residue of the predicted protein, which is within the expected range for T. vaginalis genes (30Liston D.R. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2380-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The conceptual translation of the hmp35 gene predicts a protein of 34.6 kDa consisting of 318 amino acids (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Sequence analyses of Hmp35. A, predicted 318-amino acid sequence of Hmp35. The translated sequence of the hmp35 gene open reading frame is presented. Amino acid stretches matching peptide sequence obtained from sequencing the endogenous Hmp35 protein are underlined.

B, hydrophilicity and transmembrane profiles of Hmp35.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the properties of the Hmp35 protein, we raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-Hmp35) against purified recombinant His-tagged Hmp35. Western analysis of sodium carbonate-extracted hydrogenosomes with these antibodies showed that the Hmp35 protein is found in the membrane pellet fraction and not in the soluble fraction, thus confirming that Hmp35 is present in the hydrogenosome exclusively as an integral membrane protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). The protein, with a calculated mass of 34.6 kDa, migrated at an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the Hmp35 Protein Sequence—The deduced amino acid composition of Hmp35 is shown in Fig. 2A. The predicted N-terminal sequence of Hmp35 bears no homology to the cleavable presequence (MAQPAEQILIAT) that had been found previously (18Dyall S.D. Koehler C.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Bradley P.J. Plumper E. Leuenberger D. Turck C.W. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in the only other characterized hydrogenosomal membrane protein Hmp31. The Hmp35 protein has an unusually high percentage of charged amino acids (24%), with a correspondingly high proportion of lysine residues (11%)"

Until now it was not known whether the product being released in the rate-limiting step was DNA, adenine, or both. MutY hydrolyzes adenine from 8-oxo-G:A (OG:A) base pair mismatches as the first step in the base excision repair pathway, as well as from G:A mismatches. The products are adenine and DNA containing an apurinic (AP) site. Tight product binding may have a physiological role in preventing further damage at the OG:AP site. We developed a rate assay using [8-14C]adenine in OG:A or G:A mismatches that distinguishes between adenine hydrolysis and adenine release. [8-14C]Adenine was released quickly from the MutY·AP-DNA·[8-14C]adenine complex, with a rate constant greater than 5 min–1. This was much faster than the rate-limiting step, at 0.006–0.015 min–1. Gel retardation experiments showed that AP-DNA release was very slow, consistent with it being the rate-limiting step. Thus, the kinetic mechanism involves fast adenine release after hydrolysis followed by rate-limiting AP-DNA release. Adenine appears to be buried deep in the protein·DNA interface, but there is enough flexibility or open space for it to dissociate from the MutY·APDNA·adenine complex. These results have implications for the catalytic mechanism of MutY. MutY, a DNA repair enzyme, is unusual in that it binds exceedingly tightly to its products after the chemical steps of catalysis.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). If OG-containing DNA is replicated, A is incorporated with a 200-fold preference over C. If this OG:A mismatch is not repaired, a further round of replication results in a → T mutation (4Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). MutY hydrolyzes the adenine base from OG:A, forming an apurinic site (AP), OG:AP. OG:AP sites are susceptible to spontaneous strand breakage and are substrates for MutM, a DNA glycosylase/β-lyase (5Michaels M.L. Tchou J. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) that excises OG from OG:C mismatches. With OG:AP, MutM causes a strand break opposite AP, removing all genetic information from that site. Tight binding of MutY to (OG:AP)-DNA may help protect it from strand breakage or inappropriate enzymatic reactions.MutY reactions display biphasic kinetics when [MutY] < [DNA], with a pre-steady state burst followed by a slow steady state rate (6Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).

The steady state rate constant is much lower, 0.003 min–1 with OG:A and 0.02 min–1 for G:A, which has been attributed to rate-limiting AP-DNA release (9Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The steady state rates parallel the higher affinity of MutY for OG:AP sites than for G:AP sites, with dissociation constants (K d) of 50–120 pm and 2–21 nm, respectively (11Wright P.M. Yu J. Cillo J.

It was not known whether this reflects slow adenine release followed by rapid AP-DNA release, or vice versa, or coordinated release of both. The x-ray crystal structure of MutY·adenine reveals a deep binding pocket, where it appears that adenine release would be blocked in a MutY·AP-DNA·adenine complex (14Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S.

Glycosylase reactions proceed through oxocarbenium ion(-like) transition states or intermediates (1) with a positive charge on the sugar ring (15Berti P.J. Tanaka K.S.E. Adv. Phys. Org.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 301-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and they are often susceptible to inhibition by imino sugars such as 2. However, (OG:2)-DNA binding to MutY is no better than (OG:AP)-DNA, whereas an adenine ring mimic in (OG:3)-DNA improved binding by more than 65-fold (17Deng L. Scharer O.D. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem.

This raises the possibility of a catalytic mechanism similar to purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), which is believed to bind tightly with the leaving group and nucleophile but has little interaction with the ribose ring (19Fedorov A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).Duplex Substrate DNAs— 14A-DNA or 33A-DNA (4 μm) was annealed with equal amounts of OG-DNA or G-DNA in 150 μl of 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm EDTA at 90 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 25 °C over 12 h.33P-labeled and Unlabeled (OG:AP)-DNA—(OG:33A)-DNA or (OG:A)DNA duplexes were annealed as described above, except in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 12.5 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 μm oligonucleotide for 33P reactions. After annealing, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added followed by a 2-fold excess of MutY, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before being extracted three times with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to remove MutY. All reactions were >90% complete.Adenine Hydrolysis/Release Assay—All reactions were at 37 °C, and chromatography or PAGE separations were at 6 °C. Substrate DNA (200 nm, 1000 cpm 14C, with 7.5 mm KCl) was equilibrated with reaction buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 12.5 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in 45 μl. MutY (110 nm) was added to start the reaction. For acid-quenched reactions, 5 μl of 3 m HCl was added, and the acidified reaction was placed in liquid nitrogen. It was then thawed and neutralized with 3 m KOH before chromatography.For unquenched reactions, a 30–50 μl aliquot was quickly drawn into an ice-cold 50-μl glass syringe and immediately injected onto a G-25 Sephadex Superfine (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (16 × 490 mm, 9.9 ml) with reaction buffer as eluant and a 2.5 ml/min flow rate. Fractions (2.5 ml) were collected, mixed with 16 ml of scintillation fluid (Liquiscint, National Diagnostics), and 14C was counted. Free [8-14C]adenine concentration was determined from 14C in the low and high molecular weight peaks (Equation 1), [[8-14C]adenine]free,t[[ 14A]-30]0×( 14ClowMr 14ClowMr+14ChighMr)(Eq. 1) where [[8-14C]adenine]free,t is the concentration of free [8-14C]adenine at time = t, [[14A]-DNA]0 is the initial substrate DNA concentration, and 14Clow M r and 14Chigh M r are the amounts of 14C (in cpm) eluted in the low molecular weight and high molecular weight peaks, respectively.No MutY and excess MutY (1.76 μm) reactions were used to determine [8-14C]adenine present in substrate DNA, and any unreactive substrate DNA and [[8-14C]adenine]free were corrected.Rate constants and apparent [MutY] were derived by fitting the experimental data to Equation 2, [P]t=[MutY](1-e-k+2t)+ksst(Eq. 2) where [P]t is product concentration at time = t, k +2 is the burst phase rate constant, and k ss is the steady state rate constant, equal to k +3[MutY], where k +3 is the rate of product release (Fig. 3) (6Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Kinetic mechanism of MutY-catalyzed (OG:A)-DNA hydrolysis. k +2 is the rate of the chemical step, adenine hydrolysis. Previously, k +3 was shown to be slow, but whether the upper or lower pathway was followed was not known. Our results show that the lower kinetic pathway is followed, with fast adenine release and slow (OG:AP)-DNA release.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chromatographic Resolution—The adenine release rate calculation was based in part on the time needed for high molecular weight species (DNA and protein) to be separated from adenine on the gel filtration column. Chromatographic resolution, R s, is given by Equation 3, Rs=Δtr/wav(Eq. 3) where Δt r is the difference in retention time between two peaks, and w av is the average width of the two peaks (23Harris D.C. Quantitative Chemical Analysis. W. H. Freeman, New York1995: 635-636Google Scholar). Two peaks are fully resolved when R s ≥ 1.5, with <0.1% overlap.The intention was to separate adenine from DNA based on size, but it adsorbed on the gel resin, leading to an elution volume of 19 ml for a 9.9-ml bed volume (Fig. 4) and better than expected resolution. A 50-μl test injection containing 2.5 μg of denatured herring sperm DNA and 3.5 nmol of adenine was monitored by A 254 and gave R s = 3.8 (Fig. 4a). The UV chromatogram matched the peak position and shape of 14C elution from an acid-quenched reaction with 15-s fractions. The rate of peak travel and widening was simulated numerically based on that chromatogram. These values were used to calculate peak travel, peak widths, and R s within the gel filtration column at increasing times throughout separation. R s was also measured for test runs with injection volumes from 50 to 2000 μl. The numerical simulations agreed well with experimental values of R s, lending support for their accuracy.Fig. 4a, superimposed gel filtration chromatograms of: (•), 14C (cpm) – (OG:14A)-DNA and [8-14C]adenine from a MutY reaction; (○), 33P (cpm) – (OG:33A)-DNA after reaction with MutY; and (—), A 254 – 2.5 μg of denatured herring sperm DNA and 3.5 nmol of adenine.

Fractions 2 and 3 contained high molecular weight species (G:14A)DNA and (potentially) MutY·(G:AP)-DNA·[8-14C]adenine. Fractions 7–11 contained free [8-14C]adenine. 14C in each fraction is plotted as a fraction of the total 14C applied in each chromatographic run. Calculation of the extent of reaction accounted for [8-14C]adenine present in the substrate (0–3%) and any unreactive material after the reaction was complete (97–100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNA Product Release Assay—Pulse-chase experiments were used to detect transient dissociation of MutY·AP-DNA complexes during gel filtration. 33A-DNAs were reacted with MutY and then chased with unlabeled AP-DNAs followed by gel retardation PAGE (24Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Reactions were as described above, with 200 nm (OG:33A)-DNA incubated with 250 nm MutY for 30 s. A 20–50 μl aliquot was then added to 400 nm (OG:AP)-DNA. The mixture was chromatographed as described above but on a 5-ml HiTrap Desalting column (G-25 Sephadex Superfine, Amersham Biosciences) to reduce sample dilution. Loading buffer (20 μl, 200 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue) was added to the fraction with the highest [DNA] (the 10th 200-μl fraction), and 50 μl was applied to a 145 × 165 × 1.5-mm nondenaturing 10% PAGE run in 0.5× TBE buffer. The polyacrylamide gel was run at 300 V until all the dye had entered the gel (6–8 min) and then was reduced to 70 V. Bands were visualized and quantitated by storage phosphor-autoradiography.Reactions with (G:33A) substrates were the same as (OG:33A) but with 3-min incubations, and the samples were electrophoresed without loading buffer because (G:AP)-DNA release was accelerated by some component of the loading buffer, presumably bromphenol blue.In a second set of experiments, unlabeled substrates were used with a (OG:33AP)-DNA chase. The experiments were as described above but with 150 nm MutY and 50 nm (OG:33AP)-DNA.RESULTSAdenine Hydrolysis/Release Assays—Previous MutY assays took advantage of facile β-elimination at the AP site to cleave the DNA backbone at 90 °C in 0.2 m NaOH. This allowed separation and quantitation of the resulting fragments by PAGE. An assay was developed in this study to report directly on the adenine product by using gel filtration chromatography to separate [8-14C]adenine from 14A-DNA substrate (Fig. 4). Unquenched reactions were analyzed under nondenaturing conditions, with samples cooled rapidly in an ice-cold syringe and injected immediately onto the gel filtration column. If the MutY·AP-DNA·[8-14C]adenine complex were present, it would co-elute with 14A-DNA in the high molecular weight peak. In acid-quenched reactions, MutY was denatured, releasing all of the [8-14C]adenine into solution. Reactions contained 110 nm MutY and 200 nm14A-DNA. At the end of the pre-steady state burst, roughly half of the substrate had been hydrolyzed. If adenine release were slow, most or all of the adenine would have been trapped in the MutY·AP-DNA·[8-14C]adenine complex in the unquenched reactions, and free [8-14C]adenine would have been lower than in the acid-quenched reactions.There was no detectable difference between the acid-quenched and unquenched reactions (Fig. 5, Table I). That is, the free [8-14C]adenine concentration in solution was equal to total [8-14C]adenine, indicating that adenine was released quickly from the MutY active site after the chemical steps of catalysis.Fig. 5Adenine hydrolysis/release with (G:14A)-DNA (a) and (OG:14A)-DNA (b) substrates.

Open table in a new tab The only source of 14C in these experiments was [8-14C]A residues in the substrate, which were converted to [8-14C]adenine upon hydrolysis. No detectable 33P co-eluted with adenine (Fig. 4a), demonstrating that the 14C detected with 14A-DNA substrates was truly from free [8-14C]adenine and not a chromatographic artifact. The small 33P peak at t = 3.5 min corresponded to free [33P]phosphate, which co-eluted with other nonadsorbed low molecular weight species.For the (OG:14A)-DNA reactions, the burst phase was essentially complete in the first time points, and thus the fitted values of k +2, 9 and 18 min–1 (Table I, footnote d), were not considered reliable even though they were in good agreement with literature values. The magnitude of the (OG:14A)-DNA burst phase, 109 nm, agreed with the value expected from active site titration, 110 nm. [MutY] values with (G:14A)-DNA were slightly higher but still within 15% of the active site titration.MutY·AP-DNA Release—With adenine release being fast, an important question became whether it is released directly from the MutY·AP-DNA·adenine complex or whether transient release and rebinding of AP-DNA allows adenine release. Pulse-chase experiments and gel retardation PAGE (24Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) were used to examine the high molecular weight peak from gel filtration. Gel retardation exploits the change in DNA mobility on nondenaturing PAGE when complexed with protein and has been used with MutY to probe DNA binding (9Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D.

If 33AP-DNA dissociated from MutY during chromatography, unlabeled (OG:AP)-DNA would out-compete it to rebind MutY, resulting in displacement of 33AP-DNA. The small proportion of free 33AP-DNA (Fig. 6a, Table II) demonstrated that most of the product DNA did not dissociate even once from MutY during the 9 min between the start of the reaction and separation on gel retardation PAGE. The fraction of free 33AP-DNA was in excellent agreement with that calculated from k +3 and was far from the equilibrium value expected if there was dissociation/rebinding of AP-DNA. The complementary experiment with unlabeled substrate DNA and an (OG:33AP)-DNA chase gave the same result, with only a small fraction of labeled 33P appearing in the MutY·AP-DNA complex (Fig. 6b, Table II).Fig. 6AP-DNA release. a, 200 nm (G:33A)- or (OG:33A)-DNAs were incubated with 250 nm MutY, chased with 400 nm (OG:AP)-DNA, and chromatographed before electrophoresis. b, same as a but with 200 nm (G:A)- or (OG:A)-DNA, 150 nm MutY, and 50 nm (OG:33AP)-DNA chase.

Open table in a new tab Adenine Release Rate—The adenine release rate was estimated from the chromatographic data. The acid-quenched and unquenched reactions were essentially identical for both (OG: A)- and (G:A)-DNA, arguing that adenine release was complete on the time scale of the assay. For short reaction times, the time on the gel filtration column was longer than the reaction time, and adenine release could have occurred during chromatography. If this were the case, the high molecular weight peak would be normal, but the adenine peak would have a long leading edge due to adenine being transported partway down the column in the MutY·AP-DNA·adenine complex before release. Also, the peak would be smaller for the unquenched reaction. There was no detectable 14C eluted between the high molecular weight peak and adenine (Fig. 4b), and [[8-14C]-adenine]free was the same for acid-quenched and unquenched reactions (Fig. 5). Thus, most or all adenine release occurred before chromatographic separation.The shortest elapsed time between the start of reaction and separation on the gel filtration column was ∼23 s, comprising 7 s reaction time, 5–7 s to withdraw an aliquot into an ice-cold syringe and inject it, and 7.8 s for the sample to reach the top of the resin, based on the internal volume of the tubing and fittings. Once on the resin, numerical simulations showed that 1.0 s was required to separate [8-14C]adenine from 14A-DNA and MutY·AP-DNA·[8-14C]adenine. Assuming that 23 s represented at least 3 half-lives of adenine release (87.5% released), then t ½ ≤ 8 s and k +32 ≥ 0.09 s–1 or 5 min–1 (Fig. 3).DISCUSSIONReaction Rates and Adenine Release—The rate constants k +2 and k +3 determined in this study were very similar to those reported previously, where k +2 = 14–15 min–1 (OG:A) and 1.3–2.5 min–1 (G:A), and k +3 = 0.002–0.005 min–1 (OG:A) and 0.02–0.03 min–1 (G:A) (6Porello S.L.

Several studies demonstrated altered NK and T cell function in XLP patients; however, the mechanisms underlying XLP disease are still largely unknown. Here, we show that non-transformed T cell lines obtained from XLP patients were defective in several activation events such as IL-2 production, CD25 expression, and homotypic cell aggregation when cells were stimulated via T cell antigen receptor (TCR)·CD3 but not when early TCR-dependent events were bypassed by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. Analysis of proximal T cell signaling revealed imbalanced TCR·CD3-induced signaling in SAP-deficient T cells. Although phospholipase Cγ1 phosphorylation and calcium response were both enhanced in T cells from XLP patients, phosphorylation of VAV and downstream signal transduction events such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and IL-2 production were diminished. Importantly, reconstitution of SAP expression by retroviral-mediated gene transfer completely restored abnormal signaling events in T cell lines derived from XLP patients. In conclusion, SAP mutation or deletion in XLP patients causes profound defects in T cell activation, resulting in immune deficiency.

T cell activation requires cross-linking of the T cell receptor (TCR)·CD3 complex. Upon TCR·CD3 binding by major histocompatibility complex-presented antigen or CD3-specific antibodies, cascades of protein tyrosine phosphorylations are rapidly induced. Subsequently, the adapter protein LAT (linker for activation of T cells) recruits phospholipase C (PLC)γ1 to the cell membrane, enabling its activation by tyrosine phosphorylation. Activated PLCγ1 liberates inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate from the plasma membrane, mediating an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, a major event for promoting downstream activation (11Clapham D.E.

Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LAT mediates activation of the Ras/ERK pathway (13Zhang W.G. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). TCR-induced VAV-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements are necessary for the maintenance of tyrosine phosphorylation and thus for effective signal transduction (16Valitutti S. Dessing M. Aktories K.

Moreover, T cell adhesion is controlled by VAV-mediated changes of the cytoskeleton that result in enhanced avidity of β1 or β2 integrins (18van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1065-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), promote activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) such as ERK, JNK, and p38, which mediate the transactivation of critical transcription factors such as NFκB (22Karin M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In consequence, several genes encoding cytokines, including IL-2, and cytokine receptors are transcribed to drive the immune response. Previous studies have suggested that SAP acts by binding of its SH2 domain to a consensus motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the cell surface proteins CD150 (SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule)), CD244 (2B4), CD229 (Ly-9), CD84, and NK-T-B-antigen (NTB-A) (1Morra M.

Blood. 2002; 99: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, recent work indicates also a direct role of SAP in TCR-mediated signaling. Herpesvirus saimiri-immortalized CD4+ T cells from XLP patients were shown to exhibit elevated levels of early tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ chain, ZAP 70, and Cbl, along with altered MAPK activation and cytokine production (28Nakamura H. Zarycki J. Sullivan J.L. Jung J.U. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that non-transformed T cell lines derived from XLP patients are defective in several activation events, leading to impaired IL-2 production. Importantly, defects were bypassed by stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and corrected by retroviral-mediated expression of the SH2D1A gene. Analysis of proximal T cell signaling revealed that SAP deficiency causes an imbalanced signaling with enhanced calcium response but defects in other proximal signaling events, which could underlie inadequate T cells downstream activation. In conclusion, these data indicate that SAP functions as an integrator in very early T cell signal transduction that is crucial for proper T cell activation. Antibodies—Antibodies were obtained as follows: CD3 (anti-CD3), Leu-28 (anti-CD28), anti-CD3ζ, PE-labeled anti-CD25 and PE-labeled anti-IL-2 from PharMingen; anti-PLCγ1, anti-phospho ERK-1,2 and anti-ERK-2, anti-phospho JNK and anti-JNK-1, anti-IκB-α and anti-p38 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphop38 from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); anti-VAV and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); anti-SAP from Exalpha Biologicals (Boston, MA); F(ab′)2-fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG from Sigma; horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG from Bio-Rad; horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG from Accurate (Westbury, NY). T Cell Line Establishment—Two XLP patients and four healthy age-matched controls were included in the study. The two XLP patients (H.X., T.D.) have been characterized previously (29Parolini O. Kagerbauer B. Simonitsch-Klupp I. Ambros P. Jaeger U. Mann G. Haas O.A. Morra M. Gadner H. Terhorst C. Knapp W. Holter W. Ann. Hematol. 2002; 81: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). They presented with the following SH2D1A mutations: patient H.X. revealed a g deletion at the invariant dinucleotide of the acceptor splice site of exon 3, resulting in a splicing defect that causes a frameshift with premature stop codon; patient T.D. presented a G to T nucleotide change at the translation initiation codon (ATG to ATT), leading to a methionine to isoleucine amino acid change. T cell lines were generated according to a previously described protocol (30Cocks B.G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Nature. 1995; 376: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in 24-well plates (Costar) with 2 × 105 allogeneic irradiated (50,000 milligray) EBV-transformed B cells and 1 × 106 allogeneic irradiated peripheral blood lymphocyte cell, in 1 ml of Yssel's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, phytohem-agglutinin (1 μg/ml, Sigma) and rhIL-2 (100 units/ml, kindly provided by Dr. Aversa, Novartis Institute, Vienna, Austria). Cells were maintained and expanded by periodic media changes and restimulation every second week. T cell lines were cultured in medium without rhIL-2 for 3 days before performing all functional assays reported here. Periodic immunophenotyping revealed 100% CD3+ cells and normal percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ (60 ± 15%; 40 ± 15%, respectively) in T cell lines from XLP patients and healthy controls. No significant variations were observed during cell expansion or after retroviral gene transfer. T Cell Proliferation Assay—Fourteen to seventeen days after the last stimulation, 1 × 105 cultured T cells were plated in U-bottom 96-well plates in 200 μl of RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml), alone or in combination with soluble anti-CD28 (7 μg/ml) and PMA (0.1 μm) plus ionomycin (1 μm). Three days later, cells were harvested for scintillation counting after pulsing with 1 μCi of 3H-labeled tritiated thymidine during the last 16 h of culture. SH2D1A Retroviral Vector Generation, Transfections, and Transductions—The SH2D1A cDNA (31Lewis J. Eiben L.J. Nelson D.L. Cohen J.I. Nichols K.E. Ochs H.D. Notarangelo L.D. Duckett C.S. Clin. Immunol. (Orlando). 2001; 100: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the MND-IRES-EGFP retroviral vector were generous gifts of Drs. C. S. Duckett (University of Michigan) and D. B. Kohn (Children's Hospital Los Angeles), respectively. The full-length SH2D1A cDNA was blunt-ended and ligated into the SfoI site of MND-IRES-EGFP (M-IE), upstream of the IRES sequence, thus generating MND-SH2D1A-IRES-EGFP (M-SAP-IE), a bicistronic retroviral vector expressing both SH2D1A and EGFP under the control of the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus LTR. M-SAP-IE and MNDIRES-EGFP plasmid DNAs (20 μg) were transfected into the ectropic packaging cells GP+E-86 (32Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. Virology. 1988; 167: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). EGFP-positive cells were FACS-sorted (FACS Vantage, BD Biosciences) and used to produce retroviral supernatant that was in turn used to transduce the gibbon-ape leukemia virus envelope packaging cell PG13 (33Miller A.D. Garcia J.V. von Suhr N. Lynch C.M. Wilson C. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2220-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGFP-positive PG13 cells were FACS-sorted and used to generate retroviral supernatant that was used to transduce SAP-deficient and control T cells. Initial transduction efficiency, as evaluated by determination of EGFP fluorescence, varied from 5 to 10% for both the control (M-IE) and SH2D1A constructs (M-SAP-IE). Positive cells were sorted (FACS Vantage, BD Biosciences) and restimulated for two rounds resulting in a 100% EGFP-positive population. Retrovirus-mediated expression of SAP protein in XLP cell lines was proven by Western blot analysis (data not shown). All retroviral cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Expression of IL-2 and CD25, Homotypic Cell Aggregation—T cells from controls and XLP patients (106 cells/well) were plated in RPMI supplemented with serum in 24-well plates and stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3, alone or in combination with 7 μg/ml Leu-28 or with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1.5 μm) at 37 °C for 8 h in the presence of brefeldin-A (5 ng/ml). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min, washed with saponine (0.1%), and incubated with PE-labeled rat anti-human IL-2 for 25 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For detection of CD25 as well as for analysis of homotypic aggregation, cells were stimulated in the same way but without brefeldin-A for 24 h at 37 °C. Photographs were taken, and cells were analyzed by standard flow cytometric analysis using anti-CD25-PE. Protein Phosphorylation and IκB Degradation—Cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) plus 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and for induction of VAV and MAPK phosphorylation as well as IκB degradation, preincubated on ice with 10 μg/ml Leu 28 for 15 min followed by 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 for 1–15 min at 37 °C. Phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was induced by incubation with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 cross-linked with 20 μg/ml F(ab′)2-fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG for 2 min at 37 °C. After stopping by addition of ice-cold RPMI medium, cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were lysed on ice for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7,4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), phosphatase (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA), and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin; 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.4 mm Pefabloc). After removing nuclei by short centrifugation, samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 were determined with phospho-specific antibodies. Subsequently, membranes were stripped and reprobed for non-phosphorylated antigen as a quantity control. PLCγ1 and VAV tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and subsequent stripping and reprobing of the membrane with anti-PLCγ1 and anti-VAV, respectively. IκB degradation was calculated by subtracting the amount of IκB in stimulated samples from that of unstimulated samples, which were set to 100%. Chemiluminescence was generated by BM chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Applied Science) and quantified on a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science) as detailed elsewhere (34Zeyda M. Staffler G. Horejsi V. Waldhausl W. Stulnig T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28418-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Cytoplasmic Calcium Response—Cells were labeled with the fluorescent Ca2+-indicator INDO-1 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by incubation of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg/ml INDO-1 at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples (106 cells in 250 μl of Hank's balanced salt solution, supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were then equilibrated to 37 °C for 7 min. During flow cytometric measurement, cells were stimulated via CD3 by addition of 2 μg of anti-CD3. Measurement of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by flow cytometry was performed on a FACStarPlus (BD Biosciences) equipped with an argon laser (excitation, 333–363 nm; detection, 530 nm for calcium-free INDO-1, 395 nm for calcium-bound form) at 37 °C constant temperature as detailed (35Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Horejsi V. Waldhausl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19242-19247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ratio of the fluorescence intensities at both wavelengths was computed as a direct estimate of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration and was determined for 5 min following stimulation. Cell Adhesion—T cell lines from controls and XLP patients (106 cells/well) were plated on ice for 45 min in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 0.4% bovine serum albumin in 96-well flat bottom cell culture plates coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were stimulated with different concentrations of anti-CD3 (from 2.5 to 0.15 μg/ml in serial dilution 1:2) or with PMA (100 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline, each well was photographed for counting adherent cells. Statistics—Patient and control cells were always tested in parallel. Values of controls and patients were related to the mean of controls of the same experiments, which was set to 100%. Differences between patient and control cells were compared by two-tail unpaired Student's t test. For comparison of cells transduced with M-SAP-IE and M-IE, values of control vector-transduced cells were related to cells from the same donor reconstituted with M-SAP-IE, which was set to 100%. Differences between M-IE vector and M-SAP-IE-transduced cells were analyzed by one-group student's t test. Data are given as mean ± S.E.; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. T Cells from XLP Patients Show Reduced Proliferative Response and Defective IL-2 Production That Are Corrected by Retroviral Introduction of SH2D1A Gene—We obtained nonimmortalized T cell lines from two previously diagnosed XLP patients (29Parolini O. Kagerbauer B. Simonitsch-Klupp I. Ambros P. Jaeger U. Mann G. Haas O.A. Morra M. Gadner H. Terhorst C. Knapp W. Holter W. Ann. Hematol. 2002; 81: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and several healthy controls. XLP T cell lines showed a significantly diminished proliferative response both to CD3 as well as to CD3 plus CD28 antibody stimulation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, cell proliferation following PMA/ionomycin stimulation was comparable between patients and controls (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, both CD3 alone and CD3 plus CD28 stimulation lead to a markedly decreased IL-2 production in XLP T cell lines when compared with normal controls as demonstrated by intracellular FACS analysis (Fig. 1B) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing of culture supernatants (data not shown). Importantly, also IL-2 production was completely unaffected in XLP T cells when early TCR-dependent events were bypassed by stimulation with PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 1B). To test whether the functional defects observed in patient-derived cell lines were caused by alterations of the SH2D1A gene, retroviral-mediated gene transfer was applied to express a normal copy of the SH2D1A cDNA in these cells. As postulated, activation defects in XLP T cell lines were restored following gene transfer. Both T cell proliferation and IL-2 production were significantly more pronounced in patients' T cell lines reconstituted with the M-SAP-IE vector when compared with those transduced with the M-IE control (Fig. 2, A and B). Transduction of SH2D1A gene in T cell lines derived from normal controls did not influence their functional responses (data not shown).Fig. 2Restoration of proliferative response and IL-2 production in XLP T cell lines by reconstitution with SH2D1A. T cell lines from both patients transduced with SH2D1A (M-SAP-IE) or control vector (M-IE) were stimulated with CD3, CD3/CD28, or PMA/ionomycin. As shown in A, proliferation was assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine after 72 h. The means ± S.E. of three independent experiments are shown. Significant differences when compared with M-SAP-IE-transduced cells are indicated by asterisks (**, p < 0.01). As shown in B, IL-2 production was assessed by flow cytometry. The dot plots show a representative experiment, and the diagram shows means ± S.E. of the number of IL-2-positive cells of three independent experiments for CD3 and six independent experiments for CD3/CD28, each including the two (M-SAP-IE) and (M-IE) patients' cell lines. Results are expressed in percentage of the mean of M-SAP-IE-transduced cell lines. Significant differences are indicated as in panel A. FSC-H, forward scatter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Impaired Activation of T Cells from XLP Patients—Besides production of interleukins, proliferation of T cells is regulated by expression of the inducible IL-2Rα chain (CD25), which enables the formation of the high affinity IL-2 receptor complex (36Taniguchi T. Minami Y. Cell. 1993; 73: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Expression of CD25 in response to CD3/CD28 stimulation was significantly decreased in T cell lines derived from XLP patients when compared with controls (Fig. 3A). As observed for IL-2 production and cell proliferation, stimulation with PMA/ionomycin induced CD25 expression in T cells from patients and controls to a similar extent (Fig. 3A). As a further hallmark of successful T cell activation we investigated homotypic cell aggregation; Fig. 3B shows typical CD3 and PMA/ionomycin-induced clustering of T cell lines derived from XLP patients and normal controls. Homotypic aggregation was severely impaired in XLP T cell lines when induced via CD3 but was comparable with controls after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. To elucidate the particular signaling events affected by SAP deficiency that lead to the observed downstream effects, we analyzed signaling pathways in T cell lines of XLP patients. Induction of IL-2 transcription requires activation of MAPKs such as ERK-1, -2, JNK, and p38 whose kinase activities are regulated by phosphorylation (23Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). CD3/CD28-stimulated phosphorylation of all three MAPKs was markedly decreased in XLP when compared with control T cell lines (Fig. 4A), although reduction in ERK phosphorylation failed to reach statistical significance. In addition to reduced MAPK phosphorylation, CD3/CD28-induced degradation of IκB, which masks the NFκB nuclear localization signal in quiescent cells, was profoundly blocked in XLP T cell lines when compared with controls (Fig. 4B). In summary, all investigated downstream T cell signaling events were markedly impaired in XLP patients. SAP Deficiency Causes Imbalanced Proximal T Cell Signaling—To elucidate the mechanisms underlying diminished downstream signaling in XLP T cell lines, we analyzed very proximal T cell signaling events. Interestingly, CD3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was markedly enhanced when compared with control cell lines (Fig. 5A). Also, calcium responses were significantly increased in XLP T cell lines following stimulation with low concentrations of anti-CD3 that induced only minimal responses in control cells (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, calcium responses in XLP cells reconstituted with the SH2D1A gene were markedly diminished when compared with XLP cells transduced with control vector, indicating that the enhanced CD3-induced responses are due to SAP deficiency (Fig. 5C). In contrast to PLCγ, the tyrosine phosphorylation of VAV following CD3/CD28-stimulation was significantly decreased in XLP T cell lines when compared with controls (Fig. 6A). To analyze whether the blocked VAV phosphorylation had an impact on VAV-dependent downstream events, we analyzed CD3-induced cell adhesion. Following stimulation with different concentrations of anti-CD3, T cell adhesion to fibronectin was significantly reduced in XLP patients when compared with controls (Fig. 6B), whereas no difference between patients and controls was observed after PMA stimulation. Similar to the cell proliferation and IL-2 production experiments shown earlier, this adhesion defect of patient cell lines could be corrected by transfection with M-SAP-IE but not with the control vector M-IE (Fig. 6C). These results clearly indicate that SAP deficiency causes an imbalance in early signaling events associated with enhanced PLCγ/calcium signaling but impaired VAV phosphorylation and consequently defective T cell adhesion.

https://openalex.org/W2089488870,"Three inteins were found when analyzing a pair of split dnaE genes encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III in the oceanic N2-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum. The three inteins (DnaE-1, DnaE-2, and DnaE-3) were clustered in a 70-amino acid (aa) region of the predicted DnaE protein. The DnaE-1 intein is 1258 aa long and three times as large as a typical intein, due to the presence of large tandem repeats in which a 57-aa sequence is repeated 17 times. The DnaE-2 intein has a more typical size of 428 aa with putative protein splicing and endonuclease domains. The DnaE-3 intein is a split intein consisting of a 102-aa N-terminal part and a 36-aa C-terminal part encoded on the first and second split dnaE genes, respectively. Synthesis of a mature DnaE protein is predicted to involve expression of two split dnaE genes followed by two protein cis-splicing reactions and one protein trans-splicing reaction. Tandem repeats in the DnaE-1 intein inhibited the protein splicing activity of this intein when tested in Escherichia coli cells and may potentially regulate DnaE synthesis in vivo.

Inteins are protein sequences embedded in precursor proteins, and they catalyze the protein-splicing reaction that excises the intein and joins the flanking sequences (Nand C-exteins) with a peptide bond (1Perler F.B.

A typical protein splicing reaction has 4 steps including N → S (or N → O) acyl shift at the N terminus of intein, trans-esterification forming a branched intermediate, cyclization of an Asn residue at the C terminus of intein, and formation of a peptide bond between the flanking exteins (2Xu M.Q.

A typical intein is ∼400 aa 1The abbreviation used is: aa, amino acid(s).1The abbreviation used is: aa, amino acid(s). long and bi-functional, having both protein-splicing function and endonuclease function. The two functions correspond to two separable structural domains of the intein, in which the Nand C-terminal parts of intein make up the protein splicing domain and the middle part of intein makes up the endonuclease domain (5Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The protein splicing function ensures the self-removal of intein from the host protein, and the endonuclease function promotes the maintenance and spread of the coding sequence of intein via a gene conversion (intein homing) mechanism (6Cooper A.A.

Nearly 200 intein and intein-like sequences have been found, and most are listed in the Intein Registry (9Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 10Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Dassa B. Shainskaya A. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These inteins are distributed sporadically in many different proteins among bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes, which is consistent with inteins being mobile genetic elements capable of lateral gene transfers. Although inteins generally show low levels of sequence conservation, they appear similar in overall structure, function, and evolution origin (11Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Gogarten J.P. Senejani A.G. Zhaxybayeva O. Olendzenski L. Hilario E. Annu. Rev.

Genet. 2000; 34: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Inteins were found most frequently in DNA-related proteins such as DNA polymerase, although also found in many other types of proteins, and it is possible that intein hotspots may exist in some proteins for yet unknown reason (11Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Liu X.Q. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Some inteins lack an endonuclease domain and exist as mini-inteins with protein splicing function only. A DnaE intein in some cyanobacterial species not only lacks an endonuclease domain but also exists as a split intein with its Nand C-terminal parts encoded on two separate genes. Synthesis of a mature Ssp DnaE protein required the expression of the two split dnaE genes followed by a protein trans-splicing reaction catalyzed by the split intein (14Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed the dnaE gene of the oceanic N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum that forms massive surface bloom (rapid cell proliferation) with important ecological consequences (15Orcutt K.M. Rasmussen U. Webb E.A. Waterbury J.B. Gundersen K. Bergman B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2236-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Mulholland M.R. Capone D.G. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 148-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed three inteins clustered in a small region of the DnaE protein, which included a typical bi-functional intein, a split mini-intein, and an unusual intein containing large tandem repeats that inhibited protein splicing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Cloning and Analysis—GenBank™ searches and protein sequence alignments were performed using the BLAST search program (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar) and the Clustal W program (18Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Parts of the Ter dnaE gene were amplified by doing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from total genomic DNA of T. erythraeum strain IMS101. The DnaE-1 intein coding sequence was PCR-amplified using primers M144 (5′-ATGTCCTTCGTCGGTCYTCCATATC-3′) and M145 (5′-ATCAATAAATCGCCTTCACATTGTAATC-3′) and cloned in a pDrive plasmid vector (Qiagen). To allow complete DNA sequence determination, nested deletions were made in the cloned DNA by doing partial digestion at XmnI restriction sites present once in each of the 171-bp repeat sequences. In Southern blot analysis, ∼2 μgof T. erythraeum genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes BfuAI and BglII, resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, and blotted onto nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized to a specified 32P-labeled DNA probe for 20–24 h and washed under high stringency (65 °C in 0.2× SSC and 1% SDS) before exposing x-ray films.Protein Splicing Analysis in Escherichia coli Cells—To construct gene expression plasmids, Ter DnaE-1 intein coding sequence (PCR-amplified using the above M144 and M145 primers) was inserted in the previously made pMST plasmid (19Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) between XhoI and AgeI sites, replacing the Ssp DnaB intein coding sequence of pMST′. Protein production in E. coli cells, gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were performed as before (19Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells containing the expression plasmid were grown in liquid Lurie Broth medium at 37 °C to late log phase (A 600, 0.5). isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm to induce production of the recombinant protein, and the induction was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested and lysed in SDSand dithiothreitol-containing gel loading buffer in a boiling water bath before electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blots were carried out using anti-thioredoxin antibody (American Diagnostica) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL). Intensity of protein band was estimated using a gel documentation system (Gel Doc 1000 coupled with Molecular Analyst software, Bio-Rad).RESULTSSplit dnaE Genes Contain Tandem Repeats—To find new split dnaE genes using our previous finding (14Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we searched the GenBank™ containing the nearly complete genome sequence of T. erythraeum strain IMS101 that had been determined at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov). As illustrated in Fig. 1, parts of putative split dnaE genes were found on three sequences with accession numbers AAAU01000106, AAAU01000117, and AAAU01000050, respectively. Our initial analysis indicated that the first split dnaE gene spans an undetermined sequence gap between the first two GenBank™ sequences. To determine this sequence gap, it was PCR-amplified from T. erythraeum genomic DNA using primers specific to the two GenBank™ sequences, and the resulting 4-kb DNA fragment was cloned (Fig. 2). DNA sequence determination of the cloned DNA produced the missing part of the first split dnaE gene sequence and revealed large tandem repeats in which a 171-bp DNA sequence is repeated 17 times. To confirm the presence and size of the tandem repeats in the T. erythraeum genome, Southern blot analysis was performed after digesting the genomic DNA with BfuAI and BglII restriction enzymes that cut outside the tandem repeats (Fig. 2). A 0.3-kb DNA probe next to the repetitive sequence hybridized to a BfuAI-BglII DNA fragment that matched closely the 3216-bp size predicted from DNA sequence. No DNA fragment of other sizes was detected, indicating a uniform size of the tandem repeats in the cell population and their genomes. A 1.3-kb DNA probe, which is specific to the tandem repeats, also hybridized to the 3.2-kb BfuAI-BglII DNA fragment as predicted. This DNA probe did not hybridize to DNA fragment of other sizes, indicating that the 171-bp repetitive sequence was not detectable in other parts of the genome under these conditions. This is consistent with results of Blast searches of the GenBank™, in which we did not find the 171-bp repetitive sequence outside the dnaE gene in the nearly complete genome sequence of T. erythraeum.Fig. 2PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis of T. erythraeum DnaE-1 intein coding sequence. Top, a thick line represents the genomic region encoding the DnaE-1 intein, with the solid parts representing the known unique sequences and the dotted part representing the tandem repeats determined in this study.

The predicted Ter DnaE protein contains three inteins named Ter DnaE-1, Ter DnaE-2, and Ter DnaE-3 inteins, respectively. The three inteins divide the DnaE protein sequence into four parts that are named E1, E2, E3, and E4 exteins and are 719, 26, 44, and 481 aa long, respectively. The predicted mature DnaE protein (1270 aa extein sequences, excluding the intein sequences) is over 60% identical to DnaE proteins of two distantly related cyanobacterial species, and this level of DnaE sequence identity is similar to that between the other two cyanobacterial species. Blast searches of GenBank™ sequences did not reveal additional dnaE-or dnaE-like genes (complete or partial) in the nearly complete T. erythraeum genome sequences. The three inteins in Ter DnaE protein are clustered in a 70-aa region of the DnaE extein sequences, with the DnaE-1, DnaE-2, and DnaE-3 inteins located after residues Leu719, Arg745, and Tyr789, respectively, of the DnaE extein sequences (Fig. 3A). The extein-intein boundaries were readily defined, because the extein sequences are very similar to DnaE proteins of other cyanobacteria and also because of the conserved intein sequence features (Fig. 3, B and C). A Cys follows immediately the DnaE-1 intein in the Ter DnaE protein, whereas Val is found at corresponding positions in other DnaE proteins lacking the intein. Similarly, a Cys follows immediately the DnaE-2 intein in the Ter DnaE protein, whereas Ala is found at corresponding positions in other DnaE proteins lacking the intein. The DnaE-3 intein is followed by Cys in all three compared DnaE proteins containing the intein. These are consistent with the requirement of a nucleophilic amino acid (e.g. Cys) after an intein (3Perler F.B. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and may explain the absence of DnaE-1 and DnaE-2 inteins in the other DnaE proteins.Fig. 3Protein sequence comparisons. A, DnaE extein sequences of T. erythraeum (Ter) are aligned with corresponding DnaE sequences of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 (Ssp) and Nostoc punctiforme (Npu). Only extein sequences proximal to the intein sequences are shown. Numbers mark amino acid positions in the 1270-aa complete extein sequence (excluding the intein sequences) of Ter DnaE protein. Names of the three inteins are shown in parentheses, and they are positioned in the extein sequence after amino acid residues Leu719, Arg745, and Tyr789, respectively. B, sequence alignment of the T. erythraeum DnaE-1 intein (Ter DnaE-1), the T. erythraeum DnaE-2 intein (Ter DnaE-2), and the S. sp. PCC6803 DnaB intein (Ssp DnaB). Tandem repeats R1–R17 in the Ter DnaE-1 sequence represent the 17 57-aa repeating units. Consensus sequence of R1–R16 is shown in uppercase letters, with sequence variations shown in lowercase letters. C, the T. erythraeum DnaE-3 split intein sequence (Ter DnaE-3) is aligned with the S. sp. PCC6803 DnaE split intein sequence (Ssp DnaE), with the position of split indicated in parentheses. Putative intein sequence motifs (A through H) are underlined. Symbols: - represent gaps introduced to optimize the alignment; * and. mark positions of identical and similar amino acids, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Ter DnaE-1 intein has a predicted 1258-aa sequence consisting of a 299-aa N-terminal sequence, a 969-aa repetitive sequence (17 tandem repeats of a 57-aa sequence), and a 40-aa C-terminal sequence (Fig. 3B). The Ter DnaE-1 intein would be 339 aa long, after excluding the tandem repeats, and has putative intein sequence motifs (20Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) for a protein splicing domain and an endonuclease domain (Fig. 3B), although it showed less than 15% sequence identity to other known inteins. Presence of the tandem repeats makes the Ter DnaE-1 intein three times as large as a typical intein. The tandem repeats are located at or near the C-terminal boundary between the putative endonuclease domain and the splicing domain. Coding sequence of the tandem repeats is most likely translated, because its 2907-bp sequence is maintained as a continuous open reading frame with its flanking coding sequences, while its non-coding frames contain numerous termination codons as expected. Among the 17 tandem repeats, the first 16 (R1–R16) are 91–100% identical to each other in DNA sequence and 88–100% identical to each other in protein sequence, and the last repeat (R17) differs from the others at the C-terminal end (Fig. 3B).The Ter DnaE-2 intein resembles typical bi-functional self-splicing inteins, with a predicted 428-aa sequence that has putative sequence motifs for both a protein splicing domain and an endonuclease domain (Fig. 3B). The Ter DnaE-2 intein is significantly similar to the Ssp DnaB intein, showing 27% protein sequence identity and 46% protein sequence similarity.The Ter DnaE-3 intein is a split intein encoded by two split dnaE genes found on two yet unlinked sequence contigs (Fig. 1). These two split dnaE genes could be on opposite DNA strands of the T. erythraeum genome, as was the case in another cyanobacterium (14Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), or they could be on the same DNA strand and at least 56,449 bp apart, based on the available DNA sequences. Predicted protein sequences of the DnaE-3 split intein consist of a 102-aa N-terminal part encoded on the first split dnaE gene and a 36-aa C-terminal part encoded on the second split dnaE gene (Figs. 1 and 3C). GTG was assumed to be the start codon of the second split dnaE gene, based on the absence of an upstream ATG codon or an appropriate down-stream ATG codon, and also based on amino acid sequence comparisons with other DnaE split inteins (Fig. 3C). The Ter DnaE-3 split intein is 59% identical to the previously characterized Ssp DnaE split intein, although the N-terminal part of the Ter DnaE-3 split intein is 21 aa shorter than that of the Ssp DnaE split intein (Fig. 3C).Tandem Repeats in Ter DnaE-1 Intein Affect Protein Splicing—To determine whether the Ter DnaE-1 intein is functionally affected by the presence of the tandem repeats, we tested its protein splicing activity in E. coli cells. A plasmid-borne fusion gene was constructed to produce a fusion protein in which the Ter DnaE-1 intein (plus its 5-aa native extein sequence on each side) was fused to an N-terminal maltose-binding protein and a C-terminal thioredoxin (Fig. 4). Similar fusion protein containing other inteins has been used in previous studies (19Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), so that the protein splicing products are readily identified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Precursor protein, spliced protein, and excised intein were identified by their predicted sizes, and the first two were further identified using anti-thioredoxin antibody. Variations of the fusion gene were also made after deleting parts or all of the tandem repeats coding sequence. When the complete tandem repeats (17 57-aa repeating units) were present in the intein, only the precursor protein was observed at either 37 or 25 °C incubation temperature, indicating the absence of protein splicing. When the number of the 57-aa repeating units was reduced to less than 4, both spliced protein and excised intein were observed in addition to the precursor protein, indicating that protein splicing had occurred. To estimate the efficiency of protein splicing, intensity of individual protein band on Western blot was used to measure the amount of that protein, and protein splicing efficiency was calculated as the amount of spliced protein divided by the sum of spliced protein and precursor protein. The efficiency of protein splicing was estimated to be 73, 55, 50, and 45% for Ter DnaE-1 intein containing 0, 1, 2, and 3 of the 57-aa repeating units, respectively. Ter DnaE-1 intein containing 4 of the 57-aa repeating units showed less than 5% protein splicing.Fig. 4Protein splicing of Ter DnaE-1 intein. Top, schematic illustration of the fusion protein construct consisting of maltose-binding protein sequence (M), intein sequence (black box), and thioredoxin sequence (T). Middle, predicted sizes of protein products from different fusion protein constructs (numbered as lanes 2 through 7) containing the specified number of the 57-aa repeating units (DnaE-1 intein, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 17 repeats). Fusion protein construct containing the Ssp DnaB mini-intein (numbered as 1) was included as a known standard for identifying the spliced protein (19Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Bottom, observation of protein splicing. Total cellular proteins of E. coli cells producing the specified fusion protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (left panel) or Western blot using anti-thioredoxin antibody (right panel). The lane numbers correspond to the above fusion protein construct numbers. Position of the precursor protein is marked by the letter P, the spliced protein by the letter S, and the excised intein by a black dot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONSplit dnaE Genes and Multiple Inteins—We have shown that two split dnaE genes together encode a DnaE protein containing three inteins in T. erythraeum, predicting that the synthesis of mature DnaE protein involves expression of the two split dnaE genes followed by two protein cis-splicing reactions and one protein trans-splicing reaction. The predicted mature DnaE protein, after excluding the inteins, is very similar to known DnaE proteins of related organisms in size and sequence, and no other dnaE-like gene was found in the nearly complete genome sequence of T. erythraeum. The three inteins were readily identified in the Ter DnaE protein, because they are insertion sequences showing clear boundaries, conserved intein sequence motifs, and significant sequence similarities to known inteins. The DnaE-1 and DnaE-2 inteins may be relatively recent acquisitions in the Ter DnaE protein, because they were found only in T. erythraeum, and they have putative endonuclease domain for intein homing. Sequence similarities (27% identical and 46% similar) between Ter DnaE-2 intein and the cyanobacterial Ssp DnaB intein are significantly higher than those seen among non-homologous inteins (12Gogarten J.P. Senejani A.G. Zhaxybayeva O. Olendzenski L. Hilario E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 263-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which may suggest a common ancestor for these two inteins, although their host proteins or insertion sites have no apparent similarity. The Ter DnaE-1 intein is of unknown origin, having very low sequence similarity to other known inteins even after excluding the tandem repeats. The Ter DnaE-3 split intein, present in at least two other cyanobacterial species (9Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), likely has an ancient origin preceding the divergence of the distantly related cyanobacterial species. This split intein is least likely to spread through intein homing or lateral gene transfer, because it lacks an endonuclease domain and is encoded on split genes. The DnaE-1, DnaE-2, and DnaE-3 inteins are clustered in a small (70 aa) region of the large (1270 aa, excluding the inteins) DnaE protein, suggesting that this small region may be a hotspot for intein insertions. Intein hotspots may also exist in other proteins, such as a DNA replication factor protein in which three inteins (Mja RFC-1, RFC-2, and RFC-3 inteins) were found in an 87-aa region (9Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The Ter DnaE protein is unique in that its three inteins include both cis-splicing inteins and trans-splicing split intein.Tandem Repeats Inside Intein—The Ter DnaE-1 intein is most unusual with the presence of large tandem repeats, which was revealed in sequence determination of the cloned DNA and confirmed in Southern blot analysis of the genome. This is the first repetitive sequence found inside an intein. The tandem repeats are strikingly large (57 aa repeated 17 times), unlike the single amino acid repeats associated with Huntington's disease (24Rubinsztein D.C. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 202-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Also unlike typical repetitive sequences that are dispersed in many parts of the genome and often not translated, the tandem repeats of Ter DnaE-1 intein were translated and not detected in other parts of the T. erythraeum genome in GenBank™ searches and in Southern blot analysis. The tandem repeats may have originated from duplications of a pre-existing piece of the intein sequence, although they did not show similarity to known intein sequences and were not required for the protein splicing function of the intein. Alternatively, the tandem repeats may have originated from exogenous sequences that entered the Ter DnaE-1 intein. Self-splicing inteins have been thought as “safe havens” for homing endonucleases present in most inteins, because the ability of self-removal through protein splicing of the intein makes them tolerated by the host protein. The Ter DnaE-1 intein can be such a safe haven to the tandem repeats, if the latter were selfish genetic elements of unknown function. The Ter DnaE-1 intein could also be a “waste bin,” if the tandem repeats had no function at all.Possible Function of the Tandem Repeats—Perhaps more likely, the tandem repeats may play a biological role in T. erythraeum, which would provide a reason for this organism to maintain the tandem repeats. Tandem repeats are prone to changes in length, because of polymerase slippage in DNA replication and unequal crossing over in DNA recombination. Tandem repeats of Ter DnaE-1 intein exhibited uniform size in PCR and Southern blot analysis, which may suggest unknown mechanism or reason for maintaining the number of the 57-aa repeating units at 17. Individual repeating units of the tandem repeats showed less than 10% DNA sequence heterogeneity and less than 12% protein sequence heterogeneity, which may also suggest unknown mechanism or reason for maintaining the tandem repeats. Different tandem repeats in a number of other proteins have been known to play structural or ligand/substrate-binding roles, which include examples like mucin, cell surface proteins, and proteins containing spectrin repeats (25Staub E. Perez-Tur J. Siebert R. Nobile C. Moschonas N.K. Deloukas P. Hinzmann B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 441-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Djinovic-Carugo K.

Health Res. Rev. 2001; 2: 163-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggested that the tandem repeats of Ter DnaE-1 intein may regulate the protein splicing activity of this intein, because protein splicing in E. coli cells was inhibited when 4 or more of the 57-aa repeating units were present in the intein. This may predict a regulatory mechanism in the native T. erythraeum cell that overcomes the inhibition of protein splicing by the tandem repeats or reduces the number of the 57-aa repeating units to less than 4, to produce a mature DnaE protein (catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III). The predicted regulatory mechanism may regulate DNA polymerase III synthesis and in turn DNA replication and cell proliferation. Interestingly, the N2-fixing T. erythraeum is known to form massive ocean surface bloom (rapid cell proliferation) with important ecological consequences (15Orcutt K.M. Ra"
https://openalex.org/W2091386983,"Abstract ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes can induce the translocation (sliding) of nucleosomes in cis along DNA, but the mechanism by which sliding occurs is not well defined. We previously presented evidence that sliding induced by the human SWI/SNF complex does not occur solely via a proposed “twist-diffusion” mechanism whereby the DNA rotates about its helical axis without displacement from the surface of the nucleosome (Aoyagi, S., and Hayes, J. J. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biol. 22, 7484–7490). Here we examined whether the Xenopus Mi-2 nucleosome remodeling complex induces nucleosome sliding via a twist-diffusion mechanism with nucleosomes assembled onto DNA templates containing branched DNA structures expected to sterically hinder rotation of the DNA helix on the nucleosome surface. We find that the branched DNA-containing nucleosomes undergo xMi-2-catalyzed sliding at a rate and extent identical to that of nucleosomes assembled on native DNA fragments. These results indicate that both the hSWI/SNF and xMi-2 complexes induce nucleosome sliding via a mechanism(s) other than simple twist diffusion and are consistent with models in which the DNA largely maintains its rotational orientation with respect to the histone surface."
https://openalex.org/W1965843395,"The highly conserved aspartyl-, asparaginyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases compose one subclass of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, called IIb. The three enzymes possess an OB-folded extension at their N terminus. The function of this extension is to specifically recognize the anticodon triplet of the tRNA. Three-dimensional models of bacterial aspartyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetases complexed to tRNA indicate that a rigid scaffold of amino acid residues along the five β-strands of the OB-fold accommodates the base U at the center of the anticodon. The binding of the adjacent anticodon bases occurs through interactions with a flexible loop joining strands 4 and 5 (L45). As a result, a switching of the specificity of lysyl-tRNA synthetase from tRNALys (anticodon UUU) toward tRNAAsp (GUC) could be attempted by transplanting the small loop L45 of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase inside lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Upon this transplantation, lysyl-tRNA synthetase loses its capacity to aminoacylate tRNALys. In exchange, the chimeric enzyme acquires the capacity to charge tRNAAsp with lysine. Upon giving the tRNAAsp substrate the discriminator base of tRNALys, the specificity shift is improved. The change of specificity was also established in vivo. Indeed, the transplanted lysyl-tRNA synthetase succeeds in suppressing a missense Lys → Asp mutation inserted into the β-lactamase gene. These results functionally establish that sequence variation in a small peptide region of subclass IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contributes to specification of nucleic acid recognition.

Because this peptide element is not part of the core catalytic structure, it may have evolved independently of the active sites of these synthetases. In protein biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; AspRS, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; AsnRS, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase; LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetases.1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; AspRS, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; AsnRS, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase; LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetases. establish physical relations between each amino acid and the corresponding tRNAs. Therefore, the accuracy of this family of enzymes is crucial to guarantee the fidelity of translation of mRNA. To ensure a correct matching between substrates, each synthetase recognizes a small number of nucleotide positions inside its cognate tRNA(s). These positions are also called the identity elements of tRNAs. The major identity elements in all Escherichia coli aminoacylation systems have now been identified (reviewed in Ref. 1Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In most cases (17 of 20), the anticodon sequence itself behaves as a major identity element. Additional identity elements are frequently found in the acceptor stem. They often include the so-called discriminator base 73 (2Crothers D.M. Seno T. Söll D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3063-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). From primary sequence and structural analyses, a partition of the 20 synthetases into two classes has been proposed (3Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 4Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In the first class, the catalytic domain adopts a nucleotide binding fold (Rossmann fold). In class II synthetases, the enzyme center is built around an antiparallel β-sheet. Additional domains, the three-dimensional structures of which are highly variable, contribute to the specificity and the strength of cognate tRNA binding to each synthetase. Among these domains, some are believed to have been added late in evolution, when the contemporary tRNA structure arose. Indeed, modern tRNA structure may be viewed as two domains with distinct functions (5Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Cell. 1995; 81: 983-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One domain is formed by stacking of the TΨC stem onto the acceptor helix, whereas the other results from the stacking of the anticodon stem onto the D stem. The first domain is a substrate for aminoacylation with the different amino acids. The second domain is necessary to pair with the mRNA template in translation. It is currently proposed that primitive aminoacylation systems were based on the first domain. The anticodon-containing domain would have been added later. In response to the increase in the size of the tRNA molecule, new domains would have been added to the early synthetase. With the help of such domains, the evolving synthetases gained the capacity to dock the anticodon of the tRNA far from the activated amino acid and, therefore, to diversify tRNA specificity around a catalytic core structure. In each class of synthetases, subclasses can be defined on the basis of homologies between domains. The highly conserved aspartyl-, asparaginyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases (AspRS, AsnRS, and LysRS) compose one such subclass called IIb. In the three synthetase:tRNA systems, the anticodon, and the discriminator base are identity elements (6Hasegawa T. Himeno H. Ishikura H. Shimizu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the aspartate system, identity elements also include base C38 and, less importantly, base pairs G10–C25 and G2–C71 (Fig. 1A). The three members of subclass IIb possess an appended N-terminal domain involved in the recognition of the three anticodon bases of tRNA. This domain has an OB-folded conformation. Such a fold is characterized by a five-stranded Greek key β-barrel capped by an α-helix between the third and the fourth strand. It is an attribute of various nucleic acid-binding proteins (16Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) but is also found in several oligosaccharide binding proteins, in pyrophosphatase, in inhibitors of metalloproteinases, and in histidine kinases (17Conte L.L. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J.P. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 264-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the aspartate, asparagine, and lysine systems, the central base of the anticodon is always a U. Structural studies of AspRSs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, E. coli, and Thermus thermophilus and of LysRSs from T. thermophilus and E. coli have shown that this base interacts with a rigid scaffold of amino acid residues presented by the β-strands of the OB-fold (18Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Nature. 1993; 362: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P.

Biol. 2000; 299: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The three residues sustaining this scaffold are conserved in almost all known AsnRS, AspRS, and LysRS sequences. They are as follows: an arginine between strands 1 and 2, a phenylalanine on strand 2, and a glutamine on strand 3. Most of the other residues in contact with the anticodon triplet are clustered in a loop (L45) joining strands 4 and 5 in the β-barrel. In the E. coli and T. thermophilus LysRS systems, L45 includes residues 130–136 and 113–119, respectively (Fig. 1B). In E. coli LysRS, Thr-131 is involved in the recognition of the anticodon base U35 of tRNALys, whereas Thr-133 and Glu-135 interact with U36. The main chain amide of Lys-132 interacts with U34. In the L45 loop of yeast AspRS, the hydroxyl group of Ser-181, the main chain carbonyl of Pro-178 and the main chain amide of Lys-180 are hydrogen-bonded with C36. Regarding E. coli and T. thermophilus AspRSs, L45 includes residues 77–92 and 77–90, respectively. C36 of tRNAAsp is recognized by the side chains of an arginine and of an asparagine (Arg-78 and Asn-84 in the E. coli system) and by a main chain carbonyl (Asn-82 in E. coli) (Fig. 1B). Queosine-34 interacts with the side chain of an Arg residue (Arg-76 in E. coli) (23Eiler S. Dock-Bregeon A.C. Moulinier L. Thierry J.C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Briand C. Poterszman A. Eiler S. Webster G. Thierry J.C. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data were obtained with the Asp system. They indicated that the first residue of strand 5 also contributed to the recognition of the anticodon bases (18Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Nature. 1993; 362: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Eiler S. Dock-Bregeon A.C. Moulinier L. Thierry J.C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Briand C. Poterszman A. Eiler S. Webster G. Thierry J.C. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In all known AspRS and AsnRS sequences, this residue is a Glu. In the solved AspRS-tRNA three-dimensional structures, the Glu is hydrogen-bonded with base 34 (queosine in prokaryotic tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn, guanosine in eukaryotic tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn). In almost all LysRS systems, the equivalent amino acid residue in strand 5 is a serine or a threonine (Ser-137 in E. coli LysRS). However, according to the results of several structural studies, this serine or threonine residue is involved in the binding of base U35 in tRNALys and not in that of base 34 (21Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6321-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Commans S. Lazard M. Delort F. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From all the above data, a general picture of tRNA anticodon recognition by subclass IIb synthetases can be drawn, with the binding of bases 34 and 36 mainly achieved by residues belonging to the L45 loop. To establish the functional contribution of this region to the fidelity of tRNA recognition, we transplanted the L45 loop of E. coli AspRS inside the E. coli LysRS sequence and measured the ensuing change of specificity. The two residues flanking the loop were also transplanted because of the documented interaction of the Glu-93 residue in strand 5 of AspRS with base 34 in tRNAAsp. Our results indicate that, upon the transplantation, LysRS loses its capacity to aminoacylate tRNALys. In exchange, the chimeric enzyme acquires the capacity to charge tRNAAsp with lysine. Upon giving the tRNAAsp substrate the discriminator base of tRNALys, the specificity shift could be improved. The change of specificity was also probed in vivo by monitoring the capacity of the transplanted LysRS to suppress a missense Lys → Asp mutation inserted into the β-lactamase bla gene. These experiments establish that, at a precise location within the appended N-terminal domain of subclass IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a small segment is a critical determinant of tRNA anticodon recognition. Bacteria and Plasmids—The following E. coli K12 derivatives were used in this study: JM101TR (Δ(lac-pro) supE thi recA56 srl-300::Tn10 (F′ traD36 proAB lacI q lacZΔM15)) (25Hirel P.H. Lévêque F. Mellot P. Dardel F. Panvert M. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and PALΔSΔUTR (F– Δ(lac-pro) gyrA rpoB metB argE(Am) ara supF ΔlysS::kan ΔlysU srl-300::Tn10 recA56 (pMAK705 lysU)) (26Commans S. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8180-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLysSH, harboring the wild-type E. coli lysS gene, was obtained by inserting the 1-kbp PstI-HindII fragment from M13PhlysS (26Commans S. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8180-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of plasmid pC1 (26Commans S. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8180-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBluescript KS+ was from Stratagene, and plasmid pQE70 was from Qiagen. To construct a pBluescript derivative harboring lysS and a kanamycin resistance gene, an ∼2-kbp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from plasmid pBluescript KS+, using oligonucleotides GCGAGATCTCCTTTTTGATAATCTCATGA and GCCAGATCTTAAATTGTAAACGTTAATAT. This fragment included a BglII site at each end, the replication origin of the plasmid, the replication origin of M13, and the polylinker region. It was deprived of the ampicillin resistance gene. The amplified fragment was further digested by BglII and ligated to the 1265-bp BamHI-BamHI kanamycin resistance cassette derived from pUC4K (27Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar), to give pBSkan. Then a DNA fragment containing the 635-bp KpnI-BssHII fragment from pLysSH and the 1.2-kbp BssHII-SpeI fragment from pXLysKS1 (28Lévêque F. Plateau P. Dessen P. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was inserted into the KpnI and SpeI sites of pBSkan to give pBSkanLysS. Preparation of tRNAs—Overexpressions of E. coli tRNALys, E. coli wild-type tRNAAsp, and E. coli mutant tRNAAspA73 were obtained in JM101TR cells, from synthetic genes built as described previously and inserted into pBSTNAV (29Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Bulk tRNA containing overexpressed tRNALys accepted 1000 pmol of l-lysine per A 260 unit. Bulk tRNAs containing overexpressed tRNAAsp and mutant tRNAAspA73 were further purified by chromatography on a C4 reverse-phase column (30Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recovered tRNAAsp accepted 1000 pmol of l-aspartic acid per A 260 unit. Because tRNAAspA73 had become a poor substrate of AspRS, the amino acid acceptance of this tRNA was determined with the help of LysRSBAsp in the presence of radiolabeled lysine. One A 260 unit of tRNAAspA73 could be esterified with 1200 pmol of l-lysine. Mutagenesis of the β-Lactamase gene—The bla gene was amplified by PCR from plasmid pBluescript using oligonucleotides GCGGGATCCTGCAGAATCAGGTGGCACTTTTCGG and GCCAAGCTTCTGCAGATCTTCACCTAGATCCTTTT. The first PCR primer hybridizes 133 nucleotides upstream to the N-terminal sequence of bla. It also contains BamHI and PstI recognition sequences at its 5′-end. The second primer corresponds to the C-terminal sequence of bla followed by HindIII and PstI recognition sequences. The amplified fragment (1070 bp) was digested by BamHI and HindIII and inserted between the corresponding sites of the vector M13mp19. Then site-directed mutagenesis was applied to change the lysine 73 codon of bla into an aspartate codon (31Sayers J.R. Schmidt W. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Finally, the resulting gene was inserted between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pACYC184 (32Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give pACYblamut. Mutagenesis of the lysS Gene—In order to substitute the L45 loop of LysS by that of AspRS, a HindIII and a SacI restriction sites were created inside the lysS gene of plasmid pLysSH by changing the CTG codon of Leu-128 and the TTG codon of Leu-143 into synonymous CTT and CTC codons, respectively. The resulting plasmid, pLysSHΔ, still produced wild-type LysS. Subsequently, a set of 4 self-paired oligonucleotides allowed the assembly of the DNA sequence encoding residues 76–93 of E. coli AspRS (Arg-Ala-Arg-Asp-Glu-Lys-Asn-Ile-Asn-Arg-Asp-Met-Ala-Thr-Gly-Glu-Ile-Glu), flanked ahead by the HindIII recognition sequence, and followed by (i) a short DNA sequence corresponding to 5 amino acids from LysS (Ile-His-Cys-Thr-Glu) and (ii) the SacI recognition sequence. The DNA sequence eventually obtained was inserted between the HindIII and SacI sites of pLysSHΔ, to give plasmid pBAsp. Plasmid pBSkanBAsp was obtained by inserting the 3.8-kbp KpnI-XbaI fragment from pBAsp into the corresponding sites of pBSkan. Fusion of LysU with a Polyhistidine Tag—With the aim of facilitating the separation of the mutant LysRS from wild-type LysRS, an E. coli strain was constructed in which the only source of LysRS activity was provided by a LysU protein (28Lévêque F. Plateau P. Dessen P. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) fused with a His6 tag at its C terminus. For this purpose, the entire lysU gene plus 159 nucleotides upstream, flanked by SphI and BamHI restriction sites, was amplified by PCR and inserted between the SphI and BglII sites of pQE70. Then, the XhoI-HindIII fragment of the resulting plasmid (pQE70LysUtag) was inserted between the SalI and HindIII sites of pACYC184 to give pACYLysUtag. This plasmid was used to transform PALΔSΔUTR cells at 42 °C. It was verified that pMAKlysU was eliminated at this temperature and that transformants had kept plasmid pACYLysUtag. Purification of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases—The mutant LysRSBAsp enzyme was purified from PALΔSΔUTR cells harboring both pACYLysUtag and pBAsp plasmids (Fig. 2). Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 500 ml of 2× TY medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The culture was harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All steps of the purification were performed at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication for 6 min. Removal of nucleic acids by streptomycin sulfate precipitation and concentration of the proteins by ammonium sulfate precipitation were performed as described previously (33Brevet A. Chen J. Lévêque F. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14439-14444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The protein pellet (160 mg) was dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample (26 ml) was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose column (1.2 × 5.5 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. After a 30-ml wash with buffer A (15 ml/h), elution was carried out using a linear gradient from 0 to 20 mm imidazole in buffer A (80 ml, 4 ml/h). The fractions displaying lysine-dependent ATP-PPi exchange activity (9 ml) were pooled. After concentration by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation), and dialysis against buffer A, the protein sample (19 mg in 12 ml) was submitted to a second identical Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography. Finally, 11 mg of protein were recovered in 11 ml. As judged from SDS-PAGE analysis, LysRSBAsp was at least 95% pure.

All the purified enzymes were stored at –20 °C in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 60% glycerol. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Activity Measurements—Prior to activity measurements, solutions of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were diluted in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mm 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin (from Roche Applied Science).

The exchange reaction was initiated by the addition of catalytic amounts of LysRS (5–10 nm). After quenching of the reaction, 32P-labeled ATP was adsorbed on charcoal, filtered, and counted as described (35Blanquet S. Fayat G. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Initial rates of tRNA aminoacylation were measured for 5 min at 28 °C, in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA. l-[14C]Lysine (11.7 GBq/mmol) or l-[3H]aspartic acid (8 GBq/mmol) were systematically added in the assay at a 10 μm concentration. Under these conditions, the synthetases were not fully saturated by the amino acid. Indeed, published K m values of wild-type LysRS and AspRS toward their cognate amino acids are 4.5 and 60 μm, respectively (33Brevet A. Chen J. Lévêque F. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14439-14444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Moulinier L. Eiler S. Eriani G. Gangloff J. Thierry J.C. Gabriel K. McClain W.H. Moras D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5290-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Depending on the efficiency of the reaction, k cat and K m parameters could be individually measured or not. In the first case, to measure k cat and K m, the concentration of the tRNA under study was varied between 0.05 and 12 μm. Enzyme concentrations are 0.025 nm (LysS in the presence of tRNALys), 25 nm (LysRSBAsp, tRNAAsp), 2.5 nm (LysRSBAsp, tRNAAspA73), or 100 nm (AspRS, tRNAAspA73). In most of the mischarging reactions (aminoacylation of tRNAAsp or tRNAAspA73 by LysS, of tRNALys by LysRSBAsp, or of tRNALys by AspRS), the rates of aminoacylation were very slow, and enzyme concentration in the assays had to be increased up to the micromolar range to detect time-dependent product formation. In such cases, to be allowed to derive apparent k cat/K m constants from the equation v i/[E]0 = (k cat/K m)[S]0, we systematically checked that the initial rate of product formation was directly proportional to the time of incubation and to the total added enzyme (E) concentration. The ranges of assayed enzyme concentrations are as follows: 0.5–3 μm LysS, at a fixed tRNAAsp concentration of 6 μm or at a fixed tRNAAspA73 concentration of 8 μm; 0.5–3 μm LysRSBAsp (fixed tRNALys fixed"

A., and Levy, S. B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 6101–6106). Second-site suppressor mutations were identified following hydroxylamine and nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. Three mutations, L11F in transmembrane 1 (TM1), A213T in the central interdomain loop, and A270V in cytoplasmic loop 8–9, restored a wild type level of resistance and an active efflux activity in Escherichia coli cells bearing the mutant tet(C) gene. The Tet S202F protein with the additional A270V mutation was expressed in amounts comparable with the original mutant, whereas L11F and A213T Tet(C) protein mutants were overexpressed. Introduction of each single mutation into the wild type tet(C) gene by site-directed mutagenesis did not alter tetracycline resistance or efflux activity. These secondary mutations may restore resistance by promoting a conformational change in the protein to accommodate the S202F mutation. The data demonstrate an interaction of the interdomain loop with other distant regions of the protein and support a role of the interdomain loop in mediating tetracycline resistance.

One of the major bacterial protections against the growth inhibitory action of tetracycline is exporting the drug out of the cytoplasm, thus preventing its reaching the ribosome target (2Thanassi D.G.

Some resistance can be obtained by cloning the two domains of the Tet protein separately in the cell without the interdomain loop (18Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J.

Hybrid interclass Tet protein constructions and second-site suppressor studies revealed that interactions of both domains are required for Tet function (20McNicholas P. McGlynn M. Guay G.G.

Complete cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of Tet(B) (22Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

Among them, 17, mostly glycine and proline, are considered to be essential, whereas the other 41 affect the Tc resistance phenotype mediated by Tet(B) only slightly. Four mutations, D190C, E192C, S201C, and M210C, located within the interdomain loop, caused greatly reduced tetracycline resistance levels (8–32-fold) (22Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S.

A double frameshift within the interdomain of Tet(A) changed its substrate specificity and increased the efflux of minocycline and glycylcyclines (23Tuckman M. Petersen P.J. Projan S.J. Microb. Drug Resist. 2000; 6: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In Tet(C), the interdomain mutation S202F leads to a 12-fold increase in tetracycline susceptibility of the Escherichia coli cells bearing the tet gene on a low copy number plasmid (1Saraceni-Richards C.A. Levy S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6101-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, the insertion of four residues increasing the length of the Tet(C) interdomain loop increased Tc susceptibility (14Jewell J.E. Orwick J. Liu J. Miller K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the poor conservation of the amino acid sequence, the interdomain loop of tetracycline efflux proteins appears to be important in the mediation of tetracycline resistance. This study was designed to look for amino acid changes that restored tetracycline efflux activity to a mutant strain having a deleterious first mutation in the Tet(C) interdomain loop. Materials—[3H]Tc (0.93 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pfu DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Stratagene and Invitrogen. Antibiotics were obtained from Sigma, except for AHTc, which was prepared in this laboratory.

Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis of Plasmid DNA—Mutagenesis in vitro was performed with hydroxylamine, which specifically induces GC → AT transitions by deaminating the cytosine residues (26Budowsky E.I.

Genet. 1976; 145: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 μg of plasmid p202FCH prepared using the Qiagen Spin Mini preparation kit were incubated in 400 mm hydroxylamine, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH6), and 100 mm EDTA in a 100-μl volume for 40 min at 68 °C. The entire volume was drop-dialyzed against sterile water for 1 h 30 min at room temperature on a type VS filter (0.025-μm pore size) (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The treated DNA was ethanol precipitated and washed with 70% ethanol before being resuspended in sterile water. Mutagenesis of p202FCH with MNNG was performed as described previously in DH5α cells (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 125-129Google Scholar). After both mutagenic events, 40 ng of plasmid DNA were introduced by electroporation into DH5α electro-competent cells (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) using 0.2-cm cuvettes and a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 200 ohms, 25 microfarads, and 25 kV/cm. To maximize the isolation of independent mutants, the entire transformation mix (1 ml) was divided into 10 equal portions prior to incubation and plating. Subsequently, transformants were selected on plates containing chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) (for plasmid maintenance) and tetracycline (15 μg/ml). Tc-resistant mutants appeared usually after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Only one single colony per plate was chosen for analysis to ensure that the mutants isolated were generated in separate mutagenic events. Each colony was checked for its tetracycline susceptibility by overnight liquid growth in LB broth containing chloramphenicol and tetracycline (15 μg/ml). The plasmids from the Tc-resistant clones were extracted, and their copy numbers were estimated by plasmid preparation on gels. Those plasmids whose copy numbers were not increased were chosen to retransform DH5α to assure that the Tc resistance observed was a plasmid-mediated mutation in the tet gene. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of tet(C) on plasmid pFS1 was performed by a two-stage PCR method adapted from a PCR overlap method (29Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 30Wang W. Malcom B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Two primers corresponding to the sense and antisense sequence of the tet(C) gene were designed to incorporate a restriction endonuclease site along with the desired mutation where possible. The following sense primers were used: primer L11F, 5′-CAATGCGCTCATCGTAATATTCGGCACCGTC-3′; primer A213T, 5′-GGGGCATGACTATCGTCACCGCACTTATGACTGTC-3′; and primer A270V, 5′-GCCTTCGTCACTGGTCCGGTCACCAAACGTTTCGGCGAG-3′. Restriction endonuclease sites (SspI and BstEII in primers L11F and A270V respectively), which were introduced to facilitate identification of the desired mutants, are underlined. Once the mutation was confirmed by sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis, the 3.2-kb XhoI-XbaI-mutated Tet(C) determinant was exchanged by cloning into the XhoI-BglII restriction sites of the parental unmutagenized pCR2 plasmid. To facilitate the cloning of the determinants, compatible cohesive ends were produced by blunt-ended XbaI and BglII restriction sites with T4 DNA polymerase. Nucleotide Sequencing—DNA sequencing was performed at the Tufts University Core Facility using a ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer. Determination of Tetracycline Susceptibility—AG100A cells harboring plasmids bearing wild type and tet(C)-mutated genes were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol and AHTc to an A 530 of 0.8. Cells were swabbed for confluent growth onto a LB agar plate containing AHTc (15 ng/ml) before the application of the tetracycline E-test strips (gift from AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The minimum inhibitory concentration was that amount of tetracycline showing an inhibition growth zone with the E-test after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Membrane Isolation and Western Blot Analysis—AG100A cells expressing various plasmid-specified Tet proteins were grown in the presence of AHTc (15 ng/ml) and rapidly chilled when they reached the late logarithmic growth phase (A 530 = 0.8). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH8), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 30 μg/ml lysozyme (A 530 of 100) prior to sonication (Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonics Corporations, Danbury, CT). Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 60 000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Tet proteins were solubilized by incubating the membranes in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH8), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1.5% dodecylmaltoside at 4 °C for 1 h (A 530 = 250). Membranes were removed by sedimentation for 30 min at 15,000 × g in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and extracts were stored at –80 °C. Before electrophoresis, extracted proteins were incubated in reducing sample buffer (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) for 20 min at room temperature. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) using a Miniprotein II gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunological detection was carried out with polyclonal antibodies directed against the 14 carboxyl-terminal (Ct) amino acids of Tet(B) (anti-Ct antibody, kindly provided by A. Yamaguchi) (31Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase coupled to the anti-rabbit IgG (New England Biolabs). Blots were developed with the Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The band intensities of each Tet(C) derivative were determined using NIH Image 1.6.2 free software (www.scioncorp.com). Tetracycline Accumulation Assays—The measurement of [3H]Tc uptake by intact AG100A cells containing mutant plasmids was adapted from previous works (1Saraceni-Richards C.A. Levy S.B. J. Biol.

A. 1980; 77: 3974-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Bacteria grown to exponential phase in LB broth containing AHTc were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 5 min), washed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH8) buffer, and suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.2% glucose (A 530 = 4). After 3 min of preincubation, [3H]Tc was added to 270 μl of cell suspension with shaking at 30 °C in a water bath, yielding a final tetracycline concentration of 1 μm. At various intervals, 50 μl of the suspension were removed, mixed with 10 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH6.6) and 0.1 m LiCl at 20 °C, and filtered through a Metricel® membrane filter (pore size, 0.45 μm). The filters were washed with 4 ml of the same buffer and dried before the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The protonophore CCCP was added to a final concentration of 100 μm at 18 min to deenergize the cells. Each strain was assayed in triplicate in three separate experiments. The value at each time point deviated ≤8%. Characterization of Tc-resistant Mutants—Following chemical treatments with hydroxylamine or nitrosoguanidine, a total of nine individual Tc-resistant mutants were isolated. The sequencing of the promoter and coding region of tet(C) confirmed a single base change in each clone leading to three different types of amino acid substitution (Fig. 1). Among all the clones identified, no reversion to the wild type codon was seen. In six different clones obtained with both methods (five hydroxylamine and one MNNG), a CTC → TTC mutation was observed at position 11, which led to the substitution of the leucine by a phenylalanine residue. The leucine 11 is conserved among all classes and is predicted to be within the TM1 (32Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Konishi S. Tamura N. Kubo Y. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18692-18697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In two additional MNNG mutants, a GCC → ACC transition resulted in a change from alanine 213 to a threonine residue. Based on the current topological model of Tet(C) developed by Varela et al. (33Varela M.F. Sansom C.E. Griffith J.K. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and alignment with the Tet(B) model (17Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the location of alanine 213 is predicted to be within the central interdomain loop connecting the α and β domains. This alanine residue is also conserved in the class D Tet protein that shares 78% homology with the class C protein. Finally, one last mutant, resulting from mutagenesis with MNNG, contained a GCC to GTC change that resulted in the substitution of valine for the alanine at position 270. The alanine was predicted to be in the cytoplasmic loop linking TM8 and TM9 (13Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Yamaguchi A. Kimura T. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6496-6504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AG100A cells devoid of the AcrAB pump were highly susceptible to tetracycline (minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.3 μg/ml) (Table II). When complemented with a low copy number plasmid bearing the wild type tet(C), the minimum inhibitory concentration in AG100A rose to 16 μg/ml. The presence of the single mutation S202F in Tet(C) decreased the tetracycline resistance by 4-fold to 4 μg/ml. Wild type Tc resistance was restored by each of the secondary mutations, A213T/S202F and A270V/S202F, and an even higher level of resistance was provided with the L11F/S202F mutation (24 μg/ml). Subsequently, each mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into Tet(C) specified by the plasmid pFS1. These mutations alone had no effect on the level of Tc resistance and could, therefore, be considered as not essential for Tet(C) activity (Table II). Thus, the secondary suppressor mutations are necessary to suppress the effect of the first mutation but are not by themselves critical for Tet protein function.Table IITetracycline susceptibility of AG100A cells bearing plasmids expressing the wild type or mutant Tet(C) proteinsPlasmid-specified Tet(C)Minimum inhibitory concentrations of Tcμg/mlNone0.3Wild type16S202F4L11F/S202F24A213T/S202F16A270V/S202F16L11F16A213T16A270V16 Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis of Tet Protein Expression—Western blot analysis of the Tet protein was performed using the anti-Ct antibody. The inactivating mutation S202F slightly reduced (10%) the level of protein production (Fig. 2) but confirmed the belief that the low level of resistance was not attributable to a poor expression of the protein. The double mutant protein A270V/S202F was expressed in quantities comparable with the parental S202F mutant (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the protein with the secondary L11F or A213T mutations showed increased amounts in the cells in which they were expressed (Fig. 2A). The introduction of each single suppressor mutation into the wild type determinant did not change protein expression or mobility in a detectable manner (Fig. 2B). Analysis of Tetracycline Efflux Activity—Tc resistance is characterized by a reduction in the cellular accumulation of Tc brought about by a proton motive force-dependent efflux (4McMurry L. Petrucci Jr., R.E. Levy S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3974-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 35Levy S.B. McMurry L. Nature. 1978; 276: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We measured the energy-dependent Tc efflux as the relative uptake of [3H]Tc before and after deenergization of the cells with the protonophore CCCP. AG100A, devoid of the AcrAB pump and any Tet protein, accumulated 38 pmol of [3H]Tc in 18 min (Fig. 3A). The addition of 100 μm CCCP resulted in a loss of Tc from the cell, which was attributed to the dissipation of the proton gradient across the membrane upon which Tc uptake is dependent (7McMurry L.M. Cullinane J.C. Petrucci Jr., R.E. Levy S.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1981; 20: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, when AG100A expressed the wild type Tet(C), it showed a lower uptake of [3H]Tc (13.9 pmol) (Fig. 3A), which increased when cells were treated with CCCP. The strain carrying the S202F mutation accumulated nearly 21.9 pmol of [3H]Tc in 18 min but was unaffected by CCCP addition (Fig. 3A). This lack of effect of CCCP was observed previously for some low level Tet protein mutants (36Curiale M.S. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 211-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three suppressor mutations restored an active Tc efflux comparable with the wild type (Fig. 3B). Modification of the wild-type Tet(C) protein with each single suppressor mutation revealed no distinguishable change in the efflux activity as compared with the wild type Tet protein (Fig. 3C). The cytoplasmic interdomain loop of Tet proteins has been considered to be only a means of connecting two active domain halves, because the loop is so divergent in its sequence among various tetracycline resistance determinants whose two α and β domains are much more similar (37Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. Heinrikson R.L. Kezdy F.J. Gene. 1990; 87: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, some resistance can be obtained by cloning the two domains of the Tet protein separately in the cell without the interdomain loop (18Rubin R.A. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4503-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, previous studies pointed out that a double frameshift mutation in the interdomain loop of TetA modified the substrate specificity of the protein (23Tuckman M. Petersen P.J. Projan S.J. Microb. Drug Resist. 2000; 6: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that local mutations within the loop greatly reduced the Tc resistance phenotype (1Saraceni-Richards C.A. Levy S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6101-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20330-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have isolated and characterized three different types of amino acid substitution suppressor mutations arising in nine independently isolated mutants that restore the tetracycline efflux function in Tet(C) with the S202F mutation in the interdomain loop. One secondary suppressor mutation, L11F, would increase the bulkiness of the side chain at this position. Leucine 11, predicted to be relatively close to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane within TM1, is conserved among all of the classes of Gram-negative Tet proteins that have been identified to date. Its change suggests an interaction of TM1 with the interdomain loop. According to Tamura et al. (22Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20330-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), TM1 is a partly amphiphilic helix with several residues facing the water channel built by portions of TM2, TM4, TM5, TM7, TM8, TM10, and TM11. It is therefore possible that this secondary suppressor mutation modifies the structure of TM1 and restores a wild type tetracycline resistance phenotype by correcting the active site altered by the S202F mutation. A second suppressor mutation, A213T in the cytoplasmic loop (Fig. 1), slightly increases the size of the side chain while introducing a hydrophilic residue. Prediction deduced from hydropathy plots has shown an additional cytoplasmic α helix-(Iα) located within the interdomain loop (Fig. 1), between serine 202 and arginine 207. A similar feature of 13 amino acids has been pointed out in the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of the efflux transporter AcrB, and it has been postulated that the Iα helix is attached to the cytoplasmic membrane surface (38Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). This feature may also be true for Tet(C). The predicted position of A213T near the cytoplasmic surface of the protein could improve binding of the mutated putative Iα structure to the membrane. Of note, the mutation led to a 3–4-fold higher amount of the protein without showing a greater efflux activity, suggesting that the protein itself is still not completely wild type in function. Although the reason for the increased protein is not yet clear, the single A213T change in Tet(C) did not alter protein amount or function (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, it appears that the combined interdomain mutations (S202F + A213T) add stability to the protein embedded in the membrane. Analogously, the length and nature of the residues of the interdomain loop of LacY, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, affected the insertion and stability of the protein in the membrane (39Weinglass A.B. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8938-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hydrophilic residues within the interdomain loop of LacY are required to permit a temporal delay for the insertion of both domains. A third suppressor mutation, A270V, predicted to be within the cytoplasmic loop between TM8 and TM9, restored an efficient tetracycline resistance phenotype and efflux activity without modifying the level of Tet production. The position on the same side of the protein suggests that the loop 8-9 interacts somehow with the interdomain loop and that the A270V mutation improves the interaction in the presence of the S202F mutation. The loss of tetracycline efflux activity of the mutant S202F Tet(C) could be interpreted as a modification of the conformation of the Iα helix that could perturb the correct positioning of the active site involving the interaction between α and β domains. In Tet(B), substitution of the homologous serine 202 by a cysteine residue also led to an increase in tetracycline susceptibility (17Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis analysis revealed no labeling of S201C with [14C]N-ethylmaleimide. This finding suggests that the serine, while in the water-exposed loop, is oriented into the protein interior as a membrane-interactive residue (17Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The introduction of the single mutations L11F, A213T, and A270V into Tet(C) did not produce any detectable change in the wild type Tet(C) activity or expression. This finding suggests that serine 202 plays a capital but not essential role in the functional activity of Tet(C). In this case, any conformational modification brought by each mutation is not sufficient to destroy the interaction of serine 202 with other specific portion(s) of the protein. Although the precise role of the cytoplasmic interdomain loop in tetracycline resistance is not clear, it should be reevaluated as being more than a simple linker between the α and β domains because it affects Tet protein-specified tetracycline resistance."
