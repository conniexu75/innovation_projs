We identified MRP2 in a screen designed to isolate genes that are regulated by the farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR, NR1H4). MRP2 mRNA levels were induced following treatment of human or rat hepatocytes with either naturally occurring (chenodeoxycholic acid) or synthetic (GW4064) FXR ligands. In addition, we have shown that MRP2 expression is regulated by the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3). Thus, treatment of rodent hepatocytes with PXR or CAR agonists results in a robust induction of MRP2 mRNA levels. The dexamethasone- and pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile-dependent induction of MRP2expression was not evident in hepatocytes derived from PXR null mice. In contrast, induction of MRP2 by phenobarbital, an activator of CAR, was comparable in wild-type and PXR null mice. An unusual 26-bp sequence was identified 440 bp upstream of theMRP2 transcription initiation site that contains an everted repeat of the AGTTCA hexad separated by 8 nucleotides (ER-8). PXR, CAR, and FXR bound with high affinity to this element as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor α (RXRα, NR2B1). Luciferase reporter gene constructs containing 1 kb of the rat MRP2 promoter were prepared and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. Luciferase activity was induced in a PXR-, CAR-, or FXR-dependent manner. Furthermore, the isolated ER-8 element was capable of conferring PXR, CAR, and FXR responsiveness on a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Mutation of the ER-8 element abolished the nuclear receptor response. These studies demonstrate that MRP2 is regulated by three distinct nuclear receptor signaling pathways that converge on a common response element in the 5′-flanking region of this gene.

Recently, two orphan nuclear receptors, the farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR,1 NRIH4) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) were shown to be activated by an overlapping spectrum of bile acids (1Staudinger J.L.

These results indicate that bile acids function as hormonal ligands, in addition to their well established roles in the solubilization and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestinal lumen. The primary bile acids chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid are synthesized in the liver from either cholesterol or oxysterols via the neutral or acidic pathways before being transported across the basement membrane of the hepatocyte into the bile canaliculi and stored in the gall bladder (reviewed in Refs. 6Russell D.W.

Lipidol. 1998; 9: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Following their excretion into the intestinal lumen, bile acids can be further metabolized by bacteria into secondary (deoxycholic acid (DCA) or lithocholic acid (LCA)) or tertiary bile acids prior to their resorption in the distal ileum. Defects in this cycle are associated with various diseases. For example, impaired bile flow (cholestasis) can result in the hepatic accumulation of supraphysiological levels of both toxic bile acids (e.g. LCA, 3-keto-LCA) and toxins that would normally be excreted in the bile (8Radominska A. Treat S. Little J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 219-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). FXR is activated by bile acids with the rank order of potency CDCA > DCA = LCA > cholic acid (3Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M.

In vitro studies have shown that FXR binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXRα; NR2B1) to repeats of the AGGTCA hexad. These elements can be either inverted repeats with a single nucleotide spacer (IR-1) and direct repeats separated by 3 or 4 bases (DR-3 or DR-4, respectively) (9Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E.

Thus, FXR appears to play important roles in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis, bile acid transport, and lipoprotein metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that PXR is also activated by bile acids, although the rank order of potency (3-keto-LCA > LCA > DCA = CA) differs from that of FXR (1Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B.

The convergence of the PXR and CAR signaling pathways on common response elements suggests that interplay between these receptors is likely to be a significant factor in the regulation of these xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transporter proteins. Formerly known as the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter, MRP2 is a 190-kDa phosphoglycoprotein localized in the canalicular (apical) membrane of hepatocytes and is involved in the transport of organic anions, including sulfated and glucuronidated bile salts, as well as glutathione, a major driving force in the bile salt-independent bile flow. Notably, MRP2 is active in the transport of xenobiotics (including the anti-cancer drugs cisplatin, anthacyclines, vinca alkaloids, and methotrexate) and various glutathione, glucuronate, and sulfate conjugates (40Paulusma C.C.

In addition, earlier studies had shown that MRP2 mRNA and protein levels were induced when rats were treated with dexamethasone, by a glucocorticoid receptor-independent manner (50Courtois A.

Furthermore, the up-regulation of MRP2 gene expression upon treatment of rats with the anti-glucocorticoid/anti-progestin RU486 and the anti-fungal clotrimazole, known PXR ligands, has been observed (50Courtois A.

In the current study, we demonstrate that treatment of human, rat, or murine hepatocytes with ligands for FXR, PXR, or CAR results in increased expression of MRP2 mRNA. In addition, we identify and characterize a novel binding site in the proximal promoter of the ratMRP2 gene that is bound by PXR/RXR, CAR/RXR, or FXR/RXR heterodimers. This site functions as a highly responsive FXR, PXR, and CAR response element. Finally, we demonstrate that ligands for FXR, PXR, or CAR can activate expression of reporter genes controlled either by the rat MRP2 proximal promoter or by two copies of the novel hormone response element identified in theMRP2 promoter. These studies suggest that ligands for FXR, PXR, and CAR activate transcription of the MRP2gene in order to promote excretion of conjugated toxic agents from the hepatocyte into the bile.

However, mechanisms that promote intraneuronal α-synuclein assembly remain poorly understood. Because pesticides, particularly the herbicide paraquat, have been suggested to play a role as PD risk factors, the hypothesis that interactions between α-synuclein and these environmental agents may contribute to aggregate formation was tested in this study. Paraquat markedly accelerated the in vitro rate of α-synuclein fibril formation in a dose-dependent fashion. When mice were exposed to the herbicide, brain levels of α-synuclein were significantly increased. This up-regulation followed a consistent pattern, with higher α-synuclein at 2 days after each of three weekly paraquat injections and with protein levels returning to control values by day 7 post-treatment. Paraquat exposure was also accompanied by aggregate formation. Thioflavine S-positive structures accumulated within neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, and dual labeling and confocal imaging confirmed that these aggregates contained α-synuclein. The results suggest that up-regulation of α-synuclein as a consequence of toxicant insult and direct interactions between the protein and environmental agents are potential mechanisms leading to α-synuclein pathology in neurodegenerative disorders. α-Synuclein-containing aggregates represent a feature of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD).

Parkinson's disease anti-α-synuclein paraformaldehyde Mouse On Mouse Monoclonal tyrosine hydroxylase analysis of variance 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and the formation of intraneuronal inclusions (called Lewy bodies) in different brain regions. Although the etiology of PD remains unknown, several lines of evidence suggest a pathogenetic role of the protein α-synuclein. In particular, α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in all PD patients (1Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

It has been hypothesized that a tendency of α-synuclein to aggregate may underlie its involvement in Lewy body formation and neurodegeneration. In individuals with α-synuclein mutations, abnormal forms of the protein could trigger pathological processes as a result of their enhanced propensity to self-assemble (5Conway K.A. Harper J.D.

However, in the vast majority of patients with idiopathic (nonfamilial) PD, the lack of α-synuclein mutations (8Chan P. Jiang X. Di Forno L.S. Monte D.A. Tanner C.M. Langston J.W. Neurology. 1998; 50: 1136-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Chan P. Tanner C.M. Jiang X. Langston J.W. Neurology. 1998; 50: 513-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) indicates that additional mechanisms may lead to conformational changes and consequent protein aggregation. One such mechanism could be the interaction of α-synuclein with other chemical species. The association and fibrillation of α-synuclein appear to involve a shift in equilibrium from the natively unfolded to a partially folded protein conformation (10Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Uversky and colleagues (11Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) have shown that incubating α-synuclein in the presence of paraquat or other pesticides dramatically accelerates the rate of α-synuclein fibrillation in vitro, probably due to the preferential binding of these compounds to a partially folded α-synuclein intermediate. This is an intriguing finding, since both epidemiological and clinical observations support a role of pesticides as PD risk factors. Farming, rural living, well water drinking, and exposure to agricultural chemicals are all conditions that have been associated with an increased risk for PD, and paraquat is the pesticide that has most often been implicated as a potential neurotoxicant in PD (12Gorell J.M.

Thus, interactions of α-synuclein with these environmental agents could provide a critical link between toxicant exposures and the pathogenesis of α-synuclein-containing inclusions in idiopathic PD. The purpose of the current study was to assess α-synuclein expression and assembly in the brain of paraquat-exposed mice to test the hypothesis that, in line with the in vitro findings, interactions between α-synuclein and paraquat occur in vivo and result in enhanced protein aggregation. Purified recombinant α-synuclein (10Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) solutions (140 μm, in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) were incubated at 37 °C in a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent) with shaking at 120 rpm with a 7-mm orbit. Thioflavine T fluorescence was used to monitor fibril formation (16Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). A volume of 135 μl of the mixture containing 10 μm thioflavine T was pipetted into a well of a 96-well plate (white plastic, clear bottom), and a one-eighth-inch diameter Teflon sphere (McMaster-Carr) was added. Each sample was replicated five times, and data from replicate wells were averaged before plotting fluorescence versus time. The fluorescence was measured at 30-min intervals (excitation at 450 nm and emission at 485 nm), with a sampling time of 40 ms. To examine the concentration-dependent effects of paraquat on the kinetics of fibril formation, the herbicide (Sigma) was co-incubated with α-synuclein. The kinetics of α-synuclein fibrillation are sigmoidal, defined by an initial lag phase, a subsequent growth phase in which the thioflavine T fluorescence increases, and a final equilibrium phase, when thioflavine T fluorescence reaches a plateau indicating the end of fibril formation. Thioflavine T fluorescence measurements were plotted as a function of time and fitted to a sigmoidal curve using the empirical approach described previously (17Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old; Simonsen Laboratories) received intraperitoneal injections of either saline or 10 mg/kg paraquat dichloride hydrate (dissolved in saline) once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation at days 2 and 7 following each injection. Experimental protocols were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for use of live animals and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at The Parkinson's Institute. Brain samples from ventral mesencephalon and frontal cortex were dissected on ice. The former brain region was chosen since it encompasses the substantia nigra, which is the primary site of PD pathology. Cerebral cortex (including frontal cortex) is one of the areas where inclusions are commonly observed in patients (18Forno L.S. Hefti F. Weiner W.J. Progress in Parkinson Research. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 11-21Crossref Google Scholar). Tissues were sonicated in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, and after centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was decanted. Protein extracts (5 μg) were processed for SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 12% Tris-glycine gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in 25 mm Tris-saline solution for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 2 h with either 1:3,000 anti-α-synuclein (Syn-1; Transduction Laboratories), 1:1,000 anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), 1:1,600 anti-synaptophysin (Dako) or mouse IgG (to ensure specificity; Dako). Secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:6,000; Pierce) was applied for 1.5 h, and following rinsing, blots were incubated with a chemiluminescent substrate and exposed to HyperfilmTM ECLTM (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Optical densities were determined using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics) and expressed as arbitrary units. Forebrain and midbrain blocks were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and cryoprotected in sucrose. Serial coronal sections (40 μm) were cut on a cryostat, collected in cryopreservative, and stored. For α-synuclein immunostaining, midbrain sections were incubated initially in the Mouse On Mouse Monoclonal (M.O.M.) blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C and then in Syn-1 antibody diluted 1:250 with M.O.M. protein solution. In some experiments, sections from control and paraquat-treated mice were stained with a second antibody against α-synuclein (1:150; Chemicon) that verified a comparable pattern of expression and distribution of the protein. After rinsing, sections were immersed in biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary for 1 h, treated with 0.3% H2O2 solution to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, and then incubated in avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (30 min). Visualization was performed using 0.03% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 3 min. Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, counterstained in 0.5% Cresyl violet, dehydrated, and coverslipped. All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. For thioflavine S histochemistry, 40-μm PFA-fixed tissue sections from frontal cortex and midbrain were stained in hematoxylin (2 min) and, following distilled water washes, in 0.25% thioflavine S (10 min). Sections were then immersed in 80% ethanol, rinsed, and mounted using a 50% glycerol medium. Dual label thioflavine S staining with either α-synuclein or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry required midbrain blocks to be quick-frozen in isopentane on dry ice. Cryostat-cut sections (20 μm) were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, blocked with 4% normal donkey serum for 1 h, and then incubated with the Syn-1 (1:100) or TH (1:100; Chemicon) antibody. Slides were covered with donkey anti-mouse secondary IgG conjugated to fluorescein (1:100; Chemicon) for 1.5 h, washed briefly, and incubated in 0.1% thioflavine S for 10 min. Slides were exposed to 80% ethanol solution for 5 min, rinsed, and coverslipped using 50% glycerol solution. Positive staining was observed using a Leica NT confocal microscope equipped for epifluorescence. In all immunohistochemical experiments, control sections were incubated with mouse IgG in lieu of the primary antibody. Differences among means were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Newman-Keuls post-hoc analysis was employed when differences were observed in ANOVA testing (p < 0.05). Concentrations of paraquat in the micromolar range significantly accelerated the rate of fibril formation of α-synuclein in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in Fig.1A, increasing concentrations of paraquat led to decreased lag times and increased growth rates of fibril formation. The time to half-maximum fibrils (t½) decreased in a log-linear fashion as the paraquat concentration increased (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the apparent first-order rate constant for fibril growth showed a linear increase with increasing paraquat concentration (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, if the paraquat concentration was fixed at 100 μm and the α-synuclein concentration varied, the accelerating effect of paraquat increased with increasing α-synuclein levels (data not shown). Interactions between α-synuclein and paraquat in vitro prompted us to test whether exposure to the herbicide affected α-synuclein levels and aggregation in the mouse model. Animals were treated with a weekly injection of 10 mg/kg paraquat for 3 consecutive weeks, and α-synuclein protein levels were assayed by Western immunoblot analysis in the ventral mesencephalon and frontal cortex. Denser α-synuclein-positive bands (at 19 kDa) were consistently observed in paraquat-exposed versussaline-injected mice at 2 days post-treatment. This up-regulation occurred in both brain regions and contrasted with the lack of increase in the levels of β-tubulin (Fig. 2,A–C) and synaptophysin (data not shown) proteins. Interestingly, α-synuclein returned to basal values by 7 days after each herbicide treatment (see Fig. 2C for data at 7 days after the first injection). The effect of paraquat on α-synuclein tissue levels was also assessed by immunohistochemistry. Coronal sections from control and exposed mice were stained with the Syn-1 antibody 2 days following the third injection of either saline or paraquat. Microscopic examination showed enhanced immunoreactivity in the midbrain of paraquat-treated animals (Fig. 2, D andE), and at higher magnification of the substantia nigra pars compacta, a robust α-synuclein staining was seen in both the cytosol and nuclei of neurons exposed to the herbicide (Fig. 2, F and G). As suggested by the in vitro findings, α-synuclein-paraquat interactions may ultimately promote protein conformational changes and subsequent aggregation. To test this hypothesis in vivo, brain sections from control and paraquat-treated mice were stained with thioflavine S, a dye known to bind to amyloid fibrils (19Schmidt M.L. Robinson K.A. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 503-515PubMed Google Scholar). Thioflavine S staining was minimal in animals injected with saline, but pronounced at 2 days after the last paraquat administration in both midbrain and frontal cortex. Confocal microscopy showed neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in which thioflavine S-positive deposits were present in the cytosolic and nuclear regions (Fig.3E). That these aggregates contained α-synuclein was ascertained by dual labeling with thioflavine S and anti-α-synuclein, showing a virtually complete overlap of the thioflavine S-positive structures with α-synuclein immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, D–F). To verify the specificity of this α-synuclein co-localization, midbrain sections were also double-stained with a TH antibody and thioflavine S. The diffuse immunoreactivity observed within TH-positive neurons (Fig.3G) contrasted with the distinct pattern of thioflavine S staining (Fig. 3H). Merged confocal images revealed that, within nigral dopaminergic neurons, aggregates were labeled with thioflavine S but lacked TH immunoreactivity (Fig. 3I). While the role of α-synuclein in PD and related disorders (recently referred to as “synucleinopathies”) is widely recognized, mechanisms involved in α-synuclein pathology remain elusive. In this study, interactions between α-synuclein and paraquat, an environmental agent implicated as a PD risk factor (12Gorell J.M. Johnson C.C. Rybicki B.A. Peterson E.L. Richardson R.J. Neurology. 1998; 50: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 13Liou H.H. Tsai M.C. Chen C.J. Jeng J.S. Chang Y.C. Chen S.Y. Chen R.C.

Bowering D. Snow B. Calne D. Am. J. Ind. Med. 1990; 17: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), were assessed both in vitro and in vivo as potential mechanisms leading to increased protein aggregation. In vitro findings extended previous observations (11Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that paraquat can directly stimulate α-synuclein fibrillation. This effect was dependent upon both α-synuclein and paraquat concentrations. Quite remarkably, when mice were treated with the herbicide, α-synuclein levels were significantly enhanced in both substantia nigra and frontal cortex, and this up-regulation was accompanied by the formation of intraneuronal aggregates with histological properties of amyloid fibrils (i.e. thioflavine S staining) (19Schmidt M.L. Robinson K.A. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 503-515PubMed Google Scholar, 20Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Co-localization of α-synuclein within these aggregates provided further evidence that, as predicted by the in vitro data, paraquat exposure triggers α-synuclein fibrillation in the mouse brain. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that interactions between α-synuclein and environmental agents may contribute to neurodegenerative processes and, in particular, to the development of intraneuronal aggregates. The analogies between the in vitro and in vivofindings also provide a rationale for using both approaches for the screening of putative neurotoxicants, which, by affecting α-synuclein conformation and aggregation, may play a role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. The pattern of paraquat-induced α-synuclein up-regulation, as described here, suggests that increased expression of this protein is part of a neuronal response to toxic insults. Levels of α-synuclein were consistently enhanced at 2 days after each of three weekly paraquat administrations and returned to basal control values within 7 days post-treatment. Interestingly, a similar time course of α-synuclein up-regulation has recently been reported by Vila and colleagues following administration of mice with the parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (21Vila M. Vukosavic S. Jackson-Lewis V. Neystat M. Jakowec M. Przedborski S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The significance and consequences of this α-synuclein response remain unknown. If one assumes a harmful role of α-synuclein, then its up-regulation would be expected to contribute to neuronal injury (22Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 23Forloni G. Bertani I. Calella A.M. Thaler F. Invernizzi R. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). On the other hand, work with cell cultures supports the hypothesis that overexpression of α-synuclein may actually delay cell death caused by toxic agents and protect against apoptotic stimuli (25Lee M. Hyun D. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,26da Costa C.A. Ancolio K. Checler K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). If so, increased levels of the protein triggered by paraquat, MPTP, or other neurotoxicants may limit their damaging action. A third possibility may be consistent with both a protective and deleterious role of α-synuclein. The initial response may indeed represent an attempt by neurons to counteract and to limit injury. However, should the insult be particularly severe or persistent, or should the toxic agent be capable of interacting with α-synuclein (see below), protein up-regulation may ultimately result in pathological effects. It could be argued that increased α-synuclein concentration alone may be sufficient to cause the protein aggregation observed in the brains of paraquat-exposed mice. However, results from other in vivo models indicate that higher levels of the protein are not necessarily associated with the development of thioflavine S-positive structures or α-synuclein-immunoreactive intraneuronal aggregates (21Vila M. Vukosavic S. Jackson-Lewis V. Neystat M. Jakowec M. Przedborski S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 27Matsuoka Y. Vila M. Lincoln S. McCormack A. Picciano M. LaFrancois J. Yu X. Dickson D. Langston J.W. McGowan E. Farrer M. Hardy J. Duff K. Przedborski S. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that, consistent with thein vitro work, α-synuclein assembly in our paraquat mouse model is a consequence of both protein up-regulation and α-synuclein-paraquat interactions. It is also possible that oxidative processes triggered by paraquat administration may contribute to the development of α-synuclein pathology. Paraquat toxicity is known to involve the generation of free radicals via redox cycling reactions that transfer electrons to molecular oxygen (28Bus J.S. Gibson J.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Burkitt M.J. Kadiiska M.B. Hanna P.M. Jordan S.J. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar). This oxidative stress could facilitate α-synuclein association by altering the biophysical properties of the protein and/or impairing mechanisms of protein degradation within the neurons (30Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J.M. Farer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Butterfield D.A. Kanski J. Mech.

Several lines of evidence indicate that paraquat exposure results in neurotoxicity. Paraquat is accumulated into the brain through the blood-brain barrier, possibly via a carrier-mediated mechanism (33Corasaniti M.T. Strongoli M.C. Rotiroti D. Bagetta G. Nistico G. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 83: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Widdowson P.S. Farnworth M.J. Simpson M.G. Lock E.A. Hum. Exp.

Since protein deposition has been hypothesized to play a role not only in the pathogenesis of inclusions, but also in neuronal injury and degeneration (6Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 32Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Haass C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that changes in α-synuclein assembly may ultimately contribute to paraquat neurotoxicity. Therefore, the animal model described in this study has the potential to provide critical insight into the relationship between α-synuclein aggregation and neurodegeneration and into mechanisms that may link these two critical features of neurodegenerative diseases.

The distribution of IRAP and its mRNA in the brain, determined by immunohistochemistry and hybridization histochemistry, parallels that of the AT4 receptor determined by radioligand binding. We also show that AT4 receptor ligands dose-dependently inhibit the catalytic activity of IRAP.

In two rat models of amnesia, induced by the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, or bilateral perforant pathway lesion, the Ang IV analogues reversed the memory deficits detected utilizing the Morris water maze paradigm (3Wright J.W.

Angiotensin IV and its analogues enhance long term potentiation in both the dentate gyrus in vivo (6Wayner M.J. Armstrong D. Phelix C.F. Wright J.W. Harding J.W.

We have also shown that Ang IV enhances K+-evoked acetylcholine release from rat hippocampal slices (8Lee J. Chai S. Mendelsohn F.A. Morris M.J. Allen A.M. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The actions of Ang IV and its analogues are mediated by the angiotensin AT4 receptor, defined by an international nomenclature committee (9de Gasparo M.

The AT4 receptor has since been shown to bind with nanomolar affinity the decapeptide, LVVYPWTQRF (LVV-H7), isolated from sheep cerebral cortex (19Moeller I. Lew R.A. Mendelsohn F.A. Smith A.I.

In the central nervous system, its distribution is highly conserved in guinea pig (12Miller-Wing A.V. Hanesworth J.M. Sardinia M.F. Hall K.L. Wright J.W. Speth R.C. Grove K.L. Harding J.W. J.

AT4receptors occur in high levels in the basal nucleus of Meynert, in the CA1 to CA3 regions of Ammon's horn in the hippocampus, and throughout the neocortex, areas important for cognitive processing. Despite the dramatic central effects of Ang IV and the abundance of the receptor in the central nervous system, the identity of the AT4 receptor and the mechanism by which its ligands mediate their actions were unknown.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here identify the AT4 receptor as the transmembrane aminopeptidase, IRAP, and confirm that IRAP has the same pharmacological and biochemical characteristics as the AT4 receptor. Cells transfected with the full-length cDNA for human IRAP expressed a high affinity binding site for Ang IV with a pharmacological profile identical to that obtained for the endogenous human AT4 receptor (15Mustafa T. Chai S.Y. Mendelsohn F.A. Moeller I. Albiston A.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The localization of both IRAP mRNA and protein in the brain parallels the distribution of the AT4 receptor determined by in vitroreceptor autoradiography. We also demonstrate that the well described peptide ligands of the AT4 receptor inhibited the catalytic activity of IRAP in vitro.IRAP was originally identified from GLUT4 vesicles (17Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). GLUT4 is the insulin-regulated glucose transporter that is abundantly expressed in muscle and adipose cells. The translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is the primary mechanism of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in these cells (22Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. This process involves the formation of vesicles, containing both GLUT4 and IRAP, that translocate to the cell surface and fuse with the plasma membrane by a mechanism that in part parallels synaptic vesicle trafficking in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain. (23Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).IRAP and GLUT4 have very similar distribution patterns in the central nervous system. In the rat brain, GLUT4-positive immunoreactivity is associated predominantly with motor areas and with neocortex and hippocampus (20El Messari S. Leloup C. Quignon M. Brisorgueil M.J. Penicaud L. Arluison M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 399: 492-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Apelt J. Mehlhorn G. Schliebs R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These are the regions that are enriched with AT4 receptors as detected by [125I]Nle1-Ang IV binding and with IRAP-positive immunoreactivity and IRAP mRNA observed in this study. In the neurones in these brain regions, GLUT4 was localized to rough endoplasmic reticulum, some mitochondria, vesicles, and microtubules and to dendritic spines as detected by electron microscopy (20El Messari S. Leloup C. Quignon M. Brisorgueil M.J. Penicaud L. Arluison M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 399: 492-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).IRAP is a type II membrane-spanning protein and a member of the M1 family of zinc-dependent metallopeptidases. This enzyme is also known as placental leucine aminopeptidase or oxytocinase, because it was also cloned from a human placental cDNA library as the peptidase involved in the degradation of oxytocin (24Rogi T. Tsujimoto M. Nakazato H. Mizutani S. Tomoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 56-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The enzyme specifically cleaves the N-terminal cysteine from oxytocin and vasopressin. Although N-terminal cysteine residues appear to be the preferential targets for the enzyme, a number of peptides that do not contain cysteine residues are also hydrolyzed by IRAP in vitro. These include Lys-bradykinin, angiotensin III, Met-encephalon, dynorphin A, neurokinin A, and neuromedin B (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar) (25Matsumoto H. Rogi T. Yamashiro K. Kodama S. Tsuruoka N. Hattori A. Takio K. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, other peptides that possess N-terminal cysteine residues and intramolecular disulfide bonds, such as calcitonin and endothelin, are not cleaved by the enzyme. The substrates of IRAP in vivoare unknown, and the physiological relevance of the translocation of the enzyme to the cell surface in response to insulin in adipocytes and skeletal muscle remains to be elucidated. The AT4 receptor ligands will be useful tools with which to investigate this system.We have demonstrated that two structurally unrelated AT4receptor ligands, Ang IV and LVV-H7, are potent inhibitors of the aminopeptidase activity of IRAP. A previous study by Herbst et al. (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Ang IV was a potential inhibitor of IRAP activity in adipocytes with an IC50 value of 20 nm. We postulate that AT4 receptor ligands mediate their physiological effects by inhibiting IRAP activity. Thus, we propose that inhibition of IRAP in the central nervous system extends the half-life of endogenous neuropeptides that potentiate memory. For example, vasopressin, substance P, and somatostatin, known substrates for IRAP (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar), play important roles in cognitive function (26Alescio-Lautier B. Paban V. Soumireu-Mourat B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Matsuoka N. Yamazaki M. Yamaguchi I. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that their functions may be enhanced by inhibition of IRAP.Alternatively, inhibition of IRAP may modulate the levels of peptides involved in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. The demonstration of IRAP in the same regions of the brain as GLUT4 and the occurrence of GLUT4 and IRAP in the same cells in a range of other tissues suggests that IRAP may play a critical role in the regulation of GLUT4 actions and therefore glucose uptake.Our present findings suggest that the mechanism by which AT4 receptor ligands facilitate memory and learning is by inhibiting the aminopeptidase activity of IRAP. We postulate that inhibition of IRAP extends the half-life of neuropeptides that potentiate memory. The inhibition of IRAP may also modulate the levels of peptides involved in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. These findings open a new field of inquiry to unite the positive cognitive effects of AT4 receptor ligands with the properties of IRAP and its potential role in glucose uptake. Central infusions of the hexapeptide VYIHPF (angiotensin IV, Ang IV)1 or its more stable analogues, Nle1-Ang IV and Norleucinal Ang IV, facilitate memory retention and retrieval in rats in the passive avoidance and Morris water maze paradigms (1Braszko J.J.

The localization of both IRAP mRNA and protein in the brain parallels the distribution of the AT4 receptor determined by in vitroreceptor autoradiography. We also demonstrate that the well described peptide ligands of the AT4 receptor inhibited the catalytic activity of IRAP in vitro.IRAP was originally identified from GLUT4 vesicles (17Keller S.R.

In the rat brain, GLUT4-positive immunoreactivity is associated predominantly with motor areas and with neocortex and hippocampus (20El Messari S. Leloup C. Quignon M. Brisorgueil M.J. Penicaud L.

In the neurones in these brain regions, GLUT4 was localized to rough endoplasmic reticulum, some mitochondria, vesicles, and microtubules and to dendritic spines as detected by electron microscopy (20El Messari S.

This enzyme is also known as placental leucine aminopeptidase or oxytocinase, because it was also cloned from a human placental cDNA library as the peptidase involved in the degradation of oxytocin (24Rogi T.

The enzyme specifically cleaves the N-terminal cysteine from oxytocin and vasopressin. Although N-terminal cysteine residues appear to be the preferential targets for the enzyme, a number of peptides that do not contain cysteine residues are also hydrolyzed by IRAP in vitro. These include Lys-bradykinin, angiotensin III, Met-encephalon, dynorphin A, neurokinin A, and neuromedin B (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J.

However, other peptides that possess N-terminal cysteine residues and intramolecular disulfide bonds, such as calcitonin and endothelin, are not cleaved by the enzyme. The substrates of IRAP in vivoare unknown, and the physiological relevance of the translocation of the enzyme to the cell surface in response to insulin in adipocytes and skeletal muscle remains to be elucidated. The AT4 receptor ligands will be useful tools with which to investigate this system.We have demonstrated that two structurally unrelated AT4receptor ligands, Ang IV and LVV-H7, are potent inhibitors of the aminopeptidase activity of IRAP.

We postulate that AT4 receptor ligands mediate their physiological effects by inhibiting IRAP activity. Thus, we propose that inhibition of IRAP in the central nervous system extends the half-life of endogenous neuropeptides that potentiate memory. For example, vasopressin, substance P, and somatostatin, known substrates for IRAP (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J.

It is tempting to speculate that their functions may be enhanced by inhibition of IRAP.Alternatively, inhibition of IRAP may modulate the levels of peptides involved in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. The demonstration of IRAP in the same regions of the brain as GLUT4 and the occurrence of GLUT4 and IRAP in the same cells in a range of other tissues suggests that IRAP may play a critical role in the regulation of GLUT4 actions and therefore glucose uptake.Our present findings suggest that the mechanism by which AT4 receptor ligands facilitate memory and learning is by inhibiting the aminopeptidase activity of IRAP. We postulate that inhibition of IRAP extends the half-life of neuropeptides that potentiate memory. The inhibition of IRAP may also modulate the levels of peptides involved in the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. These findings open a new field of inquiry to unite the positive cognitive effects of AT4 receptor ligands with the properties of IRAP and its potential role in glucose uptake. The results presented here identify the AT4 receptor as the transmembrane aminopeptidase, IRAP, and confirm that IRAP has the same pharmacological and biochemical characteristics as the AT4 receptor. Cells transfected with the full-length cDNA for human IRAP expressed a high affinity binding site for Ang IV with a pharmacological profile identical to that obtained for the endogenous human AT4 receptor (15Mustafa T. Chai S.Y. Mendelsohn F.A. Moeller I. Albiston A.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The localization of both IRAP mRNA and protein in the brain parallels the distribution of the AT4 receptor determined by in vitroreceptor autoradiography. We also demonstrate that the well described peptide ligands of the AT4 receptor inhibited the catalytic activity of IRAP in vitro. IRAP was originally identified from GLUT4 vesicles (17Keller S.R.

PTEN structural domains include an N-terminal phosphatase domain, a lipid-binding C2 domain, and a 50-amino acid C-terminal tail that contains a PDZ binding sequence. We showed previously that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail negatively regulates PTEN activity. We now show that phosphorylated PTEN exists in a monomeric “closed” conformation and has low affinity for PDZ domain-containing proteins. Conversely, when unphosphorylated, PTEN is in an “open” conformation, is recruited into a high molecular weight complex (PTEN-associated complex), and strongly interacts with PDZ-containing proteins such as MAGI-2. As a consequence, when compared with wild-type PTEN, the phosphorylation-deficient mutant form of PTEN strongly cooperates with MAGI-2 to block Akt activation. These results indicate that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail causes a conformational change that results in the masking of the PDZ binding domain. Consequently, the ability of PTEN to bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins is reduced dramatically. These data suggest that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail suppresses the activity of PTEN by controlling the recruitment of PTEN into the PTEN-associated complex.

Loss of PTEN leads to elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and consequent Akt activation. PTEN is comprised of an N-terminal phosphatase domain (PHD) within which lies the consensus phosphatase signature motif, a C2 domain that binds lipid vesicles and a C-terminal “tail” that contains a PDZ binding domain (PDZbd) (see Ref. 8Lee J.O.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Here, we show that phosphorylated PTEN is in a “closed” conformation and migrates as a monomer in gel filtration columns. In contrast, unphosphorylated PTEN is in an “open” conformation, is found in a high molecular weight complex (>600 kDa) (PTEN-associated complex; PAC) and unlike phosphorylated PTEN strongly interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as MAGI-1 and -2. As a result unphosphorylated PTEN acts synergistically with MAGI-2 to down-regulate Akt activity. Based on these results, we propose that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail regulates its activity by preventing it from participating in the PAC. pSG5L-HA-PTEN;WT, pSG5L-HA-PTEN;A4, pSG5L-HA-PTEN;A5, and pCDNA3-T7-Akt were described previously (13Vazquez F.

Where indicated phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate) were added. Frozen rat livers were homogenized in TNN, centrifuged, and passed through 0.8, 0.45, and 0.22-μm filters. Extracts were applied to Sephacryl S-300 or S-200 (16 × 60; Amersham Biosciences) columns and were developed with phosphate-buffered saline at 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. 2-ml fractions were collected. After the void volume (fractions 1–20) fractions 21 through 44 were collected and immunoblotted. Immunoprecipitations were prepared with Y-11 or HA-11. Where indicated samples were dephosphorylated prior to digestion. The beads were washed with TNN and 50 mm NH4HCO3, split, and incubated with 0, 5, 50, or 500 ng of sequencing grade trypsin. Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase whose main substrate is localized to the plasma membrane. A prediction is that PTEN needs to be localized to the membrane to perform its function. There are two possible mechanisms by which PTEN could be targeted to the membrane. First, PTEN can bind to lipid vesicles through the C2 domain (8Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). However, the fact that the addition of a myristoylation signal increases the ability of PTEN to induce a proliferation arrest (see Ref. 16Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Kaloudis P. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Hanafusa H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7033-7038PubMed Google Scholar, and data not shown) suggests that a second mechanism for recruitment may exist. Second, PTEN contains a PDZ binding domain at the tail that can interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins (9Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C.

Such PDZ proteins serve as scaffolds to build membrane-localized multiprotein complexes (17Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 382-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment into a protein complex could be a regulatory mechanism by which PTEN is translocated to the plasma membrane. To test the hypothesis that PTEN is recruited into a protein complex, cell extracts prepared from rat liver were separated by gel filtration over a Sephacryl S-300 column. PTEN was found in two peaks when detected by immunoblotting. The first peak eluted with a molecular mass greater than 600 kDa whereas the second eluted with a molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 1A). The latter peak is consistent with the predicted size of monomeric PTEN, whereas the former appears to represent a higher order complex. These results suggest that a fraction of PTEN is found in a protein complex (PAC). Several PDZ domain-containing proteins bind to PTEN including hdlg and MAGI-1, -2, and -3 (9Wu X. Hepner K.

To determine whether any of these proteins where present in the PAC we investigated whether PTEN and hDLG co-fractionated in gel filtration experiments. Although hDLG could be detected in high molecular weight fractions it did not co-migrate with the PAC (Fig. 1A). Attempts to recapitulate these experiments with MAGI proteins were hampered by the lack of reagents sensitive enough to detect the endogenous proteins in these extracts. Thus, it is not clear whether any one or all of these proteins are physiologically bound to PTEN in vivo. Interestingly, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K also co-fractionated with PTEN (data not shown). Although one column is not enough to determine whether PI3K p85 is present in the PAC these data raise the interesting possibility that both PI3K and the inhibitor PTEN are present in the PAC. We and others showed previously that mutation of phosphorylation sites within the PTEN tail leads to a decrease in protein stability and an increase in PTEN activity (13Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). An interesting possibility is that phosphorylation of PTEN regulates its association or participation in the PAC. To this end a phospho-specific antisera against phosphoserine 380 (anti-pS380) was raised. Experiments done previously with individual phosphorylation site mutants indicated that of the phosphorylation sites found in vivo serine 380 is the more critical for regulating PTEN function (see Ref. 13Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Anti-pS380 detected PTEN in the untreated immunoprecipitates and in those containing phosphatase inhibitors. However, no signal was detected when the extracts were treated with phosphatase (Fig. 1B). Additionally, anti-pS380 could detect PTEN;WT but not PTEN;A5 (alanine substitutions at Ser-370, Ser-380, Thr-382, Thr-383, and Ser-385) or PTEN;S380A (see Fig. 1B, and data not shown). Thus the anti-pS380 antibody is phosphospecific. Next, gel filtration column fractions were re-probed using anti-pS380. As shown in Fig. 1A although two peaks are detected by anti-PTEN, only the low molecular mass (65 kDa) peak was detected by anti-pS380. Similar results were seen in independent experiments where proteins were separated over an S-200 gel filtration column (data not shown). These results suggest that PTEN recruitment to PAC is regulated through phosphorylation. Previous data have shown that PTEN is more active when unphosphorylated; thus these new data suggest that the PTEN found in the PAC is the biologically active form of PTEN. How does phosphorylation regulate PTEN recruitment into the PAC? One possibility is that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail causes a conformational change that diminishes PTEN affinity for its binding partners. To test this hypothesis HA-PTEN and HA-PTEN;A4 (alanine substitutions at Ser-380, Thr-382, Thr-383, and Ser-385) were produced in U2-OS cells, purified by anti-HA immunoprecipitation, and subjected to partial tryptic digestion. Tryptic fragments were detected by immunoblotting with either a monoclonal (6H2.1) or a polyclonal (C54) anti-PTEN antibody that recognize the PTEN C terminus (Fig.2). Mutation of the phosphorylation sites (PTEN;A4) resulted in increased accessibility of tryptic sensitive sites indicated both by the presence of new cleavage sites and by more efficient digestion at multiple enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2,top panels). Similarly when wild-type HA-PTEN was treated with phosphatase it was more sensitive to tryptic digestion (Fig. 2). These results suggest that PTEN undergoes a conformational change when phosphorylated on tail residues. Because tail phosphorylation closed the conformation of PTEN, we investigated whether phosphorylation masked the PDZbd. Several PDZ domain-containing proteins have been shown to bind to the PTEN PDZbd (9Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl.

To determine whether phosphorylation could regulate the interaction of PTEN with PDZ domain-containing proteins the consequence of mutating the PTEN phosphorylation sites on the binding with MAGI-2 was analyzed. U2-OS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PTEN;WT or GFP-PTEN;A4 along with either empty vector or HA-MAGI-2. As shown previously PTEN;WT co-immunoprecipitates with MAGI-2 (9Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar); however mutation of the tail phosphorylation sites resulted in a dramatic enhancement in MAGI-2 binding (Fig.3A). These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitating PTEN and immunoblotting for HA-MAGI-2 (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with MAGI-1 (data not shown) suggesting that the findings are not specific for MAGI-2. Finally, extracts prepared from U2-OS cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PTEN and either vector or HA-MAGI-2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody or with anti-PTEN antibody and immunoblotted with either anti-PTEN (pan) or anti-pS380. Here, despite adequate detection of phospho-S380 in both the whole cell extracts and in the direct PTEN immunoprecipitates, no phosphorylated PTEN was detected in complex with MAGI-2 (Fig. 3, left panel) despite the abundant presence of phosphorylated PTEN found in the whole cell extracts (Fig. 3C, right panel). Conversely, we were able to detect PTEN in the immunoprecipitates albeit at lower levels (Fig. 3C). A recent report showed that alanine substitution of threonine 382 and threonine 383 also enhances PTEN binding to MAGI-2 (19Tolkacheva T. Boddapati M. Sanfiz A. Tsuchida K. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4985-4989PubMed Google Scholar). However, alanine substitution of these threonine sites impairs serine 380 phosphorylation (data not shown) thus further experiments will be needed to distinguish direct from indirect effects of mutation of these sites. Taken together these data show that phosphorylation of the tail blocks or inhibits binding of PTEN to MAGI-2 and MAGI-1 suggesting that the PDZbd is masked by the phosphorylation. It has been shown previously that MAGI-2 and -3 cooperate with PTEN as measured in assays reflecting PTEN-dependent inhibition of Akt activity. A likely explanation for these results is that MAGI recruits PTEN to the plasma membrane where the substrates of PTEN are localized (9Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 10Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Laura R. Lee J. Gu Q. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our previous results showed that PTEN tail phosphorylation restricts its activity, and data presented here show that PTEN tail phosphorylation prevents MAGI interaction. These data suggest a model in which PTEN-MAGI interaction and therefore PTEN activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. A prediction of this model is that the enhancement of PTEN function by MAGI-2 would be restricted to the unphosphorylated form of PTEN. To test this hypothesis, the PTEN null cell line 786-O was co-transfected with plasmids encoding PTEN;WT or PTEN;A4 with either the vector alone or with pCDNA3-HA-MAGI-2. Transfected Akt was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) to detect active Akt. As shown in Fig.4A, the ability of PTEN to negatively regulate Akt is maximally achieved when PTEN;A4 and MAGI-2 are co-transfected. These data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of the PTEN tail results in an inhibition of PTEN activity, at least in part, by preventing its interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as MAGI-2. The results presented here provide evidence for a mechanistic model of how phosphorylation of the PTEN tail modulates PTEN biological function (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of the PTEN tail can switch PTEN from an open to a closed conformation and prevent its recruitment into a higher molecular mass complex, PAC. This phosphorylation-dependent conformational change of the PTEN tail appears to mask the PDZbd and prevent PTEN interaction with PDZ-containing proteins. The PDZ domain is a small 80–100-residue modular domain usually found in proteins that serve as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Thus, the PDZ-containing proteins found in the PAC may recruit several other molecules to form a multiprotein complex. A question that remains is which, if any, of the known PDZ proteins are in the PAC complex. In addition, the PAC appears to contain p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. This raises the possibility that other members of the PI3K pathway might also be found in the PAC as a mechanism for enhancing signaling efficiency. The biochemical purification and identification of the endogenous PAC will begin to address these questions. There are several additional lines of evidence favoring a regulatory role for the PTEN tail. First, the structure of PTEN PHD and C2 domain were resolved by x-ray crystallography (8Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In these studies the C-terminal tail was highly susceptible to protease digestion perhaps indicating the flexible nature of this domain. These data support the notion that the conformation of the C terminus might change upon phosphorylation. Second, the tail is highly conserved in evolution fromXenopus to humans but diverges inCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster indicating that a new role for the PTEN tail was acquired during evolution. Third, the recently discovered PTEN homologue, transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology/PTEN2 (20Chen H. Rossier C. Morris M.A. Scott H.S. Gos A. Bairoch A. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Pisabarro M. Dillard-Telm L. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21745-21753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is predicted to contain a PHD and a C2 domain (21Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Pisabarro M. Dillard-Telm L. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21745-21753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but lacks the tail. Instead it contains an N-terminal extension consisting on four transmembrane domains that targets transmembrane phosphatase with tensin homology/PTEN2 to the Golgi (21Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Pisabarro M. Dillard-Telm L. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21745-21753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that an ancestral gene containing the PHD and the C2 domain diverged and that additional domains, such as the PTEN tail, were acquired to achieve additional regulation. In the case of human PTEN it appears that the phosphorylation-induced conformational change that regulates recruitment into the PAC is one such evolutionary acquisition. It has been shown previously that the PTEN tail is phosphorylatedin vitro by CK2 (18Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Using an unbiased approach to purify the PTEN tail kinase activity from cells we found that CK2 co-purified with the PTEN tail kinase activity (data not shown) suggesting that CK2 is the major cellular PTEN kinase. CK2 is a constitutive kinase making it likely that the rate-limiting step, in switching between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PTEN, is governed by a phosphatase. This phosphatase, upon activation, presumably dephosphorylates the PTEN tail changing its conformation and thus increasing the amount of complexed PTEN. An interesting possibility is that the PTEN tail phosphatase is itself found in PAC. In conclusion, we propose a model to explain how phosphorylation of the PTEN tail regulates its activity. Once the PTEN tail is phosphorylated there is a change in the conformation of the protein that prevents PTEN interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins and recruitment of PTEN into a complex. Recruitment is likely important for localization of PTEN close to the plasma membrane and thus is transduced into a change in PTEN activity.

We have found that insulin resistance induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was accompanied by increased GM3 ganglioside expression caused by elevating GM3 synthase activity and its mRNA. We also demonstrated that TNF-α simultaneously produced insulin resistance by uncoupling insulin receptor activity toward insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and suppressing insulin-sensitive glucose transport. Pharmacological depletion of GM3 in adipocytes by an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase prevented the TNF-α-induced defect in insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and also counteracted the TNF-α-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, when the adipocytes were incubated with exogenous GM3, suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 and glucose uptake in response to insulin stimulation was observed, demonstrating that GM3 itself is able to mimic the effects of TNF on insulin signaling. We used the obese Zuckerfa/fa rat and ob/ob mouse, which are known to overproduce TNF-α mRNA in adipose tissues, as typical models of insulin resistance. We found that the levels of GM3 synthase mRNA in adipose tissues of these animals were significantly higher than in their lean counterparts.

Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 325: 938-942Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-α represents a key mediator of obesity-linked insulin resistance. First, overexpression of TNF-α in adipose tissue and insulin resistance were commonly observed in different rodent models of obesity (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar, 3Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Braithwaite S.S. Colca J.R. Palazuk B.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) as well as in obese humans (4Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Second, neutralization of TNF with a soluble TNF receptor-immunoglobulin G chimeric protein was found to improve insulin receptor signaling and insulin sensitivity in obese and insulin-resistant rats (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar). Moreover, obese mice with targeted disruption of the genes encoding either TNF or its two receptors lacked insulin resistance (5Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Matino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 289: 610-614Crossref Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Third, on a cellular level, TNF is a potent inhibitor of insulin signaling. Chronic treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TNF inhibits glucose uptake and interferes with signaling through the insulin receptor to downstream of substrates, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), suggesting a defect at or near the tyrosine kinase activity (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Although there is now substantial evidence linking TNF to the presentation of insulin resistance in humans, animals, and in vitro systems as described above, the molecular mechanisms mediating the cross-talk between TNF-α and the insulin signaling cascade remain incompletely understood.A key question is whether TNF acts directly or indirectly to suppress insulin function. It has been shown that TNF causes down-regulation of the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter, GLUT4, expressed in cultured adipocytes (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar, 7Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because GLUT4 is also known to be deficient in adipose tissues of several obese animal models as well as humans with type 2 diabetes (8Pederson O.C. Kahn R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1964-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Huecksteadt T.P. Brinbaum M.J. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TNF-mediated insulin resistance in these disorders may involve the regulation of GLUT4 expression. However, an additional step in insulin action targeted by TNF has been suggested because TNF at relatively low concentrations can strongly inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes without affecting the cell content of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, or GLUT4 proteins (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Moreover, partially purified insulin receptors isolated from TNF-α-treated adipocytes showed reduced autophosphorylation of insulin receptor and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of exogenously added IRS-1, suggesting the presence of copurifying inhibitory molecule(s) (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). It would be important to purify and characterize these molecules. It has been reported recently that mice disrupted with p55 TNF receptor 1 exhibited altered ganglioside expression, including a decrease in ganglioside GM3 (10Markotic A. Lümen R. Marusic A. Jonjic A. Müthing J. Carbohydr. Res. 1999; 321: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that ganglioside metabolism is regulated at least in part by TNF signaling. Gangliosides have been suggested to be involved in signal transduction through their interaction with receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (11Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (12Van Brocklyn J.E. Bremer E.G. Yates A.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and insulin receptor (13Nojiri H. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2211-2216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper examines the effects of TNF enhancement and depletion of ganglioside GM3 on the control of insulin signaling.DISCUSSIONRecent studies examining the link between insulin resistance and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes are consistent with the involvement of TNF-α as a central mediator (32Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Qi C. Pekala P.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 128-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to adipocytes, TNF, when applied at fairly high doses, causes suppression of most lipogenic enzymes, including lipoprotein lipase, induces dedifferentiation (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar, 27Torti F.M. Dieckman B. Beutler B. Cerami A. Ringold G.M.

However, the interference with insulin action by TNF also occurs at doses (<0.1 nm) that are insufficient to cause a generalized suppression of adipocyte gene expression (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 9Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Huecksteadt T.P. Brinbaum M.J. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This requires the prolonged treatment (at least 72 h), unlike many acute effects of this cytokine. The slowness of the effect suggests that TNF induces the synthesis of an inhibitor that is the actual effector.We confirmed these previous observations using 3T3-L1 adipocytes in Fig. 2. Chronic treatment (96 h) of the adipocytes with TNF at 0.1 nm leads to a moderate reduction of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation and a more pronounced effect on IRS-1 phosphorylation without affecting the expression of insulin receptor and IRS-1 proteins. Moreover, it has been reported that partially purified insulin receptors isolated from TNF-treated adipocytes, which possessed the insulin binding ability equivalent to the untreated control cells, showed reduced autophosphorylation of the receptor and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of exogenously added recombinant IRS-1 (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 17Guo D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 615-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate the presence of an inhibitor in insulin signaling which appeared during chronic treatment with TNF.In the present study, we demonstrated that a state of insulin resistance in adipocytes treated with 0.1 nm TNF was accompanied by the progressive increase of cell surface GM3. This was mirrored by the increases of cellular GM3 content, GM3 synthase activity, and GM3 synthase mRNA content, indicating that TNF up-regulates GM3 synthesis at the transcriptional level in cultured adipocytes. We could extend these in vitro observations to intact animals because GM3 synthase mRNA contents in adipose tissues from the obese Zucker fa/fa rats andob/ob mice were significantly high compared with their lean animal versions (Fig. 7). Tanaka and Nojiri (34Tanaka T. Nojiri H. Proceedings of the 76th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society. 76. The Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD1994: 374Google Scholar) previously observed significantly higher expression of GM3 in KK-Ay mice and suggested that abnormal expression of ganglioside that has an inhibitory effect on insulin receptor function might be a possible cause of insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Because it has been reported that adipose tissues from various species, including human, rabbit, rat, and mouse, contain GM3 as the most abundant type of ganglioside (35Ohashi M. Lipids. 1979; 14: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we are currently analyzing the level of GM3 expression in adipose tissues from other rodent models as well as from humans with type 2 diabetes. It is reasonable to speculate that the transcription of the GM3 synthase gene is activated by TNF signaling through TNF receptor 1. Because we now understand the involvement of nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun, for example, in TNF-stimulated gene transcription (36Vilcek J. Jee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to identify such TNF-stimulated response element(s) to induce transcription of GM3 synthase gene in adipocyte-acquired insulin resistance.To elucidate whether the increased GM3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with TNF is involved in insulin resistance, we employed two separate experimental approaches here (reduction or enrichment of cellular GM3). First, we used an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase,d-PDMP (15Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 38: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 29Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Inokuchi J. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 183-211PubMed Google Scholar), to deplete cellular glycosphingolipids derived from glucosylceramide. This inhibitor is able to reduce the ganglioside content with minimum effect on phospholipids, neutral lipids, and glycoprotein (37Barbour S. Edidin M. Felding-Habermann B. Taylor-Norton J. Radin N. Fenderson B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). d-PDMP proved able to counteract the TNF-induced increase of GM3 content in adipocytes and completely normalize the TNF-induced defect in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 2). Thus, we were encouraged to measure the effect of PDMP on the TNF-induced defect of glucose uptake, but so far we could not see recovery of glucose uptake (data not shown). This may mean that d-PDMP effectively normalized the TNF-induced suppression at the initial step of insulin signaling by depleting GM3 but was not able to counteract the TNF-induced suppression of GLUT4 expression or its translocation to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the possible therapeutic implication for insulin resistance will be pursued more extensively because we have recently succeeded in developing a new potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (d-threo-1-phenyl-2-benzylcarboxyamino-3-pyrrolidino-l-propanol), which has no general cytotoxic effect (38Jimbo M. Yamagishi K. Yamaki N. Nunomura K. Kabayama K. Igarashi Y. Inokuchi J. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Second, we examined the effect of exogenously added gangliosides on tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 (Fig. 4) and glucose transport in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 6). Autophosphorylation of insulin receptor and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were reduced significantly only when adipocytes were incubated with 100 μm GM3 but not with GD1a (a minor ganglioside of this cell line). If the inhibition of insulin receptor to IRS-1 signaling by exogenous GM3 directly results in producing a state of insulin resistance, the downstream of events such as the glucose uptake should also be affected. Indeed, insulin-sensitive glucose uptake after prolonged treatment with GM3 was also suppressed, demonstrating that GM3 itself is able to reproduce a state of insulin resistance.How can up-regulation of GM3 synthesis in adipocytes exposed to TNF lead to the suppression of insulin signaling? A series of studies showed that gangliosides may inhibit or activate signal transduction through growth factor receptor or hormone receptor function, particularly associated with tyrosine kinase (for review, see Refs. 39Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholarand 40Yates A.J. Rampersaud A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been reported that GM3 inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor function (41Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (11Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) probably because of the interference of receptor dimerization. Recently, Meuillet et al. (42Meuillet E.J. Mania-Farnell B. George D. Inokuchi J. Bremer E.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of EGF receptor in A431 cells was enhanced when the cellular GM3 was depleted withd-PDMP treatment or was suppressed by exogenous GM3, indicating the similarity of the GM3 effects between the function of EGF receptor and insulin receptor. Previously, Nojiri et al.(13Nojiri H. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4531-4537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that gangliosides, such as sialylparagloboside and GM3, were able to inhibit autophosphorylation of partially purified human insulin receptor of IM9 human lymphoid cells in vitro. Thus, our data presented here can be supported by these previous reports, suggesting that GM3 interacts with insulin receptor probably through inhibiting the clustering of receptors, prerequisite for efficient signal transduction.Our current data demonstrated in Fig. 2A as well as others reported previously (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 17Guo D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 615-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), however, showed that the functions of insulin receptor appear to be relatively retained compared with the marked decrease of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in adipocytes treated with TNF. Because the preferential suppression of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was completely normalized by inhibiting GM3 synthesis by d-PDMP, the effects of exogenous GM3 on insulin signaling might be different from those of increased endogenous GM3 by activating GM3 synthase. IRS-1 proteins are localized at intercellular membranes (43Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. Chin D.J. Shoelson S.E. Miralpeix M. White M.F. J. Biol.

We are currently pursuing the possibility of preferential interaction of GM3 with IRS-1 inside the cells.Hotamisligil et al. (30Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of adipocytes with TNF induces an increase in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. This phosphorylation is an important event because immunoprecipitated IRS-1, which has been serine phosphorylated in response to TNF, is a direct inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. This inhibition is dependent upon the phosphorylation of IRS-1 because enzymatic dephosphorylation of IRS-1 reduces its ability to inhibit the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. This mechanism probably happens in intact cells because TNF does not interfere with insulin receptor autophosphorylation in myeloid 32D cells that lack IRS-1. When IRS-1 is ectopically expressed in the same cells, however, insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation become highly sensitive to TNF. Paz et al. (52Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) also reported that elevated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 inhibits their binding to the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor and impairs their ability to undergo insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations strongly suggest the importance of IRS-1 in TNF-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling.Here, we could show TNF-α−induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in adipocytes was completely suppressed by inhibition of GM3 biosynthesis with d-PDMP treatment (Fig. 5), suggesting that the elevated GM3 synthesis induced by TNF caused the up-regulation of serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. The elevation of GM3 level by TNF may inhibit serine phosphatase(s) or activate serine kinase(s). Because TNF-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 may occur through activation of a variety of kinases including protein kinase C (53Danielsen A.G. Liu F. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

We examined the effect of the exogenous addition of GM3 on serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, there was no obvious effect on serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 so far examined (data not shown), suggesting the differences of endogenous versus artificial exogenous GM3 on the effects of serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. To solve this issue, we are trying to transfect the synthase gene for GM3 (23Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Goto G. Urano T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9271-9276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 60Ishii A. Ohta M. Watanabe Y. Matsuda K. Ishiyama K. Sakoe K. Nakamura M. Inokuchi J. Sanai Y. Saito M.

Ganglioside GM3 may function as an inhibitor in insulin signaling during the chronic exposure of adipocytes to TNF. Insulin resistance is defined as the decreased ability of cells or tissues to respond to physiological levels of insulin and is a characteristic condition of type 2 diabetes (1Moller D.E. Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 325: 938-942Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-α represents a key mediator of obesity-linked insulin resistance. First, overexpression of TNF-α in adipose tissue and insulin resistance were commonly observed in different rodent models of obesity (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar, 3Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Braithwaite S.S. Colca J.R. Palazuk B.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) as well as in obese humans (4Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Second, neutralization of TNF with a soluble TNF receptor-immunoglobulin G chimeric protein was found to improve insulin receptor signaling and insulin sensitivity in obese and insulin-resistant rats (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar). Moreover, obese mice with targeted disruption of the genes encoding either TNF or its two receptors lacked insulin resistance (5Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Matino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 289: 610-614Crossref Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Third, on a cellular level, TNF is a potent inhibitor of insulin signaling. Chronic treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TNF inhibits glucose uptake and interferes with signaling through the insulin receptor to downstream of substrates, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), suggesting a defect at or near the tyrosine kinase activity (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Although there is now substantial evidence linking TNF to the presentation of insulin resistance in humans, animals, and in vitro systems as described above, the molecular mechanisms mediating the cross-talk between TNF-α and the insulin signaling cascade remain incompletely understood. A key question is whether TNF acts directly or indirectly to suppress insulin function. It has been shown that TNF causes down-regulation of the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter, GLUT4, expressed in cultured adipocytes (2Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6028) Google Scholar, 7Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because GLUT4 is also known to be deficient in adipose tissues of several obese animal models as well as humans with type 2 diabetes (8Pederson O.C. Kahn R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1964-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Huecksteadt T.P. Brinbaum M.J. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TNF-mediated insulin resistance in these disorders may involve the regulation of GLUT4 expression. However, an additional step in insulin action targeted by TNF has been suggested because TNF at relatively low concentrations can strongly inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes without affecting the cell content of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, or GLUT4 proteins (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Moreover, partially purified insulin receptors isolated from TNF-α-treated adipocytes showed reduced autophosphorylation of insulin receptor and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of exogenously added IRS-1, suggesting the presence of copurifying inhibitory molecule(s) (6Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar).

To explore this hypothesis in endothelial cells, we designed a set of experiments to mimic the “typical metabolic insulin resistance” by blocking the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of insulin (“compensatory hyperinsulinemia”). Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate increased expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, did not affect insulin-induced activation of MAP kinase, and increased the effects of insulin on prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins. At the same time, this experimental paradigm resulted in increased expression of vascular cellular adhesion molecules-1 and E-selectin, as well as increased rolling interactions of monocytes with endothelial cells. We conclude that inhibition of the metabolic branch of insulin signaling leads to an enhanced mitogenic action of insulin in endothelial cells.

In humans, physiological levels of insulin stimulate increased production of nitric oxide (NO)1 in the vasculature resulting in vasodilation and increased blood flow (1Scherrer U. Randin D. Vollenweider P. Vollenweider L. Nicod P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 5Steinberg H.O. Brechtel G. Johnson A. Fineberg N. Baron A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, vasodilator actions of insulin are impaired in individuals who are also resistant to metabolic actions of insulin (6Steinberg H.O. Chaker H. Leaming R. Johnson A. Brechtel G. Baron A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Although associations between vascular disease and insulin-resistant states such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension have been firmly established, the mechanisms linking endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis with insulin resistance (typically defined as decreased sensitivity or responsiveness to metabolic actions of insulin) have not been fully elucidated. With in vivostudies, it is particularly challenging to differentiate potentially distinct influences of insulin resistance per se from effects of compensatory hyperinsulinemia. In vitro studies in vascular endothelial cells demonstrate that insulin may stimulate production of NO by increasing both the expression and the activity of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (7Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 8Kuboki K. Jiang Z.Y. Takahara N. Ha S.W. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. Feener E.P. Herbert T.P. Rhodes C.J.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is necessary to promote both increased expression and activity of eNOS in response to insulin (7Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 8Kuboki K. Jiang Z.Y. Takahara N. Ha S.W. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. Feener E.P. Herbert T.P. Rhodes C.J. King G.L.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PI 3-kinase is also a key signaling molecule mediating metabolic actions of insulin in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (reviewed in Ref. 10Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Thus, abnormalities in PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway that are shared among different tissues may provide one molecular explanation for the frequent associations of vascular disease and insulin-resistant states (4Montagnani M. Quon M.J. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2000; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies (11Jiang Z.Y. Lin Y.-W. Clemont A. Feener E.P. Hein K.D. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. White M.F.

In fact, in many models of metabolic insulin resistance, insulin signaling via the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase pathway is impaired, whereas the MAP kinase pathway is unaffected (11Jiang Z.Y. Lin Y.-W.

Compensatory hyperinsulinemia resulting from insulin resistance may stimulate increased production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, endothelin, and various proliferative events in vascular smooth muscle cells via MAP kinase-dependent pathways (13Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G.

We have demonstrated recently that the ability of insulin to increase the prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins is mediated via the Shc/MAP kinase pathway and is completely independent of PI 3-kinase activity (18Goalstone M.L. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Berhanu P. Sharma P.G. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. J. Biol.

Enhanced prenylation of these small molecular weight GTPases increases the mitogenic responsiveness of cells to a variety of growth factors. One might envision that hyperinsulinemia resulting from insulin resistance would drive intact Shc/MAP kinase-dependent pathways to increase prenylation of Ras and Rho leading to enhanced mitogenic responsiveness of endothelial cells. In the present study, we designed experiments to mimic the typical “insulin-resistant” state by blocking PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling and exposing cells to increased concentrations of insulin (“compensatory hyperinsulinemia”). The effects of insulin to stimulate prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins, expression of eNOS and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and E-selectin), and the interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium were examined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We found that inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to enhanced mitogenic actions of insulin in endothelial cells. Thus, we have identified an additional plausible mechanism for insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia to contribute to vascular complications of diabetes. All standard chemicals were from Sigma.

HUVEC were serum-starved for 14 h in EBM-B (endothelial basal media supplemented with 1% platelet-deprived horse serum) and then treated with or without insulin (100 nm) for 20 h in the absence or presence of wortmannin (50 nm). Cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5), and samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against eNOS, according to standard methods. Samples were then separated by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-eNOS antibody. HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h in EBM-B and then treated with insulin (100 nm) in the absence or presence of wortmannin (50 nm) for 24 h. Cells lysates were prepared with lysis buffer, and samples were immunoprecipitated with p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, determined by Western blotting using phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence. HUVEC at 95% confluence were serum-starved overnight in EBM-A (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) prior to initiation of experiments. Cells were then stimulated with insulin (10 or 100 nm) for 1 or 24 h, without or with pretreatment with wortmannin (100 nm, added 30 min before insulin). Cells lysates were prepared using 500 μl of lysis buffer. FTase and GGTase-I activities were determined as described previously (18Goalstone M.L. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B.

Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed using Student's t test withp < 0.05 considered significant. For these experiments HUVECs were prepared from human umbilical cords by collagenase digestion and maintained as described previously (24Kim I. Moon S.O. Koh K.N. Kim H. Uhm C.S. Kwak H.J. Kim N.G.

The partial cDNAs of human VCAM-1 (nucleotides 538–816, GenBankTM accession numberM60335) and human E-selectin (nucleotides 783–989, GenBankTM accession number M30640) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). After linearizing with EcoRI, 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase (Ambion Maxiscript kit) and gel-purified. RPA was performed on total RNAs using the Ambion RPA kit. An antisense RNA probe of human cyclophilin (nucleotides 135–239, GenBankTMaccession number X52856) was used as an internal control for RNA quantification. All signals were visualized and analyzed by densitometric scanning (LAS-1000, Fuji Film, Tokyo). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Endothelial cells derived from mouse lung endothelium were obtained from Dr. Eric Brown (University of California, San Francisco) and cultured in dishes pre-coated with 1% gelatin (Sigma). The cells were maintained for 7 days in MCDB 131 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, bovine brain extract, heparin, hydrocortisone, and antibiotics to obtain confluent endothelial cell monolayers. Cells of the Wehi 274.1 monocyte-like cell line were loaded with fluorescent dye by 20-min incubation at room temperature with 1 μm2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 106cells/ml, and loaded into a 25-ml syringe. A GlycoTech (Rockville, MD) flow chamber insert and gasket were inserted into the dish to form a laminar flow chamber that can be viewed on a microscope. Cells were injected into the flow chamber in Hanks' balanced salt solution at controlled physiological shear rates using a programmable syringe pump (KD Scientific, New Hope, PA). Cells were viewed on an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a CCD camera (Model 300T-RC, Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) and viewed as a combination differential interference contrast and fluorescence image. Video was recorded onto a VHS videotape, and selected sequences of 3 min were digitized to TIF files using the Perception video editing package (Perception PVR-2500, Digital Processing Systems, Markham, Ontario, Canada). Digitized video images were examined frame-by-frame to determine numbers of leukocytes rolling on endothelium and numbers of leukocyte arrests (complete stops). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. and analyzed using Student's t test withp < 0.05 considered significant. We have shown previously that wortmannin completely inhibits the acute effect of insulin to stimulate production of NO in HUVEC (7Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that treatment of HUVEC with 50 nm wortmannin also fully inhibits the effect of insulin on the expression of eNOS in these cells (Fig.1). These experiments are consistent with previous results demonstrating that the effect of insulin to increase eNOS expression and activity in endothelial cells is mediated by the PI 3-kinase pathway (7Zeng G.

In contrast, under similar conditions, the ability of insulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of MAP kinase remained unaffected (Fig. 2), that is insulin (10 nm) promoted comparable phosphorylation of MAP kinase both in control and the wortmannin-treated cells.Figure 2Effect of insulin and wortmannin on the phosphorylation of MAP kinase in HUVEC. HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated without or with insulin (10 nm) in the absence or presence of wortmannin (WORT) (50 nm) for 24 h.

In control HUVEC, insulin (10 nm) stimulated both prenyltransferases at 1 h of incubation with a return toward basal activity at 24 h (Fig.3, A and B). In the wortmannin-treated cells, the effect of insulin on FTase was significantly increased at 24 h (Fig. 3A). A pattern of activation of GGTase I was somewhat different in the wortmannin-treated HUVEC. The effect of insulin was significantly greater both at 1 and 24 h of incubation (Fig. 3B). As expected, increased activity of the prenyltransferases was followed by the corresponding increases in the amounts of farnesylated p21Ras and geranylgeranylated Rho-A in wortmannin-treated cells exposed to either 10 or 100 nm insulin for 24 h (Fig.4).Figure 4Effect of insulin and wortmannin on the amounts of prenylated p21Ras and Rho-A. HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with insulin (10 and 100 nm) for 24 h (A and B) without or with pretreatment with wortmannin (Wort) (100 nm, added 30 min before insulin).

Similarly, cells with increased availability of geranylgeranylated Rho-A also displayed increased mitogenic responsiveness to agents working via the Rho pathway (22Golovchenko I. Goalstone M. Watson P. Brownlee M. Draznin B. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K. Stjernholm R. Leitner J. Goalstone M. Draznin B. J. Biol.

Therefore, we hypothesized that increased availability of farnesylated p21Ras and geranylgeranylated Rho-A in HUVEC might increase the responsiveness of these cells to other growth-promoting agents. To investigate this point, we examined the effect of insulin, in the presence of wortmannin, on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced expression of the adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. As expected, VEGF significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in control cells (Fig. 5). Insulin alone did not exert any significant effect on the expression of mRNA of these adhesion molecules. Nevertheless, in concert with previously published observations (25Aljada A. Saadeh R. Assian E. Chanim H. Dandona P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2000; 85 (*): 2572-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Kim I. Moon S.-O. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), it significantly attenuated the effect of VEGF (Fig. 5). However, in the presence of wortmannin, insulin lost its attenuating effect and potentiated the effect of VEGF on the expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin (Fig. 5). We then addressed the functional implications of an increased expression of the adhesion molecules. Because the process of monocyte adhesion to endothelium begins with rolling interactions and progresses to a complete stop, we assessed these two phases of monocyte interaction with the insulin-treated endothelial cells in the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 6). The experiments were performed in a flow chamber under a low shear stress (0.3 dynes/cm2). We found that rolling interactions of monocytes with the endothelial cells in response to insulin were significantly increased by the blockade of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 6A). In addition, under these conditions, leukocytes were more likely to come to complete stops than in control experiments or in the presence of either insulin or wortmannin alone (Fig. 6B). Thus, the two essential early steps required for monocyte adhesion to endothelium (i.e. initial rolling and arrest of motion) were significantly increased when the cells were treated with insulin in the presence of wortmannin. Investigators exploring contributions of insulin resistance and the resulting compensatory hyperinsulinemia to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases that accompany the metabolic syndrome X must reconcile an apparent paradox. On the one hand, insulin resistance signifies impaired insulin action. On the other hand, hyperinsulinemia raises the possibility of increased insulin action in certain contexts. For example, in endothelial cells, diminished insulin action secondary to acquired or inherited insulin resistance readily explains the impaired ability of insulin to stimulate production of NO and normal vasodilation (4Montagnani M. Quon M.J. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2000; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Steinberg H.O. Brechtel G. Johnson A. Fineberg N. Baron A.D. J. Clin.

At the same time, hyperinsulinemia may cause overproduction of endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by endothelial cells that contribute to vascular disease (13Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G.

An unresolved question is how pathological responses related to either insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia can occur simultaneously in the same cell. One potential explanation for this important pathophysiological conundrum was suggested by the demonstration that insulin resistance along the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase pathway of insulin signaling does not necessarily coincide with resistance in other signaling pathways. In fact, the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway retains normal sensitivity to insulin in both humans and animals who are resistant to the metabolic actions of insulin (11Jiang Z.Y. Lin Y.-W. Clemont A.

Even though stimulatory effects of insulin on prenyltransferases and the amounts of prenylated Ras and Rho proteins are relatively small (15–30%, see Figs. 3 and 4), they are of high physiological significance, for they result in a 2-fold potentiation of action of other growth-promoting agents working via the Ras- and Rho-dependent pathways (19Goalstone M.L.

Although insulin at high concentrations may act through the receptors for insulin-like growth factor-1 (29Sowers J.R. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the effect of insulin on the prenyltransferases is not mimicked by other growth factors, requires the presence of an intact insulin receptor, and is mediated via the Shc-MAP kinase pathway (19Goalstone M.L.

Analogous to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, where the influence of ACTH is directed along an unaffected branch of steroidogenesis, we postulate that insulin signaling via the MAP kinase pathway is unaffected (and its signaling to the prenyltransferases is actually increased) in the presence of insulin resistance along the PI 3-kinase pathway. Thus, metabolic insulin resistance caused by impaired PI 3-kinase pathways may result in compensatory hyperinsulinemia that increases the activity of the prenyltransferases through unopposed Shc-MAP kinase pathways (Fig. 7). Our current experiments strongly support our hypothesis and demonstrate an increased responsiveness of HUVEC to VEGF in the presence of an experimental paradigm mimicking the state of metabolic insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. In vascular endothelial cells, blockade of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway with wortmannin increased the ability of insulin to augment the activities of FTase and GGTase I as well as the amounts of prenylated p21Rasand Rho-A. Concomitantly, the effects of VEGF on the production of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVEC were increased, and the endothelial cells attracted significantly greater numbers of mononuclear cells (Fig. 6). Because insulin-stimulated production of NO is a PI 3-kinase-mediated event (7Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 9Zeng G. Nystrom F.H.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), our results are also consistent with a recent study showing that the effect of insulin to inhibit expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells may be dependent on production of NO (25Aljada A. Saadeh R. Assian E. Chanim H. Dandona P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2000; 85 (*): 2572-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, is believed to be among the earliest steps in the process of atherogenesis (30Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9956) Google Scholar). These adhesion molecules are not only expressed in the endothelial cells but are also released into the circulation via either shedding or an alternative pathway (31Gearing A.J. Neuman W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 506-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Increased levels of circulating adhesion molecules are correlated with future coronary events (32Shyer K.G.

Holmes M. Reaven G.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1999; 84: 3485-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and 36Kado S. Nagata N. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 46: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in healthy volunteers, Chenet al. (35Chen N.-G. Holmes M. Reaven G.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1999; 84: 3485-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have found a significant correlation between the degree of insulin resistance and circulating concentrations of E-selectin, ICAM-I, and VCAM-1, that is the most insulin-resistant individuals displayed the highest concentrations of all three soluble adhesion molecules (35Chen N.-G. Holmes M. Reaven G.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1999; 84: 3485-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our findings that insulin (with or without VEGF) can potentiate the expression of these adhesion molecules when the metabolic (PI 3-kinase-dependent) branch of insulin signaling is inhibited may provide a molecular explanation for the increased cellular expression and circulating concentrations of adhesion molecules observed in insulin-resistant states. The incidence of atherosclerosis is much higher in patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general population. However, much remains to be learned about the relationship between the pathophysiology of these diseases. It is well known that monocyte adhesion to endothelium is an essential early event in the development of the atherosclerotic plaque (37Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Investig. Med. 2001; 49: 104-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known about the effects of hyperinsulinemia in the presence of insulin resistance on the adhesion process itself. We have addressed this topic using a functional assay to test adhesion of the monocyte cell line Wehi 274.1 to cultured endothelium under stress. Our data clearly demonstrate an increase in both rolling adhesion and monocyte arrest when cells were treated with insulin in the presence of wortmannin. These effects were especially pronounced at low shear stresses (commonly associated with areas that are prone to atherosclerotic plaque formation). Thus, concomitant insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may be an important contributor to increased adhesivity of arterial endothelial cells and other early events in the development of atherosclerosis. Insulin activated both FTase and GGTase I in HUVEC (Fig. 3). Further studies are needed to determine the precise aspects of VEGF action that are potentiated by the greater availability of farnesylated p21Ras as compared with the greater availability of geranylgeranylated Rho-A. VEGF action is initiated by its interaction with several transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, including flt-1 and flk-1 (39de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 40Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase have been shown to participate in VEGF signaling cascades (41Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 42Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) indicate that effects of VEGF on expression of adhesion molecules involve nuclear factor κB (NFκB). Interestingly, activation of NFκB is dependent upon the availability of Rho-A (43Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In fact, our own studies have demonstrated that the ability of insulin to potentiate transactivation of NFκB by angiotensin II, hyperglycemia, and advance glycosylation end products is Rho-A-dependent (22Golovchenko I. Goalstone M. Watson P. Brownlee M. Draznin B. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of prenyltransferases by insulin is likely to augment the vascular actions of VEGF as well. In summary, we show that in an in vitro model of metabolic insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia, insulin is unable to stimulate eNOS expression but is able to increase production of adhesion molecules in the same endothelial cells (possibly via enhanced prenylation). We postulate that insulin resistance in vivosimultaneously results in decreased NO production and compensatory hyperinsulinemia that augments prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins. This may contribute to the increased responsiveness of endothelial cells to atherogenic actions of VEGF and other growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2069228549,"Recently we have shown that the FPB prostanoid receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that couples to Gαq, activates T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef)-mediated transcriptional activation (Fujino, H., and Regan, J. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 12489–12492). We now report that the EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors, which couple to Gαs, also activate Tcf/Lef signaling. By using a Tcf/Lef-responsive luciferase reporter gene, transcriptional activity was stimulated ∼10-fold over basal by 1 h of treatment with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in HEK cells that were stably transfected with the human EP2 and EP4receptors. This stimulation of reporter gene activity was accompanied by a PGE2-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of both glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and Akt kinase. H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), completely blocked the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3 in both EP2- and EP4-expressing cells. However, H-89 pretreatment only blocked PGE2-stimulated Lef/Tcf reporter gene activity by 20% in EP4-expressing cells compared with 65% inhibition in EP2-expressing cells. On the other hand wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, had the opposite effect and inhibited PGE2-stimulated reporter gene activity to a much greater extent in EP4-expressing cells as compared with EP2-expressing cells. These findings indicate that the activation of Tcf/Lef signaling by EP2 receptors occurs primarily through a PKA-dependent pathway, whereas EP4 receptors activate Tcf/Lef signaling mainly through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. This is the first indication of a fundamental difference in the signaling potential of EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors. Recently we have shown that the FPB prostanoid receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that couples to Gαq, activates T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef)-mediated transcriptional activation (Fujino, H., and Regan, J.

T-cell factor G-protein-coupled receptor lymphoid enhancer factor glycogen synthase kinase 3 cAMP-dependent protein kinase A prostaglandin E2 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid human immunodeficiency virus bovine serum albumin An exciting connection is starting to emerge between the T-cell factor (Tcf)1/β-catenin signaling pathway and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The potential for G-proteins to mediate this connection was suggested recently when it was shown that constitutively active Gα12 and Gα13 can interact with E-cadherin to cause the release of β-catenin and subsequent stimulation of Tcf/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef) transcriptional activation (1Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that a chimeric receptor constructed from the ligand binding and transmembrane domains of the β2-adrenergic receptor and the cytoplasmic domains of rat Frizzled-1 can stimulate Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation through a mechanism that appears to involve signaling through Gαq and/or Gαo (2Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang H.Y. Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The first example of the activation of this signaling pathway by a wild type GPCR and its cognate ligand was recently made when we demonstrated that prostaglandin F2α acting through the FPBprostanoid receptor could decrease the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic β-catenin and stimulate Tcf/Lef-mediated transcriptional activation (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly the FPA isoform, which only differs from the FPB by having an additional 46 amino acids in its carboxyl terminus, was nearly inactive with respect to activation of β-catenin/Tcf signaling even though both isoforms can stimulate inositol phosphate signaling to a similar degree (4Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Hoyer P.B. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 883-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358PubMed Google Scholar). A key enzyme in the β-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). This enzyme, which forms a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli and axin, is responsible for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of cytosolic β-catenin. Direct inhibition of GSK-3 or disruption of the GSK-3-adenomatous polyposis coli-axin complex prevents the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic β-catenin resulting in stabilization and translocation to the nucleus where it can alter gene expression through interactions with members of the Tcf/Lef family of transcriptional factors (6Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 7Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). One well characterized mechanism for inhibiting the kinase activity of GSK-3 is through phosphorylation. For example stimulation of the frizzled receptor by the Wnt ligand leads to the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3β and thereby promotes β-catenin/Tcf signaling (7Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) can result in the phosphorylation and activation of Akt kinase (also known as protein kinase B) which can then phosphorylate and inhibit GSK-3β. More recently, it has been found in vitro that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can directly phosphorylate GSK-3β and inhibit its kinase activity (8Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 9Fang X. Yu S. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In addition it is known that PKA can indirectly phosphorylate and activate Akt kinase, which could provide an indirect mechanism for the inhibition of GSK-3β by PKA (10Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Given the ability of PKA to inhibit the activity of GSK-3, and the well known regulation of cAMP formation by GPCRs, we were interested in the potential activation of Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation by the EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors. The EP2 and EP4 receptors are two of the four subtypes of receptors for prostaglandin E2(PGE2) (11Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1479-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Both the EP2 and EP4 receptors are coupled to Gαs and can activate adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP formation. Prior to the molecular cloning of these receptors, it was thought that the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by PGE2 was mediated by a single EP receptor subtype. Molecular cloning revealed, however, two receptor subtypes that were the products of separate genes (13Regan J.W. Bailey T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M. Donello J.E. Fairbairn C.E. Kedzie K.M. Woodward D.F. Gil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). The EP2 and EP4 receptors encoded by these genes only shared ∼30% amino acid homology even though they shared the same endogenous ligand and apparent second messenger pathway. We now show that stimulation of EP2 receptors by PGE2can activate a Tcf/Lef signaling pathway by a mechanism that mainly involves the phosphorylation of GSK-3 by PKA. Stimulation of EP4 receptors by PGE2 can also activate a Tcf/Lef signaling pathway, but the mechanism is more complex and involves the activation of both PI3 kinase and PKA. Cell lines stably expressing the EP2 or EP4 receptors were prepared using HEK-293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen) and the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Briefly, DNA sequences corresponding to the encoding regions of the human EP2 receptor (13Regan J.W. Bailey T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M. Donello J.E. Fairbairn C.E. Kedzie K.M. Woodward D.F. Gil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar) and human EP4 receptor (14Bastien L. Sawyer N. Grygorczyk R. Metters K.M. Adam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11873-11877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into pCEP4, and 20 μg of each purified plasmid was used to transfect one 10-cm plate of HEK-293 EBNA cells. Selection with hygromycin B and clonal expansion were done as described previously in detail (15Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for the preparation of FP receptor-expressing cell lines. Clones expressing the human EP2 and EP4 receptor isoforms were identified based on immunofluorescence microscopy using EP2 and EP4 receptor-specific antibodies (16Anthony T.L. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 20: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 250 μg/ml geneticin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cells were cultured in 10-cm plates and were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with final concentrations of 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, vehicle) or 1 μm PGE2. They were then trypsinized, centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min, and resuspended at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in ice-cold MES buffer consisting of 10 mm MES (pH 6.0), 0.4 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MnCl2. [3H]PGE2 binding was performed using 100 μl of sample added to a final assay volume of 200 μl containing 2.5 nm [3H]PGE2 (Amersham Biosciences) or 2.5 nm [3H]PGE2plus increasing concentrations of unlabeled PGE2. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and were filtered through Whatman GF/C glass filters to terminate the incubation. Filters were then washed five times with ice-cold MES buffer, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were cultured in 10-cm plates and were washed once with fresh DMEM containing 0.1 mg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma). Cells were then treated with either vehicle or 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing isobutylmethylxanthine, after which the media were removed and the cells were placed on ice. One ml of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) was added, and the cells were scraped off and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were boiled for 8 min, placed on ice, and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. Fifty μl of the supernatants (representing ∼104 cells) was added to new tubes containing 50 μl of [3H]cAMP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 100 μl of 0.06 mg/ml PKA (Sigma product P5511). The mixture was vortexed and incubated on ice for 2 h, followed by the addition of 100 μl of TE buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 26 mg/ml powdered charcoal. After vortexing and centrifugation for 1 min at 14,000 rpm, 100-μl aliquots of the supernatants were removed for liquid scintillation. The amount of cAMP present was calculated from a standard curve prepared using cold cAMP and was expressed as pmol per 104 cells. Sixteen hours prior to the immunoblotting experiments, cells were switched from their regular culture medium to Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 250 μg/ml geneticin and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with this same media containing 1 μm PGE2 for the times indicated in the figures. In some cases cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or inhibitors (10 μm H-89, Calbiochem or 100 nm wortmannin, Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmdisodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots of the supernatants containing ∼100 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat milk for 1 h and were then washed and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in 0.5% non-fat milk containing either anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog number 9331), anti-phospho-GSK-3β antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog number 9336), anti-GSK-3β antibody (Transduction Laboratories, catalog number G22320), or 5% BSA containing anti-phospho-Akt 4E2 antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog number 9276) or 5% BSA containing anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog number 9272). All antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Membranes were washed three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 0.5% non-fat milk for GSK-3 antibodies or in 0.2% non-fat milk for Akt antibodies, with a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After washing three times, immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence as described previously (17Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To ensure equal loading of proteins, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-GSK-3β antibodies or anti-Akt antibodies under the same conditions as described above. Cells, grown in 6-well plates, were transiently transfected using FuGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1.25 μg/well of either the TOP flash or FOP flash reporter plasmids (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or inhibitors (10 μm H-89 or 100 nm wortmannin) for 15 min at 37 °C followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then rapidly washed three times each with 1 ml/well of Opti-MEM and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of Opti-MEM containing 250 μg/ml geneticin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Cell lysates were prepared and luciferase activity was measured using a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer as described previously (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of protein/sample. Measurements were corrected for background activity by subtraction of the FOP flash values from the corresponding TOP flash values. HEK cells stably expressing the human EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors were prepared and used for the characterization of the signal transduction properties of these receptors. Fig.1, panel A, shows the results for the competitive radioligand binding of [3H]PGE2 to untransfected HEK cells or to HEK cells stably transfected with either the human EP2 or human EP4 receptors. In the absence of pretreatment with PGE2 the EP2 and EP4receptor-transfected cell lines showed similar maximal levels of specific [3H]PGE2 binding that was more than 100 times the amount of specific [3H]PGE2binding to untransfected HEK cells (HEK, 0.86 ± 0.39 fmol/mg protein; EP2, 122.60 ± 15.90 fmol/mg protein; EP4, 112.37 ± 5.57 fmol/mg protein). Although the EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cells showed similar levels of maximal specific binding, their affinity for PGE2 differed. Thus, EP4 receptor-transfected cells had 7-fold greater affinity for PGE2(EC50, 2.8 ± 1.6 nm) as compared with EP2 receptor-transfected cells (EC50, 19 ± 7.5 nm). Pretreatment of the cells with 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h followed by wash-out decreased the whole cell specific binding of [3H]PGE2 by 66% in EP4receptor-transfected cells but only decreased binding by 34% in EP2 receptor-transfected cells. EP2 and EP4 receptors are Gαs-coupled receptors and are known to activate adenylyl cyclase; therefore, the ability of PGE2 to stimulate cAMP formation was examined in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1, panel B, treatment of untransfected HEK cells with 1 μmPGE2 for 1 h had negligible effects on cAMP formation as compared with treatment with vehicle; however, in EP2receptor-transfected cells there was a 71-fold stimulation and in EP4 receptor-transfected cells a 10-fold stimulation of cAMP formation following treatment with PGE2 as compared with the vehicle control. It is notable that the maximal levels of cAMP formation for the EP4 receptor-transfected cells are so much lower as compared with the EP2 receptor-transfected cells even though both receptors are expressed at similar levels and the affinity of PGE2 is significantly higher for EP4 receptors as compared with the EP2receptors. The kinase activities of GSK-3 and Akt have recently been shown to be regulated following in vitro phosphorylation by PKA (8Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 9Fang X. Yu S. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To explore the signaling potential between these kinases and the activation of adenylyl cyclase stimulatory GPCRs, we examined the PGE2-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3 and Akt in untransfected HEK cells and in HEK cells transfected with the human EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors. For these experiments (Fig. 2) cells were treated with 1 μm PGE2 for the times indicated and were then lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies that specifically recognized either GSK-3β or Akt, the phosphorylated forms of GSK-3 (pGSK-3α; pGSK-3β), or the phosphorylated form of Akt (pAkt). As shown in Fig. 2, panel A, in both EP2 and EP4receptor-transfected cells GSK-3α was phosphorylated within 5 min following exposure to PGE2 and remained phosphorylated for 60 min. The control HEK cells also showed some PGE2-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3α, but it was considerably weaker and may reflect the small amount of specific [3H]PGE2 binding that is present. Densitometric analysis of the phosphorylation of GSK-3α at 60 min, compared with time 0, showed a 7-fold increase in EP2receptor-transfected cells and a 4.5-fold increase in EP4receptor-transfected cells. To ensure equal loading of proteins, the blots shown in panel A were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to GSK-3β, and as shown in panel B nearly identical amounts of GSK-3β were present throughout the time course of treatment and among the three cell lines. Panel C shows the results obtained using antibodies directed against phospho-Akt. In all the cell lines there was a detectable level of phospho-Akt present at the zero time point, and in both the EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cell lines there was an increase in Akt phosphorylation after 60 min of treatment with PGE2. Densitometric analysis showed this to be ∼2-fold for both EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cells. To ensure equal loading of proteins, the blots shown in panel Cwere stripped and re-probed with antibodies to Akt, and as shown inpanel D similar amounts of Akt were present throughout the time course. In Fig. 2 we showed that the stimulation of EP2 and EP4 receptors by PGE2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of GSK-3α and Akt. Given that both of these receptors couple to Gαs and are known to activate cAMP/PKA signaling pathways, we decided to examine the effects of H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, on the PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3 and Akt in EP2 and EP4receptor-transfected cells. In addition, because phosphorylation of GSK-3 is known to stabilize β-catenin and promote Tcf/Lef-mediated transcriptional activation, we examined the potential of PGE2 to stimulate the luciferase activity in EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cells using a Tcf/Lef-responsive luciferase reporter gene. For these experiments the cell lines were pretreated with either vehicle or 10 μmH-89 for 15 min followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h. The upper part of Fig. 3 shows the results of immunoblot analysis that was done in the same manner as described for Fig. 2. Fig. 3, panel A, shows that following pretreatment of EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cells with H-89 there was a complete block of PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3α, suggesting the direct involvement of PKA in this process. There was also a notable decrease in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β following H-89 treatment in all the cell lines. On the other hand, Fig. 3, panel C, shows that H-89 pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of Akt and actually enhanced the PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in all the cell lines. The bottom part of Fig. 3 shows PGE2-stimulated Tcf/Lef luciferase reporter gene activity in untreated cells and in cells that were pretreated with H-89 under the same conditions as used above for the immunoblotting experiments. In the absence of H-89 pretreatment, 1 μmPGE2 produced a 12-fold stimulation of luciferase activity in EP2 receptor-transfected cells and a 7-fold stimulation in EP4 receptor-transfected cells over the vehicle-treated controls. After pretreatment with H-89, however, PGE2-stimulated luciferase activity was decreased by 65% in EP2 receptor-transfected cells but was only decreased by 20% in EP4 receptor-transfected cells. Therefore, H-89 inhibited PGE2-stimulated Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity much more effectively in EP2 receptor-transfected cells as compared with EP4 receptor-transfected cells, even though it was equally effective at blocking GSK-3α phosphorylation in both cell lines. The results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that the phosphorylation of Akt following PGE2 treatment of EP2 and EP4 receptor-expressing cells is not a direct effect of PKA and suggest the involvement of additional kinases. One such candidate is PI3 kinase because Akt is known to have roles both in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and as a substrate for PI3 kinase. Therefore, we examined the effects of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3 kinase, on the PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3 and Akt and on the PGE2 stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity in EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cells. For these experiments the cells were pretreated with either vehicle or 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 μm PGE2for 1 h. The upper part of Fig.4 shows the results of immunoblot analysis that was done in the same manner as described in Figs. 2 and3. Fig. 4, panel A, shows that wortmannin pretreatment decreased the phosphorylation of GSK-3α in the vehicle-treated cells and produced a marked 62% inhibition of PGE2-stimulated GSK-3α phosphorylation in the EP4 receptor-transfected cells, but only a modest 14% inhibition in the EP2receptor-transfected cells. In addition wortmannin pretreatment inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK-3β in all the cell lines and, most interestingly, revealed a clear PGE2-dependent stimulation of GSK-3β phosphorylation in both the EP2 and EP4receptor-transfected cells. Fig. 4, panel C, shows that wortmannin pretreatment abolished both the basal and PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in all the cell lines. The bottom part of Fig. 4 shows PGE2-stimulated Tcf/Lef luciferase reporter gene activity in untreated cells and in cells that were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin as above. The data for untreated cells are the same as that shown in Fig. 3 and shown the robust PGE2stimulation of luciferase activity in both the EP2 and EP4 receptor-transfected cells. In a clear distinction from the results obtained with H-89, however, pretreatment with wortmannin produced a significantly greater inhibition of PGE2-stimulated Tcf/Lef reporter luciferase activity in EP4 receptor-transfected cells (61%) as compared with the inhibition obtained in EP2 receptor-transfected cells (27%). These findings suggest a significant PI3 kinase-mediated contribution to the PGE2 stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity in the EP4 receptor-transfected cells. The EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors are GPCRs that are linked to the stimulation of cAMP/PKA signaling through the sequential activation of Gαs and adenylyl cyclase. PGE2 is the endogenous ligand for both of these receptors and the fact that these receptors represented two unique subtypes were not fully appreciated until the molecular cloning of the EP2 receptor in 1994 (13Regan J.W. Bailey T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M. Donello J.E. Fairbairn C.E. Kedzie K.M. Woodward D.F. Gil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the pharmacology of this receptor with a previously cloned adenylyl cyclase stimulatory EP receptor led to recognition of the EP4 subtype (7Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 8Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Structurally, these receptors have less in common than one might think given their similarities with respect to ligand binding and second messenger coupling. The EP4 receptor is bigger, 488 amino acids versus 358, most of which is accounted for by a significantly longer carboxyl-terminal domain, 155 amino acidsversus 34. It is of considerable interest to understand the physiological and/or pathophysiological significance of the EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors. Nishigaki et al. (18Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar) have found that these subtypes differ with respect to agonist-mediated desensitization. Thus, when transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells the EP4 subtype underwent short term desensitization in response to treatment with PGE2, whereas the EP2 receptor did not. Related to this, Desai et al. (19Desai S. April H. Nwaneshiudu C. Ashby B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) found that when transfected into HEK cells the EP4 receptor underwent rapid agonist-mediated internalization, and again, the EP2 did not. In the present study we have also found that the EP4 receptor subtype is much more sensitive to the regulatory effects of agonist exposure and that pretreatment with 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h decreased EP4 receptor number by ∼70%, but only decreased EP2 receptor number by ∼30%. Rapid desensitization may also partially account for the markedly lower amount of agonist-stimulated cAMP formation in EP4receptor-transfected cells as compared with EP2receptor-transfected cells. Thus, the maximal level of PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation in EP4receptor-transfected cells was only ∼20% that achieved in EP2 receptor-transfected cells, even though both receptors were expressed to nearly the same extent prior to agonist pretreatment. However, more rapid desensitization of the EP4 receptor is not the only explanation for its lower stimulation of cAMP formation. It is plausible that EP4 receptors are less efficiently coupled to adenylyl cyclase and/or they have additional pathways of signal transduction that do not involve the activation of cAMP/PKA signaling. A major signaling pathway, which until recently was thought to be relatively unaffected by events in the cAMP/PKA pathway, is the Wnt signaling pathway. As reviewed in the Introduction, an important control point in this pathway involves the phosphorylation of GSK-3 which can serve to inhibit its kinase activity and promote β-catenin stabilization and Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation. There are two isoforms of GSK-3 designated as GSK-3α (51 kDa) and GSK-3β (47 kDa). At the amino acid level they share 85% homology, and both are phosphorylated by Akt as a consequence of Wnt signaling, at serine 9 in GSK-3β and at serine 21 in GSK-3α (20Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). PKA has been shown recently (8Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 9Fang X. Yu S. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) to phosphorylate GSK-3β and GSK-3α at these same positions leading to the possibility of cross-talk between the Wnt and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. A second mechanism for such cross-talk has been described in which PKA can indirectly activate Akt resulting in the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3 (10Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In our studies we have shown that the activation of the adenylyl cyclase stimulatory EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors leads to a rapid (within 5 min) agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3α and a slower agonist-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. Interestingly, the PKA inhibitor H-89 completely blocked the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3α, but it actually enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting that the phosphorylation of GSK-3α is mediated directly by PKA, whereas the phosphorylation of Akt is mediated by another kinase that is negatively regulated by PKA. This other kinase is likely to be PI3 kinase, which is corroborated by our finding that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3 kinase, completely blocked the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. Given the effects of EP2 and EP4 receptor activation on the phosphorylation of GSK-3α, it is not surprising that we observed a stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity following the incubation of these receptors with PGE2. What is surprising, however, is that the maximal stimulation of reporter gene activity is the same, or even higher, for the EP4receptor as compared with the EP2 receptor, even though the EP4 receptor only yielded ∼20% of the maximal amount of cAMP formation as that obtained with the EP2 receptor. Furthermore, PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3α in EP2 receptor-transfected cells was approximately twice that obtained in EP4 receptor-transfected cells, suggesting that the stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity should have been significantly greater for the EP2 receptor. It is very relevant, therefore, that H-89 only inhibited PGE2-stimulated reporter gene activity by ∼20% in EP4 receptor-transfected cells in contrast to the 65% inhibition obtained in EP2 receptor-transfected cells. Given the similar maximal stimulation of reporter gene activity by these receptors, the 20% inhibition of activity obtained with H-89 for the EP4 receptor is exactly as one would predict based upon the relative ability of these receptors to stimulate cAMP formation and strongly suggests that stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity by the EP4 receptor involves an additional signaling pathway. As suggested above, based upon the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by wortmannin, this additional pathway appears to involve PI3 kinase. This premise is also supported by the differential effects of wortmannin on PGE2-stimulated Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity. Thus, in contrast to the results obtained with H-89, wortmannin had nearly the opposite effect and inhibited agonist-stimulated reporter gene activity to a much greater extent in EP4 receptor-transfected cells than in EP2 receptor-transfected cells. The putative involvement of PI3 kinase with EP4 receptor signaling is further supported by the more obvious time course and extent of phosphorylation of Akt following the treatment of EP4receptor-transfected cells with PGE2 (cf. Fig.2). Therefore, although the phosphorylation of GSK-3α by activation of EP4 receptors is entirely dependent on cAMP/PKA, the stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity primarily involves activation of PI3 kinase and Akt. In contrast, both the phosphorylation of GSK-3α and the stimulation of reporter gene activity by EP2 receptor activation are primarily dependent on cAMP/PKA. One apparent discrepancy in our data, with respect to the putative involvement of PI3 kinase and Akt in the stimulation of Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity by the activation of EP4 receptors, is that we did not observe enhanced phosphorylation of either GSK-3α or GSK-3β following pretreatment of EP4-expressing cells with H-89 (cf. Fig. 3). Thus, it would be reasonable to expect that one of these isoforms would show increased phosphorylation given the observed increase in Tcf/Lef reporter gene activity. This apparent discrepancy may be explained, however, by the 16-h time differential between the measurement of GSK-3 phosphorylation and the assay of luciferase reporter gene activity. Thus, GSK-3 phosphorylation is measured immediately after the 1-h incubation with PGE2, whereas the reporter gene activity is measured 16 h after PGE2 treatment and washout. (Attempts to measure luciferase activity immediately after PGE2 treatment were unsuccessful presumably because of the time required for de novosynthesis of the enzyme.) During this time it was therefore possible that in EP4-expressing cells there was a prolonged stimulation of Akt phosphorylation that resulted in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and activation of Tcf/Lef signaling. As to why this is only observed in EP4-expressing cells may be related to the greater desensitization and internalization of the EP4receptor as compared with the EP2 receptor (18Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 19Desai S. April H. Nwaneshiudu C. Ashby B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is supported by our studies of the FP prostanoid receptor isoforms. Thus, as compared with the FPA isoform, the FPBisoform shows a markedly greater degree of functional desensitization of phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling (17Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and in this way resembles the differences between the EP2 and EP4 receptors. Interestingly, relative to the FPA isoform, the FPB isoform shows significantly prolonged activation of cellular shape change and activation of Tcf/Lef signaling following the removal of agonist (3Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also possible, however, that there is a PI3 kinase-dependent, but GSK-3-independent, pathway leading to the activation of Tcf/Lef signaling, and further work will be needed to clarify these mechanisms. Our present findings clearly establish the potential for the activation of novel signaling pathways by the EP2 and EP4prostanoid receptors. Ultimately, this potential will need to be realized in a more physiological setting; however, there is evidence to suggest that such pathways may operate in vivo, particularly as it concerns the effects of PGE2 on the immune system. For example, it is known that PGE2 acting through an EP4 receptor enhances the transcriptional activation that occurs during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (21Dumais N. Barbeau B. Olivier M. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27306-27314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HIV-long terminal repeat that drives this transcriptional activity contains a TCF-1α consensus region (22Zhang L. Huang Y. Yuan H. Chen B.K. Ip J. Ho D.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) offering a possible mechanism by which EP4 receptor activation could modulate HIV-long terminal repeat transcriptional activity. Another effect of PGE2 on immune system function, which is known to involve the activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors, concerns isotype switching and clonal expansion of B lymphocytes (23Hwang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These processes, which essentially represent cellular differentiation and proliferation, have been associated with increases in cAMP formation, but the downstream signaling pathways specifically mediating these effects are still obscure. Direct or synergistic influences of EP2 and/or EP4 receptor activation on PKA, GSK-3, PI3 kinase, and Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation would be compatible with potential regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2098782131,"Exposure of cells to a wide variety of chemoprotective compounds confers resistance to a broad set of carcinogens. For a subset of the chemoprotective compounds, protection is generated by an increase in the abundance of the protective phase II detoxification enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST). We have recently developed a cell culture system, using rat liver epithelial RL 34 cells, that potently responds to the phenolic antioxidants resulting in the induction of GST activity (Kawamoto, Y., Nakamura, Y., Naito, Y., Torii, Y., Kumagai, T., Osawa, T., Ohigashi, H., Satoh, K., Imagawa, M., and Uchida, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 11291–11299.) In the present study, we investigated the phase II-inducing potency of an isothiocyanate compound in vitro and in vivo and examined a possible induction mechanism. Based on an extensive screening of vegetable extracts for GST inducer activity in RL34 cells, we found Japanese horseradish, wasabi (Wasabia japonica, syn. Eutrema wasabi), as the richest source and identified 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC), an analogue of sulforaphane (4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate) isolated from broccoli, as the major GST inducer in wasabi. 6-HITC potently induced both class α GSTA1 and class π GSTP1 isozymes in RL34 cells. In animal experiments, we found that 6-MSHI was rapidly absorbed into the body and induced hepatic phase II detoxification enzymes more potently than sulforaphane. The observations that (i) 6-HITC activated the antioxidant response element (ARE), (ii) 6-HITC induced nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nrf2 that binds to ARE, and (iii) the induction of phase II enzyme genes by 6-HITC was completely abrogated in the nrf2-deficient mice, suggest that 6-HITC is a potential activator of the Nrf2/ARE-dependent detoxification pathway."

We demonstrate that MD-2 contains 2N-glycosylated sites at positions Asn26 and Asn114, whereas the amino-terminal ectodomain of human TLR4 contains 9 N-linked glycosylation sites. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that cell surface expression of MD-2 did not depend on the presence of either N-linked site, whereas in contrast, TLR4 mutants carrying substitutions in Asn526 or Asn575 failed to be transported to the cell surface. Using a UV-activated derivative of Re595 LPS (ASD-Re595 LPS) in cross-linking assays, we demonstrated a critical role of MD-2 and TLR4 carbohydrates in LPS cross-linking to the LPS receptor. The ability of the various glycosylation mutants to support cell activation was also evaluated in transiently transfected HeLa cells. The double mutant of MD-2 failed to support LPS-induced activation of an interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter-driven luciferase reporter to induce IL-8 secretion or to activate amino-terminal c-Jun kinase (JNK). Similar results were observed with TLR4 mutants lacking three or more N-linked glycosylation sites. Surprisingly, the reduction in activation resulting from expression of the Asn mutants of MD-2 and TLR4 can be partially reversed by co-expression with CD14.

Myc-CD14 was generated by the addition of a Myc sequence at amino terminus of CD14 into the pCMV1 plasmid containing a preprotrypsin-leading sequence. The cDNA for human amino-terminal FLAG-tagged TLR4 was a gift from Dr. C. Janeway. Myc-TLR4 was generated by the addition of a Myc sequence at carboxyl terminus of TLR4. Expression vector for FLAG-MD-2 was engineered by introducing aNotI/SmaI DNA fragment into pFLAG-CMV1 plasmid in which the preprotrypsin leader sequence precedes an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope. Carboxyl-terminal Myc-tagged MD-2 was cloned by introducing a BamHI/SmaI fragment into pALTER (Promega, Madison, WI). FLAG-JNK1 was expressed from a pCMV5 plasmid. A 220-nucleotide fragment of the human IL-8 promoter (nucleotides 1308–1526 in GenBankTM accession number M28130) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 5′-ATCCTCGAGAACTTTCGTCATACTCCG-3′ and 5′-TACCTTCACACAGAGCTGCAGAAAT-3′. The XhoI/HindIII fragment, containing the promoter and transcriptional start, was subcloned in pGL3 vector (Promega). Asn/Ala mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with the overlapping extension method by PCR using wt TLR4 or MD-2 DNA templates. Oligonucleotides were designed to replace Asn residues with Ala residues at positions Asn35, Asn173, Asn205, Asn282, Asn309, Asn497, Asn526, Asn575, and Asn624 in human TLR4 DNA and at positions Asn26 and Asn114 in human MD-2 DNA. Single-site mutations were first constructed. Multiple-site mutants were constructed progressively. The nomenclature used for TLR4 mutants is the following: mut 1.1, TLR4N35A; mut 1.2, TLR4N173A; mut 1.3, TLR4N205A; mut 1.4, TLR4N282A; mut 1.5, TLR4N309A; mut 1.6, TLR4N497A; mut 1.7, TLR4N526A; mut 1.8, TLR4N575A; mut 1.9, TLR4N624A; mut 2.1, TLR4N35,173A; mut 2.2, TLR4N173,309A; mut 2.3, TLR4N309,497A; mut 2.4, TLR4N497A,N575A; mut 2.5, TLR4N575A,N526A; mut 3.1, TLR4N35A,N173A,N205A; mut 3.2, TLR4N173A,N282A,N309A; mut 3.3, TLR4N497A,N526A,N575A; mut 3.4, TLR4N526A,N575A,N624A; mut 4.1, TLR4N173A,N205A,N282A,N309A; mut 4.2, TLR4N497A,N526A,N575A,N624A; mut 5, TLR4N35A,N173A,N205A,N282A,N309A; mut 9, TLR4N35A,N173A,N205A,N282A,N309A,N497A,N526A,N575A,N624A. The nucleotide sequences were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. 293 cells cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes were transfected and harvested 2 days after transfection. Cells were washed twice with 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5% endotoxin-free human bovine serum albumin (Serologicals Proteins Inc., Kankakee, IL). LBP·LPS complexes were formed and utilized as previously described. Briefly, 25 μg/ml recombinant LBP and 2.5 μg/ml125I-ASD-Re595 LPS were incubated in a solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, for 10 min at 37 °C. LBP·LPS complexes were added to cells, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and photolysed with a 253-nm UV light for 4 min on ice. A typical incubation reaction contained a final concentration of 250 ng/ml Re595 LPS and 2.5 μg/ml recombinant LBP. Cells were washed extensively and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 14 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmsodium orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mm sodium fluoride. After incubation for 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were recovered. Cell lysates were pre-cleared three times for 20 min at 4 °C with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and mixed with 30 μg of M2 monoclonal antibody for 3 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Immune complexes were allowed to bind to 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the washed beads were resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots from 20 μl of the original mixtures were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody for 2 h and with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at ambient temperature. Specific bands were revealed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Aliquots of 80 μl of immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and incorporated125I was revealed and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 293 cells were transfected and harvested 2 days after transfection. Cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and separated into aliquots. Immune complexes were boiled in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 10 min in the presence of 1% 2-β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5% SDS. N-Linked carbohydrates were removed by treatment with 50 units/ml peptideN-glycosidase F, Flavobacterium meningosepticum), or endoglycosidase H (Streptomyces plicatus) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To cleave potential O-linked sugars, immune complexes were treated with 0.1 unit/ml O-glycosidase (Diplococcus pneumoniae, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were performed for 2 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and transfected with the indicated plasmids together with pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 2 days. Subsequently, cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.1% NaN3, and incubated with anti-FLAG or HTA125 (10 μg/ml each) for 45 min at 4 °C. After 2 washes, cells were labeled for 45 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Cells were then washed twice and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). HeLa cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and transfected with 50 ng of IL-8 promoter-driven luciferase reporter and 10 ng of indicated plasmids. A pCMV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (50 ng) was used for normalizing transfection efficiencies. 18 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with Re595 LPS for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from Promega. Luciferase activity was measured using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). For β-galactosidase assays, an aliquot of the cell extracts was incubated in 200 μl of Z buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and 40 μl of 4 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 300 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at A420 nm. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. The concentration of IL-8 in the culture supernatants of transfected HeLa cells was measured by ELISA using 96-well Immulon plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). ELISA was performed using the monoclonal antibody MAB208 for capture and a biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL-8 Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by streptavidin horseradish peroxidase for detection. ELISA was developed using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate, and the optical density was determined at a wavelength of 490 nm using a Spectramax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All values were interpolated from a semi-log fit of a curve generated from IL-8 standards. The cDNA sequence for MD-2 predicts a protein with a mass of 16 kDa. However, when lysates from transfected 293 cells expressing FLAG-MD-2 were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, we observed that MD-2 migrates as a protein triplet of ∼26, 20, and 16 kDa (Fig.1A, lane 1). It is important to note that the 26-kDa form of MD-2 is found just below a band appearing in all lanes (Fig. 1, A and B) with a slightly slower mobility; this is the antibody light chain present in the immunoprecipitates. To determine whether the apparent heterogeneity of MD-2 results from glycosylation of MD-2 onN- or O-linked sites, the following experiment was performed. 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-MD-2, and immunoprecipitates were prepared with anti-FLAG antibody as described and either left untreated or treated with endoglycosidase H, peptideN-glycosidase F, or O-glycosidase followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Treatment with endoglycosidase H (EndoH, Fig. 1A, lane 2) and peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase, Fig. 1A,lane 3) but not with O-glycosidase treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 4) produced a protein with a mobility of 16 kDa. This apparent molecular mass is consistent with the predicted mass of the MD-2 polypeptide and supports our contention that there are N-linked carbohydrate residues on MD-2. To further support this contention we analyzed the MD-2 amino acid sequence and found two asparagines (Asn) within potential consensus sequences for N-glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). These Asn residues were replaced with Ala; single mutations of Asn26 or Asn114 produced two proteins of 20 and 16 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), whereas mutation of both residues resulted in expression of a protein with an apparent mass of 16 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 5). The 26-kDa form observed with wild-type MD-2 disappeared with each of the three mutants examined. It is interesting to note that overexpression of MD-2N114A resulted in a predominant band of 20 kDa, suggesting that this mutant is entirely monoglycosylated. These results further support our contention that MD-2 has two majorN-linked glycosylation sites; we have identified these sites as Asn26 and Asn114. Similarly, to evaluate the contribution of glycosylation to TLR4, FLAG immunoprecipitates from lysates of 293 cells transfected with FLAG-TLR4 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after glycosidase treatment. The recombinant FLAG-TLR4 has an apparent mass of 120 kDa; this is reduced by ∼30 kDa in the presence of endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase, Fig.2A). In contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of TLR4 remained unchanged in the presence ofO-glycosidase. These data are consistent with the presence of N-linked carbohydrate chains in TLR4. To identify which of the nine potential sites within TLR4 are glycosylated, the primary sequence was scanned for appropriate Asn residues, and various single and multiple Asn → Ala mutants were generated. All mutant receptors were generated using wild-type TLR4 with a FLAG moiety at the amino-terminal end. Each of the single Asn → Ala mutants had electrophoretic mobilities that were slightly reduced when compared with wt TLR4, suggesting that each site was likely to be substituted (Fig. 2B). Multiple-site mutations of Asn to Ala produced proteins with electrophoretic mobilities consistent with a lower apparent molecular weight. A mutant with all nine Asn residues mutated to Ala had the fastest mobility in SDS-PAGE, which is consistent with the predicted 90-kDa mass of TLR4 protein. MD-2 is a secreted protein that is found at the cell surface via its interactions with TLR4. Thus, we asked whether the cell surface expression of the MD-2 mutants depends on the presence of the N-linked glycosylation sites. 293 cells were transiently transfected with wt or mutant FLAG-MD-2. Flow cytometry analysis using anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated that all mutants were weakly detected at the cell surface of 293 cells (data not shown). The weak surface expression detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for wt MD-2 and its mutants is likely to be explained by the lack of co-expressed molecules such as TLR4, which act as binding partners for MD-2. This is supported by our findings that wt and mutant forms of MD-2 are detected in supernatants of transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, an additional band of about 30 kDa could be detected in cultured medium but not in cellular extracts of 293 cells transfected with wt MD-2. The exact biochemical differences accounting for the slower migrating form of MD-2 cannot at present be explained. It is interesting to note that although deglycosylated MD-2 protein levels were similar in the presence or absence of TLR4 co-expression in cellular extracts, the amount of wt MD-2 and MD-2 mutants detected in supernatants when co-expressed with TLR4 were dramatically reduced, probably due to the interaction with TLR4 (Fig. 3A,bottom panel). The totality of these data support the contention that MD-2 glycosylation is not crucial for cell surface expression and secretion of MD-2 in the absence or presence of TLR4. The next series of experiments were performed to determine the role of the N-linked sugars on one aspect of the functional integrity of the LPS receptor complex. We have previously described the use of a radioiodinated, cross-linkable derivative of Re595 LPS (125I-ASD-Re595 LPS) to show that LPS is in close proximity to the protein components of the LPS receptor, CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 (15da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). This assay was used to evaluate the role of theN-linked glycosylation sites in MD-2 and TLR4 in forming an LPS receptor complex where LPS is in close proximity to these same proteins components. To assess the role of the N-linked glycosylation sites in MD-2, we used 293 cells expressing CD14, TLR4, and either wt or mutants of MD-2 lacking one or both of the Asn residues encoding N-linked sites. Control experiments revealed essentially equivalent levels of expression of wt and the three mutant forms of MD-2 (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Both of the monoglycosylated forms of MD-2 were radiolabeled by Re595 LPS, similarly to what we observed with wt MD-2. (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 2 and3). In contrast, no binding was detected with the double mutant of MD-2 (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 4). In the same experiment we observed that the two monoglycosylated mutants were sufficient to support binding of Re595 LPS to TLR4, although at a somewhat lower level (Fig. 3B,upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, no LPS association with TLR4 was detected in the presence of the MD-2 double mutant. We and others have shown that co-expression of MD-2 with TLR4 enhanced expression of cell surface TLR4 (15da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To examine whether complete glycosylation of MD-2 was necessary for this effect, we compared TLR4 expression in the presence of wt and mutant MD-2 (Fig.4). The expression of TLR4 was identical with all forms of MD-2, supporting the contention that itsN-linked carbohydrates are not required for the enhanced cell surface expression of TLR4. Because the N-linked carbohydrates of membrane and secreted proteins are important protein modifications often involved in processing and cell surface expression, we next determined their role in TLR4 expression. To verify the subcellular localization of TLR4 mutant receptors, their expression was monitored in HeLa cells by flow cytometry analysis using a monoclonal FLAG antibody and the anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody HTA125. Of the 9 single TLR4 mutants, only receptors lacking Asn526 or Asn575 were not detected on the cell surface of HeLa cells. In contrast these proteins could be detected by immunoblotting (TableI and Fig. 2). These data suggest that at least two specific mutations result in impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane and suggest that they might be sequestered to the endoplasmic reticulum. None of the multiple Asn mutants generated containing either one of these mutations could be detected at the plasma membrane. Point mutations of the other Asn did not alter the cell surface expression of TLR4, as detected by flow cytometry.Table ITLR4 N-linked glycosylations are required for cell surface expression and binding of LPSTLR4 mutationsNameEffectsCell surface expressionLPS cross-linking to TLR4LPS cross-linking to MD-2TLR4 wtwt+++++++++TLR4N35Amut 1.1+++++++++TLR4N497Amut 1.6+++++++++TLR4N526Amut 1.7−−−TLR4N575Amut 1.8−−−TLR4N624Amut 1.9+++++++++TLR4N35A,N173Amut 2.1+++++++TLR4N497A,N575Amut 2.4−−−TLR4N35A,N173A,N205Amut 3.1+++++TLR4N497A,N526A,N575Amut 3.3−−−TLR4N173A,N205A,N282A,N309Amut 4.1++−−TLR4N497A,N526A,N575A,N624Amut 4.2−−−TLR4N35A,N173A,N205A,N282A,N309Amut 5++−−293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding for CD14 and FLAG-MD-2 in the presence of wt FLAG-TLR4 or specified mutants and cultured for 2 days.

Table I summarizes all of the experimental results obtained when expression of wt TLR4 and some of the mutant receptors were compared (experimental data not shown). Single mutants that were expressed at the cell surface had the same LPS binding characteristics as wt TLR4. We failed to observe binding of LPS to TLR4N526A and TLR4N575A, the two mutations that prevented cell surface expression of TLR4. Although the absence of only one glycan seemed not to affect binding of LPS to TLR4, mutants lacking two or more glycans lost the ability to interact with LPS. For instance, mut 4.1 and mut 5 were unable to cross-link LPS despite expression of the receptors at the cell surface. Surprisingly, loss of TLR4 glycans seemed to also affect binding of LPS to MD-2. Thus, like MD-2, TLR4 glycans seem to play a key role in the binding of LPS to the TLR4·MD-2 complex. We then asked whether the MD-2 glycans play any role in the formation of a TLR4·MD-2 complex on the cell surface. 293 cells were transfected with Myc-TLR4 in the presence or absence of FLAG-tagged wt and mutant MD-2 and cultured for 2 days.

The AtNHX1 and ScNHX1 proteins are most closely related to isoforms NHE6 and NHE7, thus confirming a novel family of organellar or endosomal antiporters (8Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Girisafi P.

Both NHX1 proteins impart tolerance to Na+ and Li+ through ion sequestration inside vacuoles, but they also mediate resistance to other toxic cations such as TMA+or hygromycin B (8Gaxiola R.A. Rao R.

Moreover, ScNHX1 was required for yeast tolerance to acute hypertonic shock, and AtNHX1 mRNA accumulated in plants treated with KCl (8Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Girisafi P. Alpher S.L. Fink G.R.

These findings have raised questions on the specificity of cation transport by NHX exchangers that need to be addressed. In contrast to their animal counterparts, structural or functional studies on the only recently cloned plant and fungal antiporters are just starting. Biochemical approaches have to be adopted to progress in the understanding of the structure-function relationships and regulations of the NHX-like transporters. Such studies are most conveniently done using highly purified protein. In this paper we describe a method for the purification of the ArabidopsisNa+/H+ antiporter AtNHX1 by Ni2+affinity chromatography. The purified protein could be functionally reconstituted into liposomes, and its transport characteristics could be determined. Contrary to most NHE transporters, high transport activity could be measured in the presence of K+. The monovalent cations Li+ and Cs+ were also transported with lower affinity, whereas TMA+1 was not a substrate. This procedure will permit a detailed description of structure-function relationships of the protein as well as identification of regulatory mechanisms and protein-protein interactions. A RGSH6 histidine tag was inserted into the yeast multicopy vector pMP658, a derivative of YEp351 containing the yeast PMA1 promoter and transcriptional terminator (20Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For this, oligonucleotides with sequence 5′-TCGAGGATCGCATCACCATCACCATCACTGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGTTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCC-3′ (reverse), encoding a RGSH6 tag followed by a stop codon after the last histidine and flanked by XhoI and SpeI restriction sites, were ligated between the PMA1 promoter and terminator of pMP658, resulting in plasmid pKV61. The AtNHX1 gene was amplified from plasmid pAtNHX1-1 (17Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), using a forward primer 5′-GCTATCTCGAGCAATGTTGGATTCT-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-GCCGCTCGAGCCTTACTAAGAT-3′, resulting in a sequence with two terminalXhoI sites and without stop codon at the C-terminal end. This AtNHX1 fragment was ligated into plasmid pKV61, giving rise to plasmid pKV62. The construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. For yeast complementation tests, theAtNHX1:RGSH6 allele was subcloned in pDR195 (21Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), producing plasmid pAtNHX1-H6. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or SDA (0.7% Difco nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with 40 μg/ml adenine, 50 mm succinic acid with Tris, pH 5.5, and 2% glucose or galactose). To assess the functionality of the wild type and histidine-tagged AtNHX1 proteins, plasmids pAtNHX1-1 and pAtNHX1-H6 were transformed into the S. cerevisiae W303–1B derivative AXT3K (Matα leu2-13, 112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1 can1-100 Δnhx1::KanMX Δnha1::LEU2 Δena1-4::HIS3) lacking the endogenous NHX1 protein, as well as the plasma membrane efflux transporters NHA1 and ENA1–4. Yeast transformants were grown in selective SDA-glucose medium to saturation. This preculture was diluted 50-fold, after which 10 μl of serial (10−1) dilutions were spotted on YPD plates with 25 μg/ml hygromycin B or AP medium supplemented with 1 mm KCl and 50 mm NaCl (17Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Growth was recorded after incubation for 3 days at 30 °C. For protein purification, pKV62 was transformed into strain RS72 (Mata ade1-100 his4-519 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 pma1::[Yip5 GAL1:PMA1]) (22Cid A. Perona R. Serrano R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A saturated 3-ml preculture in SDA-galactose was made starting from a fresh colony of transformed cells. 500 μl of this preculture was transferred to 600 ml of SDA-galactose and grown at 30 °C to saturation (A660 nm = 5.0). This culture was then inoculated into 6 liters of YPD medium and grown for 20 h. The cells were harvested, and the microsomes were isolated as described (23Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The microsomal membrane fraction (4 ml, 5 mg protein/ml) was mixed with 20 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 0.5%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C under gentle shaking. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 × g (Sorvall SS34 rotor). The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of Pentadentate Chelator resin charged with Ni2+ (Affiland) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle stirring. The resin was then poured into a polypropylene column and prewashed with 3 × 4 ml of buffer A, 3 × 4 ml of buffer B, and 1 × 4 ml of buffer A (buffers supplemented with protease inhibitors as above and 0.15%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thereafter the protein was eluted with an imidazole step gradient of 8-ml fractions containing 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 1000 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, in 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.075% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purified protein eluted in the 100–200 mmimidazole fractions. Finally, the 200 mm fraction was concentrated to 500 μl using a centrifugal concentrator (Pall Microsep) with a 50-kDa cut-off. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Membrane fractions or purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide using the system of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (25Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 128: 302-311Google Scholar). After protein electrotransfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Gelman), the blot was incubated with a monoclonal antibody raised against the RGSH4 epitope (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For reconstitution of purified AtNHX1:RGSH6into artificial membranes, essentially the same protocol was used as previously developed for reconstitution of the purified His-tagged plasma membrane proton ATPase AHA2 (23Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein (4 μg) was mixed with soybean phospholipids type II-S (Sigma) at a lipid to protein ratio of 585 in a total volume of 208 μl of reconstitution buffer containing 20 mm BTP-MES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 2.5 mm pyranine (converted to BTP salt using Dowex 50WX8 ion exchange resin). The sample was solubilized by the addition of 12 μl of 1 m octylglucoside and loaded onto a 2.5-ml spin column filled with Sephadex G-50 (fine; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) preloaded with 200 μl of 2.5 mm pyranine in reconstitution buffer. After centrifugation for 5 min at 180 × g, the eluate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 mg of wet Biobeads (SM-2; Bio-Rad) and passed again over a G-50 spin column. Pyranine fluorescence was recorded at 463-nm excitation wavelength and 510-nm emission wavelength. Fluorescence of the sample was adjusted to adequate levels by diluting the sample with reconstitution buffer. Next, 50 μl of liposomes containing AtNHX1:RGSH6 were diluted in reconstitution buffer without (NH4)2SO4 in a 1-ml stirred reaction cuvette thermostated at 20 °C. The 20-fold NH4+ dilution resulted in acid loading of the vesicles because of outward diffusion of NH3 (26Nakamura T. Hsu T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 678-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting pH inside the vesicles determined from the fluorescence of pyranine was 6.6. Thereafter, infinite inward cation gradients were imposed by the addition of chloride salts at the outside of the vesicles. Proton efflux coupled to cation influx was monitored from the increase of pyranine fluorescence. The fluorescence signal was calibrated with pH as described (27Venema K. Gibrat R. Grouzis J.-P. Grignon C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and used to calculate the initial rate of pH variation after the addition of cations. An internal vesicle volume of 1.92 liters/mol corresponding to a radius of 30.5 nm was calculated from the fluorescence of entrapped pyranine using a surface area of 75 Å2 for one phospholipid molecule (28Gibrat R. Grignon C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 736: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and an approximate molecular mass of 1000 kDa for crude soybean phospholipids (27Venema K. Gibrat R. Grouzis J.-P. Grignon C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Pouliquin P. Grouzis J.-P. Gibrat R. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 360-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The net initial rate of proton efflux was calculated from the initial rate of pH variation as described (27Venema K. Gibrat R. Grouzis J.-P. Grignon C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Rossignol M. Thomas P. Grignon C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) correcting for the buffer capacity of 20 mm BTP-MES at the starting pH inside vesicles. The number of antiporter molecules/vesicle was estimated from the lipid to protein ratio used during the reconstitution, assuming a molecular mass of 50 kDa for the antiporter. The turnover rate of the antiporter (cycles·s−1) was calculated from the maximum proton flux and density of the antiporters, assuming the transport of 1 proton/cycle. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Concentration of purified protein was estimated from quantification of the intensity of the band on Coomassie-stained SDS gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard and Scion Image software (version 3.62, www.scioncorp.com). The AtNHX1 protein was tagged with a C-terminal RGSH6 tag. To test whether the tagged protein was still functional, yeast strain AXT3K, in which the endogenous Na+/H+ vacuolar antiporter geneNHX1 is disrupted, was transformed with a yeast multicopy vector containing the gene for the tagged protein or the wild type, nontagged protein. Both constructs restored tolerance to Na+ and hygromycin B when expressed in the nhx1deletion strain (Fig. 1). No phenotypic differences could be detected between both AtNHX1 recombinant proteins. Microsomal membranes were isolated from yeast cells expressing the tagged AtNHX1 protein or not. Although no extra protein bands could be observed on a Coomassie-stained gel of microsomes of the strain expressing the AtNHX1:RGSH6 protein, indicative of relatively low levels of expression, the tagged polypeptide was detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody raised against the RGSH4 epitope (Fig. 2) and with a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of AtNHX1 (data not shown and Ref. 17Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two cross-reactive bands were observed in microsomes, one of about 100 kDa and another broader band at ∼45–50 kDa (Fig. 2). The absence of a signal in control microsomes proved that the AtNHX1:RGSH6 protein was responsible for both bands. After solubilization of the microsomal membrane fraction, the 47-kDa band could be purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using the pentadentate metal-binding resin Pentadentate Chelator. From Western blotting experiments with the RGSH4 antibody, we determined that the highest amount of tagged polypeptide was bound to the resin using Ni2+ or Zn2+ ions (data not shown). Bound proteins were eluted from the resin using an imidazole step gradient. The AtNHX1:RGSH6 protein was recovered in the 100–200 mm imidazole fractions, as determined with the RGSH4 antibody (Fig. 3). Because purity of AtNHX1:RGSH6 was maximal in the 200 mm imidazole fraction, this was the source of recombinant protein for subsequent studies.Figure 3Purification of the AtNHX1-RGSH6protein by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Microsomal membranes were solubilized, and the proteins were bound to Pentadentate Chelator resin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions were eluted with indicated buffers, and the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid from aliquots before SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Lane FT, flow through fraction (100 μl); lane A, buffer A wash fraction (1 ml);lane B, buffer B wash fraction (1 ml); lanes 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 1000 indicate the millimolar concentration of the imidazole step gradient used for elution.Left panel, Coomassie-stained gel. Right panel, Western blot of the indicated fractions using the monoclonal antibody raised against the RGSH4 epitope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 200 mm imidazole fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the purified AtNHX1:RGSH6 protein was reconstituted in soybean phospholipid vesicles containing the pH indicator pyranine and in the presence of (NH4)2SO4. Dilution of the proteoliposomes in reconstitution buffer without (NH4)2SO4 resulted in an instantaneous fluorescence diminution of trapped pyranine, reflective of the internal acidification of the vesicles (Fig.4). The internal pH estimated from the ratio of fluorescence at 404 and 463 nm was 6.60 (Fig. 4, trace a). When vesicles were diluted in the presence of (NH4)2SO4 (no pH gradient), the internal pH as indicated from pyranine fluorescence was 7.55 (Fig. 4,trace b). The variation of pyranine fluorescence (pK 7.2) is approximately linear between pH 6.6 and 7.5 and therefore directly related to intravesicular pH changes (27Venema K. Gibrat R. Grouzis J.-P. Grignon C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cation/H+ exchange reaction was initiated upon the addition of monovalent cations (80 mm, Cl− salts), and the rate of pH variation inside the vesicles was estimated from the change in pyranine fluorescence (Fig.4). The most effective cations for dissipating the pH gradient were Na+ and K+. Li+ and Cs+were much less competent, and no recovery of the signal was observed using the organic cation TMA+. In control liposomes no significant recovery of pyranine fluorescence was observed upon the addition of these monovalent cations (data not shown). The addition of (NH4)2SO4 fully collapsed the pH gradient in both liposomes and proteoliposomes (Fig. 4). When transport measurements were made at equilibrium pH inside and outside the vesicles and in the presence of the permeant anion SCN−, the addition of KCl to the outside still caused intravesicular alkalinization in response to the inward K+ gradient (Fig.5). Vesicle alkalinization was abolished by addition of 10 μm benzamil, a potent inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiporters (Fig. 5). The ion exchange reaction showed a saturable kinetics with increasing cation concentrations (Fig. 6). In control liposomes, no significant ion exchange was observed even at the highest salt concentration used (Fig.7B and data not shown). The affinity of AtNHX1 for Na+ and K+ was similar, with apparent Km values of 42 and 45 mmrespectively. The affinity for Li+ was much lower, with aKm of about 226 mm. The maximum initial rate of vesicle alkalinization (Vmax) obtained from fitting the data in Fig. 6 was 5.90 × 10−3ΔpH·s−1 for Na+, which corresponds to 1.34 nmol H+·m−2·s−1, after calibrating the pyranine fluorescence signal with pH and correcting for buffer capacity and vesicle size as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.”Figure 7Inhibition of the cation/H+exchange reaction by EIPA. In proteoliposomes (A) and liposomes (B) the inhibition of the exchange reaction by the drug EIPA was assayed using K+ as substrate. The exchange reaction was initiated by adding 80 mm KCl (A,arrow 1) or 500 mm KCl (B,arrow 1). Maximal inhibition was observed by 30 μm EIPA (A, inset). The addition of the K+/H+ exchanger ionophore nigericin (arrow 2) resulted in a rapid augmentation of fluorescence that was not affected by EIPA. In control liposomes (B), the addition of 30 μm EIPA (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) in the presence of 500 mm KCl induced dissipation of the pH gradient as estimated from pyranine fluorescence, indicative of perturbation of the membrane permeability by EIPA. DMSO addition alone did not induce pH gradient dissipation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similarly to other NHE-like antiporters, AtNHX1 contains a conserved consensus sequence for amiloride binding, an inhibitor of these cation exchangers. Accordingly, activity of AtNHX1 in yeast vacuolar vesicles could be inhibited with amiloride (7Darley C.P. Wuytswinkel O.C.M. van der Woude K. Mager W.H. de Boer A.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Attempts to inhibit the proton exchange reaction in proteoliposomes with amiloride indicated that this drug strongly interfered with pyranine fluorescence at the concentration needed to inhibit the process (data not shown). However, the amiloride analogs ethylisopropyl-amiloride (EIPA), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (MIA), and benzamil could be used successfully together with pyranine to inhibit the exchange reaction at low inhibitor concentrations (TableI). The cation exchange reaction, using KCl salts, was inhibited by EIPA in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal 70% inhibition at 30 μm EIPA and a K0.5 of about 10 μm (Fig. 7). The addition of the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin collapsed the pH gradient, independently of the EIPA concentration. A greater inhibition of AtNHX1-driven cation exchange by EIPA could not be attained in proteoliposomes because higher concentrations of the drug induced significant vesicle alkalinization of control liposomes, probably because of nonspecific perturbation of the lipidic permeability barrier (Fig. 7). Both MIA and benzamil were somewhat more efficient than EIPA, with K0.5 below 10 μm (Table I). Quinine, a compound not related to amiloride and known to inhibit cation/H+ exchange in mitochondria, could also inhibit the exchange reaction at much higher concentrations (Table I).Table IEffect of inhibitors on antiporter activityInhibitorsConcentrationActivityμm%Amiloride10101EIPA1851058MIA1751043Benzamil1701039Quinine1010610057The activity data are given as the percentages relative to control without inhibitor. The values shown are the averages of three experiments. Open table in a new tab The activity data are given as the percentages relative to control without inhibitor. The values shown are the averages of three experiments. The histidine tag was added to the C-terminal end of AtNHX1 because the existence of N-terminal signal peptides in NHE type transporters has been suggested (14Counnillon L. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 15Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As judged from phenotypic comparisons of yeast expressing the tagged and nontagged AtNHX1 proteins, addition of the histidine tag did not alter significantly the activity of the exchanger. Tolerance to Na+ ions, which relies on ion compartmentation in the vacuole of AXT3K cells (17Quintero F.J. Blatt M.R. Pardo J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was identical for cells expressing either recombinant form of AtNHX1 (Fig. 1). For unknown reasons, the function of the yeast ScNHX1 protein confers greater resistance to the cationic antibiotic hygromycin B (8Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Girisafi P. Alpher S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Again, both tagged and nontagged AtNHX1 proteins conveyed equal resistance to hygromycin B when expressed in yeast. Using a monoclonal antibody raised against the RGSH4 epitope, two cross-reactive bands of 100 and 45–50 kDa were observed in microsomes (Fig. 2). Although the 45–50-kDa band is slightly below the predicted molecular mass of AtNHX1 (58 kDa), Apseet al. (5Apse M.P. Aharon G.S. Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Science. 1999; 285: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar) also reported an apparent mass of 47 kDa inArabidopsis tonoplast fractions using a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal domain of AtNHX1.

Heparan sulfate-bound Noggin remains functional and can bind BMP4 at the plasma membrane. A Noggin mutant with a deletion in a putative heparin binding domain has reduced binding to heparin and does not bind to the cell surface but has preserved BMP binding and antagonist functions.

Although structurally distinct, members of these gene families have in some cases similar ligand specificity and overlapping patterns of expression, and in the case of Chordin and Noggin these proteins apparently are capable of at least partial compensation for each other, for example during forebrain development in the mouse (7Bachiller D. Klingensmith J. Kemp C. Belo J.A. Anderson R.M. May S.R. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Rossant J. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In addition to these multiple secreted BMP1 antagonists, there are other secreted proteins whose primary function is to overcome this antagonism (8Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 9Oelgeschlager M. Larrain J. Geissert D. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a highly complex system to regulate the bioavailability and consequently the activities of BMPs in the extracellular space. Members of the BMP gene family are broadly expressed, and their functions have been implicated in a wide range of developmental processes (10Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 11Mehler M.F. Mabie P.C. Zhang D. Kessler J.A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In most situations, BMPs appear to function as morphogens (12Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1997; 124: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Harland R. Gerhart J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Morphogens function over long ranges through the formation of gradients of activity. Cells sense the strength of the morphogen signal across this gradient and respond by induction of dose-dependent patterns of gene activation, which then serve to specify cell fate. Despite evidence for gradients of BMP activity in many tissues, there is no evidence that bmp4transcripts have graded expression patterns in many of these same tissues (15Fainsod A. Steinbeisser H. De Robertis E.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 16Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Thomsen G.H. Dev.

This has led to the suggestion that post-translational mechanisms are responsible for the establishment of BMP activity gradients in vivo (12Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1997; 124: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dale L. Wardle F.C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Jones C.M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been hypothesized that the diffusion of a secreted BMP antagonist from organizer regions might establish gradients of BMP antagonism, thereby resulting in inverse activity gradients of BMP. Therefore, BMP antagonists themselves may behave as morphogens. Blitzet al. have recently demonstrated that when Chordin is expressed at high doses by microinjection of mRNA it can directly function to inhibit BMP over large distances in the Xenopusembryo and can apparently establish a BMP activity gradient over several cell diameters (19Blitz I.L. Shimmi O. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. O'Connor M.B. Cho K.W. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 120-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It remains untested, however, whether endogenous Chordin similarly acts over long distances during normal development (19Blitz I.L. Shimmi O. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. O'Connor M.B. Cho K.W. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 120-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Testing of this hypothesis is restricted to indirect interpretations of the range of BMP antagonist function, since adequate reagents do not exist to localize the precise physical range of any BMP antagonistsin vivo in relation to their site of production. Accurately predicting this physical range is dependent on understanding the potential interactions between BMP antagonists and components of the cell surface and the extracellular matrix in vivo. Little is known about these potential properties, and typically it has been assumed that these proteins are in fact freely diffusible following secretion. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are found abundantly on the surface of all adherent cells and within the extracellular matrix, where they bind and regulate the functions of a wide range of ligands (20Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). More importantly, members of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been found to specifically modify cellular responsiveness to BMPs in vivo (21Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C. Selleck S.B. Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Zupicich J. Skarnes W.C. Saunders S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that heparan sulfate proteoglycans in vivomight regulate BMP function through interactions with BMP antagonists. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of heparan sulfate proteoglycans to bind to one well characterized BMP antagonist, Noggin, and to influence its cellular localization in cultured cells. We report that Noggin binds strongly to heparin-Sepharose in vitro and to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cultured cells, thereby localizing Noggin to the cell surface. This bound Noggin remains functional and indeed can bind BMP4 to the cell surface. Genetically engineered mutant Noggin proteins bearing deletions in a putative heparin-binding domain significantly reduce Noggin's ability to bind heparin (23Economides, A. N., Stahl, N. E., and Harland, R. M. (June 13, 2000) U. S. Patent 6,075,007, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NYGoogle Scholar) and eliminate binding to the cell surface. Furthermore, these mutations have been shown to have little effect on the function of Noggin as a BMP antagonist (23Economides, A. N., Stahl, N. E., and Harland, R. M. (June 13, 2000) U. S. Patent 6,075,007, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NYGoogle Scholar) and are consistent with the crystal structure of the Noggin-BMP7 complex, which shows that the heparin binding site lies in a separate domain from that which binds BMP. 2J. Groppe, J. Greenwald, A. N. Economides, M. Affolter, and S. Choe, manuscript in preparation. 2J. Groppe, J. Greenwald, A. N. Economides, M. Affolter, and S. Choe, manuscript in preparation. These results suggest that it is likely that interactions between Noggin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans in vivo play a significant role in the physical range of Noggin actions. RP57-16, RP57-21, and 57-06 were a gift of Regeneron. These rat monoclonal antibodies were generated using native human noggin protein as immunogen. Ascites fluid from SCID mice, affinity-purified by protein G affinity chromatography, was used in Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence as indicated below. The eukaryotic expression plasmids, pSRα.hNog and pSRα.hNogΔB2, encoding expression of full-length human Noggin (hNog) and a genetically engineered deletion mutant were a gift of Regeneron. For the generation of stably transfected cell lines, cells were co-transfected with pSVZeo from Invitrogen. Parental Chinese Hamster ovary cells (CHOK1) as well as mutant lines derived from these same cells but which are defective in either heparan sulfate (PGSD-677) or both heparan and chondroitin sulfate (PGSA-745) biosynthesis were a gift of Jeff Esko (University of California, San Diego). Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (BioWhittaker) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Liposome-mediated transfection was performed using Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were cotransfected with pSVZeo (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and selected with 0.5 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and individual clones were harvested and subcultured. Western blotting with RP57–16 antibody identified positive clones expressing similar levels of Noggin. For metabolic labeling of Noggin-expressing cultures, cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 40 min. Tran35S-label (ICN) was then added to each well at 200 μCi/ml, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequent to this pulse, cells were washed once with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and chased in the same medium. For competition experiments, heparin or chondroitin sulfate (Sigma) was added during the chase period at 1 μg/ml. At the specified time intervals, medium was recovered, and the cell layers were lysed using cold 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mmcalcium chloride in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors of 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mg/mlN-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Medium was brought to similar conditions by the addition of concentrated buffer. Cell debris was removed from both cell layer extracts and medium samples by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatants were then precleared by the addition of rat IgG (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by the addition of Protein G-Sepharose and incubation overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged and the supernatants used for immunoprecipitation. RP57-16 (Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY), was added to each sample at 1 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was subsequently added and incubated for an additional 1 h. Beads were washed twice with the original lysis buffer without protease inhibitors and then twice with PBS containing magnesium and calcium chloride. Immunoprecipitated products were recovered from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), detecting immunoprecipitated products by autoradiography or PhosphorImager. Conditioned medium and extracts from cells expressing human noggin as well as fractions separated by affinity chromatography of Noggin on heparin-Sepharose were electrophoresed on 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Zetaprobe (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride (TBS), plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Blocked filters were probed with RP57–16 at 20 ng/ml in 2.5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with TBST, incubation with an anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST for 1 h, and three remaining washes with TBST, protein bands were detected by ECL. Confluent monolayers of control CHOK1 cells and CHOK1 cells transfected with Noggin were labeled overnight with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (ICN) in S-MEM medium (sulfate-free Minimum Essential Media) containing dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were washed three times with PBS, DTSSP (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C (24Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Monolayers were washed three times with TBS to quench the cross-linking reaction, followed by three additional washes with PBS, and then subsequently extracted and immunoprecipitated as described above. After the final PBS wash, the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmCaCl2 and then incubated for 180 min at 37 °C with or without two additions of heparitinase I (Sigma) of 2 milliunits/ml spaced 90 min apart. Following two final washes with PBS, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer (Bio-Rad) containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, centrifuged, and analyzed on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). A column containing 1 ml of heparin-Sepharose was prepared and attached to an AKTA FPLC unit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The resin was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then 10 μg of purified recombinant Noggin in the same buffer was loaded, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes. Bound protein was eluted in the same buffer using a linear gradient up to 2m NaCl over 20 column volumes. For comparisons of hNog and hNogΔB2 binding to heparin, 160 μl of heparin-Sepharose (Sigma) was packed into a mobicol column (Mobitec). Following equilibration with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supernatants containing 250 ng of hNog or hNogΔB2 were applied to each column. Columns were the washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and subsequently eluted sequentially with 2 column volumes each of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with increasing amounts of salt. Eluted samples were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and Noggin was detected by Western as described above. Live cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with warm serum-free medium, incubated with primary antibodies for Noggin (RP57–16 at 4.4 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed twice with warm medium and incubated with secondary antibodies containing 0.01 mg/ml Hoechst for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with PBS followed by a water rinse, and then mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 500 configured with krypton and UV with the appropriate wavelength filters (568 and 351 nm) for CY3 and Hoechst excitation. Confocal images were assembled as montages using Adobe Photoshop. BMP4 (R & D Systems) was labeled with125I using Iodogen tubes (Pierce). Confluent monolayers of cells were washed three times with PBS at 4 °C. 100 ng/ml125I-BMP4 was added, and following incubation for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking, cells were washed three times with PBS. DTSSP (Pierce) at 5 mm in PBS was added to the monolayer and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cross-linking reaction was halted by washing three times with TBS and then twice with PBS. Cell layers were extracted and immunoprecipitated as described above. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated in 24-well plates to be 70% confluent after incubating at 37 °C overnight. Dilutions of supernatants containing Noggin or ΔB2 Noggin were mixed with BMP4 and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min, at which point they were added to the C2C12 cells, and incubation was extended overnight at 37 °C. Following cell lysis, alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using a colorimetric assay (Sigma). To establish whether Noggin is a heparin-binding protein, we evaluated the ability of purified recombinant Noggin to bind to heparin-Sepharose in vitro. Recombinant Noggin was purified to homogeneity as assessed by detection of a single peak on reverse phase high protein liquid chromatography (C4 Vydac column, 20–60% CH3CN/H2O over 40 min), and the identity of this product as Noggin was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Purified Noggin (10 μg) was applied to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column and eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 2 m NaCl. Aliquots of eluted fractions were assessed by 10–20% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a rat anti-human monoclonal antibody (RP57-16). As shown in Fig.1A, Noggin eluted from the column as a sharp peak only at high salt concentration. Indeed, greater than 1 m NaCl was found to be required to cause elution of Noggin from heparin-Sepharose. Close inspection of the primary sequence of Noggin reveals a cationic stretch of amino acids between residues 130 and 147. When plotted as a helical wheel (Fig. 1B), these cationic residues line up predominantly on one face of the helix, suggesting that they may form a portion of a heparin-binding domain. Indeed, a Noggin mutant engineered to exhibit reduced binding to heparin by deleting amino acids 133–144 has a reduced affinity for heparin and displays reduced clearance upon administration to adult mice (23Economides, A. N., Stahl, N. E., and Harland, R. M. (June 13, 2000) U. S. Patent 6,075,007, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NYGoogle Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig.1C, where, in contrast to wild type Noggin, which again elutes predominantly at 1 m NaCl, the hNogΔB2 mutant elutes from heparin-Sepharose at between 0.2 and 0.4 mNaCl. This suggests that this sequence contains residues important for the binding of Noggin to heparin. The salt requirement for elution of Noggin from heparin-Sepharose is similar to that which is required for elution of a number of proteins known to have physiologically relevant interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans in vivo. This includes, for example, some members of the fibroblast growth factor gene family which require binding to heparan sulfate for function (25Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar, 26Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that Noggin may bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in vivo and that, in particular, cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans might serve to bind and localize Noggin to the plasma membrane. To test the hypothesis that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans bind Noggin in vivo, we stably expressed human Noggin in normal cultured cell lines as well as in cell lines bearing known mutations in the heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway. These included CHO cell lines deficient in both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (PGSA-745) or heparan sulfate biosynthesis alone (PGSD-677) as well as the parental cell line (CHOK1), which displays normal heparan sulfate biosynthesis (27Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 28Esko J.D. Rostand K.S. Weinke J.L.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These three cell lines were cotransfected with a humannoggin expression plasmid (pSRα.hNG) as well as the selectable marker plasmid pSVZeo to allow for the positive selection of stable cell lines. Following stable selection in Zeocin, individual transfected lines were subcloned, and SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody specific to Noggin was used to screen whole cell extracts and conditioned medium from Zeocin-resistant subclones. Individual clones were selected for further study that demonstrated similar levels of Noggin expression in the cell layer and conditioned medium (Fig.2A). We evaluated whether the presence or absence of heparan sulfate had any effect on the cellular distribution of Noggin in transfected CHO cells. Specifically, cell surface Noggin was detected by immunofluorescence of nonpermeabilized cells with Noggin-specific rat monoclonal antibodies and CY3 secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, CHOK1 cells stably expressing human Noggin display readily detectable levels of Noggin at the cell surface (Fig. 2C), while the nontransfected parental cell line does not (Fig. 2B). In contrast, neither PGSA-745 (Fig. 2D) nor PGSD-677 (Fig. 2E) cells expressing similar levels of human Noggin have any detectable levels at the cell surface. Cells permeabilized prior to immunofluorescent staining reveal similar levels of vesicular intracellular staining of Noggin, presumably in the secretory and/or endocytic pathways (data not shown). To confirm that the cell surface staining results were not somehow merely due to an inaccessibility of the Noggin epitope when bound at the surface of heparan sulfate-deficient cells, we compared the staining pattern of these cells using several additional antibodies. These included two additional monoclonal antibodies (RP57–06 and RP57–21), at least one of which is known to bind to a different region of Noggin, 3Regeneron, unpublished data. as well as a polyclonal antiserum against Xenopus Noggin that cross-reacted with human Noggin. All antibodies produced identical staining results (data not shown). Furthermore, parental CHOK1 cells expressing similar levels of hNogΔB2 when stained with anti-Noggin antibody also reveal no detectable protein at the cell surface (data not shown). Taken together with the observations from the PGSA-745 and PGSD-677 cells, which lack the ability to synthesize heparan sulfate and also fail to bind wild-type Noggin at their cell surface, these results suggest that Noggin binding to the cell surface is a heparin-dependent phenomenon. To confirm that cell surface binding of Noggin is heparin-dependent, we determined whether Noggin could be displaced from the surface of CHO cells by soluble glycosaminoglycans. CHOK1 cells, stably expressing human Noggin, were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label for 30 min and then chased in unlabeled medium in the presence or absence of glycosaminoglycans. Labeled Noggin was detected in the total cell layer and medium at each time point by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. As seen in Fig. 3A, newly synthesized Noggin has a cellular half-life of ∼3.6 h and is released into the medium (Fig. 3E). However, the total labeled Noggin recovered from the medium is not equivalent with that which is synthesized in the initial 30-min pulse, suggesting some proportion of cell surface Noggin is likely to be internalized by the cell and degraded. In contrast, cells that are pulse-labeled and then chased in the presence of soluble heparin show almost immediate release of Noggin from the cell surface (Fig. 3B). Concomitant with this disappearance of cell surface Noggin is the rapid, and apparently stable, accumulation of Noggin in the cell medium (Fig. 3F), indicating that heparin is displacing Noggin from the cell surface. The total labeled Noggin recovered from the medium is quantitatively similar to that which is initially synthesized by the cells during the pulse. This suggests that Noggin, once displaced from the surface by heparin, is protected against subsequent internalization and degradation and suggests that Noggin may normally be endocytosed in a heparin-dependent manner. In support of this conclusion is the finding that the hNogΔB2 mutant of Noggin, with reduced heparin binding, shows rapid release from CHOK1 cells (Fig. 3D) and accumulates stably in the medium (Fig. 3H) like heparin-treated cells expressing wild type Noggin. Although a slightly reduced molecular weight form of the hNogΔB2 mutant is evident in the medium, suggesting perhaps increased proteolytic processing of this mutant, this reduced molecular weight form has been inconsistently observed, and we are therefore uncertain of its significance. To confirm that displacement of Noggin from the cell surface is not simply a nonspecific effect of the addition of a highly negatively charged polysaccharide, we evaluated the ability of an equal concentration of chondroitin sulfate to displace cell surface Noggin. As shown in Fig. 3, C and G, the addition of chondroitin sulfate had no effect on the turnover or cellular localization of Noggin. Noggin remains localized only on the surface of those cells capable of heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Since this binding can be displaced by heparin but not by chondroitin sulfate, the primary site of interaction of Noggin with the plasma membrane is likely via a heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycan. To assay for a direct physical association between these two proteins, CHOK1 cells expressing Noggin were metabolically labeled with 35S inorganic sulfate to label proteoglycans. Following cross-linking with a small chain-reducible agent to cross-link interacting proteins, we isolated complexes by immunoprecipitation with anti-Noggin antibodies and evaluated them by reduced SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 (lane 2), a sulfate-labeled protein that migrates with the electrophoretic characteristics of a proteoglycan was isolated in association with Noggin. No similar product was immunoprecipitated from control cell lines not expressing Noggin (Fig. 4, lane 1). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitate is sensitive to enzymatic cleavage with heparitinase I (lane 3), confirming the identity of this material as a heparan sulfate pro"

We show that androgens (dihydrotestosterone and R1881) down-regulate TGF-β1-induced expression of TGF-β1, c-Fos, and Egr-1 in the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, LNCaP. Moreover, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibits TGF-β1 activation of three TGF-β1-responsive promoter constructs, 3TP-luciferase, AP-1-luciferase, and SBE4BV-luciferase, in LNCaP cells either with or without enforced expression of TGF-β receptors (TβRI and TβRII). Similarly, DHT inhibits the activation of Smad-binding element (SBE)4BV-luciferase by either constitutively activated TβRI (T204D) or constitutively activated Smad3 (S3*). Activation of SBE4BV-luciferase by S3* in the NRP-154 prostatic cell line, which is androgen receptor (AR)-negative but highly responsive to TGF-β1, is blocked by co-transfection with either full-length AR or AR missing the DNA binding domain. Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays show that AR directly associates with Smad3 but not Smad2 or Smad4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the AR ligand binding domain directly inhibits the association of Smad3 to the Smad-binding element.

TGF-β first associates with constitutively active dimeric TβRII, which then recruits and activates TβRI kinase by transphosphorylation at a juxtamembrane glycine-serine repeat (21Wrana J.L.

With the help of Smad anchor for receptor activation (27Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Google Scholar), phosphorylated TβRI is able to activate Smads 2 and 3 by phosphorylating their carboxyl-terminal serine-serine-Xaa-serine motifs (28Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Google Scholar). Active Smads 2 and 3 can form heteromeric complexes with co-Smad4, and either directly or through interactions with transcription factors and co-regulators bind to Smad-binding elements (SBEs) in TGF-β-regulated genes (29Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 5-13Google Scholar, 30Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Google Scholar, 31Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Google Scholar). Further activation of Smads 2 and 3 is blocked by Smad7, whose expression is induced upon TGF-β stimulation (32Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2731-2738Google Scholar) in the prostate. Recent reports show AR associates with Smad3 and that this association may either enhance (37Kang H.Y. Lin H.K. Hu Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Google Scholar) or inhibit (38Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118Google Scholar) AR-mediated transcription. Here we report the first in vitrodemonstration that DHT inhibits TGF-β signaling in prostatic epithelial cells through interaction of AR with Smad3. Our results support that the binding of ligand-bound AR to activated Smad3 inhibits TGF-β transcriptional responses by blocking the association of Smad3 with SBE.DISCUSSIONOur data show that androgens can block TGF-β responses in prostate epithelial cells through an association of AR with Smad3, which inhibits the binding of Smad3 to SBEs in TGF-β-responsive promoters. This mechanism of cross-talk provides both rapid and direct means by which androgens can inhibit TGF-β signaling.Our data demonstrate that DHT is not necessary for the in vitro association of full-length AR to Smad3 (Fig. 4, Aand B). However, the exact localization of ligand-free AR remains controversial and depends on cell type (60Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Google Scholar, 61Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13115-13123Google Scholar, 62Karvonen U. Kallio P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15973-15979Google Scholar, 63Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Google Scholar). It is likely that the DHT-independent association of AR to Smad3 may not occur in intact NRP-154 cells due to cytosolic localization of ligand-free AR and nuclear localization of S3*. If so, the association of AR to Smad3 without DHT would have occurred after cell lysis. In view of the DHT requirement for the loss of TGF-β1-induced transcription by AR, we believe this association in NRP-154 cells occurs only by nuclear co-localization of ligand-bound AR and active Smad3. Data presented in Fig. 6 suggest DHT may also promote a modification in the AR·Smad3 complex to inhibit further the association to SBE.There is a definite requirement for Smads on all TGF-β1-responsive reporter constructs used in this study. We have investigated this requirement by observing the effects of DN-Smad4 and Smad7 on TGF-β1-induced 3TP-luciferase and AP-1-luciferase. DN-Smad4 or Smad7 inhibit ∼70–80% of TGF-β1-induced activity on both of these reporters (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, B andC, DN-Smad4 or Smad7 also inhibits TGF-β1-induced SBE4BV-luciferase by ∼80%.DHT is required for full-length AR to inhibit S3*-induced SBE4BV-luciferase (Fig. 5B). Δ538–614 AR, which lacks the DBD, is able to inhibit ∼70% of S3* activity independent of ligand and ∼90% (similar to wild type) of S3* activity with ligand (Fig. 5B); therefore, the DBD may prevent DHT-independent inhibition of S3*. The mechanism by which Δ538–614 without DHT inhibits S3* activity is unclear; however, data show ARΔDBD (no DBD) is more efficiently translocated to the nucleus compared with an AR nuclear localization mutant (64Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Google Scholar). This suggests that the nuclear localization signal of AR is bi- or tripartite and may be enhanced in the absence of DBD. Thus, we hypothesize a greater percentage of Δ538–614 may be localized to the nucleus in the absence of DHT, as compared with wild-type AR. The means by which AR DBD alone reduces S3* activity is not known, because the Δ538–614 AR data suggest this region is not necessary for complete inhibition. Furthermore, the EMSA results substantiate that the DBD is not essential for AR-mediated loss of S3* activity (Fig. 6A). AR LBD is able to inhibit GST-Smad3 binding to SBE without DHT; nevertheless, addition of ligand does enhance this effect by ∼4-fold, perhaps through an AR LBD conformational change.The above result parallels data from previous reports that demonstrated LBD alone can bind to Smad3 (37Kang H.Y. Lin H.K. Hu Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Google Scholar). Interestingly, one report (37Kang H.Y. Lin H.K. Hu Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Google Scholar) showed the AR DBD or AR LBD could bind to Smad3, although no functional consequence of these interactions was presented. The other study revealed the AR amino-terminal region (a.a. 1–563) associates with the MH2 domain of Smad3 to repress androgen receptor-mediated transcription of murine mammary tumor virus-luciferase (38Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118Google Scholar), but the significance of this interaction (amino-terminal AR·Smad3) to TGF-β signaling was not examined. We are not able to explain the discrepancy that exists among several groups attempting to characterize the association of AR with Smad3. However, we believe our data are solid due to our EMSA assay observing a function of the AR·Smad3 association and not solely the physical interaction. It is important to note that although AR can inhibit Smad3, we cannot yet rule out that this inhibition is exclusive to Smad3 and does not also involve Smads 2 or 4 through indirect means.The normal prostate requires an intact androgen signaling pathway for growth and function, whereas prostate carcinomas often escape from this dependence through changes likely to involve AR. AR receptor mutants that are unable to activate androgen-responsive genes or change the sensitivity of the receptor to circulating androgens (or other steroids) may suppress androgen dependence in the prostate (65Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Google Scholar, 66Veldscholte J.

Swami S. Navone N.M. Peehl D.M. Feldman D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 703-706Google Scholar). Also, mutations within the AR carboxyl terminus which decrease steroid affinity may produce a ligand-insensitive and yet transcriptionally active AR (68Culig Z. Hobisch A. Bartsch G. Klocker H.

An abundance of AR polymorphisms without functional significance have been characterized, especially within the amino-terminal region, which are linked to increased incidence of prostate cancer (70Miller E.A.

Moreover, it is apparent that prostate tumors, both localized and metastatic, maintain or increase AR expression and sensitivity following androgen ablation therapy (10Linja M.J. Savinainen K.J.

The data presented here suggest a novel mechanism by which such aberrations in AR can directly antagonize TGF-β effects within the prostate and promote the development and progression of cancer.Restoration of TGF-β receptor levels by overexpression of wild-type TβRII in LNCaP cells was reported to promote TGF-β responsiveness and suppress tumor growth through reduced cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis (80Guo Y. Kyprianou N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1366-1371Google Scholar). Consistent with a tumor-suppressive role of TGF-β in the prostate, we have shown that DN-TβRII promotes malignant transformation of two non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell lines (19Tang B. de Castro K. Barnes H.E. Parks W.T. Stewart L. Bottinger E.P. Danielpour D. Wakefield L.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4834-4842Google Scholar). 2D. Danielpour, unpublished observations. Our data showing that TGF-β is a potent inducer of apoptosis in the above cell lines further support TGF-β may suppress prostate tumor growth through the induction of apoptosis (47Chipuk J.E. Bhat M. Hsing A.Y. Ma J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26614-26621Google Scholar, 81Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149Google Scholar). With this in mind, the current work proposes that constitutive or enhanced activation of AR, through means discussed earlier, may cause loss of androgen dependence (e.g. rescue from undergoing apoptosis) partly via loss of TGF-β signaling through inactivation of Smad3, because Smads were shown to be critical to the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β (82Yamamura Y. Hua X. Bergelson S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36295-36302Google Scholar). This loss would allow for prostatic epithelial cells to escape growth inhibition and apoptosis by TGF-β, contributing to carcinogenesis of the prostate.In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that the association of AR with Smad3 can inhibit the ability of Smad3 to bind SBE and activate transcription. Amplification of AR, or variances within the AR (or its signaling pathway) that promote deregulated and enhanced Smad3 binding, may counteract tumor suppression by TGF-β. Moreover, these findings strengthen our hypothesis that androgens promote viability of prostatic epithelial cells, in part, by preventing TGF-β-induced apoptosis. In view of the numerous binding partners for Smads and AR, understanding how such co-regulators affect the inhibition of Smad3 signaling is critical to our understanding of normal homeostatic mechanisms and carcinogenesis of the prostate. Normal prostatic epithelium depends on androgens for growth, development, secretory function, and survival (1Hayward S.W. Cunha G.R. Radiol. Clin.

Further activation of Smads 2 and 3 is blocked by Smad7, whose expression is induced upon TGF-β stimulation (32Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118Google Scholar) AR-mediated transcription. Here we report the first in vitrodemonstration that DHT inhibits TGF-β signaling in prostatic epithelial cells through interaction of AR with Smad3. Our results support that the binding of ligand-bound AR to activated Smad3 inhibits TGF-β transcriptional responses by blocking the association of Smad3 with SBE. DISCUSSIONOur data show that androgens can block TGF-β responses in prostate epithelial cells through an association of AR with Smad3, which inhibits the binding of Smad3 to SBEs in TGF-β-responsive promoters. This mechanism of cross-talk provides both rapid and direct means by which androgens can inhibit TGF-β signaling.Our data demonstrate that DHT is not necessary for the in vitro association of full-length AR to Smad3 (Fig. 4, Aand B). However, the exact localization of ligand-free AR remains controversial and depends on cell type (60Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Google Scholar, 61Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13115-13123Google Scholar, 62Karvonen U. Kallio P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J.

It is likely that the DHT-independent association of AR to Smad3 may not occur in intact NRP-154 cells due to cytosolic localization of ligand-free AR and nuclear localization of S3*. If so, the association of AR to Smad3 without DHT would have occurred after cell lysis. In view of the DHT requirement for the loss of TGF-β1-induced transcription by AR, we believe this association in NRP-154 cells occurs only by nuclear co-localization of ligand-bound AR and active Smad3. Data presented in Fig. 6 suggest DHT may also promote a modification in the AR·Smad3 complex to inhibit further the association to SBE.There is a definite requirement for Smads on all TGF-β1-responsive reporter constructs used in this study. We have investigated this requirement by observing the effects of DN-Smad4 and Smad7 on TGF-β1-induced 3TP-luciferase and AP-1-luciferase. DN-Smad4 or Smad7 inhibit ∼70–80% of TGF-β1-induced activity on both of these reporters (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, B andC, DN-Smad4 or Smad7 also inhibits TGF-β1-induced SBE4BV-luciferase by ∼80%.DHT is r"

The stability and activity of HIF-1α are regulated by binding to various proteins such as pVHL, p53, and p300/CBP. Here, using the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we found that HIF-1α interacts with Jab1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein-1), which is a coactivator of AP-1 transcription factor and fifth subunit of COP9 signalosome complex. The interaction of Jab1 with HIF-1α was confirmed by GST pull-down assay and also reproduced in vivo in HEK 293 cells, where endogenous Jab1 was coimmunoprecipitated with the overexpressed HIF-1α. Moreover, Jab1-enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1 under hypoxia led to increase the expression of VEGF, a major HIF-1 target gene. Furthermore, Jab1 increased HIF-1α protein levels, which was due to the enhanced HIF-1α stability. The binding of HIF-1α and p53 tumor suppressor protein, negative regulator of HIF-1α stability, was interfered in a Jab1-dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicate that Jab1 should be considered as a novel regulator of HIF-1α stability via direct interaction.

Under hypoxic conditions, the diverse target genes described above are all transcriptionally up-regulated by the heterodimeric HIF-1. The α subunit of HIF-1 is the hypoxia-responsive component of the dimer, while HIF-1β is expressed constitutively.

The modulation of HIF-1α stability and activation requires interaction of these multiproteins with HIF-1α. In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel proteins that interact with ODD domain of HIF-1α and control HIF-1α stability and activity. We identified the HIF-1α-interacting clone, Jab1, a protein originally described as a transcriptional coactivator of c-Jun and Jun D (12Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). It plays roles in numerous signaling pathways, including those that regulate integrin signaling (13Bianchi E. Denti S.

Jab1 is also known as a subunit (CSN5) of mammalian CSN complex, which phosphorylates transcriptional regulators such as c-Jun, IκB, p105, and p53 (16Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D.

Herein we report a new role of Jab1 in regulating HIF-1α protein stability by competition with p53, which leads to HIF-1-dependent transcriptional activation. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. Jab1, p53, and GFP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Upstate Biotechnology, and CLONTECH, respectively. HIF-1α antibody was generated in rabbits against a bacterially expressed human HIF-1α (18Chun Y.S. Choi E. Kim G.T. Choi H. Kim C.H. Lee M.J. Kim M.S. Park J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4198-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For the yeast two-hybrid screening, we amplified the ODD domain of HIF-1α by PCR and subcloned into the pGBT9. A series of deletion mutants of HIF-1α gene were amplified by PCR and inserted into pET-28. The full length of Jab1 expression vector was constructed by PCR and subcloned into pCMV-Tag2. To construct pCITE-Jab1 for in vitro translation, the Jab1 cDNA was inserted into pCITE4. All constructs were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing analysis. For luciferase assay, pBOS-hHIF-1α, pBOS-hARNT, and pSV40pro-EpoHRE-Luc vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Fujii-Kuriyama (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) (8Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-HIF-1α vector was constructed into the KpnI andBamHI of the pEGFP vector. Yeast strains SFY526 and HF7c obtained fromCLONTECH were used to assay protein-protein interactions and for library screening, respectively. Two-hybrid assays using the GAL4 system were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Human embryonic kidney, HEK 293, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotics. For hypoxic condition, cells were incubated at 5% CO2level with 1% O2 balanced with N2 in hypoxic chamber (Forma). [35S]Methionine-labeledin vitro translated deletion mutants of HIF-1α were prepared by using the TNT system (Promega). GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (15Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (∼1 μg) of GST or GST-Jab1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with in vitro translated deletion mutants of HIF-1α in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. For competition assay with p53, GST-p53 fusion proteins and unlabeled in vitro translated Jab1 were also prepared described as above. After 24 h of transfection into HEK 293 cells, cells were treated for 6 h under hypoxic/normoxic conditions before harvesting the cells. The preparation of protein extracts, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot were performed as described previously (19Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmids was transfected to HEK 293 cells with proper recombinations of effector plasmids, pSV40promoter-EpoHRE-Luc reporter or mutated-EpoHRE-Luc reporter, pCMV-β-gal, pBOS-hHIF-1α, pBOS-hARNT, and pCMV-Jab1 using calcium phosphate-mediated methods. After transfection, cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using an assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer (Turner Design). Extracts were also assayed for β-galactosidase enzyme assay. Each extract was assayed three times, and the mean relative light units was normalized by values obtained from an extract prepared from empty vector-transfected cells. The relative luciferase activity was calculated as relative light units/β-galactosidase. HEK 293 cells were labeled with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine per plate in methionine-free DMEM under hypoxia for 4 h. After labeling, cells were washed and chased with complete DMEM for indicated amount of time in hypoxic chamber. Cells were subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. Band intensities were measured using an image analyzer (Fuji) of autoradiographs. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify candidate proteins that interact with HIF-1α in vivo. cDNA corresponding to the amino acids 401–603 (ODD domain) (21Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar) of HIF-1α was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as a bait. Using this bait, mouse embryonic and T cell library was screened as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From 6 × 106transformants, 190 His+/Lac+ double-positive clones were isolated. The 64 clones were further selected by β-galactosidase assays in another yeast strain, SFY 526, containing a GAL1UAS-lacZ reporter gene. DNA sequence and data base searches revealed that the nucleotide sequence of six clones encoded mouse Jab1 (12Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of HIF-1α and Jab1 in vitro was examined by GST pull-down assays using a series of deletion constructs of HIF-1α. The results shown in Fig. 1Aindicated that the deletion constructs, including ODD domain and the full-length HIF-1α, were pulled down by the interaction with in vitro translated 35S-labeled Jab1, whereas the amino acids 1–401 and 603–827 regions of HIF-1α were not interacted. The interaction between HIF-1α and Jab1 in vivo was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. When GFP-HIF-1α, fusion between GFP and HIF-1α, produces the stabilized HIF-1α in normoxic cells (20Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was immunoprecipitated from hypoxic and normoxic cell extracts, endogenous Jab1 was coimmunoprecipitated. Conversely, HIF-1α was coimmunoprecipitated when cell extracts were treated with anti-Jab1 antibody (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether Jab1 is involved in HIF-1 transcriptional activity, we used a luciferase reporter system, pSV40promoter-EpoHRE-Luc, and mutated EpoHRE-Luc reporters. Upon transient transfection of HIF-1α, ARNT, and EpoHRE-Luc vectors, reporter activity was stimulated under hypoxic conditions compared with endogenous HIF-1 activity. However, ectopic expression of Jab1 further enhanced the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 by about 2-fold compared with hypoxia-stimulated activity in the absence of exogenous Jab1. In cells transfected with mutated EpoHRE reporter, luciferase activity was not changed by hypoxia and Jab1 (Fig.2A). Furthermore, to evaluate whether Jab1 modulates the HRE-containing gene, VEGF, we transfected HEK 293 cells with Jab1 expression vector, pCMV-Jab1. The mRNA and protein expression of VEGF were significantly increased by Jab1 compared with hypoxia alone (Fig. 2B). Therefore, Jab1 potentiated the hypoxia-inducible transactivation function of HIF-1. HEK 293 cells overexpressing Jab1 were exposed to hypoxia and examined to find out whether Jab1 is involved in the regulation of HIF-1α protein expression. Overexpressed Jab1 up-regulated HIF-1α protein level compared with hypoxia alone, but it did not affect mRNA levels, suggesting that the elevation of HIF-1α levels by Jab1 was not due to an increased transcription of HIF-1α gene. However, under normoxic conditions, the protein levels of HIF-1α were not increased by Jab1 (Fig.3A). Analysis of HIF-1α protein stability in cycloheximide-treated cells showed that the degradation of HIF-1α was decreased in Jab1-transfected cells compared with the empty vector-transfected cells, supporting the notion that the induction of HIF-1α level by Jab1 is due to the enhanced HIF-1α stability (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in pulse-chase experiments, the half-life of HIF-1α protein was extended in Jab1-transfected cells, thus confirming the effect of Jab1 on HIF-1α stability (Fig. 3C). p53 plays an important role in hypoxia-induced HIF-1α stability via direct interaction (5Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Jab1 could influence the interaction between HIF-1α and p53 under hypoxia. Expression of ectopic Jab1 abolished the interaction between the p53 and HIF-1α as revealed by immunoprecipitations with the p53 antibody (Fig. 4A). To exclude an indirect effect of Jab1 on interaction of p53 with HIF-1α, we performed in vitro competition experiments. Increasing amounts of the in vitro translated Jab1 were added simultaneously with constant amounts of HIF-1α. As shown in Fig.4B, addition of Jab1 led to a reduction in the interaction between HIF-1α and p53, suggesting the competition between Jab1 and p53 for binding to HIF-1α. The regulation of HIF-1α stability and activity occurs at multiple levels. Especially modulation of HIF-1α protein through itself and other proteins interaction is pivotal in stabilization and activation of HIF-1α protein. In an attempt to further characterize HIF-1α protein function and regulation, we identified a novel interaction between HIF-1α and Jab1 using the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed this interaction in GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Jab1 was first discovered using the activation domain of c-Jun as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a B-lymphocyte cDNA library (12Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Jab1 also interacts with a number of proteins involved in cell signaling molecules such as integrin LFA-1 (13Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), p27kip1 (14Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), SRC-1 (15Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (22Li S. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13386-13393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (23Kleemann R. Hausser A. Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Kapurniotu A. Grell M. Finkelmeier D. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In this study, our data demonstrated that the direct interaction with Jab1 and HIF-1α contributes to the up-regulation of HIF-1α protein level under hypoxic condition. Actually, we could detect the interaction between Jab1 and HIF-1α, which is stabilized by fusion with GFP, in normoxic condition, but this interaction did not result in stabilizing or up-regulating the level of HIF-1α. It might be due to the strong affinity of pVHL for HIF-1α compared with that of Jab1, leading to the rapid degradation of HIF-1α proteins throughout physiological normoxic condition. In contrast, HIF-1α levels remain high in hypoxic conditions through direct interaction with Jab1 as mentioned above. Recently, it was reported that p53 directly interacts with HIF-1α and limits hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1 α by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation under hypoxic conditions (5Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, p53−/− cells expressed higher levels of HIF-1α protein compared with their p53+/+ counterpart in response to hypoxia. However, no increased level of HIF-1α protein was observed in p53−/− cells under normoxia (5Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas VHL-defective cells dramatically expressed the high level HIF-1α protein under normoxia (4Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4117) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that under normoxia, p53 probably does not affect HIF-1α protein degradation in contrast to pVHL. Coincident with these reports, our results showed that Jab1 directly interferes with HIF-1α-p53 interaction and lead to stabilize HIF-1α protein under hypoxia. Therefore, Jab1 probably contributes to minimal effect on HIF-1α protein stability in response to normoxia, and consequently the HIF-1α stabilization by Jab1 under normoxia was not detected. On the contrary, overexpressed Jab1 substantially augments hypoxia-induced HIF-1α levels by releasing HIF-1α protein from p53. Of course, further study would be necessary to clarify the differential role of Jab1 in regulating HIF-1α stability under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. On the other hand, Jab1 has been known to be a subunit of multiprotein complex called CSN complex (16Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). But the exact function of CSN presently is not clear. The purified complex possessed kinase activity that phosphorylates transcriptional regulators (16Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W.

In the case of c-Jun, the interaction of the CSN with c-Jun via Jab1 led to the subsequent phosphorylation, enhanced stability, and increased transcriptional activity of the c-Jun. (24Naumann M.

As another possible explanation for HIF-1α stability by Jab1, the relationship of CSN and HIF-1α can be suggested. This raises the possibility that Jab1 may serve as a docking site for CSN complex-mediated phosphorylation and subsequently lead to stabilize HIF-1α protein. Alternatively, a recent report showed that CSN complex phosphorylates p53 at Thr-155 residue, and the phosphorylated p53 is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (17Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), indicating that p53 degradation by CSN complex may result in up-regulation of HIF-1α protein. These results suggest a possible cross-talk between HIF-1 signaling and CSN complex. Taken together, we concluded that Jab1 plays a role in HIF-1α stability by blocking interaction with p53, thereby enhancing the hypoxia-dependent transcriptional activation of HIF-1. Further characterization of Jab1 may help us to understand more precisely the stabilization mechanism of HIF-1.

The critical amino acid sequences necessary for this localization are in a region of core protein that is absent in flavi- and pestiviruses, which are related to HCV. From our sequence comparisons, this region in HCV core was present in the corresponding protein of GBV-B, another virus whose genomic sequence has significant similarity to HCV. Expression of the putative GBV-B core protein revealed that it also was directed to lipid droplets. By extending the comparisons to cellular proteins, there were amino acid sequence similarities between the domains for lipid droplet association in HCV core and plant oleosin proteins. To determine whether these similarities were related functionally, an oleosin encoded by the Brassica napus bniiigene was expressed in different mammalian cell lines, where it retained the capacity to bind to lipid droplets. Analysis of deletion mutants indicated that the critical region within the protein required for this localization was the same for both plant and mammalian cells. A common feature in the viral and plant sequences was a motif containing proline residues. Mutagenesis of these residues in HCV core and plant oleosin abolished lipid droplet association. Finally, the domain within HCV core required for binding to lipid droplets could substitute for the equivalent domain in oleosin, further indicating the functional relatedness between the viral and plant sequences.

They consist of a core of neutral lipid, comprising mainly triacylglycerols and/or cholesterol esters, surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids. Bounding the phospholipid layer is a proteinaceous coat. The best characterized family of proteins that associate with lipid droplets (referred to as lipid bodies or oil bodies in plant cells) are the plant oleosins that accumulate in desiccation tolerant seeds (3Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 4Huang A.H.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Oleosins consist of a central, hydrophobic domain flanked by amphipathic N- and C-terminal regions. The hydrophobic domain is critical for association with lipid bodies (5van Rooijen G.J.H. Moloney M.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and all such domains within oleosins share a conserved motif referred to as a “proline knot” (4Huang A.H.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The proline knot is composed of three closely spaced proline residues, and mutation of these residues impairs localization to lipid bodies (6Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the principal lipid droplet binding proteins that have been identified are adipophilin (also called adipocyte differentiation-related protein; see Refs. 7Jiang H.P. Serrero G.

Adipophilin is present in a wide range of cell types and in increased quantities in certain diseases where intracellular lipid accumulation is evident (12Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R.

In addition to adipophilin and the perilipins, the core protein encoded by HCV1 also associates with lipid droplets in mammalian cells (17Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Barba G. Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Z. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc.

HCV is the sole member of the hepacivirus genus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family along with two other genera, the flavi- and pestiviruses. All of the Flaviviridae are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that have similar genome arrangements and share sequence similarities. HCV core is a structural component of the virus particle, and by analogy with flavi- and pestiviruses, it is likely to be the sole component of the capsid (20Baumert T.F. Ito S. Wong D.T. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3827-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 931-960Google Scholar). The protein is generated from a polyprotein encoded by the viral genome by cleavage at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (22Hijikita M. Kato N. Ootsuyuma Y. Nakagawa M. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 23Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J.

Virology. 1996; 224: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two processing events have been postulated for maturation of core, both of which are performed by cellular proteases. One activity is signal peptidase that cleaves the polyprotein at position 191, downstream of the signal peptide, to generate the N-terminal end of glycoprotein E1 (24Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that the second processing event removes either a portion of or the entire hydrophobic domain containing the signal peptide for E1 (17Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virology. 1996; 224: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Expression of core can lead to the genesis of lipid droplets in tissue culture cells (18Barba G. Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Z. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and the development of steatosis in transgenic mice (27Moriya K. Yotsuyanagi H. Shintani Y. Fujie H. Ishibashi K. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Koike K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Moreover, interaction between core and apolipoprotein AII, a component of lipid droplets, has been demonstrated (28Sabile A. Perlemuter G. Bono F. Kohara K. DeMaugre F. Kohara M. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Barba G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1064-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These data indicate that not only does core associate with lipid droplets, but it also may have the capacity to influence metabolic events within the cell involving the storage of lipid. As part of our studies to understand the significance of the interaction between HCV core and lipid droplets, we had identified previously a region within the viral protein that is essential for its association with these storage organelles (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined whether there is any similarity between the sequences within this region and those of a virus called GB virus-B (GBV-B), which has significant sequence identity to HCV, although it still remains unclassified among the genera of the Flaviviridae (29Muerhoff A.S. Leary T.P. Simons J.N. Pilot-Matias T.J. Dawson G.J. Erker J.C. Chalmers M.L. Schlauder G.G. Desai S.M. Mushahwar I.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5621-5630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GBV-B shares a tropism for liver hepatocytes with HCV and is infectious in tamarins (30Beames B. Chavez D. Guerra B. Notvall L. Brasky K.M. Lanford R.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11764-11772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Bukh J. Apgar C.L. Yanagi M. Virology. 1999; 262: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that GBV-B infection of tamarins may be a surrogate model system for HCV infection of humans (31Bukh J. Apgar C.L. Yanagi M. Virology. 1999; 262: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, few comparative studies between equivalent proteins encoded by the two viruses have been conducted. Our sequence comparisons were extended also to eukaryotic cellular proteins that attach to lipid droplets. Thus, we have studied the behavior of the putative core protein of GBV-B and a plant oleosin protein in mammalian cells, and we examined their ability to associate with lipid droplets. The results demonstrate that these disparate plant and viral proteins share similar sequence motifs that play important roles in enabling them to bind to lipid droplets in different cell types. Construction of plasmids pSFV/1–195 and pSFV/1–169 has been described previously (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The codons for the proline residues in these constructs were mutated to encode alanine by insertion of an oligonucleotide (HCV1 in TableI). This oligonucleotide was inserted between BspHI and BstXI sites in construct pgHCV/Δ135–144 (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pgHCV/1–195(P→A); the BspHI site is not a natural site in the sequence for HCV strain Glasgow and was introduced during the construction of pgHCV/Δ135–144. To generate pSFV/1–195(P→A) and pSFV/1–169(P→A), a 502-bp fragment from pgHCV/1–195(P→A), produced by cleavage byBglII and BstEII, was inserted into pSFV/1–195 and pSFV/1–169 digested with the same enzymes. A tagged version of HCV core was generated by first converting the nucleotide sequence in pgHCV/1–195 that encodes amino acids 116 and 117 from TCG CGC to TCT AGA; this introduced a novel XbaI site into the HCV core-coding region without changing the encoded amino acids. An oligonucleotide (HCV2 in Table I) that encoded the epitope tag (32McLauchlan J. Liefkens K. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was introduced into the XbaI site to give plasmid pgHCV/1–195tag. The tagged version of core was transferred as aBglII fragment from pgHCV/1–195tag into Semliki Forest virus (SFV) expression vector pSFV1 (33Liljestrom P. Garoff H.

Open table in a new tab To express portions of the GBV-B polyprotein, relevant regions were amplified by PCR from a construct pGBB (31Bukh J. Apgar C.L. Yanagi M. Virology. 1999; 262: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). pGBB contains the consensus sequence for an infectious molecular clone of GBV-B (31Bukh J. Apgar C.L. Yanagi M. Virology. 1999; 262: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Primers for PCR amplification were derived from the viral sequences in pGBB and were used in the following pairs to produce DNA fragments that encoded N-terminal regions of the GBV-B polyprotein: residues 1–141, GBV-B primers 1 and 2; residues 1–194, GBV-B primers 1 and 3; and residues 1–398, GBV-B primers 1 and 4. Amplified fragments were introduced initially into plasmid pGEM1 and thereafter into pSFV1 by standard cloning techniques. To permit detection of GBV-B core, an epitope tag (32McLauchlan J. Liefkens K. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was introduced into the coding region immediately following amino acid residue 85 (Fig. 2B). This was accomplished by first introducing a novel XbaI site at nucleotide residue 695 by converting the sequence from TCT CGC to TCT AGA; this did not alter the encoded amino acid sequence. An oligonucleotide encoding the epitope tag (GBV-B5 in Table I) was inserted between this XbaI site and a TfiI site (position 708 in the native GBV-B nucleotide sequence). The final SFV constructs that contained tagged versions of GBV-B core were termed pSFV/GB1–141, pSFV/GB1–194, and pSFV/GB1–398. Constructs containing oleosin sequences (Brassica napusoleosin gene bniii, GenBankTM accession numberX61937) were derived from plasmid pBnIII that contained the cDNA sequence for the oleosin transcript (34Keddie J.S. Hubner G. Slocombe S.P. Jarvis R.P. Cummins I. Edwards E.W. Shaw C.H. Murphy D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A 580-bp DNA fragment (Fig.1), produced by Tsp509I cleavage of pBnIII, was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEM1. The inserted fragment was flanked by BglII (at the 5′ end) and BamHI sites (at the 3′ end) by standard cloning methods, and the resultant construct was termed pg/Oln. Inserting oligonucleotide Oln1 (Table I) between EcoRI andXbaI (position 177 in Fig. 1) sites in pg/Oln produced the N-terminal mutant, pg/Oln-(Δ6–53). The C-terminal mutants pg/Oln-(1–153) and pg/Oln-(1–164) were made by inserting oligonucleotides Oln2 and Oln3 between BstF5I (position 463)/BamHI and SacI (position 502)/BamHI sites, respectively, in pg/Oln. Introducing Oln4 between EagI and BseRI sites (positions 211 and 364, respectively) in pg/Oln generated the deletion mutant pg/Oln-(Δ89–111) that lacks part of the central domain. Oln4 introduced an HpaI site (italicized in Table I) into pg/Oln-(Δ89–111) that is not present in the native sequence. To generate the oleosin proline mutant pg/Oln(P→A), Oln 5 was inserted between HpaI and BseRI sites in pg/Oln-(Δ89–111). DNA fragments carrying the various forms of oleosin were transferred into pSFV1 by standard cloning methods and termed the pSFV/Oln series. The construct expressing the chimeric oleosin/HCV core protein was made by replacing a 350-bp BglII/XbaI fragment in pgHCV/1–195tag that encoded HCV core amino acids 1–116 with an 180-bpBglII/XbaI fragment from pg/Oln encoding oleosin amino acids 1–54. The resultant construct, pg/Oln+core, consisted of amino acids 1–55 of oleosin, followed by 11 amino acids that constituted the epitope tag and thereafter amino acids 117–195 of the HCV polyprotein. A BglII fragment containing the chimeric gene was transferred into pSFV1 to give plasmid pSFV/Oln+core. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) C13 cells were grown and maintained in Glasgow minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (CS), 4% tryptose phosphate broth, and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (ETC10). Huh7 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin. To treat BHK cells with MG132 (supplied by Boston Biomedica), cells were incubated for 5 h after electroporation at 37 °C, and the media were replaced with fresh media containing the protease inhibitor at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for a further 12 h before the cells were either harvested for Western blot analysis or fixed for indirect immunofluorescence studies. The monoclonal antibodies used to detect HCV core protein (mAb JM122) and the epitope tag (mAb 9220) have been described previously (Refs. 19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

Ross J.H.E. Herman E. Murphy D.J. Plant J. 1997; 11: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RNA was transcribed in vitro from recombinant pSFV constructs linearized with SpeI. BHK and Huh7 cells were electroporated with in vitro transcribed RNA as described previously (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 h and then harvested. Extracts were prepared, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed as described previously (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

Oil body extracts were isolated from cells by flotation through a sucrose cushion following centrifugation, as outlined previously (35Sarmiento C. Ross J.H.E. Herman E. Murphy D.J. Plant J. 1997; 11: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 3% gelatin, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, membranes were incubated with antibodies (diluted to 1/500) or antisera (diluted to 1/5000) in 1% gelatin, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. After washing, bound antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cells on 13-mm coverslips were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 (prepared in PBS) at 4 °C. Following washing with PBS and blocking with PBS/CS (PBS containing 1% newborn calf serum), cells were incubated with primary antibody (diluted in PBS/CS at 1/200 for JM122 and 9220 antibodies and 1/10,000 for oleosin antisera) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively with PBS/CS and then incubated with conjugated secondary antibody (either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG raised in goat) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS/CS and PBS, staining of lipid droplets by oil red O was performed as described previously (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope. Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW alignment program (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) and hydropathicity plots generated by ProtScale (38Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar). Previously, we proposed (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,39McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepatitis. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) that the HCV core protein consisted of three domains and that the second of these domains was absent in related pesti- and flaviviruses. Although there is a lack of sequence identity between viral sequences in the Flaviviridae, each of the capsid proteins in members of this virus family have a high content of basic amino acids (40Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. Kunz C. Virology. 1988; 166: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, our comparisons were based on the proportion of positively charged residues in predicted coding regions accompanied by hydropathicity plot studies. We observed that the mature capsid (C) protein of yellow fever virus (YF), a flavivirus, had a high proportion of basic residues (27%). In contrast, the signal peptide sequence of YF that is removed from C protein upon maturation did not contain any basic amino acids. Hydropathicity analysis of immature C protein revealed that sequences at the site cleaved by the NS2B/3 protease, which removes the signal peptide, corresponded to a hydrophilic region of the protein (Fig.2A) that contained a stretch of basic amino acids (RKRR; see Refs. 41Amberg S.M. Nestorowicz A. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3794-3802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 42Amberg S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8083-8094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acids were immediately N-terminal to the NS2B/3 cleavage site, and mutations in this region can abolish both cleavage by the viral protease and virus production (42Amberg S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8083-8094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately following this segment, the hydrophobicity rose sharply due to the nature of the residues that composed the signal peptide sequence for the downstream glycoprotein, prM (Fig. 2A). Similar features were observed for the coding region of the capsid protein of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a pestivirus (data not shown). Analysis of the hydropathicity of the HCV core protein also revealed a highly hydrophilic region containing a similar segment of basic residues (RRRSR) between residues 113 and 117 (Fig. 2, A and B). However, there is no evidence for cleavage in this region in tissue culture cells (17Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Lo S.-Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. Ou J.-H. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Hussy P. Langen H. Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virology. 1996; 224: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, the predominant core protein detected extends to about residue 173. This suggests that there are additional motifs within the HCV core protein approximately from residues 118 to 173. The presence of an additional domain(s), which does not have a counterpart in the flavi- and pestiviruses, is further supported by an analysis of the proportion of basic residues in HCV core. Up to amino acid 117, 23% of residues were basic, and this dropped to 7% between residues 118 and 173 (Fig.2C). Thus, the N-terminal 117 amino acids of HCV core have a similar character to those in the YF C protein, but there are no sequences corresponding to the region between 118 and 173 of the HCV polypeptide. As in previous reports (19Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepatitis. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), this region is referred to as domain 2 (Fig. 2C). The most closely related virus to HCV is GBV-B, a virus that was isolated from tamarins but whose natural host is not known. To date, the proteolytic events to generate the mature proteins of GBV-B have been assumed from comparison with HCV polypeptide processing (29Muerhoff A.S. Leary T.P. Simons J.N. Pilot-Matias T.J. Dawson G.J. Erker J.C. Chalmers M.L. Schlauder G.G. Desai S.M. Mushahwar I.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5621-5630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the putative GBV-B core sequence with that of HCV did not identify any stretches of similarity until residue 75 of GBV-B (Fig.2B). According to the sequence alignment, domain 1 for GBV-B core ended at residue 85 (corresponding to residue 117 in HCV core; Fig. 2B), and thus, for this domain, the GBV-B sequence was shorter than that for HCV. The overall sequence identity between these domains in HCV and GBV-B was about 22% (Fig. 2C). From residue 86 and up to the start of the putative signal peptide sequence (residue 140) of GBV-B, sequence identity between the two viral sequences increased to 41%, and apart from one additional residue in GBV-B, the sequences were co-linear (Fig. 2, B andC). In HCV core, this segment is composed of domain 2 and indicated that sequences corresponding to this region are present in GBV-B. Sequence identity between the signal peptides (residues 140–156 for GBV-B) was slightly lower at 38% and reduced further in the equivalent E1 sequences (∼25%; data not shown). Distribution of basic residues in the putative GBV-B core protein revealed a high lysine/arginine content (21%) in the N-terminal region up to amino acid 85, a reduced percentage beyond this point (3.6% between amino acids 86 and 139), and no positively charged amino acids in the signal peptide sequence. This pattern of distribution corresponded to that present in HCV core. From these data,"
https://openalex.org/W2137563316,"The importance of zinc in organisms is clearly established, and mechanisms involved in zinc acquisition by plants have recently received increased interest. In this report, the identification, characterization and location of GmZIP1, the first soybean member of the ZIP family of metal transporters, are described. GmZIP1 was found to possess eight putative transmembrane domains together with a histidine-rich extra-membrane loop. By functional complementation of zrt1zrt2 yeast cells no longer able to take up zinc, GmZIP1 was found to be highly selective for zinc, with an estimated K m value of 13.8 μm. Cadmium was the only other metal tested able to inhibit zinc uptake in yeast. An antibody raised against GmZIP1 specifically localized the protein to the peribacteroid membrane, an endosymbiotic membrane in nodules resulting from the interaction of the plant with its microsymbiont. The specific expression of GmZIP1 in nodules was confirmed by Northern blot, with no expression in roots, stems, or leaves of nodulated soybean plants. Antibodies to GmZIP1 inhibited zinc uptake by symbiosomes, indicating that at least some of the zinc uptake observed in isolated symbiosomes could be attributed to GmZIP1. The orientation of the protein in the membrane and its possible role in the symbiosis are discussed.

More than 3% of the proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans are predicted to contain sequence motifs characteristic of zinc binding structural domains (1Clarke N.D. Berg J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2018-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Zinc deficiency is a widespread micronutrient deficiency limiting crop production (2Ruel M.T. Bouis H.E. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 488S-494SCrossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In recent years, genes encoding zinc transporters have been identified in various organisms (3Eide D.J. Annu. Rev.

Plant Cell Environ. 2001; 24: 217-226Crossref Google Scholar). These studies have shed some light on zinc uptake and regulation, particularly at the plasma membrane level. However, with the exception of the recently identified Zrt3p transporter on the vacuole membrane in yeast (9MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), little is known about intracellular zinc transport systems, nor about the mechanisms of the transporters identified. Here we investigate zinc transport at the symbiotic interface between legumes and rhizobia, which presents an additional level of complexity. Many legumes form a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria (rhizobia) that enables the plants to utilize atmospheric N2 for growth. Infection of the legume root by rhizobia results in the formation of specialized organs called nodules that provide the microaerobic conditions required for operation of the nitrogenase enzyme. Within the infected cells of nodules, the N2-fixing bacteroids are enclosed in a plant membrane to form an organelle-like structure termed the symbiosome (12Roth L.E. Jeon K. Stacey K. Palacios R. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Genetics of Plant-Microbe Interactions. APS Press, St. Paul, MN1988: 220-225Google Scholar). The envelope of the symbiosome is called the peribacteroid membrane (PBM) 1The abbreviations used are:PBMperibacteroid membraneLZMlow zinc mediumRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDIGdigoxigeninSSPEsaline/sodium phosphate/EDTASSWsodium salts wash bufferTBSTris-buffered salineIRTiron-regulated transporter 1The abbreviations used are:PBMperibacteroid membraneLZMlow zinc mediumRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDIGdigoxigeninSSPEsaline/sodium phosphate/EDTASSWsodium salts wash bufferTBSTris-buffered salineIRTiron-regulated transporter and effectively controls the exchange of metabolites between the symbiotic partners. The PBM, although originating from the plasma membrane of root cells, evolves over the course of nodule organogenesis to become a new and specialized membrane containing symbiosis-specific proteins (see Ref.13Whitehead L.F. Day D.A. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 30-44Crossref Google Scholar for a review). peribacteroid membrane low zinc medium rapid amplification of cDNA ends 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid digoxigenin saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA sodium salts wash buffer Tris-buffered saline iron-regulated transporter peribacteroid membrane low zinc medium rapid amplification of cDNA ends 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid digoxigenin saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA sodium salts wash buffer Tris-buffered saline iron-regulated transporter The principle metabolic exchange that occurs between plant and bacteroid is reduced carbon (usually malate) from the plant for fixed N2 from the bacteroid, and specific transport mechanisms have been identified for this exchange (14Day D.A. Kaiser B.N. Thomson R. Udvardi M.K. Moreau S. Puppo A. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 28: 667-674Google Scholar). However, the bacteroids are dependent on the plant for all micronutrients, and transporters for these must also exist on the PBM. Included in these micronutrients is the essential metal zinc. Among the various transporters identified in other systems, the ZIP family of zinc transporters was first identified in Arabidopsis, and members have also been identified in other plants (see Ref. 8Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar for a recent review). In general, the activities of these transporters have been studied by expressing the proteins in yeast, and their activity in the parent plants has not been ascertained. Here we report the isolation of the first member of the ZIP family from soybean and localize it to the peribacteroid membrane of N2-fixing root nodules. The ability to isolate intact symbiosomes from soybean nodules has allowed us to compare the activity of GmZIP1 in both its native membrane and in yeast. The S. cerevisiae strains used were DY1455 (MATα ade2–1oc can1–100 oc his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 gal), DEY1453 (MATα ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet3::HIS3 fet4::LEU2) and ZHY3 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 zrt1::LEU2 zrt2::HIS3). AtIRT1 cDNA in yeast expression vector pFL61 (15Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) is referred to as pAtIRT1. Cells were grown in yeast extract/peptone/glucose or synthetic defined media (2% glucose, 0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base; Difco) supplemented with necessary auxotrophic requirements. Yeast transformations were performed using a lithium acetate-based method (16Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar), and synthetic defined medium was used to select transformants. Low zinc medium without EDTA (LZM-EDTA) was used for yeast zinc uptake and was prepared as previously described (17Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). GmZIP1 was cloned using PCR based on observed sequence similarity between AtIRT1 (U27590), AtIRT2 (TO4324), the pea Rit1 (AF065444) and a rice EST (D49213). Near complete conservation of the amino acid sequence occurs in several short regions such as CFHQMFEGM (residues 241–249 in Rit1) and MSLMAKWA (residues 341–348 in Rit1, underlined residues not conserved). The first set of primers corresponded to these regions, but to avoid the use of degenerate primers the codons of Rit1 from Pea (the closest relative to soybean) were used. Using these primers a partial cDNA was amplified from a soybean root nodule cDNA library (MarathonTM cDNA Amplification Kit fromCLONTECH). Based on this sequence, gene-specific primers were designed (5′-RACE primer: 5′-TCT GCG CAA GAA GAT CTA CAA GTG C-3′ and 3′-RACE primer: 5′-CAA TAA GAC CAC TGA TGG CTG CA-3′). Next, 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were performed using a soybean root nodule cDNA library. Finally, primers designed to clone the open reading frame (5′-TTG CCT CTT TCA CTG ATC ACA TG-3′ and 5′-CTC TCA TTC TAT CTT AAG CCC AT-3′) were used to amplify a fullGmZIP1 open reading frame (based on sequence alignment to other ZIP genes) of 1062 bp. GmZIP1 was cloned into pFL61 yeast expression vector to give pGmZIP1. Soybean (Glycine max cv. Stevens) seeds were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA 110. Plants were grown in pots as previously described (18Puppo A. Dimitrijevic L. Rigaud J. Planta. 1982; 156: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Symbiosomes were isolated from soybean nodules harvested from 4- to 5-week-old plants and purified in mannitol medium through a Percoll density gradient, as described before (19Day D.A. Price G.D. Udvardi M.K. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1989; 16: 69-84Crossref Google Scholar). Isolated symbiosomes were vortexed vigorously to disrupt the PBM and centrifuged at 12 000 ×g for 10 min to pellet the bacteroids. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for an hour. Peribacteroid membranes were collected from the pellet of this second centrifugation, while the supernatant represented the peribacteroid space fraction (20Herrada G. Puppo A. Rigaud J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1324-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Proteins were phenol-extracted by the method of Hurkman and Tanaka (21Hurkman W.L. Tanaka C.K. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 802-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), concentrated by ammonium acetate/methanol precipitation at −20 °C, and resuspended into 65 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue before SDS-PAGE. Microsomal fractions were obtained from nodules ground in 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 7.0, 350 mm mannitol, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pAB, 10 μm E64, 1 mm dithiothreitol, filtered, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min in order to pellet the symbiosomes. Supernatant was again centrifuged at 125,000 × g for an hour, and the pellet from this centrifugation contained the soybean nodule microsomes. Proteins were extracted and concentrated as described above. The same protocol was used to purify proteins from frozen root after homogenization in 0.7 m sucrose, 0.5m Tris, 30 mm HCl, 0.1 m KCl, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations were estimated according to the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the leaves, stems, and roots as well as the nodules of various aged plants using Dynabeads oligo(dT)25 (Dynal). The Northern gel was loaded with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA samples, then run, and blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond N, Am-ersham Biosciences, Inc.), and the membrane baked according to standard procedures (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). GmZIP1DNA was DIG-labeled using the PCR DIG Labeling Mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization overnight at 55 °C was followed by washes (2 × 15 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 1% SDS and then 2 × 30 min at 68 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS). Immunological detection of the probe was accomplished using anti-DIG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and the CDP-Star™ chemiluminescent substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNAs were isolated from nodules of soybean plants using RNeasy Plant Minikit (Qiagen). Samples containing 20 μg of RNA were denatured, separated onto a 1.2% agarose 7.4% formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. Equal loading of RNA in each lane was confirmed by visualization of ribosomal RNA bands after staining of the gel with ethidium bromide. [32P-CTP]-labeled riboprobe was synthesized using anin vitro transcription system kit (Promega) andApaI-linearized pGmZIP1 as template. After 12 h of hybridization at 55 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% powdered milk, 10% dextran sulfate, the membrane was washed twice for 20 min at 55 °C in 2 × SSC 0.1% SDS and was then exposed to film (Biomax, Kodak). Genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves of 28-day-old plants using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Southern blot analysis was performed with 5 μg of genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes. DNA was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted onto nylon membrane, and the membrane baked for 2 h at 80 °C. GmZIP1 DNA was DIG-labeled as above. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C, followed by washes (2 × 15 min at 24 °C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and then 2 × 30 min at 42 °C in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS). Detection of signal was as above using CDP-Star™. ZHY3 yeast strains carrying plasmid pFL61 or pGmZIP1 were grown to mid-log phase in LZM-EDTA. Cells were harvested, washed once, and resuspended in a minimal volume of LZM-EDTA. Cells were equilibrated at 30 °C for 20 min before being mixed with twice their volume of a radiolabeled65Zn2+ solution. Uptake solution contained LZM-EDTA, pH 4.2, 20 μm ZnCl2, and 200 nCi of65ZnCl2 (New England Biolab). Cells were incubated in a 30 °C water bath for stated amounts of time. Aliquots were collected on glass microfiber filters (GF/F Whatman) and washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold SSW, pH 4.2 (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm trisodium citrate, 1 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaCl; Ref. 23Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).65Zn2+ content of the cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. Competition for Zn2+ uptake by metal ions was measured by adding a 10-fold molar excess of iron, copper, nickel, manganese, cobalt, cadmium, or molybdenum to 20 μm65Zn2+-labeled solution. All metals were used as their chloride salts and were of analytical reagent grade or equivalent. To study the competition for zinc uptake by ferrous iron, 10 mm ascorbic acid was also added to the mix, and the sulfate salt of iron was used in this case. When needed, the uptake solution was buffered with Tris-HCl for pH ranges of 7–9 or with citric acid-NaOH for pH ranges of 3–6. A stock solution of 250 mm ZnCl2 was prepared in 0.02 nHCl. Cell number was determined by measuring the absorbance of liquid cultures at 600 nm and comparing with a standard curve. Isolated symbiosomes were diluted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and pre-equilibrated at 30 °C for 15 min. Symbiosome aliquots were added to a double volume of assay buffer giving a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Uptake experiments were conducted as described above for yeast, except that mannitol medium was used instead of LZM or SSW. When used as the uptake wash buffer, 10 mm nitrilotriacetic acid was added to the mannitol medium to chelate loosely bound metals. In all experiments, controls for background adherence of zinc were performed by measuring uptake at 0 °C; these values were subtracted from all of the data shown. Two peptides were selected from immunogenic regions of the GmZIP1 protein sequence, corresponding to the first 9 N-terminal amino acid residues (MKRFHSDSK) and to amino acid residues 182–196 (HGHVPTDDDQSSELL) present in the loop between transmembrane domains III and IV. These two peptides are unique when searched against GenBankTM. Peptides were synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier protein. Rabbits were primed and boosted three times with the mix of the two coupled peptides, following the Eurogentec Double X immunization program over a time of three months. Pre-immune serum and antiserum obtained in the final bleed were purified through a HiTrap Protein A column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and used at a 1:1000 dilution unless otherwise stated. Proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207031) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Membranes were blocked with 1% blocking solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody. Antisera used were anti-GmZIP1 antiserum (described above) or anti-AtIRT1 antiserum. 2M. L. Guerinot, unpublished data. After washing off the unbound antibodies several times with 1 × TBS-Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1:20,000 dilution of sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and washed several times. Immunodetection was performed with a chemiluminescence Western blotting kit according to the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sequence analysis of the soybean cDNA showed that it encodes a protein of 354 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). A BLAST search on the translated protein sequence indicated strong homology with several members of the ZIP family as well as with other zinc and iron transporters. Consequently, we have named this cDNAGmZIP1. A phylogenetic tree obtained after compiling GmZIP1 with the sequences of 18 other known plant ZIP members (Fig.2), revealed that GmZIP1 is most closely related to AtZIP1, AtZIP3, and AtZIP5, three recently identified zinc transporters of Arabidopsis (8Guerinot M.L.

A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). According to the SMART (26Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) predictions, GmZIP1 contains eight transmembrane-spanning regions, a very short C-terminal tail, and a predicted extracellular location of both the N- and C-terminal ends. The first 20 amino acid residues were also predicted to be part of a signal peptide. The extra-membrane loop located between putative helices III and IV is rich in histidine residues. This feature is one of the characteristics of the ZIP proteins, together with completely conserved histidine and glycine residues in helix IV, which are also present in GmZIP1 at positions 212 and 217, respectively. Moreover, amino acids 207–221 of GmZIP1 give a perfect match with the bona fide signature sequence of the ZIP family (29Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H., Jr. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results, together with the presence of several putative metal ion binding sequence motifs between helices III and IV, suggest that GmZIP1 can be considered a new member of the ZIP zinc transporter family and the first one identified in soybean.Figure 1Predicted amino acid sequence of GmZIP1 and alignment with selected members of the ZIP gene family.

Although the DY1455 wild type strain can grow under zinc-deficient conditions, ZHY3 cells are very sensitive to zinc deprivation because both their high (ZRT1) and low (ZRT2) affinity zinc uptake systems have been mutated (30Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, GmZIP1-expressing ZHY3 cells were able to grow on restrictive medium, indicating that GmZIP1 could encode a putative zinc transporter. A similar experiment was performed using DEY1453 cells, which lack both high (FET3) and low (FET4) affinity iron transporters and cannot grow on iron-limited media. Under the conditions tested, transformation with GmZIP1 did not restore the growth of thefet3fet4 mutant, suggesting that GmZIP1 cannot use iron as a substrate. In both sets of experiments, the mutant strains were also transformed with pAtIRT1, which has previously been shown to complement both fet3fet4 and zrt1zrt2 cells (31Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), as a positive control. To quantify the transport of zinc by GmZIP1, uptake assays with65Zn2+ were performed in ZHY3 mutant cells. At 30 °C, zinc accumulation in GmZIP1-expressing cells was linear for at least 60 min (Fig.4 A). Cells transformed with the pFL61 empty vector, on the other hand, showed a very low level of zinc accumulation (data not shown), which presumably represented residual zinc uptake through other yeast metal ion transporters. Values obtained in these control experiments were subtracted from all the data presented. No zinc uptake could be detected when assays were conducted on ice suggesting that the zinc accumulation observed was due to an internalization of the metal rather than a nonspecific adsorption of zinc to the cell surface. An absence of uptake was also observed when cells were starved of glucose for an hour prior to starting the uptake assays (Fig. 4 A). However, no change in uptake level was noticed when pH was varied from 3 to 7 (data not shown), indicating that GmZIP1 activity is not pH-dependent. pH values higher than 7 are known to lead to the formation of monovalent Zn(OH)+, neutral Zn(OH)2, and insoluble complexes (32Reid R.J. Brookes J.D. Tester M.A. Smith F.A. Planta. 1996; 198: 39-45Crossref Google Scholar) and, therefore, were not tested. We also investigated the affinity of the uptake system over a range of zinc concentrations. Uptake was followed over a 20-min period and was found to be concentration-dependent and saturable (Fig. 4 B). The transport kinetic parameters, K m andV max, were determined from Lineweaver and Burk data transformations (Fig. 4 B, inset) and were estimated at 13.8 μm and 12.5 fmol per min per 106 cells, respectively. The specificity of GmZIP1 for zinc or other metals was assessed in competition experiments performed in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of other, non-labeled divalent cations. Among the metals tested, cadmium alone had a significant inhibitory effect on zinc uptake (TableI). It is interesting to note that neither Fe(III) nor Fe(II) could compete with zinc, in agreement with the inability of GmZIP1 to complement the fet3fet4 mutant on iron-limited media.Table IEffect of divalent metal competition on yeast and symbiosomes zinc uptakeMetal testedYeastSymbiosomes% inhibition of zinc uptakeZn2+66.668.2Cd2+51.869.5Cu2+8.432.3Fe2+7.52.4Mn2+<119.8Ni2+<115.5Co2+<16.3Ca2+n/a22.9A 10-fold excess of non-labeled metal was added to the incubation mix containing 20 μm65ZnCl2.

Standard errors were always <15%. The results presented above clearly show that the soybean GmZIP1 behaved like a zinc transporter when expressed in a heterologous system. We subsequently investigated the role of GmZIP1 in planta. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from leaves, stems, roots, and nodules and analyzed on a Northern blot (Fig.5). Under the conditions used, the probe detected GmZIP mRNA only in the nodules. TheGmZIP transcript signal only appeared in nodules of plants 18 days and older, and the abundance of transcripts did not change between nodules of 23- and 42-day-old plants (Fig. 5). No signal was observed in roots, stems, or leaves. This tissue-specific expression suggests that GmZIP1 is a symbiotic protein that is active in mature, nitrogen-fixing nodules. Since in Arabidopsis ZIP1 and ZIP3 transcripts are only observed in roots when plants are starved of zinc (25Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and since the plants used in the present study were grown in the presence of ample zinc, the results suggest either that the nodule-infected cell cytosol is depleted of zinc (perhaps by the bacteroids themselves) or that expression of the symbiotic gene is regulated by other factors. The answer to this question awaits further experimentation. To analyze the presence of GmZIP1 at the protein level and to localize it within nodules, we used both an antiserum raised against AtIRT1 and a GmZIP1-specific antibody. The AtIRT1 antiserum reacted with several proteins in a microsomal membrane preparation from nodules (see “Experimental Procedures”) but only a single protein of 34 kDa on the purified PBM (Fig. 6 A), which is the predicted size of GmZIP1. While we cannot eliminate the possibility that there is an IRT homologue on the PBM, which reacts with AtIRT1 antiserum, this is unlikely since the primers we used to amplify GmZIP1 from the nodule cDNA library should have amplified IRT clones also. A stronger reaction against the 34-kDa PBM protein was observed with the GmZIP1 antibody, which did not react with protein samples isolated from root microsomes or nodule microsomes isolated after removing the symbiosomes (Fig.6 B). PBM proteins isolated from plants of 4-, 6-, and 7-week-old plants reacted equally with the GmZIP1 antibody (Fig.6 C). The r"

The diversity of primary sequence of these enzymes coupled with distinct tissue distribution profiles argues for distinct physiological roles for each mammalian sPLA2 species.The group IIA human sPLA2 was first discovered in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and was also released from platelets (7Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immun. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has a marked preference for anionic interfaces and expresses high activity with Escherichia coli membranes often used in standard assays, while a substrate preference for phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid has been proposed (9Snitko Y. Yoon E.T. Cho W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The enzyme is now recognized as expressing antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, while its presence at high concentrations in inflammatory fluids (7Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar) and human tears (10Qu X.D. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with this activity as a major role of this phospholipase. Similarly, the enzyme is released from Paneth cells of the intestine (11Harwig S.L. Tan L. Qu X.D. Cho Y. Eisenhauer P.B. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 603-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and macrophages (7Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immun. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both cells being involved in the human antibacterial response. It has been proposed that the antibacterial role of the group IIA enzyme is directly linked to the highly cationic nature of the protein, allowing bacterial cell wall penetration (12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protein has a net tabulated charge of +19 (+27; −8), assuming cationic groups are His, Arg, and Lys and anionic groups are Asp and Glu (13Scott D.L. Mandel A.M. Sigler P.B. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The human group V and X enzymes have been identified more recently and their ability to hydrolyze mammalian cell membranes has been investigated (4Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, only the antibacterial properties of the group V enzyme have been described (16Gronroos J.O. Laine V.J.O. Janssen M.J.W. Egmond M.R. Nevalainen T.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4029-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These two enzymes show notable difference in tabulated positive charges of +10 (+18; −8) and −3 (+12; −15), respectively.In this paper, we show using charge reversal mutagenesis that the unique ability of the human group IIA enzyme to penetrate the bacterial cell wall and to hydrolyze the cell membrane is attributable to the highly cationic nature of the enzyme. A loss of this hydrolyzing ability together with the loss of the antibacterial properties of the enzyme parallels removal of this positive charge. In all cases, bacterial killing paralleled the ability of the enzyme to achieve cell membrane hydrolysis; however, the expressed bactericidal properties were much less sensitive to enzyme activity, requiring prolonged exposure with higher concentrations of enzyme. It would appear that in the absence of other factors, these bacteria are able to recover from a considerable insult in terms of membrane phospholipid hydrolysis, as previously reported (17Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weiss J. Elsbach P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).In contrast to the group IIA enzyme, we show that the human group V was very much less effective in its ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall and hydrolyze the cell membrane although the group V enzyme has considerable cationic character. The group IB, IIE, IIF, and X human enzymes were also studied, and their characteristics are not consistent with them having an antibacterial role.DISCUSSIONThe precise physiological roles of human group IIA sPLA2 remain unclear, and the discovery of an increasing number of sPLA2s has added to the complexity of the situation (1Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The fact that all these enzymes are of similar size and can be confidently predicted to have similar crystal structures coupled to only modest differences in active site specificity focuses attention on the interfacial and other surface properties of these enzymes. Arguably, it is these major differences in surface properties that reflect the physiological roles of these groups of enzymes. Moreover, since these enzymes are secreted, it is the extracellular environment that would be expected to provide the necessary membrane surface and other factors for the enzyme to function.In the case of the human group IIA enzyme, it is the extreme cationic nature of the protein together with an absence of an interfacial tryptophan (28Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that dominates its surface properties. The enzyme binds tightly to heparin (19Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and has a marked preference for anionic phospholipid interfaces, not normally a characteristic of the outer monolayer of the eukaryotic cell membrane. A unique property of this enzyme is its almost complete lack of ability to hydrolyze such zwitterionic plasma membranes except when using concentrations of enzyme far in excess of that seen in the cell except perhaps under the most extreme inflammatory conditions (4Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13203-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such characteristics make the enzyme particularly well designed for it to have selective antibacterial properties, because bacteria are characterized by their anionic nature in terms of cell membrane, cell wall, and, in the case of Gram-negative bacteria, the lipopolysaccharide coat.The antibacterial potential of the group IIA enzyme has been recognized for some time (reviewed in Ref. 12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the importance of surface positive charge in allowing penetration of the wall has been discussed (12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other human sPLA2s do not have the extreme cationic nature commensurate with this antibacterial function, although the human group V enzyme does show considerable cationic character.In this paper, we have compared the bacterial cell membrane hydrolyzing potential of the human group IB, IIA, IIE, IIF, V, and X enzymes. The results clearly demonstrate that the group IIA has enhanced ability to hydrolyze the cell membrane of suspensions of Gram-positive bacteria, a characteristic that reflects the ability of the enzyme to penetrate the anionic peptidoglycan cell wall. Once the permeability barrier of the cell wall is removed, then all enzymes express similar activity against the bacterial cell membrane.The bacterial cell wall is a structurally complex barrier that varies considerably from organism to organism. Therefore, the permeability properties to a large molecule such as a sPLA2 will vary accordingly. In the case of M. luteus, this has provided a good model system, because the IIA enzyme appears to be fully permeable to the cell wall in comparison with other sPLA2s, while the cell wall can be made permeable by treatment with lysozyme. Similarly, we found that Listeria was very sensitive to the action of the IIA enzyme. It was the most sensitive to hydrolysis of the organisms tested, confirming published data (10Qu X.D. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other bacteria such as S. aureus have a more condensed cell wall, and permeability of even the IIA enzyme is restricted and may be sensitive to the physiological state of the organism (30Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Results using suspensions of M. luteus have highlighted the dramatic ability of the IIA enzymes to hydrolyze the cell wall in such suspensions by making use of a real time fluorescence displacement assay that is well suited for such studies. Although an indirect assay, the fluorescence data correspond well with radioactive assays and, in particular, the measurement of phospholipid content before and after sPLA2 treatment using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (27Buckland A.G. Heeley E.L. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fluorescence assays highlight the greatly reduced ability of other human sPLA2s to hydrolyze this organism unless the cell wall has been previously permeabilized by lysozyme treatment. It is noteworthy that the group V enzyme, which is also a basic protein (tabulated net charge +10), has a modest ability to penetrate the cell wall. The basic bee venom enzyme (tabulated net charge +9) was included in this comparison and also was unable to demonstrate significant ability to hydrolyze M. luteus cell suspensions. However, the size and structure of this enzyme are sufficiently different from group I and group II enzymes to make direct comparisons more difficult.Our understanding of the structure and function of the group IID, IIE, and X enzymes is at an early stage; however, the data presented would suggest that these enzymes do not have a bactericidal role in the body.The major role of surface cationic charge in allowing the group IIA enzyme to penetrate the highly anionic cell wall has been confirmed by structural studies involving charge reversal mutagenesis in which surface cationic residues have been turned into anionic residues. It is clear that the loss of cell wall permeability correlated with loss of positive charge. By the time that five-site mutations had been introduced (net positive charge of 9) this permeability was less than 1% of the wild-type enzyme. This loss of permeability was monitored as reduced access to the underlying cell membrane, resulting in corresponding reduced rates of hydrolysis. Because the strategy of charge reversal mutagenesis involved different clusters of cationic residues (19Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it is apparent that there are no specific cationic domains that are required to allow cell wall permeability. The direct involvement of the interfacial surface in cell wall penetration is unlikely based on the results with the five-site mutant (K53E/R54E/R58E/K124E/R127D) that involves residues distant from the interfacial binding surface (20Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W.H. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The model we propose (12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) involves multiple electrostatic interactions between the enzyme and the cell wall that would both increase the local concentration of enzyme at the cell surface and promote passage through anionic pores as a result of the continuous making and breaking of electrostatic bonds. Overall, the very high affinity of this enzyme for the anionic phospholipid interfaces would promote the net transfer of enzyme from the cell wall to the bacterial cell membrane.In the case of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme has to first penetrate the lipopolysaccharide coat. The pioneering work of Elsbach, Weiss, and colleagues (31Weiss J. Inada M. Elsbach P. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26331-26337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Elsbach P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) has already highlighted the role of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein in this penetration, where it increases the permeability of the lipopolysaccharide coat (33Wiese A.

Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10311-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This enhanced permeability would allow access of the enzyme to the cell wall, where the selective permeability of sPLA2s would be expressed.

The group IIA human sPLA2 was first discovered in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and was also released from platelets (7Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immun. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has a marked preference for anionic interfaces and expresses high activity with Escherichia coli membranes often used in standard assays, while a substrate preference for phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid has been proposed (9Snitko Y. Yoon E.T. Cho W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The enzyme is now recognized as expressing antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, while its presence at high concentrations in inflammatory fluids (7Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar) and human tears (10Qu X.D. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with this activity as a major role of this phospholipase. Similarly, the enzyme is released from Paneth cells of the intestine (11Harwig S.L. Tan L. Qu X.D. Cho Y. Eisenhauer P.B. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 603-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and macrophages (7Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immun. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both cells being involved in the human antibacterial response. It has been proposed that the antibacterial role of the group IIA enzyme is directly linked to the highly cationic nature of the protein, allowing bacterial cell wall penetration (12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protein has a net tabulated charge of +19 (+27; −8), assuming cationic groups are His, Arg, and Lys and anionic groups are Asp and Glu (13Scott D.L. Mandel A.M. Sigler P.B. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The human group V and X enzymes have been identified more recently and their ability to hydrolyze mammalian cell membranes has been investigated (4Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, only the antibacterial properties of the group V enzyme have been described (16Gronroos J.O. Laine V.J.O. Janssen M.J.W. Egmond M.R. Nevalainen T.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4029-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These two enzymes show notable difference in tabulated positive charges of +10 (+18; −8) and −3 (+12; −15), respectively. In this paper, we show using charge reversal mutagenesis that the unique ability of the human group IIA enzyme to penetrate the bacterial cell wall and to hydrolyze the cell membrane is attributable to the highly cationic nature of the enzyme. A loss of this hydrolyzing ability together with the loss of the antibacterial properties of the enzyme parallels removal of this positive charge. In all cases, bacterial killing paralleled the ability of the enzyme to achieve cell membrane hydrolysis; however, the expressed bactericidal properties were much less sensitive to enzyme activity, requiring prolonged exposure with higher concentrations of enzyme. It would appear that in the absence of other factors, these bacteria are able to recover from a considerable insult in terms of membrane phospholipid hydrolysis, as previously reported (17Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weiss J. Elsbach P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast to the group IIA enzyme, we show that the human group V was very much less effective in its ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall and hydrolyze the cell membrane although the group V enzyme has considerable cationic character. The group IB, IIE, IIF, and X human enzymes were also studied, and their characteristics are not consistent with them having an antibacterial role. DISCUSSIONThe precise physiological roles of human group IIA sPLA2 remain unclear, and the discovery of an increasing number of sPLA2s has added to the complexity of the situation (1Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The fact that all these enzymes are of similar size and can be confidently predicted to have similar crystal structures coupled to only modest differences in active site specificity focuses attention on the interfacial and other surface properties of these enzymes. Arguably, it is these major differences in surface properties that reflect the physiological roles of these groups of enzymes. Moreover, since these enzymes are secreted, it is the extracellular environment that would be expected to provide the necessary membrane surface and other factors for the enzyme to function.In the case of the human group IIA enzyme, it is the extreme cationic nature of the protein together with an absence of an interfacial tryptophan (28Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that dominates its surface properties. The enzyme binds tightly to heparin (19Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and has a marked preference for anionic phospholipid interfaces, not normally a characteristic of the outer monolayer of the eukaryotic cell membrane. A unique property of this enzyme is its almost complete lack of ability to hydrolyze such zwitterionic plasma membranes except when using concentrations of enzyme far in excess of that seen in the cell except perhaps under the most extreme inflammatory conditions (4Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13203-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such characteristics make the enzyme particularly well designed for it to have selective antibacterial properties, because bacteria are characterized by their anionic nature in terms of cell membrane, cell wall, and, in the case of Gram-negative bacteria, the lipopolysaccharide coat.The antibacterial potential of the group IIA enzyme has been recognized for some time (reviewed in Ref. 12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the importance of surface positive charge in allowing penetration of the wall has been discussed (12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other human sPLA2s do not have the extreme cationic nature commensurate with this antibacterial function, although the human group V enzyme does show considerable cationic character.In this paper, we have compared the bacterial cell membrane hydrolyzing potential of the human group IB, IIA, IIE, IIF, V, and X enzymes. The results clearly demonstrate that the group IIA has enhanced ability to hydrolyze the cell membrane of suspensions of Gram-positive bacteria, a characteristic that reflects the ability of the enzyme to penetrate the anionic peptidoglycan cell wall. Once the permeability barrier of the cell wall is removed, then all enzymes express similar activity against the bacterial cell membrane.The bacterial cell wall is a structurally complex barrier that varies considerably from organism to organism. Therefore, the permeability properties to a large molecule such as a sPLA2 will vary accordingly. In the case of M. luteus, this has provided a good model system, because the IIA enzyme appears to be fully permeable to the cell wall in comparison with other sPLA2s, while the cell wall can be made permeable by treatment with lysozyme. Similarly, we found that Listeria was very sensitive to the action of the IIA enzyme. It was the most sensitive to hydrolysis of the organisms tested, confirming published data (10Qu X.D. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other bacteria such as S. aureus have a more condensed cell wall, and permeability of even the IIA enzyme is restricted and may be sensitive to the physiological state of the organism (30Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Results using suspensions of M. luteus have highlighted the dramatic ability of the IIA enzymes to hydrolyze the cell wall in such suspensions by making use of a real time fluorescence displacement assay that is well suited for such studies. Although an indirect assay, the fluorescence data correspond well with radioactive assays and, in particular, the measurement of phospholipid content before and after sPLA2 treatment using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (27Buckland A.G. Heeley E.L. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fluorescence assays highlight the greatly reduced ability of other human sPLA2s to hydrolyze this organism unless the cell wall has been previously permeabilized by lysozyme treatment. It is noteworthy that the group V enzyme, which is also a basic protein (tabulated net charge +10), has a modest ability to penetrate the cell wall. The basic bee venom enzyme (tabulated net charge +9) was included in this comparison and also was unable to demonstrate significant ability to hydrolyze M. luteus cell suspensions. However, the size and structure of this enzyme are sufficiently different from group I and group II enzymes to make direct comparisons more difficult.Our understanding of the structure and function of the group IID, IIE, and X enzymes is at an early stage; however, the data presented would suggest that these enzymes do not have a bactericidal role in the body.The major role of surface cationic charge in allowing the group IIA enzyme to penetrate the highly anionic cell wall has been confirmed by structural studies involving charge reversal mutagenesis in which surface cationic residues have been turned into anionic residues. It is clear that the loss of cell wall permeability correlated with loss of positive charge. By the time that five-site mutations had been introduced (net positive charge of 9) this permeability was less than 1% of the wild-type enzyme. This loss of permeability was monitored as reduced access to the underlying cell membrane, resulting in corresponding reduced rates of hydrolysis. Because the strategy of charge reversal mutagenesis involved different clusters of cationic residues (19Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it is apparent that there are no specific cationic domains that are required to allow cell wall permeability. The direct involvement of the interfacial surface in cell wall penetration is unlikely based on the results with the five-site mutant (K53E/R54E/R58E/K124E/R127D) that involves residues distant from the interfacial binding surface (20Koduri R.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The model we propose (12Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) involves multiple electrostatic interactions between the enzyme and the cell wall that would both increase the local concentration of enzyme at the cell surface and promote passage through anionic pores as a result of the continuous making and breaking of electrostatic bonds. Overall, the very high affinity of this enzyme for the anionic phospholipid interfaces would promote the net transfer of enzyme from the cell wall to the bacterial cell membrane.In the case of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme has to first penetrate the lipopolysaccharide coat. The pioneering work of Elsbach, Weiss, and colleagues (31Weiss J. Inada M. Elsbach P. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26331-26337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Elsbach P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) has already highlighted the role of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein in this penetration, where it increases the permeability of the lipopolysaccharide coat (33Wiese A.

Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10311-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

High mRNA levels were detected in prostate, cartilage, kidney, liver, heart, and muscle, whereas transcripts were barely detected in thymus and leukocytes. At least 11 RNA splice variants were found, transcribed from 19 exons on human chromosome 3p25.3–3p24.1. Differential exon usage was found in different tissues by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Predicted proteins range from 186 to 720 amino acids. Soluble secreted proteins lacking transmembrane and intracellular domains are predicted from several splice isoforms and may function as extracellular antagonists to cytokine signaling by functioning as soluble decoy receptors. Using antibodies directed at the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains of this protein, we investigated its localization and found that it was expressed in a variety of normal human tissues including prostate and in prostate cancer. interleukin interleukin-17 receptor-like protein extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase c-jun N-terminal kinases stress-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase nuclear factor κ chain transcription in B cells expressed sequence tag extracellular domain, CYTO, cytoplasmic domain reverse transcriptase Interleukins were historically defined as soluble secreted factors expressed in immune cells that mediate interactions between leukocytes.

However, the signal transduction pathway and the in vivo functions of this receptor are not known.The existence of several IL-17-related proteins led us to explore the existence of additional members of the IL-17 receptor family.

We characterize its expression in various tissues and demonstrate differential exon usage in different tissues. We present evidence of splice variants that code for single-pass transmembrane proteins as well as secreted proteins that lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and may function as soluble decoy receptors.

Rose, personal communication, manuscript in preparation. has identified new members of the IL-17 family of cytokines and implicated them in a variety of normal and disease-related conditions. The number of newly identified IL-17 family cytokines provided an impetus to explore the existence of additional receptors. The aim of the present study was to identify new receptors based on homology to the published IL-17 receptor. To this end, we have searched the public EST data base and identified a cDNA coding for a novel protein related to IL-17R. We named this protein IL17-RL (receptor-like) based on its homology to IL-17R. Its primary sequence suggests that, like IL-17R, it is a single-pass transmembrane protein with an extracellular N terminus. We characterized its expression in a variety of human tissues at the mRNA level, as well as on tissue extracts and histological sections at the protein level. We determined its genomic structure and found evidence of alternative splicing even in the limited number of EST sequences available in the public data bases.The RNA splicing of this gene is of particular interest because a number of the observed splice variants introduce frameshifts and stop codons before the C-terminal transmembrane domain, resulting in the translation of secreted rather than transmembrane protein. We found 12 different splice variants in the 108 ESTs currently in the data base. Exons 7, 12, 14, and 15 were spliced out in several ESTs, and exons 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 18, and 19 have alternate splice donor or acceptor sites. Some ESTs have combinations of two or more nearby exons spliced out. Additional splice variants with combinations of distant exons are possible, but due to the limited length of sequence available from each EST, we have no direct evidence for this. Also, further splice variations in the 5′ end of the mRNA may have been missed because of the inherent bias toward 3′ ends in the EST data base. The extent of alternative splicing is not immediately evident from Northern blot analysis because many of the exons are of similar size and are relatively small when compared with the overall length of the mRNA. However, we have confirmed the presence of multiple transcripts from single tissues and cell lines using RT-PCR (data not shown).We have demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR that most of the mRNA does not contain exon 7. Moreover, there is some evidence that exon 7 usage is tissue-specific because it is present less frequently in RNA isolated from the brain than from the liver or heart. This implies that there may be tissue-specific regulatory factors that control the RNA splicing of this gene and also that there may be a functional difference between proteins made from mRNA with and without exon 7. This raises the additional possibility that regulation of splicing may occur in response to the activation of growth factor signaling pathways.The assembled full-length cDNA has a single large open reading frame that is predicted to encode a 720-amino acid single-pass transmembrane protein. Translation of the alternatively spliced mRNAs results in at least eleven additional proteins. Although the open reading frame of downstream exons is not affected by the removal of exons 7, 12, or 15, the removal of most other exons causes a frameshift that introduces in-frame stop codons. An in-frame stop codon before exon 17, which codes for the transmembrane domain, will result in translation of a secreted protein. Therefore, the translation products can be classified into two general categories. Both categories contain the presumed ligand binding extracellular domain. The first category is full-length proteins, which have the ligand binding extracellular domain along with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Since the cytoplasmic domain is predicted to contain several phosphorylation sites, this first category of proteins has the potential both for ligand binding and for subsequent activation of cytosolic signal transduction pathways. The second category is truncated proteins, which contain the extracellular domain but in which a stop codon occurs in or before the transmembrane domain. This category consists of either membrane-associated or soluble secreted proteins. Presumably these proteins retain the ligand binding activity but without the capacity for activation of signal transduction pathways. It is likely that the soluble receptor isoforms may thus function as signaling antagonists or decoy receptors.Analysis by immunoblotting confirms that multiple proteins with different molecular weights are detected in homogenates of a single tissue, presumably from translations of alternatively spliced mRNA. Immunohistochemical analysis also indicates that multiple isoforms of the proteins can exist because some tissues bind strongly to antibodies directed against both the extracellular and the cytoplasmic domain, whereas other tissues only bind strongly to antibodies directed against the extracellular domain. Especially noteworthy is the localization in the prostate and prostate cancers. This differential localization of soluble and membrane-bound receptor implies that certain tissues expressing primarily soluble receptor may not respond to the ligand.As there was a strong immunohistochemical localization of the novel IL17-RL in prostate by the antibody directed against the extracellular domain (anti-ECD), it was of interest to also compare the localization in prostate cancers. The results are depicted in Fig. 7. In the normal prostate, IL17-RL was localized in both the epithelial and stromal compartments. In prostate cancers with increasing Gleason grade, there was a progressive loss of staining in the epithelium and increased staining in the stroma. The antibody used is directed against the N-terminal extracellular domain, which is present in both the transmembrane and the soluble decoy isoforms of IL17-RL. Thus, it is possible that in prostate cancer, the redistribution of the receptor from epithelial to stromal compartments signifies a dysregulation of expression or signaling of IL17-RL.With the completion of the human genome project came the realization that the human genome contains far fewer genes than originally predicted (31Lander E.S.

The existence of several IL-17-related proteins led us to explore the existence of additional members of the IL-17 receptor family. With this in mind, we searched human sequences in the GenBankTM data base, and in this report, we describe the cloning of a new IL-17R-related mRNA and elucidation of its genomic structure. We characterize its expression in various tissues and demonstrate differential exon usage in different tissues. We present evidence of splice variants that code for single-pass transmembrane proteins as well as secreted proteins that lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and may function as soluble decoy receptors. This novel receptor is expressed in human prostate and in prostate cancer. DISCUSSIONPrevious work from our laboratory and others (1Li H. Chen J. Huang A. Stinson J. Heldens S. Foster J. Dowd P.

We characterizedCe-cpl-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans cathepsin L-like cysteine protease. RNA interference with Ce-cpl-1activity resulted in embryonic lethality and a transient delayed growth of larvae to egg producing adults, suggesting an essential role forcpl-1 during embryogenesis, and most likely during post-embryonic development. Cpl-1 gene (Ce-cpl-1:lacZ) is widely expressed in the intestine and hypodermal cells of transgenic worms, while the fusion protein (Ce-CPL-1::GFP) was expressed in the hypodermis, pharynx, and gonad. The CPL-1 native protein accumulates in early to late stage embryos and becomes highly concentrated in gut cells during late embryonic development. CPL-1 is also present near the periphery of the eggshell as well as in the cuticle of larval stages suggesting that it may function not only in embryogenesis but also in further development of the worm. Although the precise role of Ce-CPL-1 during embryogenesis is not yet clear it could be involved in the processing of nutrients responsible for synthesis and/or in the degradation of eggshell. Moreover, an increase in the cpl-1 mRNA is seen in the intermolt period approximately 4 h prior to each molt. During this process Ce-CPL-1 may act as a proteolytic enzyme in the processing/degradation of cuticular or other proteins. Similar localization of a related cathepsin L in the filarial nematodeOnchocerca volvulus, eggshell and cuticle, suggests that some of the Ce-CPL-1 function during development may be conserved in other parasitic nematodes.

Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Within the papain family, the cathepsins can be subdivided into more than 10 subfamilies on the basis of their primary sequence and enzymatic activity (2Santamaria I. Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The family includes cathepsin B, C, L, and Z, all of which contain an essential cysteine residue in their active site but differ in tissue distribution and in some enzymatic properties, such as substrate specificity and pH stability. Cathepsin B-like cysteine protease genes occur as a large multigene family in a wide range of parasitic and free-living nematodes. Several cathepsin B genes were reported to be expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans, some of which were restricted to the intestines of larval and adult transgenic worms (3Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 315-327Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Pratt D. Armes L.G. Hageman R. Reynolds V. Boisvenue R.J. Cox G.N. Mol. Biochem.

Interestingly, the structurally similar Hemonchus contortus (3Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 315-327Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Pratt D. Armes L.G.

Parasitol. 1999; 43: 161-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cathepsin B homologues were also expressed in the gut and were suggested to be potentially involved in feeding (5Ray C. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7McKerrow J.H. Drug Disc. Desi. 1994; 2: 437-444Google Scholar), such as nutrient digestion. Heterologous transformation of C. elegans with an H. contortus cathepsin B gene promoter has demonstrated also conservation of the mechanisms controlling its spatial expression in free-living and parasitic nematodes (8Britton C. Redmond D.L. Knox D.P. McKerrow J.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and therefore both enzymes were hypothesized to be not only structurally similar, but also functionally homologous and important for proper feeding (4Pratt D. Armes L.G. Hageman R. Reynolds V. Boisvenue R.J. Cox G.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7McKerrow J.H. Drug Disc. Desi. 1994; 2: 437-444Google Scholar). Cathepsin L and Z-like proteases were shown to be present in many parasitic nematodes, where they are speculated to have diverse biological functions including invasion, feeding, molting, and immune evasion (reviewed in Refs. 6Tort J. Brindley P.J. Knox D. Wolfe K.H. Dalton J.P. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 43: 161-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Koiwa H. Shade R.E. Zhu-Salzman K. D'Urzo M.P. Murdock L.L. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M.

Many of these cathepsins have homologues in C. elegans suggesting that they may be involved in functions conserved across different nematode species. Yet not much is known about their precise function. In Dirofilaria immitis (11Richter J.K. Sakanari J.A. Frank G.R. Grieve R.B. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Brugia pahangi 1X. Hang, C. Britton, and J. McKerrow, unpublished data.1X. Hang, C. Britton, and J. McKerrow, unpublished data. cysteine proteases were shown to be associated with molting as well as activities that might facilitate larval migration. The potential role of cysteine proteases during molting was indirectly established in Onchocerca volvulus by showing that the peptidyl monofluoromethyl ketones, low molecular weight irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors, inhibit the molting of third stage larvae (L3) in a time- and dose-dependent manner (12Lustigman S. McKerrow J.H. Shah K. Lui J. Huima T. Hough M. Brotman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30181-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These irreversible inhibitors can block cathepsin Z and L-like, but not the B-like enzyme activities, suggesting that a cathepsin L, as well as a cathepsin Z, might be involved in the molting process. The target cysteine proteases were indirectly localized in the granules of the glandular esophagus ofO. volvulus L3 using the biotin-Phe-Ala-CHN2inhibitor (12Lustigman S. McKerrow J.H. Shah K. Lui J. Huima T. Hough M. Brotman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30181-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In further studies, a larval O. volvuluscysteine protease named LOVCP was cloned (12Lustigman S. McKerrow J.H. Shah K. Lui J. Huima T. Hough M. Brotman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30181-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). LOVCP as well as its homologue in Toxocara canis and C. eleganswere recently classified as a novel monophylectic group in the papain family of cysteine proteases, named cathepsin Z (13Falcone F.H. Tetteh K.K. Hunt P. Blaxter M.L. Loukas A. Maizels R.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The O. volvulus cathepsin Z was shown to be required for molting and the development of fourth-stage larvae (L4) based on its localization using monospecific anti-LOVCP antibodies. The native enzyme was localized in molting L3 in the region where the separation between the cuticles of L3 and L4 takes place. The general role of the O. volvulus cathepsin Z-like enzyme as well as its C. elegans homologue (14Hashmi S. Tawe W. Lustigman S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) during molting was therefore hypothesized to be as a proteolytic enzyme involved in cuticle degradation, similar to that observed in the entomopathogenic fungiMetarhizium anisopliae with its endogenous cysteine protease Pr4 (15Cole Jr., S.C. Charnleg A.K. Cooper R.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 189-196Crossref Google Scholar). This function as well as other yet unknown functions of cathepsin Z and L cysteine proteases were previously hypothesized to be present in nematodes based on the immunolocalization of onchocystatin, an endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor, in thin sections of O. volvulus. Onchocystatin was expressed in L3, molting L3, adult worms, and eggshells around developing microfilaria (16Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T. Prince A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T. Prince A.M. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17339-17346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that its target cysteine protease(s) is possibly involved in regulating activities such as molting, cuticle remodeling, and embryogenesis during the development of the parasite in the host. Importantly, C. elegans has two homologues of onchocystatin (14Hashmi S. Tawe W. Lustigman S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of their target enzymes in this worm as well. The indirect approaches as described above, however, do not provide conclusive information on the precise function of these proteases. Recently, a new family of cathepsin L-like sequences with similarity to previously characterized mammalian cathepsin L-like enzymes was identified in the O. volvulus as well as in other filarial L3 EST data bases, 2D. Guiliano, unpublished data.2D. Guiliano, unpublished data. and in other parasitic nematodes. 3C. Britton and L. Murray, unpublished data.3C. Britton and L. Murray, unpublished data.Their function is not as yet known. We have identified a related cathepsin L-like protease sequence (T03E6.7) within the C. elegans complete genome data base (ACeDB), and used the C.elegans powerful system for investigating its functionsin vivo during development. To determine the function of the cathepsin L protease we took advantage of methods available in C. elegans that enable analysis of gene promoter activity and gene function in individual cells. Based on the obtained information we could predict its potential physiological role in filarial parasites. This study is the first to directly demonstrate the functional importance of cathepsin L in nematode development. A BLAST search (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar) of the C. elegans genome data base (ACeDB, www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/C_elegans/wormpep/1) and the nr data base using the Ov-CPL (accession number AF331036) and other filarial nematodes amino acid sequences, Di-CPL (accession number AF001101), Bp-CPL (accession number AF031819.1) identified a predicted C. elegans cathepsin L-like gene (T03E6.7), which was namedCe-cpl-1.4 ACe-cpl-1 cDNA clone containing the full-length sequence was also identified in the EST data base (accession number C12099) and the corresponding λ ZAP II phage was obtained from Yuji Kohara (clone yk146d10, C. elegans consortium, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). The pBluescript phagemid was excised and the DNA sequenced in both directions to confirm the predicted amino acid sequence. Signal sequences and putative cleavage sites were identified using the SignalP server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). Prediction of the pro-region cleavage site as well as the active sites were based on alignment of the CPL protein sequences was made using Cluster W multiple sequence alignment. Analysis of the promoter region ofCe-cpl-1 gene was performed using Genefinder provided by BCM server (www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/searchlauncher). C. elegans strains used in this study were the wild-type Bristol N2 strain and unc-76 mutant strain DR96 (unc-76(e911)V) (19Brenner M. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both provided by theCaenorhabditis Genetics Center. Strains were maintained on NGM agar plates as previously described (19Brenner M. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR) was carried out using first strand cDNA generated from total RNA collected from synchronous L1, L2, L3, L4, and young adultC. elegans cultures at 2-h intervals, as previously described (20Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The stage-specific cDNA samples were kindly provided by Iain Johnstone (Wellcome Center for Molecular Parasitology, University of Glasgow, UK) and used according to the established protocols. Gene-specific cDNA fragments were amplified using two sets of PCR primers, one set was specific forCe-cpl-1 (CPF1, sense, 5′-GTCTCCGTGCTCTGGGTCGGTTCCGTATC-3′ and CPR1, antisense, 5′-CCATGGTGTCGACACCGAGGAGTCATAC-3′) and the other set was specific for an internal control, the ama-1transcript (20Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The primers were designed to span an intron to distinguish cDNA from contaminating gDNA products. The following PCR conditions, which allowed reactants to remain in excess, were used: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Amplified products were separated on 2% agarose gels, Southern blotted, and probed with the appropriate end-labeled oligonucleotides. After autoradiography, specific bands corresponding to amplified cpl-1 and control ama-1 products were excised from the blot for each time point and counted in scintillant. The relative content of the transcript corresponding to the Ce-cpl-1 gene is expressed as the ratio of the signal for cpl-1 for each developmental stage to that ofama-1. The sqRT-PCR was carried out on two occasions, with very similar results, one of which is presented. The double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) procedure was carried out as described by Fireet al. (21Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11651) Google Scholar) and Tabara et al. (22Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C.C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Three different regions of the Ce-cpl-1 gene were PCR amplified from cosmid T03E6 DNA using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the following PCR primers (underline indicates artificial restriction enzyme sites introduced for cloning): CPexon1F (XhoI), sense, 5′-AATCTCGAGATTCATTCTTCTGGCACTG-3′, and CPexon1R (XbaI), antisense, 5′-AAATCTAGATTCTTACCAAGTCAGC-3′ (PCR product 275 bp); CPexon3F (PstI), sense, 5′-TTTCTGCAGCCAGATGAGGTTGAC-3′ and CPexon3R (PstI), antisense 5′-ACCCTGCAGGTAAAGTTGGAAGCTGC-3′ (PCR product 453 bp); CPexons3+4F (XbaI), sense, 5′-AAATCTAGACGACTGCTCTACCAAGTAC-3′, and CPexons3+4R (XhoI), antisense, 5′-GACCTCGAGATAACTGGCCTTGGTGGC-3′ (PCR product 1.07 kb). Positions and sizes of the resulting PCR products are indicated in Fig. 1B. The three DNA fragments and the full-lengthCe-cpl-1 cDNA present in clone yk146d10 were cloned separately into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as templates for RNA synthesis. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) used for RNAi experiments was prepared following the Fire et al. (21Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11651) Google Scholar) protocol. Briefly, forin vitro transcription, each of the pBluescript plasmid DNA constructs was linearized with the appropriate restriction enzyme and single-stranded sense or antisense RNA was synthesized using the RiboMAX RNA Large-Scale Production System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturers instructions. Equal amounts of each set of sense and antisense RNA strand were then annealed by incubation in injection buffer (20 mm KPO4, 3 mmK citrate, 2% PEG 6000, pH 7.5) for 10 min at 68 °C and 30 min at 37 °C. Double-stranded RNA (concentration 0.5 mg/ml) was then injected into the gonad of 25–30 young adult C. eleganshermaphrodites. Injected worms were left for 16–24 h at 20 °C to recover and to lay any eggs present in utero prior to microinjection, and then transferred to individual plates at 24-h intervals. The F1 progeny was quantified and examined for embryonic lethality or abnormal development. RNAi using the soaking protocol was done on L3 and L4 as described by Tabara et al. (22Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C.C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 C. elegans worms were incubated in 15 μl of 0.2 m sucrose in 0.1 × PBS containing 1 mg/ml dsRNA pre-mixed with 1 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 24 h, soaked larvae were transferred to individual plates and their development examined for 4–5 days. Larvae soaked in 0.2 m sucrose in 0.1 × PBS without dsRNA served as the control. The length and width of each treated worm were measured under microscope using ocular and stage micrometer. Data were analyzed by One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Student-Newman-Keuls Comparison Test (GraphPad InStat Software Inc.). Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Loss ofcpl-1 transcript following dsRNA injection was examined by RT-PCR using the same cpl-1 and ama-1 internal primers described above. Approximately 20 RNAi injected adult hermaphrodites or 300 RNAi mutant embryos were collected and washed twice in 1 ml of PBS. Wild-type adults and embryos were used as controls for normal gene expression levels. Adult and embryo pellets were then resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K), quick-frozen at −80 °C for 10 min, followed by incubation at 55 °C for 1 h. The RNA was extracted using Total RNA Isolation Reagent (Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd.) and the RT-PCR was carried out using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Each 50-μl reaction mixture was split into two tubes into which either cpl-1 primers or ama-1 control primers were added. After 35 cycles of amplification, the RT-PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. Both transcriptional and translationalCe-cpl-1 reporter gene fusion constructs were generated and their expression patterns examined. For the transcriptional fusion construct, a promoter region of 1.76-kb ofcpl-1 upstream sequence, was generated by PCR on T03E6 cosmid DNA using Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following PCR primers: CPpromF1 (SphI), sense, 5′-ACAGCATGCTCCCGAAAAAAACTTCAATATTCTG-3′, corresponding to positions −1761 to −1736 relative to the ATG start codon, and CPpromR1 (XbaI), antisense, 5′-CGGTCTAGACTGGAATTTTATAACATTTAAAAT-3′, complementary to positions −2 to −25 relative to the ATG start codon (Fig. 1A). Following restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR fragment was cloned into lacZ reporter vector pPD96.04 containing a nuclear localization signal (kindly supplied by A. Fire). The translational fusion construct (pSL104) contained a 3.6-kb genomic fragment including 1.03 kb of the potential promoter region and all the four exons and three introns. This fragment was amplified by PCR on T03E6 cosmid DNA using the following primers: F1 (SphI), sense, 5′-CATGCATGCATCTCACCGTCTTCACCAGG-3′ corresponding to position −1030 to −1010 relative to the ATG start codon and R1 (AgeI), antisense, 5′-GCTACCGGTGCGACTCCGCAGTGATTGTT-3′, complementary to position 2550 to 2570 within the cpl-1 gene relative to the ATG start codon. The PCR amplified gene fragment was first cloned into the PCR2.1 cloning vector using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the gfp reporter vector pPD95.75 (kindly supplied by A. Fire). Plasmid DNA of the construct was prepared using the ConcertTM Rapid Plasmid Miniprep System (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that the last exon of cpl-1 is in-frame with gfp. Transformation of C. elegans was performed by microinjection of plasmid DNA into the distal arm of the hermaphrodite gonad as described previously (23Fire A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2673-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmid DNA corresponding to the transcriptional construct (25 μg/ml) or translational construct (60 μg/ml) was co-injected with a marker plasmid DNA (pRF4 at 100 μg/ml) containing a dominant mutant allele of the rol-6gene (su1006) (24Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). Transformants were identified by their right roller phenotype (25Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To allow examination of expression from transcriptional fusion constructs in the absence of any enhancers from therol-6 gene, transformation rescue of the unc-76mutant strain DR96 was carried out with plasmid p76–16B (a gift of Laird Bloom, MIT Center for Cancer Research), which contains the wild-type neuronally expressed unc-76 gene. Lines in which F2 and subsequent generations showed the roller orunc-rescue phenotype were stained for β-galactosidase expression, as previously described (3Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 315-327Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (final concentration 0.1%) as a co-stain to aid in the identification of cell types. GFP was visualized by mounting live transgenic worms on a 2% agarose pad in 0.01% sodium azide, that inhibits their movement, and viewing under a fluorescence filter. At least three independent lines were examined for each construct. A fragment of Ce-cpl-1 cDNA encoding the mature enzyme (Fig. 1A, amino acids 121–337) was amplified and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Bioscience Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The recombinant GST-Ce-mCPL-1 protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies and was therefore purified from the 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, insoluble pellet. The pellet was solubilized in 6 m urea in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, followed by preparative separation using the Prep Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers instructions. Fractions containing the purified recombinant GST-Ce-mCPL-1 polypeptide were identified using antibodies against GST. A mouse antiserum was raised using the repetitive multiple site immunization strategy (26Kilpatrick K.E. Wring S.A. Walker D.H. Macklin M.D. Payne J.A. Su J.L. Champion B.R. Caterson B. McIntyre G.D. Hybridoma. 1997; 16: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each mouse received a total of 10 μg of GST-mCPL-1 in RIBIs adjuvant on days 0, 3, 6, 8, and 10. For detection of the nativeCe-CPL-1 enzyme in C. elegans embryos, gravid hermaphrodites were washed off culture plates in PBS and cut open to release the embryos. The embryos were then collected and fixed in methanol/acetone using the freeze-cracking protocol (27Kemphues K.J. Wolf N. Wood W.B. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For whole mounted immunostaining, mixed-stage population of larvae and adults were collected and washed in PBS and Ruvkun Fixation buffer before being fixed and permeabilized using 1% paraformaldehyde in Ruvkun Fixation buffer for 30 min and two freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice/ethanol bath (28Finney M. Ruvkun G.B. Cell. 1990; 63: 895-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The fixed and permeabilized embryos or the whole worms were treated with a blocking solution (60 mg/ml normal goat serum in PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h before reaction with antibodies. Primary anti-GST-mCPL-1 antibodies were used at 1:20 and 1:40 dilution. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used at a 1:50 dilution. Immunostained specimens were viewed under fluorescence microscope using appropriate filter sets in the presence of mounting medium, Vectashield containing 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). C. elegans mixed stage larvae, hermaphrodites, and embryos collected from 5% NaOCl-treated hermaphrodites were fixed for 60 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% sucrose. The fixed worms were then processed for immunoelectron microscopy as previously described (17Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T. Prince A.M. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17339-17346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections of C. elegans embedded worms were probed with mouse antisera raised against the recombinant C. elegansGST-Ce-mCPL-1 fusion polypeptide before incubation with 15-nm gold particles coated with anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). Mouse preimmune serum or antibodies to GST were used as controls. The localization of the native CPL in O. volvuluswas done as previously described (17Lustigman S. Brotman B. Huima T. Prince A.M. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17339-17346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using thin sections of O. volvulus L3 and adult-embedded worms and rabbit antisera raised against the recombinant O. volvulus mature region or the pro-region. Rabbit preimmune serum or antibodies to GST were used as controls. The antisera raised against the CPL enzymes recognized by Western blot their corresponding recombinant proteins and did not cross-react with recombinant proteins expressing the cathepsin Z-like proteins of C. elegans or O. volvulus (data not shown). The potential promoter region of Ov-cpl was amplified by sequential PCR reactions using O. volvulus genomic library, λ Fix II (kindly provided by Dr. R. D. Walter), the vector primer and gene-specific primers designed based on known sequences. A 1.3-kb fragment containing the ATG start codon was amplified first followed by another 1.8-kb fragment after using the vector primer and an antisense primer corresponding to a region within the 1.3-kb fragment. The final region identified as the putative promoter of the gene was ∼2.5 kb upstream of the ATG of Ov-cpl encoding region (accession number AF442768). For the transcriptional fusion construct, this fragment was amplified from O. volvulus genomic DNA using the following pair of PCR primers: OVcplp5′ (XbaI), sense, 5′- CGTCTAGACTTAGATTTCCATCCCGACGAG-3′, corresponding to positions −2525 to −2504 relative to the ATG start codon, and OVcplp3′ (XmaI), antisense, 5′-GACCCGGGTGAGTTTTTTTCTGTTTCTGTTTTCC-3′, complementary to positions +1 to −25 relative to the ATG start codon. Following restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR fragment was cloned into lacZ reporter vector pPD90.23 containing a nuclear localization signal (kindly supplied by A. Fire). The fusion gene containing the cpl putative promoter was designatedOv-cpl:lacZ (pSL117A). Using a heterologous transformation, we created C. elegans transgenic lines expressing theO. volvulus promoter as described in generation and expression of C. elegans reporter gene constructs. Based on BLASTP search of ACeDB using the mature region of theOv-CPL amino acid and the other filarial nematode sequences, a related sequence was identified in cosmid T03E6.7 (accession nu"

To study the biosynthesis of these compounds, we have isolated and functionally expressed a cDNA GmhPCS1 encoding homo-phytochelatin synthase from Glycine max, a plant known to accumulate homo-phytochelatins rather than phytochelatins upon the exposure to heavy metals. The catalytic properties of GmhPCS1 were compared with the phytochelatin synthase AtPCS1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. When assayed only in the presence of glutathione, both enzymes catalyzed phytochelatin formation. GmhPCS1 accepted homoglutathione as the sole substrate for the synthesis of homo-phytochelatins whereas AtPCS1 did not. Homo-phytochelatin synthesis activity of both recombinant enzymes was significantly higher when glutathione was included in the reaction mixture. The incorporation of both glutathione and homoglutathione into homo-phytochelatin, n = 2, was demonstrated using GmhPCS1 and AtPCS1. In addition to bis(glutathionato)·metal complexes, various other metal·thiolates were shown to contribute to the activation of phytochelatin synthase. These complexes were not accepted as substrates by the enzyme, thereby suggesting that a recently proposed model of activation cannot fully explain the catalytic mechanism of phytochelatin synthase (Vatamaniuk, O.

These peptides are linear polymers of the γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl (γ-Glu-Cys) portion of glutathione (GSH). Iso-phytochelatins are isoforms of phytochelatins (2Zenk M.H.

Although the enzymology of phytochelatin formation by a constitutive phytochelatin synthase was clarified early on (10Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the gene encoding this enzyme was discovered only recently (11Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Chroeder J.I.

Gene. 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Because iso-phytochelatins occur in only those plants that contain glutathione isomers, e.g. homoglutathione (hGSH) (8Grill E. Gekeler W. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 47-50Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), hydroxymethyl-glutathione (5Klapheck S. Fliegner W. Zimmer I. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glutamic acid (6Meuwly P. Thibault P. Schwan A.L. Rauser W.E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it could be supposed that these substances are involved in iso-phytochelatin biosynthesis. Furthermore, it was shown that several leguminaceous plants contain hGSH but not GSH (8Grill E. Gekeler W. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 47-50Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Oven M. Raith K. Neubert R.H.H. Kutchan T.M. Zenk M.H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Price C.A. Nature. 1957; 180: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Gekeler W. Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1989; 44c: 361-369Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and it could be, therefore, assumed that hGSH is the substrate for homo-phytochelatin biosynthesis. However, it has been reported that a crude enzyme preparation from Pisum catalyzes the formation of homo-phytochelatin from homoglutathione in the presence of GSH (9Klapheck S. Schlunz S. Bergmann L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, using the same enzyme preparation from Pisum, and in the presence of GSH, the synthesis of (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Ser from the corresponding glutathione isomer containing serine could be observed. This indicated for the first time that Pisum may either have a phytochelatin synthase with broad substrate specificity or that several enzymes with differing substrate specificity are present in the crude plant extracts (9Klapheck S. Schlunz S. Bergmann L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The explanation put forward by these authors was that phytochelatin synthase has a γ-Glu-Cys donor binding site that is specific for glutathione and a γ-Glu-Cys acceptor binding site that is less specific and accepts various tripeptides such as glutathione, homoglutathione, and hydroxymethyl-glutathione. However, conclusive evidence for the incorporation of GSH in iso-phytochelatins was not demonstrated. We chose Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean) as experimental material because this plant has been shown to contain homoglutathione (16Price C.A. Nature. 1957; 180: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and produces high amounts of homo-phytochelatins, but not phytochelatins, when exposed to non-toxic doses of Cd2+ions (8Grill E. Gekeler W. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 47-50Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Using the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding phytochelatin synthase (11Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Chroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 12Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Buggs S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S.

A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we isolated a cDNA encoding homo-phytochelatin synthase by homology-based cloning. Our goal was to express and biochemically characterize the G. maxhomo-phytochelatin synthase enzyme and compare its properties to theArabidopsis thaliana phytochelatin synthase using GSH as substrate. Our hypothesis, which was put forward early on (8Grill E. Gekeler W. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 47-50Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was that, although phytochelatin synthase uses glutathione as a substrate for the γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptidyl transpeptidase (EC2.3.2.15), homo-phytochelatin synthase from the order Fabales would use homoglutathione as substrate. We suggested previously that phytochelatin synthase is a metal-activated enzyme that uses GSH or PCs for its substrate (10Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that the addition of EDTA or apoPCs into the reaction mixture containing phytochelatin synthase, cadmium ions and GSH resulted in the immediate inactivation of the enzyme (18Löffler S. Hochberger A. Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 42-46Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We suggested that the phytochelatin synthase-catalyzed reaction terminated immediately after the metal ions were chelated by EDTA or apoPCs and concluded that the activity of phytochelatin synthase is regulated by the reaction product, i.e. PCs (18Löffler S. Hochberger A. Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 42-46Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, a significantly different model for phytochelatin biosynthesis was presented recently (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S., Lu, Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The authors of this model suggested that metal·GS2, rather than free metal ions, activate phytochelatin synthase. Furthermore, these authors suggested that metal·GS2 as well as metal·PC complexes are active substrates for phytochelatin synthase (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S., Lu, Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Some of our previously published results, most notably the results of our studies on the termination of phytochelatin synthase catalyzed reaction (18Löffler S. Hochberger A. Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 42-46Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), cannot be explained by this new model. If this model would be correct, then the addition of apoPCs into the reaction mixture containing phytochelatin synthase, metal ions, and GSH should not result in the immediate reaction termination, because metal·PC complexes should have been used as substrates for phytochelatin synthase during phytochelatin chain elongation. Hence, such a reaction should proceedad infinitum. The authors of the newest model suggested that PC biosynthesis terminates when GSH or apoPCs compete with thiolates for the high affinity site of the synthase or when higher order substrate-inactive metal·PC complexes are formed, or when metal·PC complexes are removed from the cytosolic pool into the vacuole (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S., Lu, Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We addressed the question of phytochelatin synthase activation and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the second part of the presented study. Cultured suspension cells of G. max (soybean) were provided by the cell culture laboratory of the Leibniz-Institut für Pflanzenbiochemie in Halle. Cultures were grown in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 400 ml of Linsmaier-Skoog medium (20Linsmaier E.M. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1965; 18: 100-127Crossref Scopus (2855) Google Scholar) over 7 days at 23 °C on a gyratory shaker (100 rpm) in diffuse light (750 lux). Differentiated soybean plants were grown under greenhouse conditions at 24 °C. Suspension cells were vacuum-filtered, and 400 mg of filtered cells was extracted in 600 μl of 1 n NaOH that contained NaBH4 (1 mg ml−1). Following sonication (3 × 10 s) and centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g, room temperature), 500 μl of supernatant was transferred into a new tube and acidified by the addition of 100 μl of 3.6 n HCl. After 5-min incubation on ice (protein precipitation), samples were once more centrifuged (5 min, 10,000 × g, room temperature) and analyzed by HPLC. Total RNA was isolated from 4-day-old suspension cultured cells of G. max (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNA was purified from total RNA using an Oligotex kit (Qiagen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen). Partial cDNA fragments encoding phytochelatin synthases were amplified using Taq polymerase and degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions in known phytochelatin synthases. The primer sequences were 5′-TGG AA(A/G) GG(A/C/G/T) (C/T)C(A/C/G/T) TGG (A/C)G(A/C/G/T) TGG-3′, corresponding to the WKGPWRW motif, and 5′-GG(A/G) TA(C/T) TT(A/G) AA(A/C/G/T) C(T/G)(A/C/G/T) GC(A/C/G/T) AC(A/G) TC-3′, corresponding to the DVARFKY motif. cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems) using the following program: 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 42 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 30 s; followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from a band of the expected length (ca. 330 bp) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) prior to nucleotide sequence determination. DNA sequencing of partial and full-length clones on both strands was performed at GATC (Konstanz, Germany) and MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). The full-length homo-phytochelatin synthase cDNAGmhPCS1 was obtained by screening a G. max λ ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) using the G. maxphytochelatin synthase-like PCR product as a probe. The probe was α-32P-labeled using the RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen), and phage plaques hybridizing with the labeled probe were identified using autoradiography. The identified cDNA was in vivo excised from the phage in pBluescript phagemid and sequenced. To express the cDNA in Escherichia coli cells, the open reading frame was cloned into the pET-14b vector (Novagen), which contains a hexahistidine N-terminal fusion tag. PCR primers were designed to introduce a NotI restriction enzyme site at the start codon (5′-TAT CCA TAT GGC GAC GGC GGG G-3′) and anXhoI restriction enzyme site downstream of the stop codon (5′-TAT CCT CGA GTC AAG AGA GAG GAG C-3′). PCR amplification was performed in 50 μl using 2.5 units of Pfupolymerase with the following conditions: 3 min at 94 °C, then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. After restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product and vector, the GmhPCS1 open reading frame was cloned into pET-14b to give construct pET:GmhPCS1. Cloning was confirmed by sequencing with the T7 primer. Similarly, the Arabidopsisphytochelatin synthase cDNA, AtPCS1, was amplified by PCR using primers containing recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases EcoRI (5′-TAT CGA ATT CAT GGC TAT GGC GAG TTT A-3′) and XhoI (5′-TAT CCT CGA GCT AAT AGG CAG GAG CAG C-3′), appropriate for subcloning into pET-28a (Novagen). TheG. max and Arabidopsis phytochelatin synthase clones were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The expression of recombinant proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, bacteria were grown at 37 °C to A 600 0.6, and the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of IPTG (final IPTG concentrations: 0.4 mm for bacteria transformed with pET:GmhPCS1 and 1 mm for bacteria transformed with pET:AtPCS1). The expression of recombinant proteins was allowed to proceed overnight at 18 °C. Bacteria were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, and 750 μg/ml lysozyme, and the recombinant proteins were purified from the bacterial extracts using a cobalt metal affinity resin (Talon,CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. To remove the hexahistidine tag, protein eluting from the Talon column was loaded onto a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2. The protein was incubated with 20 units of thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. After digestion, the protein solution was again passed over a Talon column, and the flow-through, containing phytochelatin synthase lacking the hexahistidine tag, was collected. The homogeneity of the purified enzymes was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The phytochelatin synthase activity was measured as described previously (10Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The standard 125-μl reaction mixture contained 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmCdCl2, 10 mm GSH, and 0.1 μg of recombinant enzyme. Homo-phytochelatin synthase activity assays were performed under the same experimental conditions except that 10 mm GSH was replaced by 10 mm hGSH, or by 10 mm hGSH and 0.5 mm GSH in the assay. Optionally, in the experiments where the role of thiols in the phytochelatin synthase assay was studied, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted or replaced by other thiols, and 10 mm GSH was replaced by 10 mm S-methyl-GSH. The influence of pH on enzyme activity was monitored in sodium citrate (pH 4–6), sodium phosphate (pH 6–7), Tris-HCl (pH 7–9), and glycine/NaOH (pH 9–10.5). The assay mixtures were incubated at 35 °C for 5 min. Prior to HPLC analysis, samples were acidified by the addition of 125 μl of 3.6n HCl and centrifuged (5 min, 10,000 × g, room temperature). The determination of thiols occurring in plant cell suspension cultures, as well as thiols and S-methyl-thiolate compounds that resulted from a PC synthase assay, was performed by HPLC analysis. In all cases, 100 μl of acidified sample was injected onto a reversed-phase HPLC system (Knauer HPLC; solvent A: 99.9% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 79.9% water, 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; flow rate: 2 ml min−1; column Knauer B6 Y535 Eurospher-100 C18 with precolumn), optionally with DTNB post-column derivatization as previously described (10Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HPLC was calibrated using GSH in various concentrations (0.1–100 nmol injected). Samples used for mass spectrometric analysis were isolated using HPLC with the DTNB derivatization omitted. The isolated compounds were submitted to mass spectrometric analysis as described previously (15Oven M. Raith K. Neubert R.H.H. Kutchan T.M. Zenk M.H.

These control cells contained 650 nmol·g (dry weight) dwt−1 hGSH, whereas the concentration of GSH was in the order of 50 nmol·g dwt−1. Traces of hPC2(20 nmol·g dwt−1), resulting from the presence of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions in the growth medium, were detected (22Grill E. Thumann J. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Plant Cell Rep. 1988; 7: 375-378PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The exposure of the cultivated G. max cells to 50 μm CdCl2 (Fig. 1 B) resulted in the formation of hPC2 and hPC3 (1290 and 630 nmol·g dwt−1, respectively). PC2 and PC3 were not observed under these conditions. G. max was, therefore, a suitable plant material for the isolation of a putative homo-phytochelatin synthase-encoding cDNA. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of known PC synthases (A. thaliana, Triticum aestivum,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and C. elegans) revealed that all four proteins have a conserved N-terminal end, whereas the C-terminal end of these proteins is more variable. The design of degenerate PCR primers was based on the conserved regions at the protein N-terminal end. The PC synthase-like cDNA fragments were PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that only one PC synthase homolog was amplified. This 334-bp cDNA fragment had high identity to known plant PC synthases (87 and 84% identity at the amino acid level to Arabidopsis and T. aestivum PC synthases, respectively). The isolated fragment was α-32P-labeled and used as a probe in screening of aG. max cDNA library. The screening resulted in the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone, GmhPCS1, that showed high identity to Arabidopsis and T. aestivum PC synthases (74 and 68% at the amino acid level) (Fig.2). GmhPCS1 and AtPCS1 were cloned in T7 promoter-based expression vectors and expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3). His-tagged proteins were purified from the crude bacterial extracts using a cobalt-containing resin. PC synthase activity of the individual purification steps was determined by the standard PC synthase assay using GSH as a substrate (TableI). The protein content during the purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Thrombin protease removal of the hexahistidine tag was a yield-limiting step; however, it was included in the protein purification to prevent a possible interaction of histidine with heavy metals in the PC synthase assays.Table IPurification of recombinant GmhPCS1 from E. coliPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activity1-ankat, nmol substrate converted/s; pkat, pmol substrate converted/s.Specific activityYieldPurificationmgnkatpkat/μg protein%-foldCrude extract861920221001Talon1.21630136084.961.8Talon after thrombin digest0.22270121013.955.0Activity was determined using 10 mm GSH, 0.5 mmCdCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.1-a nkat, nmol substrate converted/s; pkat, pmol substrate converted/s. Open table in a new tab Activity was determined using 10 mm GSH, 0.5 mmCdCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The expression of GmhPCS1 and AtPCS1 differed substantially in E. coli. Using GSH as a substrate and crude soluble protein from the expression cultures, GmhPCS1 showed a specific activity of 22 pmol substrate converted/s (pkat)·μg protein−1, whereas that of AtPCS1 was 230 pkat·μg protein−1. It is suspected that different codon usage in each gene might effect expression level. By comparing the codon usage of GmhPCS1 and AtPCS1 it was observed that AGG, one of the E. coli low frequency arginine codons (1.4 codons used per 1000 codons), was very abundant in GmhPCS1 cDNA (18 codons used per 1000 codons) and significantly less abundant inAtPCS1 cDNA (6.2 codons used per 1000 codons). To verify whether the codon usage was the limiting factor in GmhPCS1expression, each GmhPCS1 and AtPCS1 was expressed in the E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE2)-RIL strain (Stratagene), which contains additional AGG tRNAs. However, the heterologous expression of the two cDNAs in this bacterial strain did not increase the yield of GmhPCS1, but rather decreased the yield of AtPCS1. The reason for the different expression levels ofGmhPCS1 and AtPCS1 remains therefore unclear. Homogenous homo-phytochelatin synthase from G. max was tested in the presence of 10 mm hGSH and found to produce hPC at a low rate (hPC synthase activity 2.2 pkat·μg−1 enzyme). Increasing the protein concentration showed a linear relationship in hPCs synthesized. When tested with GSH, however, the soybean enzyme showed high PC-synthesizing activity (1210 pkat·μg−1 enzyme). In contrast, the recombinant enzyme from Arabidopsis was completely inactive with hGSH as substrate (hPC-synthesizing activity within the range of experimental error), but showed normal PC-synthesizing activity with GSH in the range of 1510 pkat·μg−1 enzyme. Surprisingly, however, when 0.5 mm GSH was added to the GmhPCS1 assay mixture containing 10 mm hGSH, where only low hPC synthase activity was observed as given above, the hPC synthase activity increased almost 100-fold (210 pkat·μg−1 enzyme; Fig.3). Although the predominant reaction product of this experiment was hPC2 (230 nmol·μg−1 enzyme after 25 min), a small amount of PC2 was simultaneously synthesized under these conditions as well (21 nmol·μg−1 enzyme after 25 min). A similar increase in hPC-synthesizing activity could also be observed with AtPCS1 when 0.5 mm GSH was applied together with 10 mm hGSH in the reaction mixture. The hPC-synthesizing activity of AtPCS1 was determined to be 190 pkat·μg−1 enzyme. The identity of the reaction product was verified as hPC2using MS and MS/MS (Fig. 4 A). The observed result suggested that hGSH acts only as an acceptor molecule for γ-Glu-Cys units being generated from GSH by the homo-phytochelatin synthase. To test this hypothesis, hGSH was incubated in a GmhPCS1 assay, and S-methyl-GSH was added instead of GSH. S-Methyl-GSH has been previously reported to be a substrate for PC synthase (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S., Lu, Y.P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, in addition to the expected S-methyl-PC2 andS-methyl-PC3, another new metabolite was synthesized, which by mass spectral analysis was identified asS-methyl-homo-PC2 (Fig. 4 B). The incorporation of -γ-Glu-Cys(SCH3)- into the newly formed pentapeptide proved that GSH is a co-substrate in the synthesis of homo-phytochelatins. Furthermore, the position of the methyl group on the first cysteine residue demonstrated that the pentapeptide was synthesized by a condensation of a γ-Glu-Cys(SCH3)- unit, originating from S-methyl-GSH, and γ-Glu-Cys-β-Ala (i.e. hGSH). The absence of a peptide with the structure γ-Glu-Cys-γ-Glu-Cys(SCH3)-γ-Ala containing a Z2 fragment with a mass of 319 Da or a possible structure of a mass of 233 Da should be noted. The peptide with a possible structure γ-Glu-Cys-γ-Glu-Cys(SCH3)-β-Ala was, therefore, not formed. A comparison of AtPCS1 and GmhPCS1 with regard to their pH optima showed within experimental error that there is no difference between the two enzymes (pH 8.2 ± 0.2). The temperature optimum is in both cases 35 °C. These values correspond to the previously determined parameters for the partially purified native PC synthase from Silene cucubalus (10Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (pH optimum 7.9 and temperature optimum 35 °C). The K m value for GSH was determined for GmhPCS1 as 15 mm and for AtPCS1 as 11 mm. An absolute heavy metal ion requirement for phytochelatin synthesizing activity has frequently been demonstrated (9Klapheck S. Schlunz S. Bergmann L.

Detailed analysis revealed that this inactivation was similar to the O2-dependent inactivation of the enzyme in the absence of catecholic substrate, resulting in oxidation of the active site Fe(II) to Fe(III). Interestingly, the catecholic substrate not only increased the reactivity of the enzyme with O2 to promote ring cleavage but also increased the rate of O2-dependent inactivation. Thus, in air-saturated buffer, the apparent rate constant of inactivation of the free enzyme was (0.7 ± 0.1) × 10−3s−1versus (3.7 ± 0.4) × 10−3 s−1 for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, the preferred catecholic substrate of the enzyme, and (501 ± 19) × 10−3 s−1 for 3-chlorocatechol, a potent inactivator of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (partition coefficient = 8 ± 2, K mapp = 4.8 ± 0.7 μm). The 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase-catalyzed cleavage of 3-chlorocatechol yielded predominantly 2-pyrone-6-carboxylic acid and 2-hydroxymuconic acid, consistent with the transient formation of an acyl chloride. However, the enzyme was not covalently modified by this acyl chloride in vitro or in vivo.

These enzymes utilize non-heme ferrous iron to cleave the aromatic nucleus of catechols meta (adjacent) to the hydroxyl substituents, incorporating both atoms of dioxygen into the product (1Que Jr., L.

In humans, homogentisate dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5) and 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.6), two extradiol-type enzymes, have been associated with the genetic disorders alkaptonuria and Huntington's disease, respectively (5La Du B.N.

Extradiol-type dioxygenases are, thus, of considerable interest due to their general metabolic significance, their potential utility in the degradation of environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),1 and as potential targets in the treatment of genetic disorders. Sequence and structural data indicate the existence of at least two evolutionarily independent types of extradiol dioxygenases (7Eltis L.D. Bolin J.T. J.

Subsequent O2 binding to the Fe(II) followed by the iron-mediated electron transfer from the catechol to O2 yields a semiquinone-Fe(II)-superoxide intermediate. This species reacts to give an iron-alkylperoxo intermediate, which undergoes alkenyl migration, Criegee rearrangement, and O-O bond cleavage to give an unsaturated lactone intermediate and an Fe(II)-bound hydroxide anion. The latter hydrolyzes the lactone to yield the reaction product. Several steps in this mechanism have yet to be substantiated, and the catalytic roles of conserved active site residues remain to be fully elucidated. It has long been recognized that extradiol-type dioxygenases are susceptible to mechanism-based inactivation by their aromatic substrates (18Mitchell R.A. Kang H.H. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1151-1155Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 19Klecka G.M. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1981; 41: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been studied in thexylE-encoded catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O; EC 1.13.11.2) of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 of the TOL pathway and in mammalian 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase. Different catechols inactivate C23O to different extents, and several mechanisms of inactivation have been proposed. The inactivation of C23O by 3-chlorocatechol has been suggested to occur either through reversible chelation of the active site iron (19Klecka G.M. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1981; 41: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or irreversible covalent modification by an acyl chloride species generated by the ring cleavage reaction (20Bartels I. Knackmuss H.-J. Reineke W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 500-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no evidence for either mechanism has been presented. In contrast, the inactivation of C23O by alkyl catechols appears to involve the accidental oxidation of the active site Fe(II) to Fe(III) during turnover (21Cerdan P. Wasserfallen A. Rekik M. Timmis K.N. Harayama S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6074-6081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, several pathways have recruited a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin to maintain the dioxygenase active site iron in the reduced state (22Cerdan P. Rekik M. Harayama S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Hugo N. Meyer C. Armengaud J. Gaillard J. Timmis K.N. Jouanneau Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5580-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the inactivation of C23O by 3-methylcatechol involves alternate binding modes of the catecholic substrate (24Polissi A. Harayama S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An early report suggested that the mechanism-based inactivation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase also involves oxidation of the active site Fe(II) (18Mitchell R.A. Kang H.H. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1151-1155Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, this was refuted in a subsequent study (25Koontz W.A. Shiman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 368-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a halogenated substrate analogue, 4-chloro-3-hydroxyanthranilate, had been suggested to inhibit 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase via covalent modification by an acyl halide (26Parli C.J. Krieter P. Schmidt B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although it was subsequently shown that this analogue inhibits the enzyme reversibly in vivo (27Walsh J.L. Wu H.-Q. Ungerstedt U. Schwarcz R. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 33: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Clearly, many aspects of the inactivation of extradiol-type dioxygenases and the relationship of this inactivation to productive catalysis remain to be clarified. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (DHBD; EC 1.13.11.39) catalyzes the extradiol cleavage of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (DHB; Fig.1). DHBD is the third enzyme of the microbial biphenyl (bph) pathway. This pathway has been studied for its potential to remediate PCB-contaminated soils. The ability of the bph pathway to degrade PCBs is limited in part by DHBD, which is incapable of transforming certain chlorinated DHBs (28Furukawa K. Tomizuka N. Kamibayashi A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 301-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Seeger M. Timmis K.N. Hofer B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2654-2658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is inhibited by 3-chlorocatechol (30Sondossi M. Sylvestre M. Ahmad D. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2884-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of highly active preparations of DHBD fromBurkholderia sp. LB400, a good PCB degrader, accelerated the development of structural data (34Han S. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Muchmore S.W. Bolin J.T. Science. 1995; 270: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and enabled kinetic studies that established that the enzyme is subject to reversible substrate inhibition and mechanism-based inactivation (35Vaillancourt F.H.

This enzyme is thus an attractive system for experiments to further our understanding of extradiol-type dioxygenase function and mechanism-based inactivation in particular. Herein, the inactivation of DHBD by different catecholic substrates, including 3-chlorocatechol, was studied. An experimental design based on the theoretical approach of Duggleby (36Duggleby R.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 123: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the steady-state mechanism of the enzyme (Fig. 2) was utilized to investigate which forms of the enzyme are subject to inactivation. A variety of biophysical experiments were conducted to substantiate the mechanism of inactivation. The results are discussed in terms of the proposed catalytic mechanism of extradiol dioxygenases and have implications for the engineering of pathways to degrade environmental pollutants. The approach developed in this study is critical to correctly analyze the steady-state cleavage of PCB metabolites by DHBD as well as the reactivity of extradiol-type dioxygenases in general.

Buffers were prepared using water purified on a Barnstead NANOpure UV apparatus to a resistivity of greater than 17 megaohms-cm. All manipulations involving DHBD were performed under an inert atmosphere unless otherwise specified, usually in a Mbraun Labmaster 100 glovebox (Newburyport, MA) maintained at 2 ppm O2 or less. DHBD was purified and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage as described previously (35Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Aliquots of DHBD were thawed immediately before use and were exchanged into 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl (I = 0.1), pH 8.0, by gel filtration chromatography (35Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D.

Samples of DHBD were further diluted using the same buffer as required. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Iron concentrations were determined colorimetrically using Ferene S (44Haigler B.E. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was routinely measured by following the consumption of dioxygen using a Clark-type polarographic O2 electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments model 5301, Yellow Springs, OH) as previously described (35Vaillancourt F.H.

All experiments were performed using 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 25.0 ± 0.1 °C (290 μm dissolved O2) unless otherwise stated. The standard activity assay was performed using 80 μm DHB. Concentrations of active DHBD in the assay were defined by the iron content of the injected purified enzyme solution and were used in calculating specificity, catalytic, and inactivation constants. Steady-state rate equations were fit to data using the least squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (45Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the quantity of enzyme required to consume 1 μmol of O2/min. For inactivation studies in which progress curves were integrated, DHBD activity was followed spectrophotometrically by following the appearance of product with a Varian Cary 1E spectrophotometer equipped with a thermojacketed cuvette holder (Varian Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and interfaced to a microcomputer equipped with Cary WinUV software version 2.00. Experiments involving catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and DHB were monitored at 376, 389, and 434 nm, respectively, using molar extinction coefficients of 38.1, 22.0, and 25.7 mm−1 cm−1 for the corresponding ring-cleaved products. These values were determined as described previously (46Seah S.Y.K. Terracina G. Bolin J.T. Riebel P. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22943-22949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The steady-state cleavage of 3-chlorocatechol by DHBD was studied using DHB as a reporter substrate. The concentration of DHB was varied from 5 to 85 μm(i.e. at concentrations below those at which substrate inhibition is observed), and the concentration of 3-chlorocatechol was varied from 2.4 to 7.6 μm (i.e. 0.5 times the apparent Km to the maximum concentration possible without enzyme inactivation affecting the initial velocities). An equation identical in form to that for competitive inhibition was fit to the data (45Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). In this equation, the K mapp of 3-chlorocatechol replaces the competitive inhibition constant,Kic. Inhibition experiments with HOPDA were performed using air-saturated buffer. The concentration of DHB was varied from 5 to 85 μm, and the concentration of HOPDA was varied from 240 μm to 4.8 mm. Equations for competitive, uncompetitive, and mixed inhibition were fit to the data (45Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The respective stabilities of the EA, AEA, and EP complexes (Fig. 2) were studied by anaerobically incubating DHBD with appropriate amounts of substrates or product, withdrawing aliquots at timed intervals, and determining the remaining DHBD activity using the standard assay. In these experiments, a solution of ∼1.2 μm DHBD was incubated with either 0.08, 0.8, or 6 mm DHB, 5 mm catechol, and 2.5 or 5 mm HOPDA. The stability of the DHBD-3-chlorocatechol complex was evaluated by incubating a 150 μm solution of the enzyme under anaerobic conditions in the presence of either 1 or 5 mm3-chlorocatechol for 30 min. The EA complex was then desalted in 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl pH 8.0 by gel filtration as described previously (35Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the remaining DHBD activity was determined using the standard assay. The stability of the free enzyme in the presence of O2 was studied by incubating DHBD in the oxygraph cuvette under standard assay conditions, and monitoring At, the activity remaining after different time intervals, by adding 80 μmDHB to the cuvette. The apparent first-order rate constant of inactivation, j 1app (Fig. 2), was evaluated using Equation 1, in which Amax is the activity observed in the absence of pre-incubation.At=Amaxe−j1apptEquation 1 Partition ratios for each substrate were determined using an oxygraph assay in which limiting amounts of DHBD were added to defined amounts of catecholic substrate (2–10 times the Km). The amount of DHBD added to the reaction cuvette was such that the enzyme was completely inactivated before 10% of either the catecholic substrate or O2 was consumed in the reaction mixture. The partition ratio was calculated by dividing the amount of O2 consumed to the amount of active DHBD added to the assay (Equation 2). For 3-chlorocatechol, the partition ratio was also calculated from the amount of substrate remaining in an HPLC-based assay. Partition ratio=No.of substrate molecules consumedNo.of enzyme molecules inactivated=kcat∑jiEquation 2 The apparent rate constant of inactivation during catalytic turnover in air-saturated buffer,j 3app (Fig. 2), was independently evaluated using two different experimental designs. In the first approach, j 3app was calculated from the partition ratio determined using the oxygraph assay under saturating substrate conditions ([S] ≫Km). Under such conditions, the concentration of free enzyme, [E], is negligible, and the partition ratio is equal to the ratio of the catalytic constant,k catapp, and the inactivation constant j 3app(i.e. Σ ji = j3). The rate constant evaluated using this method was termedj 3Capp. In the second experimental approach,j 3app was determined from progress curves obtained from reactions performed at different substrate concentrations. In these experiments, the spectrophotometric assay was utilized. In the case of catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and 3-chlorocatechol, the substrate concentration was varied from the determined K mapp to 5 times the determined K mapp. In the case of DHB, the substrate concentration was varied from 80 to 250 μm. The rate constant of inactivation at each substrate concentration,jS, was determined by fitting Equation 3 (47Tudela J. Garcia-Canovas F. Varon R. Garcia-Carmona F. Galvez J. Lozano J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to the corresponding progress curve using SCIENTIST version 2.01 (Micromath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT).Pt=P∞(1−e−jSt)+PiEquation 3 In this equation, Pi is the concentration of product recorded at the start of the assay, andP∞ is the concentration of product subsequently generated during the assay. To minimize the effect of substrate depletion on the rate of reaction, the assays were performed using minimal amounts of enzyme (i.e. substrate consumption was less than 15%). The apparent rate constant of inactivation evaluated using this method was termedj 3Eapp. For catechol, 3-methyl-catechol and DHB, j 3Eappwas evaluated from jSmeasured at different substrate concentrations, S, using Equation 4 (47Tudela J.

DHBD was inactivated in vitro using three different methods, each performed at 23 °C using 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mmNaCl, pH 8.0. First, DHBD was inactivated anaerobically by incubating a 30 μm solution of the protein with 5 mm1,10-phenanthroline for 20 h. In a second experiment, DHBD was inactivated with O2 by exposing a solution of the enzyme to air for 20 h. Finally, DHBD was inactivated by incubating a 12–15 μm solution of the enzyme with 10 mm catechol or 3-chlorocatechol. In this experiment, the reaction mixture was gently bubbled with air for 10 min, which was sufficient for complete inactivation. The activity of the preparations was monitored using the standard assay to verify inactivation. Samples of DHBD were reactivated under the inert atmosphere of the glovebox. Aerobically inactivated samples were gently bubbled with argon for 15 min before being transferred to the glovebox. All samples were exchanged into 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, by gel filtration. Samples of inactivated protein were then divided into two aliquots. The first aliquot was incubated with 2 mm DTT, and the second was incubated with 2 mmDTT and 1 mm FeCl2·4H2O. After 30–60 min of incubation, the protein was exchanged into fresh 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and the specific activity of the preparation was determined using the standard assay. Mass spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an ion spray ion source (Sciex) or nanospray ion source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The protein samples were injected onto an Ultrafast Microprotein Analyzer UMA (Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Aubum, CA) directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. In each experiment, the protein was loaded onto a polymeric reversed phase column for protein (Michrom BioResources Inc., 8 U, 300 Å, 1 mm × 50 mm) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water and then eluted at a flow rate of 50 μl/min over 5 min with a 20–90% gradient of solvent containing 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile in water. Spectra were obtained in the single quadrupole scan mode, and the quadrupole mass analyzer was scanned over a mass to charge ratio (m/z) range of 600–2400 atomic mass units, with a step size of 0.5 atomic mass units and a dwell-time of 1.0 ms/step. The ion spray ion source voltage was set at 5.0 kV, and the nanospray ion source voltage was set at 0.9 kV. The orifice energy was set at 45 or 50 V. X-band EPR spectroscopy was carried out using a Bruker model ESP 300e spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard microwave frequency counter. For low temperature studies, samples of DHBD were prepared anaerobically in 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, transferred to a 3-mm quartz cell (Wilmad, Buena, NJ), and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 s of removal from the glovebox. Samples were then placed in a finger Dewar (Wilmad) insert at 77 K for EPR analysis. EPR spectra were obtained as an average of two scans with a sweep time of 336 s. Other parameters are indicated in the legend of Fig. 5. For spin-trapping studies, EPR spectra were recorded at 293 K as an average of 3 scans with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a sweep time of 42 s, a microwave power of 10 mW, a modulation amplitude of 0.103 millitesla, and a scan range of 343 to 353 millitesla. The peak area was estimated by integration using standard WINEPR software. Three different methods were used to detect superoxide: spin-trapping using DMPO, fluorescence detection of the reduction of hydroethidine, and spectrophotometric detection of the reduction of XTT. The reduction of hydroethidine to ethidium (49Bindokas V.P. Jordán J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Benov L. Sztejnberg L. F"

Bromo-octanoate, an inhibitor of β-oxidation, and amino-oxyacetate, an inhibitor of the malate-aspartate shuttle, were used to modify substrate flux and thus increase cytosolic [AMP]. Cytosolic [AMP] was calculated using metabolites measured by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing glucose and either no inhibitor, the inhibitors, or the inhibitors plus butyrate, a substrate that bypasses the metabolic blocks. In this way, [AMP] changed from 0.2 to 27.9 μm, and [ATP] varied between 11.7 and 6.8 mm. AMPK activity ranged from 7 to 60 pmol·min−1·μg of protein−1. The half-maximal AMPK activation (A0.5) was 1.8 ± 0.3 μmAMP. Measurements in vitro have reported similar AMPKA0.5 at 0.2 mm ATP, but found thatA0.5 increased 10–20-fold at 4 mmATP. The low A0.5 of this study despite a high [ATP] suggests that in vivo the ATP antagonism of AMPK activation is reduced, and/or other factors besides AMP activate AMPK in the heart.

AMP-activated protein kinase acetyl-CoA-carboxylase bromo-octanoate amino-oxyacetate phosphocreatine intracellular pH Krebs-Henseleit buffer phenylphosphonic acid beats/min AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1 and AMPK kinase comprise a protein kinase cascade that has been highly conserved throughout evolution (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Increases in AMP concentration ([AMP]) activate this cascade by four mechanisms (3Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are as follows: 1) an allosteric activation by AMP of AMPK kinase, which then phosphorylates AMPK; 2) the binding of AMP to AMPK, which makes it a poorer substrate for protein phosphatases; 3) the binding of AMP to AMPK, which makes AMPK a better substrate for AMPK kinase; and 4) the allosteric activation by AMP of AMPK. The activating effects of AMP are antagonized by high concentrations of ATP. Since the AMPK is activated when AMP is elevated and ATP is depressed, AMPK is hypothesized to act as cellular “fuel gauge” (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar).After AMPK activation, in response to metabolic stress, AMPK phosphorylates enzymes, leading to activation of catabolic pathways to increase ATP synthesis and inhibition of anabolic pathways to limit ATP consumption. For example, AMPK phosphorylation decreases acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) activity, which decreases malonyl-CoA concentration. Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, which transports fatty acids into the mitochondrion (6Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 11A-16AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Reduction of malonyl-CoA increases fatty acid uptake via carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and, thereby, the fatty acid oxidation by the mitochondria, which increases ATP production. In skeletal muscle and hearts, AMPK activity also increases glucose uptake by enhancing GLUT-4 translocation (8Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Winder W.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 9Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J.

In hearts, AMPK phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a stimulator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, which accelerates glycolysis (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L.

AMPK also down-regulates ATP-consuming pathways, such as glycogen, cholesterol, and fatty acid synthesis (12Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J.

(14Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) modeled the AMPK cascade. Their model predicts a sigmoidal response of AMPK activity to increasing [AMP] with a half-maximal activation (A0.5) of 4 μm. Stein et al. measured AMPK activity of the α1 and α2 isoforms in vitro as a function of [AMP] (15Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These measurements showed a hyperbolic increase in AMPK activity with increasing [AMP], with an A0.5 of 5.7 μm for α1 and 16 μm for α2. In contrast, Marsin et al. (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) reported a linear relationship between AMPK activity and AMP/ATP ratio, using total AMP measured in tissue extracts of isolated rat hearts during ischemia or treatment with inhibitors of ATP synthesis.The aim of the present study was to define the relationship between AMPK activation and cytosolic [AMP] in vivo in the isolated perfused rat heart. To accomplish this, we employed an approach that restrains substrate metabolism by use of the inhibitors bromo-octanoate (BrO) to inhibit fatty acid oxidation (16Schulz H. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and amino-oxyacetate (AOA), to inhibit pyruvate oxidation (17Safer B. Smith C.M. Williamson J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1971; 2: 111-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using this approach together with increased work demand reduced the phosphocreatine (PCr) (18Balschi J.A. Shen H. Madden M.C. Hai J.O. Bradley Jr., E.L. Wolkowicz P.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3123-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We used 31P NMR spectroscopy to measure the PCr and ATP content as well as the intracellular pH (pHi) of these hearts. The creatine kinase and the adenylate kinase equilibrium expressions were used to calculate [ADP] and [AMP], respectively. The net effect of [PCr] reductions is an increase in [AMP] with a relatively constant [ATP]. Cytosolic [AMP] was therefore manipulated in a relatively controlled manner, and the AMPK activity was measured.DISCUSSIONResults in this paper define the relationship between AMPK activity and the cytosolic [AMP] in the isolated perfused rat heart. To our knowledge, this is the first correlation of AMPK activity with metabolically active cytosolic [AMP] in the isolated heart. To increase the cytosolic [AMP] in isolated perfused rat hearts, the heart's supply of acetyl-CoA was limited using the inhibitors bromo-octanoate and amino-oxyacetate. This method decreases both aerobic energy production and high energy phosphates, particularly PCr (18Balschi J.A. Shen H. Madden M.C. Hai J.O. Bradley Jr., E.L. Wolkowicz P.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3123-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because of the equilibrium of the creatine kinase reaction, the reduction of [PCr] results in an increase in [ADP]. In turn, the near equilibrium of the adenylate kinase reaction translates the increase in [ADP] into an increase in [AMP]. 31P NMR-measured PCr, ATP, and pHi provided an estimate of cytosolic [AMP] in vivo.Four conclusions can be drawn from the AMPK activity and [AMP] measurements of the seven groups of hearts studied here. First, Glc hearts, oxidizing both exogenous and endogenous glucose and endogenous triglycerides, maintain low values of [AMP] and AMPK activity. Second, AMPK activity in GBA-Bu hearts treated with inhibitors of fatty acid and glucose oxidation but provided with the substrate butyrate, which can bypass the blockade of β-oxidation, is equal to that of the Glc group hearts. These hearts maintain [AMP] equal to those of Glc hearts. These results show that AMPK activity does not increase due to nonspecific effects of the inhibitors. Third, AMPK activity increased in the GA hearts paced at 450 bpm. Fourth, GBA hearts treated with BrO and AOA to inhibit fatty acid and glucose oxidation have increased [AMP] as well as increased AMPK activity. In this study, hearts with an [AMP] above 10 μm demonstrate maximal AMPK activity (Fig. 2).Maximal increases in AMPK activity have been reported by a number of investigators. In vitro measurements by Stein found a 300% maximal activity for the α1 AMPK isoform and a 1300% maximal activity for the α2 AMPK isoform (15Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The heart contains both AMPK isoforms with the α2 isoform accounting for 70–80% of the total (27Stapleton D.

A study by Marsinet al. (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) of AMPK activity during ischemia found a nearly 800% increase after 10 min of ischemia, which decreased to a 500% increase after 30 min of ischemia. In the present study, the maximal increase in AMPK activity observed was ∼240% (relative to Glc, TableII).To investigate whether AMPK activity could be greater than the 240% that we observed in this study during ischemia, we measured AMPK activity (without AMP) after 30 min of ischemia. The AMPK activity, 107 pmol·min−1·μg of protein−1, is an increase of ∼500% higher than the Glc group. Thus, the AMPK activity after 30 min of ischemia was approximately twice the maximal activity observed (∼240%) in the groups of this study. The greater AMPK activity observed in the ischemic heart could result from activation due to higher [AMP]. During no-flow ischemia in the rat heart, [AMP] is higher for at least two reasons: first, [PCr] falls to nondetectable levels in about 10 min; second, pHi decreases to 6.3 within 10 min. Cytosolic AMP-specific 5′-nucleotidase, which deaminates AMP to adenosine and Pi, is inhibited at a pHi of 6.3 (30Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C992-C1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of 5′-nucleotidase allows AMP to accumulate to 143 μm after 12 min of ischemia (30Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C992-C1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions employed in the present study allow controlled increases in [AMP], but since 5′-nucleotidase is not inhibited, AMP does not accumulate. Hence, the AMPK activity achieved here may not be maximal.[AMP] and AMPK CascadeUsing our methods to alter myocardial energy metabolism, the cytosolic [AMP] ranged from 0.2 to 28 μm. The A0.5 = 1.8 μm AMP suggests that the threshold for [AMP] activation of AMPK in the heart is low and that AMPK activity is maximal at [AMP] ≥ 10 μm. In vitro the relationship between AMPK activation and [AMP] for the α1 and α2 AMPK isoforms yields an A0.5 equal to 5.7 ± 2.0 and 16 ± 3.5 μm AMP, respectively (15Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Here, we measured total AMPK activity and, therefore, cannot distinguish the degree to which the individual isoforms are activated.The measurements of AMPK activity (without AMP) report the state activation of the AMPK cascade. Hardie et al. (14Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) developed a model of the AMPK cascade using an A0.5 of 4 μm AMP that predicts full activation below 10 μm AMP. Our study, in accord with those of Hardieet al. (14Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and Stein et al. (15Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), found a hyperbolic relationship between AMPK activity and [AMP]. Marsinet al. report a linear correlation between AMPK activity in the AMP/ATP range of 0.03–1.31 in perfused rat hearts using total AMP and ATP measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Since most AMP is bound, however, the total AMP overestimates the cytosolic [AMP], which is presumably the allosteric regulator of the AMPK cascade activity. Our measurements of AMP/ATP are 100–1000 times lower than those reported by Marsin (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar).[ATP] and AMPKATP antagonizes the allosteric activation of AMPK by AMP because ATP competes with AMP for binding at the allosteric site but does not promote formation of the active conformation (5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Because of this, Hardie and Carling have suggested that the kinase reacts to the AMP/ATP ratio (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Using our methods to alter myocardial energy metabolism, the AMP/ATP ratio ranged from 0.132 × 10−3 in the GBA-Bu group to 4.768 × 10−3 in the GBA450 group, with an AMP/ATP ratioA0.5 of 0.210 × 10−3. The model of the AMPK cascade by Hardie et al. predicts that theA0.5 of 4 μm with 0.2 mm ATP will increase to 40 μm at 2.0 mm ATP (14Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In vitro measurements of AMPK activity report an A0.5 of 4.4 ± 2.2 μm AMP at 0.2 mm ATP, but with 4 mm ATP, the A0.5 was 29 ± 14 μm (5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The A0.5 of 1.8 μm in the present study reports on the activation of the AMPK cascade in vivo. This implies a lowA0.5 for AMPK phosphorylation in vivo, where [ATP] was always greater than 7 mm.[H+] and AMPKIntracellular [H+] may alter AMPK activity. A study of AMPK in vitro found that progressive decreases of pH from 7.3 to 6.6 resulted in progressive increases in AMPK activity (31Ponticos M. Lu Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Manipulating energy metabolism in this study only modestly altered pHi. The GBA group hearts have a pHi of 7.0 when paced at 300 bpm and 6.9 when paced at 450 bpm, both of which are lower than the 7.1 of the Glc group. Thus, the alterations of AMPK activity observed in this study occurred at near normal pHi. Myocardial pHi typically decreases well below 7 during ischemia. If increased [H+] alters AMPK activity, this may contribute to the greater AMPK activity in the ischemic heart.AMPK and ACCAMPK activity plays a major role in the regulation, by phosphorylation, of ACC activity in the heart (28Dyck J.R. Kudo N. Barr A.J. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Lopaschuk G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (12Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACC catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. In heart and skeletal muscle, malonyl-CoA regulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 transfers long chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondrion, where the fatty acids are oxidized by β-oxidation. In the rat heart during reperfusion following ischemia, increased AMPK activity correlates with reduced ACC activity (32Kudo N. Gillespie J.G. Kung L. Witters L.A. Schulz R. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this study, we also found a negative correlation between ACC activity and AMPK activity.ConclusionsOur findings reveal important details of AMPK regulation in the heart. Because of its activation by AMP, AMPK is hypothesized to act as a “low fuel warning system” (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) or as a “master switch” for cellular energy levels (33Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). For AMPK to function as a metabolic sensor, it must be activated rapidly and early during a metabolic stress if it is to help sustain energy levels. Our results indicate that the A0.5 for activation of AMPK was 1.8 μm. AMP concentrations in that range can result from PCr decreases of about 30% or less in the heart. These characteristics are consistent with AMPK functioning as a low fuel warning system. These results also indicate that AMPK activation could conceivably occur in situations other than ischemia. For example, Neubauer et al. (34Neubauer S. Horn M. Cramer M. Harre K. Newell J.B. Peters W. Pabst T. Ertl G. Hahn D. Ingwall J.S. Kochsiek K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2190-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) reported 30% decreases in the PCr/ATP ratio in the human heart during failure.The measures of PCr, ATP, and pHi by 31P NMR provide the most accurate estimates of cytosolic [AMP] available. This enabled us to measure in the intact heart anA0.5 of 1.8 μm AMP, which is comparable with the A0.5 measured in vitro in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP. In vitro, the AMPK A0.5 increased 10–20-fold at 4 mm ATP due to the antagonizing effect of ATP on the AMP activation of AMPK. In the present study, [ATP] was, however, always greater than 7 mm. The lowA0.5 in the presence of 7 mm [ATP] in the intact heart suggests several possible features of AMPK regulation in vivo: first, the ATP antagonism of AMPK activation is reduced; second, AMPK senses an [ATP] that is different than the average cytosolic concentration; or third, factors in addition to AMP activate AMPK in the heart. These possibilities remain to be explored. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1 and AMPK kinase comprise a protein kinase cascade that has been highly conserved throughout evolution (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Increases in AMP concentration ([AMP]) activate this cascade by four mechanisms (3Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 4Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are as follows: 1) an allosteric activation by AMP of AMPK kinase, which then phosphorylates AMPK; 2) the binding of AMP to AMPK, which makes it a poorer substrate for protein phosphatases; 3) the binding of AMP to AMPK, which makes AMPK a better substrate for AMPK kinase; and 4) the allosteric activation by AMP of AMPK. The activating effects of AMP are antagonized by high concentrations of ATP. Since the AMPK is activated when AMP is elevated and ATP is depressed, AMPK is hypothesized to act as cellular “fuel gauge” (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). After AMPK activation, in response to metabolic stress, AMPK phosphorylates enzymes, leading to activation of catabolic pathways to increase ATP synthesis and inhibition of anabolic pathways to limit ATP consumption. For example, AMPK phosphorylation decreases acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) activity, which decreases malonyl-CoA concentration. Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, which transports fatty acids into the mitochondrion (6Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 11A-16AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Reduction of malonyl-CoA increases fatty acid uptake via carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and, thereby, the fatty acid oxidation by the mitochondria, which increases ATP production. In skeletal muscle and hearts, AMPK activity also increases glucose uptake by enhancing GLUT-4 translocation (8Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Winder W.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 9Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J.

In hearts, AMPK phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a stimulator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, which accelerates glycolysis (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). AMPK also down-regulates ATP-consuming pathways, such as glycogen, cholesterol, and fatty acid synthesis (12Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vavvas D. Apazidis A. Saha A.K. Gamble J. Patel A. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Several studies have examined the relationship between the activation of AMPK and [AMP]. Hardie et al. (14Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) modeled the AMPK cascade. Their model predicts a sigmoidal response of AMPK activity to increasing [AMP] with a half-maximal activation (A0.5) of 4 μm. Stein et al. measured AMPK activity of the α1 and α2 isoforms in vitro as a function of [AMP] (15Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These measurements showed a hyperbolic increase in AMPK activity with increasing [AMP], with an A0.5 of 5.7 μm for α1 and 16 μm for α2. In contrast, Marsin et al. (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J. Beauloye C. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Carling D. Hue L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) reported a linear relationship between AMPK activity and AMP/ATP ratio, using total AMP measured in tissue extracts of isolated rat hearts during ischemia or treatment with inhibitors of ATP synthesis. The aim of the present study was to define the relationship between AMPK activation and cytosolic [AMP] in vivo in the isolated perfused rat heart. To accomplish this, we employed an approach that restrains substrate metabolism by use of the inhibitors bromo-octanoate (BrO) to inhibit fatty acid oxidation (16Schulz H. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and amino-oxyacetate (AOA), to inhibit pyruvate oxidation (17Safer B. Smith C.M. Williamson J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1971; 2: 111-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using this approach together with increased work demand reduced the phosphocreatine (PCr) (18Balschi J.A. Shen H. Madden M.C. Hai J.O. Bradley Jr., E.L. Wolkowicz P.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3123-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We used 31P NMR spectroscopy to measure the PCr and ATP content as well as the intracellular pH (pHi) of these hearts. The creatine kinase and the adenylate kinase equilibrium expressions were used to calculate [ADP] and [AMP], respectively. The net effect of [PCr] reductions is an increase in [AMP] with a relatively constant [ATP]. Cytosolic [AMP] was therefore manipulated in a relatively controlled manner, and the AMPK activity was measured. DISCUSSIONResults in this paper define the relationship between AMPK activity and the cytosolic [AMP] in the isolated perfused rat heart. To our knowledge, this is the first correlation of AMPK activity with metabolically active cytosolic [AMP] in the isolated heart. To increase the cytosolic [AMP] in isolated perfused rat hearts, the heart's supply of acetyl-CoA was limited using the inhibitors bromo-octanoate and amino-oxyacetate. This method decreases both aerobic energy production and high energy phosphates, particularly PCr (18Balschi J.A. Shen H. Madden M.C. Hai J.O. Bradley Jr., E.L. Wolkowicz P.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3123-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because of the equilibrium of the creatine kinase reaction, the reduction of [PCr] results in an increase in [ADP]. In turn, the near equilibrium of the adenylate kinase reaction translates the increase in [ADP] into an increase in [AMP]. 31P NMR-measured PCr, ATP, and pHi provided an estimate of cytosolic [AMP] in vivo.Four conclusions can be drawn from the AMPK activity and [AMP] measurements of the seven groups of hearts studied here. First, Glc hearts, oxidizing both exogenous and endogenous glucose and endogenous triglycerides, maintain low values of [AMP] and AMPK activity. Second, AMPK activity in GBA-Bu hearts treated with inhibitors of fatty acid and glucose oxidation but provided with the substrate butyrate, which can bypass the blockade of β-oxidation, is equal to that of the Glc group hearts. These hearts maintain [AMP] equal to those of Glc hearts. These results show that AMPK activity does not increase due to nonspecific effects of the inhibitors. Third, AMPK activity increased in the GA hearts paced at 450 bpm. Fourth, GBA hearts treated with BrO and AOA to inhibit fatty acid and glucose oxidation have increased [AMP] as well as increased AMPK activity. In this study, hearts with an [AMP] above 10 μm demonstrate maximal AMPK activity (Fig. 2).Maximal increases in AMPK activity have been reported by a number of investigators. In vitro measurements by Stein found a 300% maximal activity for the α1 AMPK isoform and a 1300% maximal activity for the α2 AMPK isoform (15Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The heart contains both AMPK isoforms with the α2 isoform accounting for 70–80% of the total (27Stapleton D.

FYVE domains have been subsequently found in a wide variety of proteins involved in cell signaling pathways (SARA), vesicular trafficking (EEA1, Rabenosin, Rabip4, Vac1p, Fab1p), both (PIKfyve, Hrs), or cytoskeleton regulation (Fgd1–3 and Frabin) (for a recent review, see Ref. 5Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Presently at least 25 different FYVE domain-containing proteins have been identified in mammals and 5 in yeast (3Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin.

Structural information for the FYVE domains of Vac1p, EEA1, Hrs-1, and Vps27 is now available with somewhat conflicting results related to the mode of PtdIns 3-P interaction (reviewed in Ref. 13Fruman D.A.

According to recent NMR analysis of the EEA1 FYVE domain complexed with di-C4PtdIns 3-P, this interaction proceeds in several steps. A hydrophobic loop in the FYVE domain is initially inserted into the lipid bilayer in a nonspecific manner. This causes opening of the basic pocket and a subsequent ligation of the PtdIns 3-P headgroup (14Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In both yeast and mammalian cells, PtdIns 3-P is predominantly found within the membranes of the endocytic pathway, including the limiting membranes of early endosomes and the intraluminal vesicles of MVBs (15Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). This implies that, directed by their FYVE fingers, the FYVE domain proteins should co-localize, entirely or partially, with PtdIns 3-P. However, recent studies indicate that this does not seem to always be the case. FYVE domain proteins (i.e., SARA, DFCP1, double FYVE-containing protein 1, and probably others) have been localized to intracellular membrane sites that seem to be free of PtdIns 3-P, such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (16Derubeis A.R. Young M.F. Jia L. Robey P.G. Fisher L.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In other cases, FYVE domain proteins such as Hrs and Vac1p are localized onto PtdIns 3-P-enriched endosomal membranes, but this association proceeds in a manner that is independent of the FYVE domain and intracellular PtdIns 3-P levels (18Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

A recent study shows that the full-length mouse Hrs protein does not even bind to PtdIns 3-P-enriched liposomesin vitro (20Hayakawa A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29636-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results imply that the function of the FYVE domains as essential determinants for endocytic membrane association and downstream effectors of PtdIns 3-P should be determined for each individual FYVE domain protein. PIKfyve, the mammalian PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2-generating enzyme, harbors a FYVE finger domain on its N terminus (Refs. 12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 21Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol.

Int. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy studies detect PIKfyve, both endogenous and expressed in heterologous cell systems, associated with discrete vesicle structures, most of them positive for markers of the late endocytic pathway (23Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent data demonstrating a dramatic endomembrane swelling and vacuolation upon expression of dominant-negative PIKfyve lipid kinase-deficient mutants and a subsequent correction of the abnormal phenotype upon microinjection of PtdIns 3,5-P2 implicate PtdIns 3,5-P2production in the organization of a specialized membrane domain on late endocytic compartment (24Ikonomov O.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Ikonomov, O., Sbrissa, D., Mlak, K., Kanzaki, M., Pessin, J., and Shisheva, A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Whether PIKfyve, directed by its FYVE finger domain, targets the late endocytic membrane populations of PtdIns 3-P remained to be identified. Furthermore, PIKfyve enzymatic activity to metabolize PtdIns 3-P predicts an additional region within the C-terminal catalytic domain able to also specifically bind PtdIns 3-P. Therefore, we have analyzed the binding of the PIKfyve FYVE finger and the C-terminal catalytic domains to PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes and the relevance of this binding for PIKfyve intracellular localization. In this paper we document specific and high affinity interactions between the PIKfyve FYVE finger domain and PtdIns 3-P liposomes in vitro. This binding mechanism depends on a patch of basic residues within the FYVE domain and is utilized in live cells to direct a subfraction of intracellular PIKfyve to PtdIns 3-P-enriched late endocytic membranes. Construction of the catalytic region of PIKfyve (residues 1684–2052) in pGEX5X-3 and the N-terminal PIKfyve FYVE finger (residues 99–473) into pGEX-1 vector (Amrad) has been described elsewhere (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Double and point mutations within the predicted lipid-substrate activation loop of the PIKfyve catalytic region were introduced on Lys-1999, Lys-2000, or both, by PCR. Initially, theHindIII-PstI fragment of clone K12 (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that encompasses nucleotides 5216–6462 of the PIKfyve sequence (nucleotide numbers correspond to GenBank™ accession no. AF102777) was amplified as two fragments and subsequently linked in the engineeredXhoI site (CTCGAG replacing the original sequence6139CTTGAG with no change in amino acids) positioned downstream of the mutations. The first fragment (∼900 bp) was amplified with an external sense primer harboring the authenticHindIII site at nucleotide 5216 (5′-GCCGAAGCTTCAGGAATGTTG-3′) and an internal antisense primer specific for each mutant (5′-CGGCCTCGAGTTTTTCGTCCCATG-3′ for Lys-1999; 5′-CGGCCTCGAGTTCTTTGTCCCATG-3′ for Lys-2000 and CGGCCTCGAGTTCTTCGTCCCATG-3′ for Lys-1999/2000; the XhoI site is underlined). The second fragment (∼300 bp) was amplified with an internal sense primer (5′-CGGCCTCGAGATGGTTGTGAAG-3′) identical for the three mutants with silent substitutions for the XhoI site and an external antisense primer (5′-GCCGCTGCAGTCATGGACAGTC-3′) harboring the PstI site from the 3′-untranslated region of the PIKfyve sequence. The PCR products were digested withHindIII-XhoI or PstI-XhoI, respectively, and then ligated into theHindIII-PstI cloning sites of pBluescript II SK(+). The correct sequence and desired mutations were confirmed by sequencing and restriction analysis with XhoI. The PIKfyve catalytic domain fragments harboring the above point and double mutations were expressed as GST fusion proteins in pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Specifically, the pGEX-PIKfyve-(1798–2052) construct carrying the mutations were generated by releasing the EcoRI-NotI oligonucleotide fragments from PIKfyve-(1694–2052) of the corresponding mutants in pBluescript II SK(+) and subsequent subcloning into the EcoRI-NotI digest of pGEX5X-1. Generation of GST fusion peptide encompassing amino acids 1798–2052 and harboring a mutation in Lys-1831, identified as a putative ATP-binding residue (26Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was achieved in a similar manner using pBluescript II SK(+) PIKfyveK1831E described previously (26Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Truncation of a 21-amino acid fragment (residues 177–198; referred herein as Δfyve) comprising the most conservative patch of basic residues within the FYVE finger (residues 164–224; Ref. 12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was introduced by digesting pGEX-1-PIKfyve-(99–473) cDNA withPstI (releases a 63-bp fragment between nucleotides 673 and 736). A subsequent self-ligation of the remaining fragment yielded the GST-PIKfyve-(99–473)Δfyve construct. All constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping. E. coli strain XA-90 was used for transformation. Production and purification of the GST fusion proteins on GSH-agarose beads (Sigma) were performed essentially as we described previously (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The concentration and quality of the eluted purified proteins were determined electrophoretically by the intensity of the Coomassie-stained protein bands versus bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce). Truncation of a 21-residue fragment (amino acids 177–198) from the conservative basic patch of the FYVE domain was achieved by PstI digestion of pEGFP-PIKfyveS-(1–286) cDNA. The small 63-bp fragment was eliminated, whereas the remaining two fragments were ligated to give the pEGFP-PIKfyveS-(1–286)Δ177–198 construct. The generation of all other PIKfyve constructs in pEGFP that were used in this study has been described previously (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), were seeded on 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips at 125,000 cells/35-mm plate (for fluorescence microscopy) or at 750,000 cells/100-mm plates (for biochemistry). Transfection with the EGFP-hemagglutinin epitope-tagged version of PIKfyveSWT or deletion mutants was performed using LipofectAMINE as described elsewhere (21Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with or without wortmannin (200 nm) for different time periods up to 20 min and then processed for fluorescence microscopy or biochemical fractionation. Subsequent to fixation in 4% formaldehyde and washings, transfected cells were processed for fluorescence microscopy analysis as described elsewhere (23Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted on slides using the Slow Fade anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence analysis was performed with a standard green fluorescence filter in a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 310) using a 63/1.4 oil immersion lens or in a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with SPOT RT Slider charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments) mounted on the microscopes. Science Lab software (Fuji) was used for quantitation of the fluorescence intensity. Liposome preparation and binding to GST fusion proteins were conducted essentially as described previously (27Schiavo G., Gu, Q.-M. Prestwich G.D. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly liposomes were prepared from a lipid mixture containing 65% brain PtdCho (Avanti Polar Lipids), [3H]dipalmitoyl PtdCho (76 μCi/nmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 20% dimyristoyl PtdSer (Avanti Polar Lipids), 15% brain PtdEth (Avanti Polar Lipids), and/or a different dipalmitoyl PI (gift by Echelon Research Laboratory Inc.) at the expense of PtdCho, at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The3H-lipid mixture dried under nitrogen at ∼40 °C was hydrated to a final concentration of 230 μm and agitated vigorously by vortexing in “assay buffer” (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). Following bath sonication for 5 min, the liposome suspension was cleared of large aggregates and undispersed lipid by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. GST fusion proteins (typically 7 μg if not otherwise stated) prepared from lysates of E. coli were immobilized on 10 μl of packed GSH-agarose beads and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline plus protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and finally twice in “assay buffer.” One hundred μl of the cleared 3H-liposome suspension was incubated with the immobilized protein (typically 1μm) at room temperature and mixed vigorously for 30 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 s and washed four times with assay buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Radioactivity bound to the immobilized fusion proteins was counted by liquid scintillation after extracting the beads with 300 μl of 10% SDS. For determination of the dissociation constant, K D , PI concentration was varied up to 10% of the total lipid at the expense of PtdCho.K D values were determined from a linear least-squares double-reciprocal plot of the equation: [bound] =B max × [free]/(K D + [free]), where [bound] is the concentration of total lipid bound, [free] is the concentration of free PI in solution, andB max is the saturation binding. COS cells transfected with pEGFP-PIKfyve cDNA constructs were fractionated to total membranes and cytosol by sequential centrifugations for 5 min at 800 × g and 15 min at 200,000 × g in a Beckman TL-1000 Ultracentrifuge. In some experiments, the total membranes were separated into intracellular membrane-enriched and plasma membrane-enriched fractions following subcellular differential centrifugation protocols characterized for 3T3-L1 adipocytes as outlined previously (23Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (CLONTECH) subsequent to protein separation by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane was performed as described previously (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the FYVE finger domain in PIKfyve to interact specifically with PtdIns 3-P in vitro, beads containing GST fusion of PIKfyve N-terminal region (residues 99–473), harboring the FYVE domain (residues 168–224), were incubated with radioactive liposomes composed of up to 65% PtdCho, 20% PtdSer, 15% PtdEth, and different concentrations of the indicated PI at the expense of PtdCho. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, inclusion of 2% PtdIns 4-P, PtdIns 5-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2, PtdIns 4,5-P2, or PtdIns did not result in increased binding of the PIKfyve FYVE domain fusion peptide to the liposome matrix. In contrast, inclusion of 2% PtdIns 3-P markedly increased the binding of the PIKfyve FYVE domain to liposomes. The specificity of the binding was further substantiated by the classical saturation curve obtained at increased amounts of the FYVE domain peptide and by the inability of GST alone or GST fused with a control protein of similar size (GDI-2, Ref. 28Shisheva A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 39: 39-50Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to bind PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes (Fig. 1, A andB). Furthermore, the binding of PIKfyve FYVE domain to PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes was of high affinity with aK D of ∼550 nm as calculated from the saturation kinetics obtained when GST-PIKfyve-(99–473) was incubated with progressively increasing concentrations of PtdIns 3-P in the liposome matrix (Fig. 1 C). The specific binding of the GST-PIKfyve-(99–473) protein fragment to the PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes was entirely dependent on the presence of the FYVE finger. Deletion of 21 residues within the FYVE finger core region (CSEKFTTFRRRHHCRLCGQIF) that harbors the basic patch of conservative residues engaged in PtdIns 3-P ligation (13Fruman D.A. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) resulted in abrogation of the GST-PIKfyve-(99–473)Δ177–198-specific binding to PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes (Fig. 1 A). Together, these data demonstrate a direct and high affinity binding of an intact FYVE domain peptide fragment of PIKfyve specifically with PtdIns 3-P. PIKfyve is a PtdIns 3-P-metabolizing enzyme with a putative catalytic region positioned at the C terminus of the molecule (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This indicates that, besides the N-terminal FYVE domain, PIKfyve displays an additional region for PtdIns 3-P-specific binding in the substrate activation loop. Whereas bacterially expressed GST peptide fragment of the entire catalytic domain (residues 1684–2052) was enzymatically inactive (12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we examined the affinity of this fragment toward PtdIns 3-P. Beads containing a GST fusion of the PIKfyve catalytic domain were incubated with radioactive liposomes composed of 65–63% PtdCho, 20% PtdSer, 15% PtdEth, and 0–2% PtdIns 3-P. Small but statistically significant specific binding to PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes was documented in eight separate experiments (Fig. 2 A). This binding was of much lower affinity compared with that of the FYVE finger domain and showed a K D >7 μm(Fig. 2 B). Specific binding of the PIKfyve catalytic fragment to PtdIns-containing liposomes was not detected under the conditions of our liposome-binding assay (data not shown), indicating that, although full-length PIKfyve could convert PtdIns substrate, this interaction is below the sensitivity of our liposome-binding assay. Likewise, a specific binding to other PIs was not detected (data not shown). We next assessed the involvement of the two adjacent basic residues, Lys-1999 and Lys-2000, within the consensus sequence T(F/Y)T(W/L)DKKLE(S/TM)WVKXXG proposed to define the specificity of the PtdIns 3-P substrate activation loop in PIKfyve (25Ikonomov, O., Sbrissa, D., Mlak, K., Kanzaki, M., Pessin, J., and Shisheva, A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Immobilized GST fusion peptide fragments of the PIKfyve catalytic domain, in which either or both of these residues were replaced with Glu, were incubated with PtdCho- or PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes under standard assay conditions. The K2000E mutant exhibited specific binding to PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes at a level similar to the wild type peptide fragment (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, mutation in the ATP-binding site Lys-1831 (26Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) did not significantly alter the specific binding of GST-PIKfyve-(1798–2052)K1831E fusion peptide to PtdIns 3-P-containing liposomes (data not shown). In contrast, a mutation in Lys-1999 resulted in a complete loss of PtdIns 3-P-specific binding in both GST-PIKfyve-(1798–2052)K1999Eand GST-PIKfyve-(1798–2052)K1999/2000E mutants (Fig.2 A). Together these results indicate that the PIKfyve catalytic domain specifically interacts with PtdIns 3-P but with affinity that is >12-fold lower than that measured for the PIKfyve FYVE finger-PtdIns 3-P interaction. In addition, these results identify Lys-1999 as a critical residue in the PtdIns 3-P-specific binding, which is supported further by our recent functional observations, demonstrating a dramatic loss of the PtdIns 3,5-P2-forming activity associated with the expression of the full-length PIKfyveK1999E or PIKfyveK1999/2000E mutants (25Ikonomov, O., Sbrissa, D., Mlak, K., Kanzaki, M., Pessin, J., and Shisheva, A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Our immunofluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the FYVE domain is a necessary determinant in PIKfyve association with vesicle structures (Refs. 12Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Shisheva A. Rusin B. I"

Polyunsaturated free fatty acids alone, as well as synergistically with sterols, decrease SRE-mediated gene expression up to 80% in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing levels of the active transcription factor SREBP. We investigated potential mechanisms for this effect. We hypothesized that free fatty acids reduce SREBP-mediated gene transcription by increasing intracellular cholesterol content through the hydrolysis of cellular sphingomyelin, which has a high affinity for free cholesterol.

Sequential cleavage by two proteases, site-1 protease and site-2 protease, releases transcriptionally active mature SREBP (mSREBP). In the nucleus, SREBP binds to SREs, cis-acting elements in the promoters of genes of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Cholesterol exerts a negative feedback mechanism on its own synthesis by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage of SREBP by site-1 protease. SREBP-mediated regulation has been demonstrated for a number of key enzymes in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (7Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

Our earlier data showed that the effect of fatty acids is dependent on changing SREBP cleavage. Fatty acids do not affect the mSREBP protein once it has been cleaved from the precursor protein. For example, fatty acids did not reduce SRE-mediated gene expression in mutant cells overexpressing the mSREBP protein (9Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that one contributing pathway whereby fatty acids modulate intracellular cholesterol movement is by affecting cellular sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component, has a higher affinity for free cholesterol than for other phospholipids (13Barenholz Y. Gatt S. Hawthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Sphingomyelin: Metabolism, Chemical Synthesis and Physical Properties. 4. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1982: 29-177Google Scholar, 14Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J.

Sphingomyelinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, has been shown to be activated by fatty acids (16Robinson B.S. Hii C.S. Poulos A. Ferrante A. Immunology. 1997; 91: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We anticipated, as shown by others (18Slotte J.P. Harmala A.S. Jansson C. Porn M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that decreasing plasma membrane sphingomyelin content would induce more free cholesterol to partition to other intracellular membranes (e.g. to the endoplasmic reticulum), resulting in decreased SREBP cleavage. Our data support this hypothesis. Furthermore, we found that a product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, ceramide, independently and reversibly decreases SRE expression. Our data provide new evidence for sterol- and non-sterol-related effects of fatty acids on the maturation cascade of SREBP. [3H]Choline (75 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). [3H]Sphingomyelin (N-palmitoyl[9,10-3H]sphingomyelin), received from Dr. Ira Tabas (Columbia University), was synthesized as previously described (21Schissel S.L. Jiang X.

It contains the 3H label on the palmitic acid, allowing identification of ceramide obtained after sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Sphingomyelinase (Bacillus cereus), ethanol, oleate, stearate, arachidonate, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and U18666A (3-β-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)androst-5-en-17-one) were obtained from Sigma. (1S,2R)-d-erythro-2- (N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (d-MAPP), C2-ceramide (d-erythro-N-acetylsphinganine), C6-ceramide (d-erythro-hexanoylsphingosine), C8-ceramide (d-erythro-N-octanoylsphingosine), and C6-dihydroceramide (d-erythro-N-hexanoyldihydrosphingosine) were obtained from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All cell culture reagents, LipofectAMINE, and neomycin (G418) were obtained from Invitrogen. All organic solvents were purchased from Fisher. (Springfield, NJ). The pSyn-SRE plasmid contains a generic TATA-box and three SREs (bp −326 to −225) of the hamster hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG-CoA synthase) promoter fused to the luciferase pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and has been described (9Worgall T.S.

CHO cells were grown in F-12 nutrient mixture containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) glutamine, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified CO2 (5%). To obtain stable transfectants, CHO cells were plated in 12-well plates at 50% confluency and transfected for 5 h in the presence of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with pSyn-SRE (1 μg/well) and pWLNeo (0.25 μg/well) using LipofectAMINE (1.5 μl/well). Cells were then incubated for 2 days in growth medium. On day 3, neomycin-containing medium (400 μg/ml) was added. Selection for neomycin-resistant colonies was continued for 3 weeks. Pooled clones were analyzed for luciferase expression. Experiments were performed with pooled clones as well as with cells derived from a single clone. Cells were grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml neomycin. For experimental use, cells were plated in the absence of neomycin at least 24 h ahead in regular growth medium. Cells to be analyzed for luciferase activity were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, and 10 mm MgSO4, pH 7.7. Cells were frozen once at −70 °C, thawed, scraped, collected, vortexed, and briefly centrifuged to pellet cell debris. An aliquot was used to measure luciferase activities in a Berthold LB 9501 luminometer (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) with a luciferin reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity in relative light units was divided by protein content (mg/ml) for each extract. β-Galactosidase activities were determined in a 30-μl aliquot using a high sensitivity β-galactosidase assay kit (Stratagene). Fatty acids were dissolved in 100% ethanol and complexed to BSA at a molar ratio of 2:1 as described (2Rumsey S.C. Galeano N.F. Lipschitz B. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10008-10016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of ethanol (<0.1% of the medium volume) were added under control conditions and had no effect on reporter gene and other assays. The amount of cell protein was determined by the Bio-Rad method, and BSA was used as a standard. Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide thiazolyl blue test (23Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, the ability of cells to convert 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to an insoluble formazan by cleavage of the tetrazolium ring by dehydrogenase enzymes is evaluated and used to measure cell viability, cell number, and cytotoxicity. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis of isolated nuclei stained with propidium iodide using a method previously described (24Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted at 200 × g and fixed in 2 ml of cold 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 60 min. The cells were then centrifuged, washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. To a 0.5-ml cell sample was added 0.5 ml of RNase (1 mg/ml). After mixing, 10 μg/ml propidium iodide solution was added. The solution was kept at 4 °C in the dark until measured by FACScan flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The sphingomyelinase activity of cell extracts was measured as described (21Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). CHO cells were plated in 35-mm plates and incubated for 18 h with 0.3 mmoleate, 10 μg/ml cholesterol plus 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, the control conditions containing 1% BSA, or 10 microunits/ml sphingomyelinase. After the incubation, cells were washed two times with ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose and scraped into 0.3 ml of sucrose solution/35-mm plate. The scraped cells of two plates were pooled and disrupted by sonication on ice using three 5-s bursts (Branson Model 450 sonifier). An aliquot of 15 μg of cell protein and 50 pmol of [3H]sphingomyelin containing [3H]palmitic acid as the label and resuspended in Triton X-100-containing buffer (1.55 g of Triton X-100 in 50 ml of 0.25m sucrose) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl in buffer containing 0.1 m sodium acetate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.0. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43071) Google Scholar). To label cellular sphingomyelin, 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]choline was added to the culture medium, and labeling was performed for 48 h to allow for equilibrium distribution (26Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 6-well plates for the different experiments. To assess the effect of fatty acids on sphingomyelin hydrolysis, cells were treated for 1 h in the presence of 0.3 mm stearate, oleate, or arachidonate. Controls were incubated with serum-free medium containing 1% BSA, 10 μg/ml cholesterol plus 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, or 10 microunits/ml sphingomyelinase. Because membrane phospholipids may turnover rapidly, we analyzed the effect of fatty acids over the first hour (28Gallaher W.R. Weinstein D.B. Blough H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Gallaher W.R. Blough H.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 168: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After the incubation, cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer, scraped, and transferred to glass tubes. An aliquot was used for luciferase and protein determination. Then, 1 ml of ice-cold methanol, 2 ml of chloroform, and 0.5 ml of 0.1 nHCl were added; vortexed; and spun at 800 × g for 10 min. The upper phase was discarded, and the organic phase was washed with 3× 2 ml of 0.001 n HCl. Lipids were then dried under N2. Alkaline hydrolysis was performed to remove [3H]phosphatidylcholine. Dried lipid was incubated in 2 ml of 0.1 n KOH in methanol at 37 °C for 1 h. Lipids were then re-extracted by adding 2 ml of chloroform and 1.2 ml of balanced salt solution (135 mm NaCl, 4.5 mmKCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mmHepes, pH 7.2) containing 100 mm EDTA (1.08 ml/0.12 ml). After vortexing and centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, the lower phase was dried under N2 (27Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Santana P. Fanjul L.F. Ruiz de Galarreta C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 105: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted lipids were then dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), spotted onto TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and chromatographed with chloroform, methanol, and 0.22% aqueous CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v) (31van Echten-Deckert G. Klein A. Linke T. Heinemann T. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide and sphingomyelin (dissolved at 1 μg/μl) were run as standards. The lipids were identified according to their RF values after visualization in an iodine vapor tank. The TLC plate was cut at the corresponding lipid spots, mixed with scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, Packard Instrument Co.), and analyzed in a Wallac 1409 scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Results are expressed in dpm/mg of protein as a percentage of total counts. Cells were plated on day 1 in regular growth medium. On day 2, cells were incubated in control medium (1% fatty acid-free BSA) or under the respective conditions. Two hours before harvesting, all cells received 25 μg/mlN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal to inhibit proteolysis of SREBP by the proteasome. After 8 h, cells were scraped and pelleted at 1000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in Western lysis buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed and homogenized by passing 20 times though a 22-gauge needle. An aliquot of each sample (30 μg of protein) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The monoclonal antibodies against SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (NIF 824; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were used for Western blot analysis according to the manufacturers' instructions. Detection was performed with the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein mobilities were compared with prestained broad-range molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). CHO cells were plated on day 1 at 80% confluency and treated under the respective conditions for 8 h. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. RNA concentration was calculated from absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA (30 μg) was separated on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% denaturing agarose and capillary-transferred to Duralon UV membranes (Stratagene). The cDNA probe for Northern hybridization of HMG-CoA synthase was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from human THP-1 macrophage mRNA using previously described primers (9Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The blot was hybridized in Quick-Hyb (Stratagene) for 1 h with cDNA probes for HMG-CoA synthase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase corresponding to bases 247–882 as a loading control. Probes were labeled by random priming (Stratagene Prime-It® Random priming labeling kit) using 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 50 ng of DNA fragment. Statistical significance was calculated by paired t tests. Unless otherwise indicated, results are given as means ± S.D. All experiments were repeated on different days at least three times and each time in triplicate. Most cellular cholesterol is located within the plasma membrane (14Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it has a high affinity for sphingomyelin (13Barenholz Y. Gatt S. Hawthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Sphingomyelin: Metabolism, Chemical Synthesis and Physical Properties. 4. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1982: 29-177Google Scholar, 32Turner J.D. Rouser G. Lipids. 1974; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We investigated the ability of different fatty acids to enhance hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, a mechanism that would promote the release of cholesterol from the plasma membrane. CHO cells were incubated for 1 h with myristic acid, palmitate, stearate, oleate, or arachidonate. Before addition of fatty acids, the CHO cells were incubated with [3H]choline for 48 h to label cellular sphingomyelin. The results in Fig.1 show that treatment with a 0.3 mm concentration of the unsaturated fatty acid oleate or arachidonate reduced the amount of [3H]choline-labeled sphingomyelin by one-third compared with that obtained under control conditions. Neither saturated fatty acids nor cholesterol plus 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased the amount of [3H]choline-labeled sphingomyelin. Treatment with sphingomyelinase (shown as a positive control) reduced [3H]choline-labeled sphingomyelin to about half of control values (Fig. 1). To examine the ability of oleate to increase sphingomyelin hydrolysis after longer incubations, an in vitro assay for sphingomyelinase activity was established. Cell extracts from cells treated for 18 h with 0.3 mmoleate were incubated for 1 h with [3H]sphingomyelin. The [3H]sphingomyelin that was used is labeled on the fatty acid moiety, allowing measurement of [3H]ceramide resulting from [3H]sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Cell extracts from oleate-treated cells converted one-half of the total sphingomyelin to ceramide compared with controls or cells incubated with cholesterol, which both converted only one-fourth of [3H]sphingomyelin to [3H]ceramide (Fig. 2). It has been shown that short-term incubations (90–150 min) with exogenous sphingomyelinase decrease the amount of mSREBP protein (33Scheek S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11179-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of sphingomyelin hydrolysis over a longer period of time, cells that stably express the SRE linked to a luciferase reporter gene were incubated in the presence of sphingomyelinase for 8 h. Sphingomyelinase decreased SRE-mediated gene transcription to one-third after 8 h. Incubation of sphingomyelinase together with 0.3 mm oleate did not further decrease SRE-mediated luciferase expression (Fig.3). Sphingomyelin hydrolysis decreases the capacity to bind cholesterol within the plasma membrane (34Slotte J.P. Tenhunen J. Porn I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Ohvo H. Olsio C. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and results in the generation of phosphocholine and ceramide. Ceramide is a second messenger implicated in multiple cellular pathways such as cell growth, differentiation, regulation of transcription factors, and apoptosis (37Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kolesnick R.N. Fuks Z. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). By several lines of evidence, we determined that fatty acids or ceramide analogs did not induce apoptosis or cell death under our experimental conditions. First, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide mitochondrial uptake assay (23Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar) showed no differences between control and treatment groups up to 24 h. Second, propidium iodide uptake of nuclei analyzed by FACScan (24Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar) showed no difference between control and treatment groups (data not shown). Third, the effects of ceramide were reversible and did not affect expression of another reporter gene (see below). Fourth, protein levels were not decreased by ceramide treatment. The effect of ceramide on SRE-mediated gene expression was investigated next. Fig. 4 shows that the ceramide analog C2-ceramide decreased SRE-mediated gene transcription by 5 h and that this effect was synergistic with oleate. Incubation for 16 h with 0.3 mm oleate alone caused the previously described decrease in SRE-mediated gene expression (9Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). After 16 h, the effect of ceramide alone on SRE expression apparently disappeared; but in the presence of 0.3 mm oleate, a substantial decrease persisted. Addition of fresh C2-ceramide at 8 h sustained the decrease in SRE-mediated reporter gene expression, suggesting instability of the compound over an extended period of time. 2A. H. Merrill, personal communication. Because C2-ceramide can serve as a substrate for the synthesis of sphingomyelin, we also tested the effects of the longer chain C6- and C8-ceramides, which are not substrates for sphingomyelin synthesis. Incubation for 8 h with C6- or C8-ceramide similarly decreased SRE-mediated gene transcription to 46 ± 8 and 43 ± 7%, respectively. We determined next whether the effect of ceramide analogs on SRE-mediated gene transcription is reversible. Cells were incubated with C2-ceramide for 5 h, sufficient time to substantially decrease SRE-mediated reporter gene transcription, as shown in Fig. 4. The medium was then changed to control medium (1% BSA) for 3 h for a total incubation time of 8 h. Fig.5 shows that SRE-mediated gene transcription returned to control levels, indicating that the effects of ceramide are reversible. We then determined the protein levels of SREBP at 8 and 16 h in the presence of C2-ceramide. The levels of mSREBP-1 and SREBP-2 decreased at 8 h (Fig.6A). Parallel to the reporter gene assays (Fig. 4), mSREBP levels returned to co"

Currently, three mammalian isoforms (Akt1/PKBα Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ) of the kinase have been identified (1Brodbeck D. Hill M.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29550-29558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Brodbeck D. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

The isoforms share a high degree of structural homology with human Akt1 having 81 and 83% amino acid identity with Akt2 and Akt3, respectively. Akt1 and Akt2 knockout mice suggested distinct roles for each of the Akt family kinases (4Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I.

Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The kinases have two distinct functional domains: an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain mediating protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (3Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 6Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

The basic activation process of the Akt isoforms seems to be uniform. After the binding of growth factors to their cell surface receptors, Akt is translocated to the plasma membrane secondary to binding of the PH domain with products of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway: phosphatidylinositide 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate. The activation of Akt is then regulated by phosphorylation on two regulatory sites: threonine 308/309/305 and serine 473/474/472 (Akt1/2/3, respectively) with phosphorylation of both required for maximal kinase activity (2Brodbeck D. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9133-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the threonine residue occurs through the activity of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (3Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 6Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 7Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the kinase(s), putatively named PDK2, responsible for phosphorylation of the serine residue remains unclear. Recently, Akt kinase activity was demonstrated to be required for serine phosphorylation to occur in vitro, suggesting that Akt autophosphorylation might play a role in the process (8Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After activation, Akt has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate a number of pivotal pro-apoptotic molecules including BAD, Nur77, and forkhead transcription factor (9Brunet A. Bonni A.

Despite a high degree of structural identity and a similar activation process, there appears to be variability in the physiological roles of the Akt isoforms. Akt1 and Akt2 seem to be ubiquitously expressed, whereas the expression of Akt3 is more restricted with predominance toward heart, kidney, brain, testes, lung, and skeletal muscle (2Brodbeck D. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9133-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). There is also evidence of differential regulation of the isoforms after induction by a common Akt activator. In human esophageal cancer cell lines, epidermal growth factor stimulation led to the activation of all Akt isoforms in some cell lines, whereas, in others, only Akt1 and Akt2 or solely Akt1 were phosphorylated and activated (17Okano J. Gaslightwala I. Birnbaum M.J. Rustgi A.K. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The identity of factors possibly contributing to isoform-specific regulation of Akt remains currently unknown. We have found previously in a yeast two-hybrid screening that the proto-oncogene TCL1, implicated in human T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (18Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Isobe M. Russo G. Croce C.M. Proc.

In functional assays we found that all three proteins of the TCL1 family (TCL1, MTCP1, and TCL1b) were able to interact with Akt1 in mammalian cells and enhance Akt kinase activity (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 16Pekarsky Y. Koval A. Hallas C. Bichi R. Tresini M. Malstrom S.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5638-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further, TCL1 was able to promote the formation of oligomeric TCL1-Akt protein complexes in which the kinase was preferentially phosphorylated and activated (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because TCL1, MTCP1, and TCL1b only share 30–50% amino acid homology with each other, we hypothesized that they may show specificity in binding with the three Akt isoforms and differentially function as Akt co-activators. We further hypothesized that, as TCL1 facilitates the formation of Akt oligomers, interaction with more than one Akt isoform might result in Akt hetero-oligomerization. In the present report, we show that, in contrast to Akt1 and Akt2, which can interact with TCL1, MTCP1, and TCL1b, Akt3 specifically binds to TCL1. Further, only TCL1 can enhance Akt3 phosphorylation and kinase activity in vitro with PH domain as the functional determinant. Finally, we show that TCL1 binds to each of the Akt kinases in TCL1-overexpressing leukemic cells, and that TCL1 facilitates heterodimerization of different Akt molecules, which may contribute to the development of human malignancies associated with TCL1 overexpression. Mammalian expression constructs (pCMV6-HA-Akt1, pCMV6-HA-Akt2, pCMV2-Flag-TCL1, pME-18S-HA-TCL1, pCMV2-Flag-MTCP1, pCAGGS-Flag-TCL1b) and prokaryotic expression vectors for generation of GST fusion proteins (pGEX4T2-TCL1, pGEX4T2-MTCP1, and pGEX4T2-TCL1b) have been described previously (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for HA-Akt3K177M and HA-Akt3T305A/S472A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with wild-type pCMV-HA-Akt3 (generous gift from B. Hemmings) as template. GFP-tagged HA-Akt3 (GFP-HA-Akt3) was generated by digesting pCMV-HA-Akt3 and ligating the insert with the pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) vector. Expression vectors for full-length flag-Akt3, flag-PHAkt3 (amino acids 1–119 of Akt3), and flag-cAkt3 (amino acids 120–479) were generated by PCR (primer pairs 5′-ATCGAATTCATGAGCGATGTTACCATTGTGAAG and 5′-ATCAGATCTTTATTCTCGTCCACTTGCAG, 5′-ATCGAATTCATGAGCGATGTTACCATTGTGAAG and 5′-ATCAGATCTTTAACAATTCATTCTCTCCTCTTC, and 5′-ATCATCGAATTCAGTCCAACTTCACAAATTGAT and 5′-ATCAGATCTTTATTCTCGTCCACTTGCAG, respectively) with pCMV-HA-Akt3 as template and introducing a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′BglII site. PCR products were then subcloned toEcoRI/BamHI-digested pCMV2-Flag cassette (Sigma). The chimeric pME-18S-HA-Akt3/Akt1 construct was generated by PCR amplifying the coding sequences of the first 119 amino acids of Akt3 (PH-Akt3) and that of amino acids 121–480 of Akt1 (C-terminal Akt1), and subcloning both inserts into the pME-18S-HA cassette (15Laine J.

Stern), and P3HR-1 (HTB-62) (ATCC) cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments 293T cells were co-transfected with a total of 10 μg (5 μg of each plasmid) of indicated plasmids/10-cm diameter dish, except for the experiment demonstrating enhanced interaction of Akt1 with Akt3 in the presence of TCL1 in which 1 μg of pCMV-HA-Akt1 and 1 μg of pCMV2-Flag-Akt3 were transfected together with 8 μg of pME18S-TCL1-myc or PCMV empty vector (sham). 48–72 h after transfection, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold Brij 97 lysis buffer (0.875% Brij 97 (Sigma), 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH7.5), and 2.5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitor mix (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) added. Lysates were precleaned for 1 h with 50/50% (v/v) protein A/protein G mix and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with anti-HA (3F10, Roche), anti-Flag (M2, Sigma), or anti-mouse-IgG as control. The samples were washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer, after which SDS sample buffer was added, the samples resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted with monoclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (M2, Sigma). In experiments using Sup-T1, SupT-11, and P3HR-1 cell lines, precleaning was performed using protein G and immunoprecipitation was done overnight at 4 °C using isoform-specific anti-Akt1, anti-Akt2, or anti-Akt3 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) with sheep normal serum as control. Western blotting for Akt was done using anti-pan-Akt antibody (New England Biolabs) or monoclonal anti-TCL1 antibody 27D6 (generous gift from R. Bichi). In vitro translation reactions were performed using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), using [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), T7 polymerase, and human full-length Akt3 in pBluescript SK II (Stratagene). 10 μl of in vitrotranslated Akt3 protein product was mixed with 6 μg of each GST fusion protein and 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) (control, TCL1, MTCP1, or TCL1b) in 400 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with NETN buffer. After the final wash 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer was added to each reaction, and the samples were resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and autoradiographed. The assays were performed using the Akt kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technologies) with the modifications described previously (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M.

For the preparation of HA-Akt1, HA-Akt2, HA-Akt3 HA-Akt3/Akt1, and GFP-HA-Akt3 (wild-type and K177M). 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of the indicated plasmid/10-cm plate. 48 h after transfection the cells were harvested as described above for co-immunoprecipitation except adding 10 mm NaF and 1 mm NaVO3 to Bri97 lysis buffer, precleaned for 1 h at 4 °C with 50/50% (v/v) protein A/protein G mix and immunoprecipitated for 16–18 h at 4 °C with anti-HA (3F10, Roche) or anti-GFP (CLONTECH) monoclonal antibodies. After immunoprecipitation samples were washed three times with ice cold lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (Akt kinase assay kit, Cell Signaling Technologies). Baculoviral HA-Akt1K179D was generated as described (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). IVK reaction was performed using GSK-3-paramyosin fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technologies) or mBAD as substrates by incubating 0.5 μg of the indicated substrate proteins in the presence of 5 ng of indicated immobilized Akt and the indicated amount of GST fusion proteins (GST-TCL1, -MTCP1, -TCL1b or control) for 0–12 min at 30 °C. The total amount of GST fusion proteins in each reaction was normalized to 15 μg by adding GST-control protein to the reaction samples. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer, the samples were resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted with anti-HA (3F10, Roche), phosphospecific anti-Akt (Ser-473), phosphospecific anti-Bad (Ser-136), and phosphospecific anti-GSK-3 (S21/9) (Cell Signaling Technologies). All kinase assays have been quantitated using the NIH Image (version 1.62) software, and the numbers (-fold increase compared with the control) are shown in each figure. 293 cells (ATCC) were transfected with 1 μg of pEGFP-HA-Akt3 K177M (pEGFP vector,CLONTECH) together with 6 μg/10-cm dish of pCMV2-Flag TCL1, pCMV2 Flag-36–38A TCL1 (dimerization-defective mutant form of TCL1), 2G. Künstle, et al.(2002) Mol. Cell Biol. 22. or vector control (pCMV2 Flag vector, Eastman Kodak Co.). 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h before harvesting. The cells were lysed, precleaned with protein A/protein G mix, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag beads (M2, Kodak) or control antibody (data not shown) as described (14Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt, anti-Akt, or anti-Flag antibodies as indicated. There are currently three known members of the TCL1 family (TCL1, MTCP1, and TCL1b) and three known Akt kinase isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3). TCL1, MTCP1, and TCL1b have all been shown previously to interact with Akt1 (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, because they have only 30–50% amino acid homology, we hypothesized that they might show isoform specificity in their interaction with the other Akt kinases. In mammalian overexpression systems using 293T cells, we first confirmed that TCL1 is capable of binding to all Akt isoforms (Fig. 1A). The interaction is not dependent on Akt kinase activity or phosphorylation status because, in addition to wild-type Akt3, TCL1 co-immunoprecipitated with ATP-binding site mutated Akt3, and activation site mutated Akt3 (Fig.1B). We next found that, in mammalian overexpression systems, Akt3 selectively interacts with TCL1, but not with MTCP1 or TCL1b (Fig.1C). The results were consistent in GST-pull down assays, which verified the TCL1 specificity of Akt3 binding compared with MTCP1 and TCL1b (Fig. 1D). Similarly to Akt1 and in contrast to Akt3, Akt2 was capable of binding with TCL1 and with MTCP1 and TCL1b (data not shown). The results indicate that, although Akt1 and Akt2 interact with all three TCL1 family members, Akt3 shows specificity for TCL1 and does not bind to MTCP1 or TCL1b. Because Akt3 binds selectively to TCL1 but not to MTCP1 or TCL1b, we hypothesized that similar specificity applies to Akt3 kinase activity induction by the proteins. In in vitro Akt3 kinase assays using human Akt3 immobilized from transfected 293T cells and GSK-3α as substrate, we found that only the presence of TCL1 but not MTCP1 or TCL1b significantly enhanced GSK-3α phosphorylation. However, in the same experiment, all three TCL1 isoforms were able to enhance Akt1-dependent GSK-3α phosphorylation. Analogously, all three isoforms enhanced Akt2-dependent GSK-3α phosphorylation in vitro(Fig. 2A). We further confirmed the effects of TCL1 on Akt3 kinase activity in a time-course study and found that GSK-3α phosphorylation was enhanced in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2B). To determine that the effect of TCL1 on Akt3 kinase activity was not GSK-3α substrate-specific, we performed in vitro kinase assays using BAD as substrate and found that TCL1 enhanced Akt3-induced BAD phosphorylation on Ser-136 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2C). Additionally, in accordance with our previous findings that TCL1 facilitates Akt1 phosphorylation and activation, we found that the increase in BAD phosphorylation was accompanied by corresponding TCL1 dose-dependent increases in Akt3 Ser-472 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). TCL1-induced kinase activation was Akt-specific because TCL1 did not enhance the phosphorylation on kemptide by either protein kinase A or protein kinase A-related kinase (data not shown). The results show that, similar to the specificity of the interaction with the members of the TCL1 oncogene family, Akt1 and Akt2 kinase activity is enhanced by all family members, whereas that of Akt3 can only be induced by TCL1, but not MTCP1 or TCL1b. In a mammalian overexpression system, we then determined that the interaction between Akt3 and TCL1 is mediated through Akt3 PH domain, because TCL1 co-immunoprecipitated with both full-length Akt3 and the PH domain of Akt3 (lanes 1–3), but not with C-terminal Akt3 (Fig. 3A). As it appeared that the PH domain was the functional determinant for the TCL1 specificity of Akt3, we generated a chimeric form of Akt in which Akt3 PH domain was fused to the C terminus of Akt1 (Fig.3B). We then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found that wild-type Akt1 interacted with all three TCL1 isoforms (Fig. 3C), and the chimeric Akt3/Akt1 selectively bound to TCL1 but not to MTCP1 or TCL1b (Fig. 3C). The association also showed functional selectivity because only TCL1, but not MTCP1 or TCL1b, was able to enhance GSK-3α phosphorylation by the chimeric Akt3/Akt1 in in vitro kinase assays (Fig.3D). Together the results indicate that, despite the high degree of sequence homology (82%) between the Akt1 and Akt3 PH domains, the differences are sufficient to lead to functional differences among the Akt kinase family. In contrast to the Akt kinases, which are ubiquitously expressed in most tissues under normal physiological conditions, the expression of TCL1 is restricted. However, in human disease in addition to T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), TCL1 is widely expressed in hematological malignancies including lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (21Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Croce C.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5638-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Teitell M. Damore M.A. Sulur G.G. Turner D.E. Stern M.H. Said J.W. Denny C.T. Wall R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Croce C.M. Russo G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2095-2100PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that, in human disease in TCL1-overexpressing cells, TCL1 could interact with all three Akt isoforms in vivo. We first examined expression of TCL1. Both SUPT-11 (T cell leukemia) and P3HR-1 (Burkitt's lymphoma), but not SUP-T1 acute T-cell leukemia cell line, express TCL1 (Fig.4A). However, all three Akt isoforms are present as determined by immunoprecipitation with Akt1-, Akt2-, and Akt3-specific antibodies followed by immunoblotting with a pan-Akt antibody (data not shown). Moreover, endogenous TCL1 co-immunoprecipitated with Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 in both SUPT-11 and P3HR-1 cells, whereas no background was observed in SUP-T1 cells (Fig.4B). TCL-1 forms homo-oligomers in vivo and can associate with all Akt isoforms; we then postulated that the presence of TCL1 could facilitate the formation of oligomers encompassing different Akt isoforms. In a mammalian overexpression system, we found that co-transfection of HA-Akt1 and Flag-Akt3 with TCL1-Myc enabled the co-immunoprecipitation of Akt1 with Akt3 compared with similar transfection of Akt1 and Akt3 with an empty vector control (Fig.4C). Because TCL1 was able to induce hetero-oligomerization of Akt3 with Akt1 and autophosphorylation has been reported to be one mechanism of Akt Ser-472/473 phosphorylation, we performed in vitro kinase assays to determine whether transphosphorylation between Akt molecules could occur in the oligomeric protein complex. We generated GFP-tagged wild-type and kinase inactive Akt3. Because of the additional GFP (30-kDa mass; Fig. 5A,left panel), GFP-Akt3 can be distinguished from non-tagged Akt (retarded migration on SDS gels). In vitrokinase assays were performed using baculovirally generated kinase-inactive K179D Akt1 (15Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as a potential transphosphorylation target for GFP-wild-type Akt3. In the presence of TCL1, but not in its absence, GFP-WT Akt3 was able to enhance Ser-473 phosphorylation and of K179D Akt1 (Fig. 5A). The effect required the presence of Akt kinase activity, as similarly prepared GFP-Akt3 K177M had no effect on K179D Akt1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Together, the results demonstrate that transphosphorylation can occur between two different Akt molecules in the presence of TCL1 in vitro. We then determined whether Akt transphosphorylation or a similar event could occur in vivo in the presence of TCL1. Kinase-inactive GFP-Akt3 K177M was co-transfected into 293 cells together with Flag-wild-type TCL1, Flag-36–38A-TCL1 (TCL1 mutant incapable of homodimerization)2 or sham. As shown in Fig. 5B, equal amounts of endogenous Akt and transfected GFP-Akt3 K177M co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type and dimerization-deficient 36–38A TCL1. However, the Ser-473 phosphorylation levels of both endogenous and transfected Akt were significantly higher in cells transfected with wild-type TCL1 compared with the cells transfected with 36–38A TCL1. Thus, TCL1 homodimerization and resulting Akt oligomerization are required for TCL1 enhanced Akt phosphorylation in vivo. Despite the highly conserved structure and the common activation process of three mammalian Akt isoforms, there are differences in the expression pattern, regulation following cell stimulation by growth factors, and implication in the pathogenesis of specific malignancies between the isoforms. Akt1 and Akt2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Akt3 seems to be mainly expressed in brain, testes, kidney, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle (2Brodbeck D. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9133-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

However, any factors responsible for isoform-specific regulation of the Akt kinases have not previously been identified. The TCL1 protein family consists of three members (TCL1, MTCP1, and TCL1b), which do not contain any known functional motifs. Proteins of the TCL1 family share a relatively low degree of amino acid homology (30–50%), but a unique symmetrical β-barrel structure based on x-ray crystallographic analysis of TCL1 (25Hoh F.

The 5-LO core promoter required for basal promoter activity has a unique (G+C)-rich sequence that contains five tandem Sp1 consensus sequences. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell type-specific 5-LO expression are unknown. Here we show that 5-LO expression is regulated by DNA methylation. Treatment of the 5-LO-negative cell lines U937 and HL-60TB with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AdC) up-regulated expression of 5-LO primary transcripts and mature mRNA in a similar fashion, indicating that AdC stimulates 5-LO gene transcription. Analysis of the methylation status of the 5-LO promoter revealed that the core promoter region was methylated in U937 and HL-60TB cells, whereas it was unmethylated in the 5-LO-positive parent HL-60 cell line. Reporter gene assays with 5-LO promoter constructs gave up to 68- and 655-fold repression of 5-LO promoter activity in HeLa and Mono Mac 6 cells by methylation. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), potent inducers of the 5-LO pathway in myeloid cell lines, increased 5-LO RNA expression in HL-60TB and U937 cells, but co-treatment with AdC was required to achieve 5-LO expression levels in HL-60TB cells that were comparable with wild-type HL-60 cells. In reporter gene assays, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGFβ were unable to induce promoter activity when the 5-LO promoter constructs were methylated, which suggests that 5-LO promoter demethylation is a prerequisite for the high level induction of 5-LO gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TGFβ and that the effects of both agents on 5-LO mRNA expression are not related to DNA methylation. 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), the key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis, is expressed in a tissue- and cell differentiation-specific manner.

Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 69-83Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, several cytokines have been shown to be inducers of the 5-LO pathway. In granulocytes 5-LO expression is stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (4Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Dubois C.M. Blood. 1995; 85: 3719-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas interleukin-3 regulates the development of the 5-LO pathway in mouse mast cells (5Murakami M. Austen K.F. Bingham III, C.O.

In the human myeloid leukemic cell lines HL-60 and Mono Mac 6, cell differentiation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) leads to a strong induction of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (6Brungs M.

In Mono Mac 6 cells, the induction of 5-LO protein expression and activity by TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3 was accompanied by a 64-fold up-regulation of mature 5-LO mRNA and an up to 5-fold increase in 5-LO primary transcripts (7Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Härle D. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas no significant induction of 5-LO transcription was found in nuclear run-off assays (9Härle D. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 105-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human 5-LO gene promoter was first characterized by Hoshiko et al.(10Hoshiko S. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Several features of the putative 5-LO promoter region (such as the lack of TATAA or CCAAT boxes and repeated (G+C)-rich elements) are characteristic for so-called housekeeping genes. Previous data suggest that the transcription factors Egr-1 and/or Sp1 are required for basal 5-LO transcription and that they functionally interact with the 5-LO promoter and activate it via repeated response elements located between positions −212 and −88 bp, relative to the translational start site (10Hoshiko S.

Collins T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, naturally occurring mutations were found in the 5-LO promoter consisting of the deletion of one or two, or the addition of one Sp1 binding site (12In K.H. Asano K. Beier D. Grobholz J.

These mutations only slightly alter 5-LO promoter activity in reporter gene assays but have a significant impact on the response of asthma patients to 5-LO inhibitors (13Drazen J.M. Yandava C.N.

As yet, no data are available on the mechanisms involved in the cell type-specific activation of the 5-LO promoter in response to cell differentiation signals and inflammatory stimuli. Expression of several genes with (G+C)-rich promoters has been shown to be regulated by DNA methylation (14Singal R. Ginder G.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 4059-4070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas promoters of (G+C)-rich housekeeping genes are usually unmethylated, methylation of promoters of tissue-specific genes is usually linked with silencing of the respective genes. Therefore, it was of interest to study the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of 5-lipoxygenase expression. The human myeloid cell lines Mono Mac 6 and HL-60 show prominent 5-LO gene expression and 5-LO activity after differentiation by TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3 (6Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B.

Here we show that the suppression of 5-LO expression in U937 and HL-60TB cells is a result of DNA methylation and that 5-LO promoter activity is regulated by methylation of CpG sites within the (G+C)-rich core promoter region. Molecular biology reagents were from MBI Fermentas, Sigma, Life Technologies, Inc., Promega, or other sources indicated in the text. Insulin was a gift from Hoechst-Marion-Roussel (Frankfurt, Germany). Human TGFβ1 was purified from outdated platelets (according to Ref. 17Werz O. Brungs M. Steinhilber D. Pharmazie. 1996; 51: 893-896PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleospin extract columns for direct purification of pDNA were from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). HPLC solvents were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Vectors pN10 and pN7 were obtained by insertion of 5-LO promoter fragments −843 to −12 (upstream of the 5-LO start codon) and −1547 to −12 into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3Basic (Promega), respectively. Plasmid constructs were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The pSG5VDR and pSG5RXR expression plasmids for the human vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the human retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) were obtained from Dr. Carsten Carlberg (Kuopio, Finland). HL-60 cells were obtained from ATCC; U937 and HL-60TB cells were from the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 6% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). For a cell culture of Mono Mac 6 cells, which were kindly provided by Dr. H. W. L. Ziegler-Heitbrock (Munich), the growth medium was supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), oxalacetate (1 mm), and insulin (10 μg/ml) (18Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L.

HeLa cells were obtained from Dr. Müller (Pharmacological Institute, Frankfurt) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. U937 and HL-60TB cells (0.3 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 100 nm (U937 cells) or 30 nm AdC (HL-60TB cells) for 72 h. The medium containing AdC was replaced every 12 h as described (19Attadia V. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar). After 72 h, the cells were seeded at a density of 0.35 × 106 cells/ml and grown without AdC for 4 days. AdC-treated cells are designated U937 AdC and HL-60TB AdC. Cells (0.3 × 106cells/ml) were differentiated by 1,25(OH)2D3(50 nm) and TGFβ (U937, 10 ng/ml; Mono Mac 6, 2 ng/ml; HL-60, HL-60TB, and HeLa, 1 ng/ml). Differentiated cells were harvested for RNA isolation and determination of 5-LO activity after 2 and 4 days, respectively. 5-LO activity assays with intact cells and cell homogenates were carried out as described, and the formed 5-LO products were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (7Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total RNA was isolated from cells as described (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (8Härle D. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The following PCR primers were used at a concentration of 5 ng/μl: β-actin (24 cycles), 5′-GAGGAGCACCCCGTGCTGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCTGTGGACGATGGAGGGGCC-3′; 5-LO (exon primers for mature mRNA, 30 cycles), 5′-ACCATTGAGCAGATCGTGGACACGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGTCCTGCTCTGTGTAGAATGGG-3′; 5-LO (intron primers for pre-mRNA, 33 cycles), 5′-AGATGAGTCATGCTCACAGAACT-3′ and 5′-AGATCAGCATTAGGAACTAGCTT-3′. Signal intensities of ethidium bromide-stained DNA bands were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000 system) and analyzed with the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad). Results are expressed as relative changes in RNA amounts normalized with β-actin as internal standard. Genomic DNA was isolated by proteinase K digestion and a 2-fold phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction. After precipitation by the addition of 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.5 volumes of ammonium acetate (7.5 m), the DNA was fished, washed twice with ethanol (80%, v/v), and dissolved in water. Plasmid DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli using NucleoBond extraction columns (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genomic DNA (20–30 μg) was cleaved with KpnI (5 units/μg DNA) for 2 h at 37 °C. The DNA was precipitated by ethanol and washed once, and the pellet was dissolved in 23 μl of water at 4 °C overnight. The DNA then was bisulfite-treated as described in (21McDonald L.E. Kay G.F. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The bisulfite incubation was carried out in a thermocycler (Techne Cyclogene) for 6 h with an initial alkaline denaturation step at 95 °C for 7 min followed by shock cooling on ice. The samples were incubated at 50 °C with bisulfite (3m) under mineral oil for 6 h in the dark. The incubation was interrupted by heating to 95 °C for 30 s every 60 min. The bisulfite-modified DNA was purified with NucleoTrap CR (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocols and desulfonated by addition of 0.1 volumes of 3 n NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min. After 2 min on ice, 0.2 volumes of 3 msodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of ethanol were added to precipitate the DNA. The precipitated DNA was washed once with 80% (v/v) ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 20–50 μl of water overnight at 4 °C. The modified DNA was amplified by nested PCR with 35 cycles for each amplification using primers specific for the noncoding strand of the 5-LO gene with the sequences (R = reverse, F = forward primer): 5′-ATTCTCTCATAAATCRCACTTCCTC-3′ (R−552/−528); 5′-CTCTCATAAATCRCTCTTCCTCTACA-3′ (R−549/−525); 5′-TTGTAGAAGGGTTTGTTTAGTAGGT-3′ (F+107/+131); 5′-AATTATTGGTTGTTAGTGGTTAYGGTGAT-3′ (F+14/+44). Annealing temperatures were 62 and 57 °C for the first and second amplification, respectively. The amplified fragments were directly sequenced (377 sequencer, PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). Additional primers used only for sequencing were: 3′-TACCCCAATCCCCTA-5′ (R−306/−290, sequences from 5′ → 3′); 3′-ACAACACTAAATACAAACACC-5′ (R−71/−51, sequences from 3′ → 5′); 3′-TAGCTGCGGCGCATT-5′ (F−215/−200, sequences from 5′ → 3′); 3′-GTATGGTGTGGGTTGTGG-5′ (F−13/+5, sequences from 5′ → 3′). The Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) has been used under the recommended conditions for DNA sequence determination. Plasmid DNA was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with SssI methylase (New England BioLabs) at 1 unit/μg pDNA in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.9) supplemented with 160 μmS-adenosylmethionine. For transfections, methylated pDNAs were purified by Nucleospin extract columns (Macherey-Nagel). Complete methylation at CG sites was confirmed byHpaII digestion of the plasmids. Mono Mac 6 cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were grown for 48 h, harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and washed twice at room temperature with RPMI 1640 without FCS and l-glutamine. The cells were then resuspended at 46 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 without supplements, and 0.3 ml of the cell suspension were placed into a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). 40 micrograms of supercoiled plasmid DNA in 30 μl of water were added to the cell suspension. After 5 min at room temperature, electroporation was performed at 975 μF and 200 V using a Bio-Rad GenePulser. The cuvettes were immediately cooled on ice for 20 min. Then the cells were transferred into 10 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, insulin, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. 1,25(OH)2D3 (50 nm) and TGFβ (1 ng/ml) were added immediately after the cell transfer as indicated. 6 h after transfection cells were harvested for luciferase assay. 24 h prior to transfection, cells were plated into a 24-well tissue culture plate at a density of 6 × 104 cells per well, so that 60–80% of the cells were confluent at the time of transfection. Plasmid DNA (0.4 μg) was diluted into serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and precomplexed with 5 μl of PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Precomplexed plasmid DNA was mixed with 25 μl of 1:50 diluted Lipofectin reagent and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The medium then was replaced by 200 μl of fresh serum-free medium, and the DNA-PLUS-Lipofectin reagent complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 1 ml of medium containing 15% (v/v) FCS was added. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and luciferase activity was determined as described below. After transfection of Mono Mac 6 (6 h) and HeLa (24 h), cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2 and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay constant light signal kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Luciferase activity was determined by monitoring light emission with a Microlumat Plus LB96V EG&G Berthold luminometer. Light emission signal was integrated for 5 s. Transfection efficiency was monitored and normalized by cotransfection with 1 μg (MonoMac6) and 1 μg (HeLa) pCMVSEAP using the Phospha-LightTM kit (Tropix) to determine the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity. Expression vectors pSG5VDR and pSG5RXR were cotransfected in all reporter gene experiments. pCMVluc was used as positive control. As shown previously, undifferentiated HL-60 and Mono Mac 6 cells do not exhibit significant 5-LO activity. However, after differentiation with TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3 there is a strong up-regulation of cellular activity (Ref. 7Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). In contrast, HL-60TB and U937 cells have no significant 5-LO activity after differentiation with TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1). However, pretreatment of U937 and HL-60TB cells with AdC leads to high 5-LO activity after differentiation. Similar effects were observed when 5-LO pre-mRNA and mature mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig.2). In HL-60 cells, TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3 up-regulated 5-LO pre-mRNA expression, but only modest levels of 5-LO pre-mRNA were observed in HL-60TB cells after differentiation with TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3. However, after pretreatment of HL-60TB cells with AdC, similar 5-LO pre-mRNA levels were found as in wild-type HL-60 cells. In U937 cells, AdC enhanced expression of 5-LO pre-mRNA and mature mRNA about 2- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). Stronger effects of AdC were observed in HL-60TB cells. AdC up-regulated 5-LO pre-mRNA and mature mRNA about 6.6- and 23-fold in undifferentiated cells and 4.8 and 8.5-fold in cells differentiated with 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ, respectively. Thus, similar to Mono Mac 6 cells, the changes in 5-LO RNA levels were more pronounced when mature RNA was analyzed compared with pre-mRNA in HL-60 and U937 cells. Furthermore, the data indicate that all three cell lines respond to TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3 and show 5-LO RNA induction, although the achieved mRNA levels were lower in HL-60TB and U937 cells. Interestingly, AdC treatment also enhanced 5-LO RNA expression in undifferentiated cells, which suggests that its effects are at least in part independent of the cellular actions of TGFβ and 1,25(OH)2D3. Activation of gene expression by AdC is assumed to be caused by inhibition of DNA methylation, which subsequently leads to partial demethylation of CpG sites and up-regulation of the activity of methylation-sensitive gene promoters. Because basal 5-LO promoter activity is induced by multiple Sp1/Egr-1 binding sites located in a C+G-rich region with many putative CpG methylation sites, it was of interest to study the methylation pattern of the 5-LO core promoter in HL-60, HL60-TB, and U937 cells and to correlate it with the 5-LO expression data shown above. Genomic DNA isolated from all three cell lines was digested withKpnI and subjected to DNA methylation analysis by genomic bisulfite sequencing as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 3 shows the methylation pattern of the 5-LO core promoter region of the indicated cell lines. In HL-60 cells showing prominent 5-LO expression the 5-LO core promoter was completely unmethylated, whereas it was heavily methylated in HL-60TB and U937 cells that show only low 5-LO expression. In U937 cells all CpG sites of the core promoter required for basal activity were methylated, whereas CpG sites located more upstream were unmethylated. Thus, a good correlation exists between the methylation status of the 5-LO promoter and 5-LO gene expression in HL-60, HL-60TB, and U937 cells (Figs. 2 and 3). Treatment of HL-60TB and U937 cells with AdC led to partial demethylation of the 5-LO promoter, although the demethylating effect of AdC was stronger in HL-60TB than in U937 cells (Fig. 3). To check whether 5-LO promoter activity is regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3/TGFβ and/or DNA methylation, reporter gene assays were performed. The plasmids N10 and N7 and two deletion constructs (pN10ΔGC and pN7ΔGC) lacking the core region containing the five direct and two inverted GGGCGG repeats were used (Fig. 4). HeLa and Mono Mac 6 cells were transiently transfected with these plasmids, and promoter activities were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Deletion of the region −258 to −96 containing the Sp1 and Egr-1 binding sites close to the transcription initiation site (plasmids N10ΔGC and N7ΔGC) significantly reduced 5-LO promoter activity in transfected HeLa cells (Fig.5A) and almost abolished reporter gene expression in the 5-LO-positive monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ did not increase 5-LO promoter activity in reporter gene assays in Mono Mac 6 cells (Fig. 5), although both agents strongly induced 5-LO gene expression in this cell line (7Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and although at least one vitamin D response element was present in the 5-LO promoter (22Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In control experiments, 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ strongly activated (25-fold) a promoter construct containing the 4×-concatemerized DR3-type pig osteopontin vitamin D response element (core sequence ATGGGTCATATGGTTCA) in front of the thymidine kinase promoter. From these results it was concluded that there is no induction of 5-LO promoter activity by 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ, at least under the experimental conditions of transient reporter gene assays. To study the effect of DNA methylation on 5-LO promoter activity and to investigate possible relationships between DNA methylation and 1,25(OH)2D3/TGFβ signaling in the regulation of 5-LO promoter activity, the N10 and the N10ΔGC plasmids were methylated by SssI methylase in vitro. Subsequently, Mono Mac 6 and HeLa cells were transfected with the methylated or unmethylated plasmids, and promoter activity was determined. Methylation completely suppressed 5-LO promoter activity in both cell lines, and transcriptional activities of the methylated N10 and N10ΔGC plasmids were comparable with the negative control (pGL3Basic promoterless plasmid) (Fig.6). Interestingly, 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ could not activate transcription from the methylated constructs in HeLa and Mono Mac 6 cells, indicating that both hormones can not induce demethylation of the 5-LO promoter under these experimental conditions (Fig. 6). The relative changes in the 5-LO promoter activities by DNA methylation are summarized in Table I. Methylation of the 5-LO promoter plasmid pN10 led to a 68- and 655-fold repression of promoter activity in HeLa and Mono Mac 6 cells, respectively, whereas transcriptional repression by DNA methylation was much lower with the cytomegalovirus-driven pCMVluc vector (18- and 7-fold, respectively), which was used as positive control. Similar results were obtained when the 5-LO promoter insert of the pN7 plasmid was selectively methylated. Thus, the 5-LO promoter (−863 to −12) was excised from the pN7 plasmid, in vitro methylated by SssI methylase, reinserted into the plasmid, and transfected into HeLa cells. Under these conditions, methylation led to a 38-fold repression of 5-LO promoter activity.Table IEffects of DNA methylation by SssI methylase on luciferase reporter gene activityCellsPlasmidEffects of DNA methylation (-fold repression ± S.E., n = 3)− TGFβ/1,25(OH)2D3+ TGFβ/1,25(OH)2D3Mono Mac 6 cellspN10655 ± 120631 ± 161pCMVluc7 ± 19 ± 1HeLa cellspN1068 ± 895 ± 5pCMVluc18 ± 419 ± 2 Open table in a new tab The 5-LO gene is expressed in a tissue- and cell differentiation-specific manner (3Steinhilber D. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 69-83Google Scholar). In view of this, the features of the 5-LO promoter (such as the (G+C)-rich region, multiple GC-boxes, and lack of TATA or CCAAT sequences) were rather surprising, because the 5-LO promoter resembles promoters for so-called housekeeping genes that are ubiquitously expressed (23Funk C.D. Hoshiko S. Matsumoto T. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Previous reports demonstrated that the promoter region −212 to −88 containing multiple Sp1 and Egr-1 binding sites is important for basal transcriptional activity (10Hoshiko S. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11De Silverman E.S. Du J. Sanctis G.T. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Drazen J.M. Collins T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This promoter region has been found to be transcriptionally active in cells lines (e.g. HeLa cels) that do not show endogenous 5-LO expression (10Hoshiko S. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9073-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations were found in the 5-LO promoter that obviously only slightly alter 5-LO promoter activity in reporter gene assays but have a significant impact on the response of asthma patients to 5-LO inhibitors (13Drazen J.M. Yandava C.N. Dubé L. Szczerback N. Hippensteel R. Pillari A. Israel E. Schork N. Silverman E.S. Katz D.A. Drajesk J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Beside binding sites for Egr and Sp transcription factors, consensus sequences for other transcription factors like NF-κB, GATA, myb, and AP family members are present in the promoter region (24Silverman E.S. Drazen J.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S77-S80Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, to date the mechanisms involved in the cell-specific and/or stimulus-dependent regulation of the 5-LO promoter are unknown. When we studied 5-LO expression in a variety of cell lines and sublines, two myeloid cell lines (U937 and HL-60TB cells) that lack 5-LO expression in response to well known differentiation agents were identified. We found that the DNA demethylating agent AdC activates 5-LO expression in these cell lines. When methylation of CpG sites in the 5-LO promoter was analyzed, we found that the 5-LO promoter was heavily methylated in U937 and HL-60TB cells, whereas it was completely unmethylated in the 5-LO-positive cell line HL-60. Furthermore, reporter gene assays revealed that methylation of the 5-LO core promoter by SssI methylase leads to an almost complete loss of transcriptional activity. Thus, taken together, our data clearly suggest that 5-LO promoter activity is regulated by DNA methylation and that suppression of 5-LO expression in the respective cell lines is obviously caused by DNA methylation. In vertebrates, the genomes of somatic cells are globally methylated (with the exception of CpG-rich regions (CpG islands). CpG methylation correlates with alterations in chromatin structure and gene silencing (25Antequera F. Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 62: 503-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Aberrant methylation of promoter regions has been shown to be involved in cancer development via the suppression of tumor suppressor genes. Approximately half of all genes in mouse and humans contain CpG islands. These are mainly housekeeping genes that have a broad expression pattern, but 40% of the genes with a tissue- or cell type-specific expression pattern are also represented. Usually DNA demethylation is linked to activation of gene transcription. Several enzymes with DNA methylase activity were identified and functionally characterized (for review see Ref. 26Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), but less is known about enzymes and signaling pathways involved in demethylation of CpG islands. At present, the mechanisms that lead to cell type-specific and cell differentiation-related methylation and demethylation of CpG islands are unknown. Thus, 5-LO might represent an interesting candidate to elucidate such mechanisms. Much more knowledge has been gained about the connection between the methylation status of gene promoters and transcriptional activity of the respective genes. Methylated CpG sites are recognized by a variety of methyl-CpG-binding proteins (e.g. MBDs1–3, MeCP2), which are associated either directly or indirectly with histone deacetylases (27Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus, chromatin condensation mediated by recruitment of histone deacetylases seems to be one mechanism of gene silencing by CpG methylation. Concerning 5-LO, inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A (at 330 nm) did not lead to activation of 5-LO gene expression in U937 and HL-60TB cells, although general cellular histone acetylation by trichostatin A was detectable by AUT-gel electrophoresis (data not shown), suggesting that repression of 5-LO gene expression by DNA methylation does not depend primarily on recruitment of trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylases but seems to be mediated by other mechanisms. For 15-lipoxygenase, it has been shown that trichostatin A leads to the up-regulation of 15-LO mRNA expression (28Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas AdC has no effect (data not shown). Another gene of the leukotriene pathway that is regulated by DNA methylation is the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1. It has been shown with reporter gene assays that methylation of the BLT1 promoter reduces its activity to about 15% of the control (29Kato K. Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that up-regulation of 5-LO mRNA expression in Mono Mac 6 cells by 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ is in part due to the induction of transcript elongation and mRNA maturation (8Härle D. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Härle D. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 105-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas no significant effects of both agents were found on 5-LO promoter activity in Mono Mac 6 cells with reporter gene assays (this study) and nuclear run-on assays (9Härle D. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 469: 105-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have shown with reporter gene assays that in contrast to 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ, DNA methylation regulates 5-LO promoter activity. First, there was a strong inhibition of 5-LO promoter activity by DNA methylation. Second, AdC treatment of U937 and HL-60TB cells induced 5-LO expression and led to 5-LO promoter demethylation. AdC-induced 5-LO promoter demethylation was much stronger in HL-60TB cells than in U937 cells, which correlated with a stronger induction of 5-LO pre-mRNA (1.8- versus6.6-fold) and mature mRNA (3.9- versus 23-fold), respectively. It has to be considered that modest changes in the methylation status of CpG-sites (e.g. from 90 to 70%) that could already affect 5-LO promoter activity are hardly detectable by the methylation-specific DNA sequencing method. Taken together, our experiments suggest that demethylation of the 5-LO promoter is required for high 5-LO gene transcription. Both AdC treatment and 1,25(OH)2D3/TGFβ stimulated 5-LO mRNA expression and the combination of both treatments had additive affects. In contrast to DNA methylation, 1,25(OH)2D3/TGFβ did not affect 5-LO promoter activity under our experimental conditions but rather seemed to be related to post-transcriptional effects such as transcript elongation and maturation. Furthermore, in reporter gene assays we found no evidence that 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ can induce promoter activity when 5-LO promoter constructs are methylated, suggesting that both effects are independent from each other. Our data obtained with HL-60TB and U937 cells demonstrate that 5-LO promoter demethylation is required for the high level induction of 5-LO gene expression by inducers such as 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGFβ.

To understand the mechanisms by which the C2 domain mediates the membrane targeting of PLC-δ isoforms, we measured the in vitro membrane binding of the C2 domains of PLC-δ1, -δ3, and -δ4 by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer techniques and their subcellular localization by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The membrane binding of the PLC-δ1-C2 is driven by nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the Ca2+-induced cationic surface of protein and the anionic membrane and specific interactions involving Ca2+, Asn647, and phosphatidylserine (PS). The PS selectivity of PLC-δ1-C2 governs its specific Ca2+-dependent subcellular targeting to the plasma membrane. The membrane binding of the PLC-δ3-C2 also involves Ca2+-induced nonspecific electrostatic interactions and PS coordination, and the latter leads to specific subcellular targeting to the plasma membrane. In contrast to PLC-δ1-C2 and PLC-δ3-C2, PLC-δ4-C2 has significant Ca2+-independent membrane affinity and no PS selectivity due to the presence of cationic residues in the Ca2+-binding loops and the substitution of Ser for the Ca2+-coordinating Asp in position 717. Consequently, PLC-δ4-C2 exhibits unique pre-localization to the plasma membrane prior to Ca2+ import and non-selective Ca2+-mediated targeting to various cellular membranes, suggesting that PLC-δ4 might have a novel regulatory mechanism.

The PLC family comprises eleven isoforms that can be subdivided into four types (β, γ, δ, and ε) based on their structural differences. All PLC isoforms except newly discovered PLC-ε possess three regulatory domains: PH, EF-hand, and C2 (2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Among PLC isoforms, Ca2+-sensitive PLC-δ1 has been the subject of extensive structure-function studies due to the availability of tertiary structural information. Crystallographic structures of PLC-δ1 lacking the amino-terminal PH domain (3Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and of its isolated PH domain (4Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) revealed a four-module organization of the enzyme comprising the amino-terminal PH domain, the EF-hand domain, catalytic domain, and the carboxyl-terminal C2 domain. Based on these structures, it was proposed that PH and C2 domains, both of which are well-characterized membrane-targeting domains, are involved in the membrane targeting of PLC-δ1 (3Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The PH domain is a β-barrel-like structure that is present in many membrane-binding proteins (5Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J.

Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The essential role of the PH domain in the membrane targeting of PLC-δ1 has been experimentally demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo (8Yagisawa H. Sakuma K. Paterson H.F. Cheung R. Allen V. Hirata H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The PH domain of PLC-δ1 is capable of anchoring the protein to the membrane by specifically binding to Ins(4,5)P2 in the membrane, and the competitive binding of the PH domain to soluble IP3 can induce the membrane dissociation of PLC-δ1. However, the role of the C2 domain in PLC-δ1 catalysis remains unclear. The C2 domain has been identified in many cellular proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking (9Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Many C2 domains bind Ca2+ and mediate Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of proteins. Structural analyses of multiple Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding C2 domains have shown that they share a common fold consisting of an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich connected by variable loops, which form the binding sites for multiple Ca2+ ions at one end of the domain (3Essen L.O.

Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which led to the proposal that the C2 domain is involved in the Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of the protein. However, a mutant of PLC-δ1 lacking the C2 domain Ca2+ binding sites showed the same activity toward Ins(4,5)P2 in phosphatidylcholine (PC)-containing vesicles and micelles as the wild type, suggesting the Ca2+ requirement of PLC-δ1 largely reflects the binding of Ca2+ to the active site (20Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5020-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that, in the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the assay mixture, the C2 domain plays a key role in the activation of PLC-δ1 through the formation of a C2·Ca2+·PS ternary complex (21Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Roffler S.R. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21995-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of the C2 domain in the membrane targeting and activation of PLC-δ1 and other isoforms, we measured the binding of the C2 domains of PLC-δ1, -δ3, -δ4, and their mutants to model membranes, and analyzed the binding in terms of the electrostatic properties of the domains. We also measured the spatiotemporal dynamics of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged C2 domains and mutants in living cells. Results described herein establish the C2 domains of PLC-δ isoforms as Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting domains that have distinct membrane binding properties, which in turn control their subcellular localization behaviors. Together, these studies shed new light on the roles of the C2 domains in the membrane targeting and activation of PLC-δ isoforms. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Ins(4,5)P2 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Tritiated Ins(4,5)P2([3H]Ins(4,5)P2) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (22Kates M. Techniques of Lipidology.2nd Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 114-115Google Scholar). The Liposofast microextruder and 100-nm polycarbonate filters were from Avestin (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Bayer Inc. (Kankakee, IL).

Zeocin and ponasterone A were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). To subclone the cDNA of PLC-δ1 into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) that contains the amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) sequence, the start codon was removed and new restriction sites (SmaI andXhoI) were constructed in the gene by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Using NdeI and HindIII sites, the cDNAs of PLC-δ3 and PLC-δ4 were subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) that encodes the amino-terminal His6 tag and thrombin cleavage site (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH). The isolated C2 domains of all three isoforms were subcloned similarly into the pET28a vector. Mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (for pGEX-4T-1 vector) and BL21(DE3) (for pET28a vector) were used as hosts for protein expression. One liter of Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for PLC-δ1 and 50 μg/ml kanamycin for PLC-δ3 and PLC-δ4 was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture grown at 37 °C. Cells were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.6, then the protein expression was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Research Products, Mount Prospect, IL). After overnight incubation at room temperature, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. His-tagged proteins (PLC-δ3 and PLC-δ4) were purified using a Ni-NTA-agarose column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion protein (PLC-δ1) was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose affinity system as follows. The cell lysate was incubated with GST beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The unbound protein impurities were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. The GST-fused protein still bound to the beads was incubated with thrombin for 6 h at 25 °C. Then, the cleaved protein was eluted with the same buffer. Isolated C2 domains were prepared as follows. One liter of Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture. Cells were grown until absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.6, then the protein expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. After the suspension was sonicated, the inclusion body pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and re-centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 m urea. The pellet was stirred for 20 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The washed inclusion body was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 8 m guanidinium chloride. Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (2.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 m urea and 5 mm EDTA. The first major peak was collected (35 ml) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 m urea and then against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The refolded C2 domain was purified using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity of all protein samples was higher than 90% electrophoretically. Aliquots of purified protein were stored at −20 °C. Activity of PLC was assayed by measuring the initial rate of Ins(4,5)P2 hydrolysis as described by Cifuentes et al. (23Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Small unilamellar vesicles (500 μm) containing 1% Ins(4,5)P2, a trace of [3H]Ins(4,5)P2 (2 × 104dpm) and bulk phospholipids (POPC, POPG, or POPS; each 495 μm) were prepared in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m KCl, 500 μg/ml BSA, and 0.5 mm Ca2+. Free calcium concentration was adjusted using a mixture of EGTA and CaCl2 according to the method of Bers (24Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding the indicated amount of enzyme, continued for 5 min, and quenched by adding 0.25 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 25 μl of 20% Trition X-100. Samples were kept on ice for 15 min, and the precipitate containing [3H]Ins(4,5)P2 was separated from the supernatant containing [3H]IP3 by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, 0.5 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1), was added and the aqueous phase containing [3H]IP3 was extracted. Radioactivity of the hydrolyzed product was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Surface pressure (π) of solution in a circular Teflon trough was measured using a Wilhelmy plate attached to a computer-controlled tensiometer (25Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The trough (4 cm diameter × 1 cm depth) has a 0.5-cm deep well for a magnetic stir bar and a small hole drilled at an angle through the wall to allow an addition of protein solution. Five to ten milliliters of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) was spread onto 10 ml of subphase (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m KCl and 0.5 mm free Ca2+) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (πo). The subphase was continuously stirred at 60 rpm with a magnetic stir bar. Once the surface pressure had been stabilized (after about 5 min), the protein solution (typically 50 μl) was injected into the subphase through the hole, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. The maximal Δπ depended on the protein concentration at the low concentration range and reached saturation when the protein concentration was higher than 3 μg/ml. Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The preparation of vesicle-coated Pioneer L1 sensor chip (BIAcore) was described in detail elsewhere (26Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The sensor surface was coated with POPC/POPS (7:3) or POPC/POPG (7:3) vesicles. In control experiments, the fluorescence intensity of the flow buffer after rinsing the sensor chip coated with vesicles incorporating 10 mm 5-carboxyfluorescien (Molecular Probes) was monitored to confirm that the vesicles remained intact on the chip. All experiments were performed with a control cell in which a second sensor surface was coated with POPC, because all C2 domains of PLC-δ isoforms showed negligible binding to POPC-coated chip. The drift in signal for both sample and control flow cells was allowed to stabilize below 0.3 resonance unit/min before any kinetic experiments were performed. All kinetic experiments were performed at 24 °C, and a flow rate of 60 μl/min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and varying concentration of Ca2+. A high flow rate was used to circumvent mass transport effects. The association was monitored for 90 s and dissociation for 4 min. The immobilized vesicle surface was then regenerated for subsequent measurements using 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH. The regeneration solution was passed over the immobilized vesicle surface until the SPR signal reached the initial background value before protein injection. For data acquisition, five or more different concentrations (typically within a 10-fold range above or below the Kd) of each protein were used. After each set of measurements, the entire immobilized vesicles were removed by injection of 25 μl of 40 mm CHAPS, followed by 25 μl of octyl glucoside at 5 μl/min, and the sensor chip was re-coated with a fresh vesicle solution for the next set of measurements. All data were evaluated using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore). For each trial, the signal was corrected against the control surface response to eliminate any refractive index changes due to buffer change. Furthermore, the derivative plot was used to monitor potential mass transport effects. Once these factors were checked for each set of data, the association and dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: [protein × vesicle] ↔ protein + vesicle. The association phase was analyzed using an equation,R=[kaC/(kaC+kd)]Rmax(1−e−(kaC+kd)(t−t0))+RIwhere RI = refractive index change,Rmax is the theoretical binding capacity,C is analyte concentration, ka is the association rate constant, and t0 is the time at start of fit data. The dissociation phase was analyzed using an equation, R=R0e−kd(t−t0) wherekd is the dissociation rate constant andR0 is the response at the start of fit data. The curve fitting efficiency was checked by residual plots and χ2. The dissociation constant (Kd) was then calculated from the equation, Kd =kd/ka. All constructs were ligated into the modified pIND vector (Invitrogen). An amino-terminal EGFP fusion was found to yield higher gene expression than the carboxyl-terminal counterpart. The spacer sequence between EGFP and the gene was AAA. A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments. Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Cells were passaged into eight wells of a Lab-Tech-chambered coverglass for later transfection and visualization. Only cells between the 5th and 20th passages were used. 80–90% confluent cells in Lab-Tech-chambered cover glass wells were exposed to 150 μl of unsupplemented DMEM containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) for 7–8 h at 37 °C. After exposure, the transfection medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with FBS-supplemented DMEM, and overlaid with FBS-supplemented DMEM containing Zeocin and 140 μg/ml ponasterone A to induce protein production. Images were obtained using a four-channel Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser. All experiments were carried out at the same laser power, which was found to induce minimal photobleaching over 30 scans, and at the same gain and offset settings on the photomultiplier tube. An LP 505 filter was used on channel 1 for all experiments. A ×63 magnification, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective was used for all experiments. Cells for imaging were selected based on their initial intensity, which needed to fall in the upper third of the photomultiplier tube's range. The 510 imaging software provides an option for time series imaging and was used to control the time intervals for imaging. Ca2+-dependent translocation of C2 domains was monitored as follows: Thirty minutes before imaging, the cells were treated with 2 μl of Fura Red AM (Molecular Probes). Immediately before imaging, induction media were removed and the cells were washed with 150 μl of 2 mmEGTA and then overlaid with 150 μl of HEK buffer (1 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm KCl, 0.67 mm d-glucose, and 6.4 mm sucrose). After initially imaging a cell, 150 μl of HEK buffer containing ionomycin and various concentrations of Ca2+ was added to PLC-δ-C2-transfected cells. Control experiments were done with dimethyl sulfoxide in place of ionomycin. The electrostatic properties of the structure of PLC-δ1-C2 and homology models for PLC-δ3-C2 and PLC-δ4-C2 and mutants were calculated and visualized in the program GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar). In each panel of the figure, the red and blue meshes represent, respectively, the −25 and +25 mV electrostatic equipotential contours in 0.1 m KCl. All homology models were built based on the alignment of the sequence being modeled to the PLC-δ1-C2 sequence and using the structure of PLC-δ1-C2 as a template. Previous studies have suggested that PLC-δ1-C2 binds three Ca2+ ions (18Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the modeling studies, we used the structure of the PLC-δ1-C2 complexed with three lanthanum ions (1djg, residues 626–756) (18Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which we replaced with Ca2+ ions. Indistinguishable results were obtained with the structure of the C2 domain complexed with two calcium ions (1dji, residues 626–756) into which we modeled a third Ca2+ ion based on the structural alignment with the lanthanum-bound structure. Homology models were built for PLC-δ3-C2 and PLC-δ4-C2 as well as the S717D and K717E/R718E mutants of PLC-δ4-C2 with the program PRISM (28Yang A.S. Honig B. Proteins. 1999; 37: 66-72Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were added to the heavy atoms of the structure and homology models with the program CHARMM (29Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13874) Google Scholar). The structures with hydrogens were subjected to conjugate gradient minimization with a harmonic restraint force of 50 kcal/mole/Å2 applied to the heavy atoms located at the original crystallographic coordinates to minimize atomic clashes. Each model was evaluated using the program Verify 3D (30Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2539) Google Scholar), which scores structures according to how well each residue fits into its structural environment based on criteria derived from statistical analyses of the Protein Data Bank; all models scored well relative to the PLC-δ1-C2 domain structure. Rather than build separate models for both the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms of PLC-δ3-C2 and PLC-δ4-C2 and to facilitate comparison of their electrostatic properties, we assumed that the structures in the absence of Ca2+ are similar to those in its presence, and the calcium-free forms of the C2 domains were derived from the Ca2+-bound models by deleting the Ca2+ ions from the models' coordinate files. This assumption is consistent with the studies of PLC-δ1-C2 (18Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Confirming this, our results for Ca2+-free PLCδ1-C2 are insensitive to whether we used the Ca2+-free structure (1isd) or deleted the Ca2+ ions from the Ca2+-bound form. Four distinct PLC-δ isoforms have been identified so far (2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Although all four isoforms are homologous in general, some sequence variations are noticed in the calcium-binding loops in the C2 domains (see Fig.1). For instance, PLC-δ4-C2 has Ser in place of a calcium-ligating Asp residue (i.e.Asp708 for PLC-δ1). To determine how these variations affect the membrane binding properties of the C2 domains, we measured the membrane binding of the C2 domains of PLC-δ1, -3, and -4 isoforms by SPR analysis. We have shown that the SPR analysis allows direct determination of membrane association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants for peripheral proteins (25Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We first measured the binding of PLC-δ1-C2 to immobilized POPC/POPS (7:3) vesicles as a function of Ca2+concentration (see Table I). In the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. 0.1 mm EGTA), no appreciable binding was detected with protein concentration up to 1 μm, indicating that PLC-δ1-C2 has >μmaffinity for POPC/POPS (7:3) under this condition. As illustrated in Fig. 2, an increase in Ca2+ from 0.5 μm to 0.5 mmresulted in a 50-fold increase in the affinity (Kd) of PLC-δ1-C2 for POPC/POPS (7:3), demonstrating that it is a Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting domain. Interestingly, Ca2+ affected both ka(∼6-fold) and kd (∼9-fold) to a comparable degree. Our previous study indicated that nonspecific electrostatic interactions primarily accelerate the association of protein to anionic membrane surfaces, whereas hydrophobic interactions and specific interactions, whether electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding, mainly slow the membrane dissociation (26Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Ca2+ ions are involved in both nonspecific electrostatic interactions and specific and/or hydrophobic interactions. As was the case with PLC-δ1-C2, PLC-δ3-C2 (up to 1 μm) showed no detectable affinity for immobilized POPC/POPS (7:3) vesicles in the absence of Ca2+. Again, the membrane affinity of PLC-δ3-C2 increased as a function of Ca2+. For this C2 domain, increasing the Ca2+ concentration from 0.5 μm to 0.5 mm led to a more pronounced"
https://openalex.org/W1964803671,"Immucillins are logically designed transition-state analogue inhibitors of mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) that induce purine-less death of Plasmodium falciparum in cultured erythrocytes (Kicska, G. A., Tyler, P. C., Evans, G. B., Furneaux, R. H., Schramm, V. L., and Kim, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 3226–3231). PNP is present at high levels in human erythrocytes and in P. falciparum, but the Plasmodium enzyme has not been characterized. A search of the P. falciparumgenome data base yielded an open reading frame similar to the PNP fromEscherichia coli. PNP from P. falciparum(P. falciparum PNP) was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized. The primary amino acid sequence has 26% identity with E. coli PNP, has 20% identity with human PNP, and is phylogenetically unique among known PNPs with equal genetic distance between PNPs and uridine phosphorylases. Recombinant P. falciparum PNP is catalytically active for inosine and guanosine but is less active for uridine. The immucillins are powerful inhibitors of P. falciparum PNP. Immucillin-H is a slow onset tight binding inhibitor with a Ki* value of 0.6 nm. Eight related immucillins are also powerful inhibitors with dissociation constants from 0.9 to 20 nm. TheKm/Ki* value for immucillin-H is 9000, making this inhibitor the most powerful yet reported forP. falciparum PNP. The PNP from P. falciparumdiffers from the human enzyme by a lower Km for inosine, decreased preference for deoxyguanosine, and reduced affinity for the immucillins, with the exception of 5′-deoxy-immucillin-H. These properties of P. falciparumPNP are consistent with a metabolic role in purine salvage and provide an explanation for the antibiotic effect of the immucillins on P. falciparum cultured in human erythrocytes. Immucillins are logically designed transition-state analogue inhibitors of mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) that induce purine-less death of Plasmodium falciparum in cultured erythrocytes (Kicska, G.

Craig M. Dieichmann U. Marsh K. Bull. W. H. O. 1999; 77: 624-640PubMed Google Scholar). An essential step in the life cycle of the parasites is cellular replication of the trophozoite in the human erythrocyte. RNA and DNA synthesis creates a need for large quantities of purines, which must be salvaged from the mammalian host, becauseP. falciparum is a purine auxotroph (2Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W. Blood Cells. 1990; 16 (discussion 485–498): 467-484PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sherman I.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 453-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Walsh C.J. Sherman I.W. J.

This purine demand makes growth of Plasmodium sensitive to disruption of pathways for purine salvage (6Wiesmann W.P. Webster H.K. Lambros C. Kelley W.N. Daddona P.E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1984; 165: 325-342PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxanthine has been reported to be the major purine precursor for purine salvage, and P. falciparum growth is reduced by culturing in the presence of xanthine oxidase, which depletes both the medium and erythrocyte of hypoxanthine (7Berman P.A. Human L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 309A: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Berman P.A. Human L. Freese J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1848-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The sole pathway of hypoxanthine production inP. falciparum and in human erythrocytes is through the phosphorolysis of inosine to hypoxanthine, a reaction catalyzed by PNP1 (3Sherman I.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 453-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These features of purine metabolism in humans and P. falciparum make the PNPs from both organisms of interest as potential targets for antimalarials. Purine nucleoside phosphorylases from bacterial and mammalian sources belong to distinct families. Family 1 contains most bacterial PNPs, uridine phosphorylases from both bacteria and mammals and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase from Sulfolobus solfataricus. Proteins in this family invariably contain the signature consensus sequence (G/S/T)XG(L/I/V/M)GX(P/A)SX(P/A)SX(G/S/T/A)IX3EL. Bacterial PNPs in this family are hexamers and are termed “high molecular mass” PNPs because the average aggregate mass of the hexamer is near 150 kDa (9Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Bzowska A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Tebbe J. Schroder W. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Koellner G. Bzowska A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 431: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The bacterial PNPs accept 6-aminopurines (e.g. adenosine) and accept 6-oxopurines (e.g. inosine) as substrates when a single PNP is expressed in the organism. Family 2 includes all mammalian PNPs, some of the bacterial PNPs (Bacillus subtilis (11Jensen K.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (12Hamamoto T. Okuyama K. Noguchi T. Midorikawa Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), methylthioadenosine phosphorylases from eukaryotes and xanthosine phosphorylase from Escherichia coli (13Seeger C. Poulsen C. Dandanell G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5506-5516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in this family invariably contain the consensus sequence (L/I/V)X3GX2HX(L/I/V/M/F/Y)X4(L/I/V/M/F)X3(A/T/V)X1–2(L/I/V/M)X(A/T/V)X4(G/N)X3–4(L/I/V/F/M)2X2(S/T/N)(S/A)XG(G/S)(L/I/V/M). The PNPs in Family 2 are homotrimers and are termed “low molecular mass” PNPs with a mean aggregate weight of 90 kDa. Family 2 PNPs accept inosine, guanosine, and 2′-deoxyguanosine as substrates but not adenosine. A third group of PNPs do not fit into either family (e.g. Cellulomonas sp. (14Tebbe J. Bzowska A. Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Schroder W. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Saenger W. Koellner G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). An early characterization of the catalytic properties of P. falciparum PNP was accomplished in extracts of parasites cultured in erythrocytes from children with a genetic deficiency in PNP (15Daddona P.E. Wiesmann W.P. Milhouse W. Chern J.W. Townsend L.B. Hershfield M.S. Webster H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11667-11673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach was used to distinguished the large excess of human erythrocyte PNP from the P. falciparum PNP activity and established the presence of PNP catalytic activity in P. falciparum. The present work provides a genetic approach to pure preparations of large quantities of P. falciparum PNP. These preparations have been used to define substrate specificity and transition state inhibitors. We report the molecular cloning, expression, and isolation of P. falciparum PNP as well as the identification of powerful transition state inhibitors. The primary sequence is related to theE. coli PNP (Family 1 PNP), and sequence alignment shows conservation of most active site residues, even though the consensus pattern is not strictly observed. The availability of P. falciparum PNP permits the exploration of the recently discovered purine-less death of P. falciparum caused by immucillins. Immucillins are picomolar inhibitors of mammalian PNP that inhibit P. falciparumgrowth in cultured human erythrocytes (16Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3226-3231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that inhibition of P. falciparum growth requires inhibition of both human and P. falciparum PNPs, because both host and parasite contain high PNP activities (17Sherman I.W. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1998: 177-184Google Scholar, 18Reyes P. Rathod P.K. Sanchez D.J. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 5: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Immucillins inhibitP. falciparum PNP with equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki*) as low as 0.6 nm, and represent the tightest binding inhibitors yet reported for this enzyme. The substrate specificity of P. falciparum PNP is consistent with the role of purine salvage, and the inhibition of P. falciparum PNP by immucillins is appropriate to target this pathway for novel antibiotic action against malaria. Imm-H ((1S)-1-(9-deazahypoxanthin-9-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-ribitol) and other immucillins were synthesized fromd-gulonolactone and chemically protected 9-deazahypoxanthine (33Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Gainsford G.J. Schramm V.L. Tyler P.C. Tetrahedron. 2000; 563053Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purity and structure were established by NMR and purity confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nucleosides and deoxynucleosides were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). 6-Methylpurine deoxyriboside was purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Human erythrocyte purine nucleoside phosphorylase and xanthine oxidase from bovine buttermilk were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Sequence data for P. falciparum was obtained from The Sanger Center website (available at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_falciparum). Protein sequences for mammalian and bacterial PNPs were used to search the complete sequence data base from the P. falciparum 3D7 Genome Sequencing Centers (Sanger Center, Stanford, and The Institute for Genomic Research or the Gene Sequencing Tag Project at the University of Florida) (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Preliminary sequence data for P. falciparum chromosomes 2, 10, 11, and 14 were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website (www.tigr.org). Sequencing of chromosomes 2, 10, 11, and 14 was part of the International Malaria Genome Sequencing Project and was supported by awards from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the U.S. Department of Defense. The algorithm, TBLASTN, was used to find candidate genes with primary sequence homology to human, bovine, mouse, yeast, E. coli,Baccillus subtilis I, B. subtilis II, B. streptococcus, or Treponema pallidum PNPs. A candidate sequence that was embedded in an open reading frame of appropriate length was targeted for molecular cloning. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the coding region from genomic DNA isolated from FCB strain of P. falciparum (provided by Dr. Tom McDonald, Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Primers were designed to flank the ends of the open reading frame, creating a PCR product for blunt-end insertion into an expression vector. The sense primer was 5′-GATAATCTTTTACGCCATTTAAAAATAAG-3′. The antisense primer contained 5′-TCAGGCATATTTGGTAGCTAATTTTG-3′ complementary to the intended sequence, except that a mutation was included to avoid primer-dimer formation. The primer altered the N-terminal sequence from MDNL∼ to MALDNL∼. The PCR cycling parameters included denaturation at 95 °C (1 min), annealing at 45 °C (1 min), and extension at 72 °C (1 min). After 35 cycles, a single band of the appropriate size was visualized by agarose gel analysis. The PCR product was ligated into the protein expression vector pTrcHis2 TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). The antisense primer contained a stop codon to prevent the expression of the His tag located on the vector. A clone with a correctly oriented insert was identified by restriction analysis with NcoI,PvuI, and EcoRI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Petersburg, VA) and confirmed with automated DNA sequencing (Albert Einstein College of Medicine DNA Sequencing Facility). E. colistrain BL21(DE3) was freshly transformed and the culture grown at 37 °C in LB media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to anA600 of 0.25. After 500-fold dilution in fresh medium, cultures were grown to A600 = 0.85 and induced with 0.6 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells were pelleted and frozen at −70 °C for subsequent purification. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme in 5 ml of buffer/g of cells. Protein was extracted from cells with mechanical disruption using a French press with 16,000 p.s.i. pressure. The extract was centrifuged at 50,000 × g, 60 min 4 °C. The ammonium sulfate fraction precipitating between 35 and 70% saturation was resuspended and dialyzed into 50 mmimidazole, 5 mm KPO4, pH 6.5. The dialysate was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 1 mNaCl in the imidazole phosphate buffer (5 column volumes). The PNP activity and a 27-kDa band on SDS-PAGE eluted between 450 to 750 mm NaCl. Protein fractions were concentrated to 2.5 ml then separated by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein fractions containing PNP activity were concentrated to 25 mg/ml using an Ultrafree-15 Centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, from 20 to 26% saturation, where the P. falciparum PNP precipitated. Purity was estimated to be greater than 95% based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme concentration was determined by absorption in the far-UV near the peptide band at 205 nm ( E 205nm1mg/ml = 37.0 + 120 ×A280/A205) (20Wetlaufer D.R. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 21Goldfarb A.R. Saidel L.J. Misovich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 397-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was also estimated by the assay of Bradford. Protein was stored at 10 mg/ml at 4 °C in 50 mmimidazole, 10 mm KPO4, pH 7.0. No significant activity loss was noted after 12 weeks (<10%), and kinetic and inhibition assays were generally performed within 30 days of enzyme purification. The protein sequence data bases from other organisms identified sequences similar to P. falciparum PNP. All non-redundant protein directories were searched using two iterations of position-specific iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) (BLOSUM62, inclusion threshold = 0.002) (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). This method generates a position-specific scoring matrix from an initial round of Gapped BLAST searching using conventional substitution scores (23Gribskov M. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4355-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The position-specific scoring matrix was used for subsequent rounds of BLAST searching. High similarity hits were used for multiple sequence alignment with ClustalX (24Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) using default parameters and the BLOSUM series of tables (25Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). This alignment was used to calculate the similarity between sequences, using the formula [no. of identical residues/(alignment length − no. of gap residues)]. Identity between sequences was determined by pairwise alignment using the Lipman-Pearson method with a gap penalty = 4 and gap penalty length = 12. Phylogenetic trees were generated with ClustalX using the Neighbor-Joining method and excluding gaps (26Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and displayed with NJPLOT. Reliability of phylogenetic structure was determined using bootstrapping analysis with 1000 replications (27Felsenstein J. J. Mol. Evol. 1981; 17: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (11195) Google Scholar). Values above 950 were considered to give high support to phylogenetic tree structure and above 800 are considered significant. Orthologues toP. falciparum PNP in other Plasmodium species were identified by using the P. falciparum PNP sequence to search multiple data bases using the BLAST algorithm (P. berghei, P. vivax, P. chabaudi, and P. yoelii) as described above. Partially purified P. falciparum PNP was used for kinetic and inhibition studies (60–70% as determined by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), some of which were repeated with highly purified enzyme. The results with both preparations were the same. Catalytic activity was determined in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4 with variable inosine concentration (40 μm to 1 mm). Hypoxanthine was converted to uric acid in a coupled assay containing 160 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase. The reaction was followed by measuring the formation of uric acid with E293 = 12.9 mm−1 cm−1 (28Kim B.K. Cha S. Parks Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1771-1776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uridine phosphorylase activity was measured in 50 mmKPO4, pH 7.5. Product formation was determined by direct UV monitoring of the conversion of uridine to uracil atA272 (E260 = −2.9 mm−1 cm−1). Adenosine phosphorylase and 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase activities were determined using continuous assays. In a coupled assay containing alkaline phosphatase, the reaction was followed by measuring formation of adenine from adenosine or 5′-methylthioadenosine (E256 = 1.9 mm−1cm−1). Guanosine and deoxyguanosine phosphorylase activity were also determined using a continuous assay. In a coupled assay containing alkaline phosphatase, the reaction was followed by monitoring the formation of guanine from guanosine or deoxyguanosine (E258 = 5.2 mm−1cm−1 (29Stoeckler J.D. Cambor C. Parks Jr., R.E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). Using similar methods, phosphorolysis of 6-methyl-purine deoxyriboside was monitored at 260 nm. In substrate specificity assays, sufficient P. falciparum PNP was added to reliably detect catalytic activity at 0.2% of the activity with inosine. Inhibition of P. falciparumPNP was measured by addition of enzyme to the complete assay mixture containing inhibitor. Assays used conditions of excess substrate, so that inhibitor concentration exceeded enzyme concentration by at least 10-fold (30Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition constant for the initial rate period was determined from fits of the initial data to the equation:v = (kcat ×A)/(Km (1 +I/Ki)), where v = the initial reaction rate, kcat = the maximal catalytic rate, A = substrate concentration,Km = Michaelis constant, I = inhibition concentration and Ki = dissociation constant for the E·I complex. Reaction rates were monitored continuously to establish both the initial reaction rate (v) and to determine if a second steady-state rate (vs) occurred following a slow-onset inhibition phase. This approach permitted the determination ofKi* from the data set, where the valueKi* is for competitive inhibition following the completion of slow onset inhibition; vs = (kcat × A)/(Km (1 + I/Ki*) + A), whereA is substrate concentration, Km is the Michaels constant, and Ki* is the equilibrium inhibition constant that results after the slow-onset phase of inhibition (30Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 31Miles R.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The observed rate vs is the rate following slow-onset inhibition, and kcatis the uninhibited rate at saturating substrate concentration. Searching theP. falciparum genome data base with the protein sequence forE. coli PNP returned a single sequence with significant homology represented as independent entries (Fig.1). Pairwise alignment revealed 26% identity to E. coli PNP and 24% identity to B. subtilis type II PNP. The P. falciparum gene encodes a single open reading frame corresponding to 245 amino acids with a molecular mass of 26,857 Da and a calculated isoelectric point at pH 6.3. The reading frame for P. falciparum PNP was amplified using PCR and DNA sequencing of the product showed no difference from the data base sequence, except for the changes introduced at the N terminus. Sequences similar to P. falciparum PNP were also identified in other Plasmodiumspecies. These include P. berghei, P. vivax, andP. yoelii with 79%, 28%, and 78% identity to the P. falciparum PNP in regions of 168, 111, and 244 amino acid residues in length, respectively. Searching the protein data base with the P. falciparum PNP sequence yielded homologous sequences containing the “purine and other phosphorylases” Family 1 signature (PROSITE, PS01232). There was weaker but significant homology to sequences with the Family 2 signature of purine other phosphorylases (data not shown). In a multiple sequence alignment of the putativeP. falciparum PNP with the PNP, UDP, and MTAP protein sequences from mammalian and microbial sources, P. falciparum PNP had ∼40% similarity to Family 1 phosphorylases that are bacterial PNPs and UDPs, and significant but less similarity (∼20%) to Family 2 phosphorylases that are mostly of mammalian origin (data not shown). In contrast, Family 1 PNPs have an average similarity to each other of 62.8% and Family 2 PNPs have an average similarity to each other of 87%. P. falciparum PNP does not contain sufficient homology to either family to make it a typical member of either group. The phylogenetic tree shows that P. falciparum PNP is an outlier in terms of genetic distance from both families of purine phosphorylases (Fig. 2). Phylogeny of thePlasmodium genus makes it more closely related to mammalian species than to bacteria. However, P. falciparum PNP is genetically more distant from mammalian PNPs (p < 0.01) and closer to bacterial PNPs (p < 0.01) (Fig.2). With respect to all Family 1 phosphorylase members, it is closer to bacterial uridine phosphorylases than it is to other PNPs or to the bacterial methylthioadenosine phosphorylase from B. sulfolobus. Sequence alignment with only bacterial PNPs indicates that P. falciparum PNP has 11 of the 17 catalytic site residues identified in the E. coli PNP crystal structure (TableI and Fig. 1) (9Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Bzowska A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T.A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Four of the six non-conserved residues are conservatively substituted, and another is nearby in the alignment. The general acid/base contact at N7 of the purine ring in E. coli PNP is Asp204, which is also in H-bond contact to the 6-amino group for adenosine phosphorolysis (33Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Gainsford G.J. Schramm V.L. Tyler P.C. Tetrahedron. 2000; 563053Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This region is not highly conserved betweenE. coli PNP and P. falciparum PNP, but Asp205 in P. falciparum PNP may function in the same way (Fig. 1). The displacement of Asp205 relative to the E. coli PNP is particularly interesting, because, unlike other Type 1 phosphorylases, adenosine is not a substrate for P. falciparum PNP ((15); see below).Table IConserved active site residues in PNPs from E. coli, human and P. falciparumaaResidues in the active sites of E. coli and human PNPs are based on their crystal structures (32Mao C.

Although P. falciparum PNP is phylogenetically closer to UDPs than other PNPs, it is missing important features of the UDPs (Fig. 2). The E. coli UDP contains a flexible loop (Tyr163-Phe180), which extends to neighboring subunits. The loop is missing in P. falciparum PNP and bacterial PNPs. Also absent is the E. coli UDP Asp5, which is involved in catalytic activity (35Morgunova E. Mikhailov A.M. Popov A.N. Blagova E.V. Smirnova E.A. Vainshtein B.K. Mao C. Armstrong Sh R. Ealick S.E. Komissarov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Current crystallographic studies of E. coli UDP have not identified residues with specific functions in catalysis but only residues near the active site (35Morgunova E. Mikhailov A.M. Popov A.N. Blagova E.V. Smirnova E.A. Vainshtein B.K. Mao C. Armstrong Sh R. Ealick S.E. Komissarov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These residues are no more conserved in P. falciparum PNP than they are in the bacterial PNPs. The family 1 phosphorylase consensus pattern (G/S/T)XG(L/I/V/M)GX(P/A)SX(G/S/T/A)IX3EL is not complete in P. falciparum PNP (Fig. 1). The 8th and 11th consensus residues (Ser and Ile) are substituted by Gly and Val. P. falciparum PNP shows no consistent features of the consensus pattern of the Type 2 phosphorylases. Bacterial recombinant P. falciparum PNP protein was expressed as ∼5% of soluble protein in induced cultures (Fig.3). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity in cell extracts was increased substantially relative to non-induced cultures. The specific catalytic activity of P. falciparum PNP increased at each purification step, and the final protein purity was estimated to be >95% (Fig. 3).

We previously identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Rac1, STEF (SIF and Tiam 1-like exchange factor), which can induce ruffling membrane in KB cells and is predominantly expressed in the brain during development. Here, we characterize the molecular nature of STEF and its involvement in neurite growth. Deletion analyses revealed distinct roles for individual domains: PHnTSS for membrane association, DH for enzymatic activity, and PHc for promoting catalytic activity. Ectopic expression of STEF in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells induced neurite-like processes containing F-actin, βIII tubulin, MAP2, and GAP43 in a Rac1-dependent manner even under the serum-containing neurite-inhibiting conditions. We further found that a PHnTSS STEF fragment specifically inhibited the function of both STEF and Tiam1, a closely related Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Suppression of endogenous STEF and Tiam1 activities in N1E-115 cells by ectopically expressed PHnTSS STEF resulted in inhibition of neurite outgrowth in serum-starved conditions, which usually induce neurite formation. Furthermore, these inhibitory effects were rescued by exogenously expressed STEF or Tiam1, suggesting that STEF and Tiam1 are involved in neurite formation through the activation of Rac1 and successive cytoskeletal reorganization of neuronal cells during development.

Therefore, it was proposed that a balance between the activities of the Cdc42/Rac1- and RhoA-mediated pathways determines whether neurites extend or retract (9Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 12van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of GTPase activities in neurite behavior in response to environmental cues in vivo remain unclear. Rho family GTPases serve as molecular switches cycling between the GDP-bound inactive and the GTP-bound active forms. These switches are turned on by Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 which catalyze GDP-GTP exchange in one or more GTPases (13Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Members of this family often exhibit tissue- and subcellular-specific localization. They also often possess multiple protein motifs, such as PH, SH2 and SH3 (Src homology domains 2 and 3, respectively), and PDZ domains, most of which are involved in intracellular signal transduction. Dbl family GEFs are believed to integrate extracellular information for proper activation of Rho GTPases at specific subcellular regions. Recent genetic studies in C. elegans and Drosophila have shown that some Dbl family GEFs play important roles in neuritogenesis (14Steven R. Kubiseski T.J. Zheng H. Kulkarni S. Mancillas J.

However, although over 30 Dbl family GEFs have been identified in vertebrates, physiological functions in neuronal network formation have been clarified in vivo for only a few. Previously, we identified a Rac1-specific GEF, STEF (19Hoshino M. Sone M. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a mammalian homologue of Drosophila SIF, which is involved in synaptic growth (20Sone M. Hoshino M.

Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. Development. 2000; 127: 4157-4168PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that STEF was capable of inducing membrane ruffling in KB cells through the reorganization of actin filaments, similar to the constitutively active Rac1 (19Hoshino M. Sone M. Fukata M.

Structurally, STEF contains a catalytic Dbl homologous (DH) domain flanked by a pleckstrin homologous (PHc) domain, a hallmark of Dbl family GEFs. In addition, STEF possesses another PH domain at its N terminus (PHn), followed by a TSS (otherwise known as CC-Ex) and a PDZ domain. PH domains are thought to be involved in protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (22Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J.

Tiam1 is another mammalian homologue of Drosophila SIF, originally isolated as an invasion-inducing gene product (24Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A.

Overexpression of Tiam1 induces membrane ruffling in NIH3T3 cells, invasion in T-lymphoma cells, and neurite-like processes in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells in a Rac1-dependent manner (12van Leeuwen F.N.

We attempted to characterize the fundamental functions of STEF using KB epidermoid and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Deletion analyses were used to determine the function of individual STEF domains. Ectopic expression of STEF and establishment of a dominant-negative form of STEF allowed us to further elucidate its in vivo role. These results, in conjunction with the predominant expression ofstef and Tiam1 in the brain, particularly in regions where neurite extension is believed to occur during development (19Hoshino M.

Oligonucleotides encoding FLAG, Myc, or hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes flanked by stop codons were introduced into the vectors. ΔPHn, ΔTSS, ΔPDZ, ΔDH, ΔPHc, and DHPHc mutants were constructed by removing amino acids 540–595, 620–794, 824–1078, 1115–1315, 1409–1480, and 464–1076, respectively, from the ΔN STEF construct. Oligonucleotides encoding the N-terminal 20 residues of the mouse c-Src signal for myristoylation were inserted to construct Myr-DHPHc STEF. Myr-DH was derived from Myr-DHPHc by deleting the PHc domain. The PHnTSS fragment of STEF (amino acids 464–780) was generated by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3 containing C-terminal FLAG or HA epitope tags. pEF-BOS-HA plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant Rac1 (27Kuroda S.

To construct pcDNA3-Myc-V12Rac1 and pcDNA3-Myc-N17Rac1, respective cDNAs were inserted in a pcDNA3 vector containing an N-terminal Myc epitope. ΔN Tiam1 cDNA, originally provided by J. G. Collard (The Netherlands Cancer Institute), was subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector containing C-terminal Myc, FLAG, or HA epitopes. βPix cDNA was isolated using Rapid-Screen cDNA library panels from mouse E19 mRNA (OriGene Technologies) and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Kodak). pEGFP plasmid was fromCLONTECH. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion STEF protein corresponding to the middle region of STEF (amino acids 812–1003). Antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography. KB and N1E-115 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Plasmids were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent kit (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 h of incubation, fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was substituted, and cells were cultured for 24 h. For KB cells, serum-free medium was used for the subsequent 24 h culture. For N1E-115 cells, serum-free or serum-containing medium was used for the 24-h incubation as indicated. In the rescue experiments using N1E-115 cells, reduced-serum Opti-MEM was used throughout. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin /PBS for 30 min. After incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h, cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with Alexa488- or Alexa594-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Cy5-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used in triple-staining experiments. Rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize actin filaments. Fluorescent images were obtained by TCS SP laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica). Primary antibodies used were anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma), anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-β-tubulin mAb (Sigma), anti-tubulin βIII isoform mAb (Chemicon), anti-MAP2 mAb (Chemicon), anti-GAP43 mAb (Sigma), and anti-Tiam1 polyclonal (Santa Cruz). Cell lysates in Laemmli's SDS-sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 6% skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Signals were developed using the ECL PLUS system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and then exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated on ice for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and EDTA-free CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were centrifuged for 3 min at 12,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants and pellets were used as Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, respectively (28Payrastre B. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.

Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blotting analyses. Anti-HSP-70 polyclonal antibody was a gift from A. Nakai (Yamaguchi University, Japan) and anti-EGF receptor mAb from Sigma. Assay was performed according to the modified method of Sander et al. (29Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment containing the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) region (amino acids 54–165) of PAK1 was subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to construct GST-PAK CRIB. Bacterially produced recombinant GST-PAK CRIB fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Transfected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid, 4% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free CompleteTM. Lysates were briefly centrifuged and incubated with 20 μg of GST-PAK CRIB protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound GTP-Rac1 proteins were detected by Western blotting with antibody against HA epitope. Polyclonal antibody against the central region of the STEF protein (amino acids 812–1003) was generated and used for Western blot analyses. The affinity-purified antibody revealed a band of ∼190 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of STEF, in extracts from fetal mouse brain and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells but not KB epidermoid carcinoma cells (Fig.1A, lanes 3–5), which correlates with our Northern analyses showing thatstef transcripts are expressed predominantly in the nervous system (19Hoshino M.

The antibody recognized a 190-kDa band in KB cell lysates transfected with full-length STEF expression plasmid and exhibited no cross-reactivity with exogenously expressed Tiam1 (Fig. 1A,lanes 1 and 2). The specificity of anti-Tiam1 antibody was also confirmed against STEF (Fig. 1B). Ectopic expression of full-length and constitutively active N-terminal truncated (ΔN) STEF (Fig. 2) induced prominent ruffling of the membrane in KB cells above the sites of colocalized STEF protein and F-actin (Fig. 3A, a andb), although the number and intensity of FL STEF-expressing cells were lower, likely because of instability of the FL STEF (data not shown and Fig. 3C). This effect was dependent on Rac1 activity, because induction of membrane ruffling was suppressed by the coexpression of N17Rac1, a dominant-negative mutant of Rac1 (Fig.4A, a and B).Figure 3Domain analyses of STEF protein in KB cells.A, representative confocal images of KB cells expressing mutant proteins of STEF.

The amount of precipitated exogenous GTP-bound Rac1 proteins was detected by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody (top panel). Total amounts of HA-tagged Rac1 in the lysates are shown in the middle panel. The expression levels of FLAG-tagged mutant proteins are shown in the bottom panel. The expression levels of mutant proteins were similar except for FL STEF, possibly because of protein instability.

Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the role of each STEF domain, we performed a series of transfections with deletion mutant constructs containing C-terminal FLAG epitope tags (Fig. 2). Mutant proteins and F-actin were detected with anti-FLAG antibody and rhodamine-phalloidin, respectively, to analyze protein localization and cell shape using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Initially, we focused on the membrane localization ability of each deletion mutant protein. Horizontal xy axis images as well as vertical xz axis images showed that mutants lacking the PDZ (ΔPDZ), DH (ΔDH), or C-terminal PH (ΔPHc) domains were localized at the plasma membrane, whereas those lacking the N-terminal PH (ΔPHn) or TSS (ΔTSS) domains appeared mainly cytoplasmic (Fig. 3A, c–g). We found that a fragment encompassing the PHn and the adjacent TSS domain (PHnTSS) was capable of localizing to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, h). These results indicate that both PHn and TSS domains are necessary and sufficient for the membrane localization of STEF in KB cells. To further examine subcellular localization of the mutant proteins, transfected cell lysates were biochemically fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions and subjected to Western blot analyses (Fig. 3B). Triton X-100-insoluble fractions have previously been reported to contain components of plasma membrane and cytoskeleton (28Payrastre B. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Breton M. den Hartigh J.C. Plantavid M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We found that FL, ΔN, ΔPDZ, ΔDH, ΔPHc, and PHnTSS mutant proteins were strongly detected in the insoluble fraction, whereas the ΔTSS mutant protein was barely detectable, consistent with our confocal observations. Interestingly, the ΔPHn protein was abundantly detected in the insoluble fraction, although it seemed mainly cytoplasmic in confocal images, implying that STEF may associate with cytoskeletal components apart from cell membrane in the absence of the PHn domain. We next investigated the ability of the deletion mutants to drive membrane ruffling in KB cells. Although both ΔPDZ and ΔPHc mutants were able to induce ruffling membranes (Fig. 3A, e and g), ΔPHc exhibited a much weaker phenotype than ΔN and ΔPDZ. ΔDH was unable to induce membrane ruffling (Fig. 3A, f), supporting the consensus that the DH domain is a catalytic domain for the exchange reaction (13Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Notably, ΔPHn and ΔTSS mutants that do not localize, also failed to elicit ruffling (Fig. 3A, c andd), despite the presence of the catalytic DH domain, suggesting that membrane association is crucial for the membrane ruffling ability. To examine this possibility, we tested a C-terminal mutant containing DH and PHc domains (DHPHc) and found that it could neither localize to the plasma membrane nor evoke membrane ruffling (Fig. 3A, i and B). To enable membrane localization, a myristoylation site derived from c-Src (30Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) was added at the N terminus of DHPHc (Myr-DHPHc). The resulting mutant protein successfully localized to the membrane and induced prominent membrane ruffling in KB cells (Fig. 3A, j and B), demonstrating that membrane localization of the DHPHc region is sufficient to induce ruffling membrane in KB cells; it suggests further that the PHnTSS region functions mainly for STEF localization. In addition, the Myr-DH mutant, which lacks the PHc domain, exhibited an apparently weaker ability to induce ruffling membrane than Myr-DHPHc, although it contains the catalytic DH domain and can localize to the membrane (Fig. 3A, k and B). We also investigated the capacity of each mutant to activate Rac1 in KB cells. To measure Rac1 activation, we performed affinity pull-down assays using the PAK1 CRIB domain that specifically binds to GTP-bound active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 (29Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). After cotransfection of a STEF mutant and HA-tagged Rac1 (HA-Rac1) in KB cells, GTP-bound HA-Rac1 was precipitated with GST-PAK CRIB conjugated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and immunodetected with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3C). ΔN STEF was found to significantly increase the amount of GTP-bound HA-Rac1 compared with control, consistent with the fact that STEF serves as a Rac1 GEF in vitro (19Hoshino M. Sone M. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), although expression levels of FL STEF were too low to enhance Rac1 activity, possibly because of protein instability. Deletion of the entire PDZ domain (ΔPDZ) did not impair the ability of STEF to activate Rac1, in contrast with mutants lacking PHn, TSS, or DH domains (ΔPHn, ΔTSS, or ΔDH). DHPHc mutants were unable to enhance the Rac1 activity in KB cells, albeit our previous findings that the DHPHc portion of STEF alone was sufficient to exhibit GDP/GTP exchange activity for Rac1in vitro (19Hoshino M. Sone M. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, forced targeting of DHPHc to the membrane (Myr-DHPHc) restored the exchange activity, suggesting a direct correlation between the ability to activate Rac1 and the ability to induce membrane ruffling and further indicating that STEF works as an exchange factor only when it is localized at the membrane in KB cells. It is also notable that deletion of the PHc domain from ΔN or Myr-DHPHc (ΔPHc or Myr-DH, respectively) resulted in a remarkable reduction of Rac1 activation compared with their parental constructs, although each mutant protein retained the ability for membrane localization (Fig. 3A, g and k). These results suggest that the PHc domain may be involved in enhancing the enzymatic activity of the adjacent DH domain and are supported by the fact that both ΔPHc and Myr-DH mutants induced much weaker membrane ruffling than their parental constructs (ΔN and Myr-DHPHc) (Fig. 3A, b, g, j, and k). As described above, we found a functional significance for the PHnTSS region of STEF. Taken together with the demonstration by Stam et al. (31Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that polypeptides containing the PHn and TSS (or CC-Ex) regions of Tiam1 effectively suppressed Tiam1-induced membrane ruffling in COS-7 cells, we postulated that the PHnTSS region of STEF might act as a dominant-negative form. To test this idea, we cotransfected PHnTSS STEF with ΔN STEF into KB cells to see wh"

Only the αβ-heterodimer Hex A is able to degrade ganglioside GM2 (Fig. 1B) at significant rates in the presence of the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP). A group of severe neurodegenerative storage diseases, the GM2 gangliosidoses, results from mutations in any of the genes encoding the two hexosaminidase subunits and GM2AP. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in a deficiency in Hex A and Hex S, whereas in Sandhoff disease the lack of Hex A and Hex B activity is observed due to mutations in the HEXB gene. The GM2 gangliosidoses are characterized by a massive accumulation of ganglioside GM2 and related glycolipids in neuronal lysosomes.

In the Hexb −/− mice no increased accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was observed indicating that Hex S, which is still expressed in the mutant mice, is involved in GAG catabolism. GAGs contain β(1–4)- and β(1–3)-linked N-acetylhexosamine residues which become sensitive to hexosaminidases when exposed as terminal sugar residues during their degradation (10Neufeld E.F. Muenzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. III. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3421-3452Google Scholar). We have purified and characterized recombinant Hex S (rHexS) after expression in insect cells. To study its substrate specificity the storage glycans were isolated from the urine of the hexosaminidase double knockout mice. In addition, other water-soluble and lipid substrates were evaluated. The results demonstrate that Hex S is highly active on a wide range of substrates and support the contention that the enzyme is physiologically important in vivo. Phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) (PC), cholesterol (Chol), the maltose oligosaccharide standard, concanavalin A-Sepharose, chondroitin 6-sulfate (type IV-S), β-glucuronidase from bovine liver (type B-10), and hyaluronidase (bovine testes) were purchased from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. BMP was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid was supplied by ICN Biochemicals. POROS 20 HQ and HS ion exchange resins were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany. LichroPrep RP18, TLC, and HPTLC plates were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Carbograph SPE tubes were obtained from Alltech, Unterhaching, Germany. DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-25 fine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc., München, Germany. TSK-Gel HW40F was kindly provided from TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany. The anionic standard saccharides N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate (GalNAc-6-sulfate) and the saturated disaccharide derived from chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S-2) were obtained from Dextra Laboratories, Reading, UK. The unsaturated GAG disaccharide standards ΔDi2S, ΔDi4S, and ΔDi6S were purchased from Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany. The synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (MUG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside-6-sulfate (MUGS) used for the hexosaminidase assay were supplied by Toronto Research Chemicals, Downswood, Ontario, Canada. 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-tris-sulfonic acid,N-acetylgalactosamine, chondroitinase AC, chondroitinase ABC, and methyl-α-d-mannoside were purchased from Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany. Trypsin was purchased from Promega GmbH, chymotrypsin was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, both in Mannheim, Germany. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or of the highest purity available. Recombinant Hex S was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Sf21 cells were infected with a recombinant virus containing the cDNA encoding for the human hexosaminidase α-subunit. The baculovirus construct was prepared as described for the expression of recombinant Hex B (11Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The expression was terminated 96 h after infection. After centrifugation of the serum-free culture medium of infected cells the supernatant was subjected to lectin affinity chromatography with concanavalin A. The column was eluted with 15% (w/v) methyl-α-d-mannoside in equilibration buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 200 mm sodium chloride) and the enzyme activity was monitored with MUG as substrate. The eluate of the concanavalin A column was concentrated and passed through a fast-flow cation exchange resin (POROS 20 HS) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. rHexS was eluted without binding, in contrast to contaminating glycoproteins in the ConA eluate. Subsequently the fraction containing Hex S activity was applied to a weak anion-exchange material (POROS 20 HQ) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was eluted by increasing the concentration of sodium chloride in the equilibration buffer (by 10 mm/column volume), at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Purification to 90% homogeneity was shown by SDS-PAGE. The purified preparation of rHexS was identified by Western blotting and N-terminal sequencing using Edman degradation and ESI-MS/MS sequencing of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides after narrow-bore reverse phase HPLC separation as described below. Western blotting was performed according to Towbin et al. (12Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar) using an antiserum raised against the denatured hexosaminidase α-subunit (13Proia R.L. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3350-3354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hex A and Hex B were purified from human liver to apparent homogeneity according to Liessem et al. (14Liessem B.

Their purity and identity were ensured by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (12Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar, 13Proia R.L. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F.

After proteolytic cleavage and reverse phase separation of the resulting peptides the post-translational modifications of rHexS were analyzed by mass spectrometry: N-glycosylation of rHexS glycopeptides was demonstrated by treatment withN-glycosidase F (15Schuette C.G. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by ESI-MS/MS fragment analysis as described below. Disulfide linkages were analyzed by comparing the masses of the proteolytic cleavage products of unmodified active rHexS with those of active rHexS alkylated by iodoacetamide, and those of reduced and alkylated rHexS as established in our laboratory for the analysis of the hexosaminidase β-subunit (15Schuette C.G. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, chymotryptic cleavage of rHexS was used under the conditions described for tryptic degradation (15Schuette C.G. Weisgerber J. Sandhoff K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and proteolytic digestion products were also analyzed by ESI-MS/MS as described below, in addition to MALDI-MS. Recombinant GM2AP was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (16Schütte C.G. Lemm T. Glombitza G.J. Sandhoff K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Km and Vmax values for recombinant β-hexosaminidase S were determined by the method of Lineweaver and Burk (17Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8013) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were measured as described (5Kytzia H.J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using various concentrations of the synthetic substrates MUG (final concentrations of 0.25–2.5 mm in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.4) and MUGS (0.1–1.0 mm in 50 mmcitrate buffer, pH 4.0), respectively. Enzyme kinetics with these substrates followed Michaelis-Menten theory. Enzyme activities were measured as described (5Kytzia H.J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using MUG (final concentrations of 1 mm in 50 mm citrate buffer) and MUGS (0.5 mm in 25 mm citrate buffer), respectively, and varying the pH of the solution in the range from 3.0 to 6.0. The data obtained with the artificial substrates are means of at least duplicate determinations. Deviations did not exceed ± 5% of the mean. Generation of hexosaminidase-deficient mice through targeted gene disruption and cross-breeding of the knockout animals to obtain the double knockout mice has been described previously (7Sango K. Yamanaka S. Hoffmann A. Okuda Y. Grinberg A. Westphal H. McDonald M.P. Crawley J.N. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 8Sango K. McDonald M.P. Crawley J.N. Mack M.L. Tifft C.J. Skop E. Starr C.M. Hoffmann A. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The urine and kidneys of knockout mice and wild type littermates of 10–20 weeks of age were analyzed. SM2 and SB2 were isolated according to Jennemann et al. (18Jennemann R. Schulze M. Bauer B.L. Kurtz C. Wiegandt H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Kidneys were homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax, freeze-dried, and extracted twice with acetone using an ultrasonic bath. The residual pellet then was extracted for GSLs two times with chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/1, v/v), once with chloroform/methanol/water (30/60/8, v/v) using an ultrasonic bath, and the combined chloroform/methanol/water extracts were dried in a rotary evaporator. To remove most phospholipids the chloroform/methanol/water extract was treated with 0.1 m methanolic KOH for 2 h at 37 °C and neutralized with acetic acid. To remove salts the extract was dialyzed 5 times against water and subsequently freeze dried. Neutral and acidic GSLs were separated on a DEAE column and acidic GSLs were split into fractions by eluting with a stepwise gradient of 20, 80, 200, 500, and 1000 mm potassium acetate in methanol. Again salts were removed by dialyzing 5 times against water and subsequently freeze drying the micellar lipid solution. SM2 then was isolated from the 80 mm potassium acetate fraction and SB2 from the 500 mm potassium acetate fraction. Each fraction was further purified by silica gel flash chromatography using a stepwise gradient of propanol-2/n-hexane/water, with changes in the ratio of n-hexane and water (55/44/1, 55/43/2, etc. until 55/37/8, v/v). Final purification of SM2 was achieved by repeated silica gel flash chromatography of the combined SM2-containing fractions using the solvent systems chloroform/methanol/water (62/30/1.8, v/v/v) and then chloroform/methanol/water (70/30/2, v/v/v). Final purification of SB2 was achieved by silica gel flash chromatography of the combined SB2-containing fractions using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/water (65/30/2.5, v/v/v). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by the following procedure: PC (50 mm, toluol/ethanol, 2/1, v/v), BMP (5 mm, chloroform/methanol, 2/1, v/v), Chol (25.6 mm, chloroform/methanol, 2/1, v/v), and SM2 (740 μm, chloroform/methanol/water, 60/35/8, v/v/v) were dissolved in organic solvents. Appropriate aliquots of the lipid solutions were mixed and dried under nitrogen. The lipid mixture was hydrated to a total lipid concentration of 2 mm in Tris/HCl buffer (1 mm, pH 7.4) and freeze-thawed 10 times in liquid nitrogen to ensure solute equilibration between trapped and bulk solutions. The standard lipid composition was 50 mol % PC, 20 mol % BMP, 20 mol % Chol, and 10 mol % SM2. Unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the passage of liposomes through 2 polycarbonate filters (100-nm pore size, Avestin) mounted in tandem in a mini-extruder (Liposo-Fast, Avestin). Samples were subjected to 19 passages as recommended (19MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The model substrate for Hex S was obtained by enzymatic degradation of chondroitin 6-sulfate according to Kresse et al. (20Kresse H. v. Figura K. Klein U. Glössl J. Paschke E. Pohlmann R. Methods Enzymol.83. Academic Press, New York1985: 559-572Google Scholar). Briefly, after exhaustive digestion of chondroitin 6-sulfate with testicular hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35) in 100 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, for 45 h at 37 °C the ethanol-soluble degradation products were chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G-25 fine (24 × 850 mm) equilibrated and eluted with 1.0 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The fractions were monitored by FACE profiling. Tetrasaccharide peak fractions were desalted using the same column equilibrated with water. The tetrasaccharide was then treated with β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.2, for 48 h at 37 °C. The trisaccharide product C6S-3 (Fig. 1C) was chromatographed and desalted as described for the tetrasaccharide. The urine was collected in a metabolism cage for mice (Scanbur A/S) in which the mice stayed 8 h per day. Neutral urinary oligosaccharides were prepared by solid phase extraction on graphitized carbon as described by Klein et al. (21Klein A. Lebreton A. Lemoine J. Perini J.M. Roussel P. Michalski J.C. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 2422-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the columns (0.5 ml) equilibrated with 3 ml of water were loaded with 150–300 μl of urine sample and washed with 2 ml of water again. Neutral oligosaccharides were eluted with 2 ml of 25% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Anionic urinary oligosaccharides were prepared according to Lindahl et al. (22Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A 2.6-ml DEAE-Sephacel column was equilibrated first with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and then with washing buffer (50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) at a flow-rate of 1.2 ml/min. After loading of 150–300 μl of urine and 15 ml of washing buffer the column was eluted with either 150 mm lithium chloride in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, for the isolation of DS-5 (A) or 2.0 m lithium chloride in the same buffer for the preparation of GAG OS (B). The eluates A and B were separately desalted by size exclusion chromatography on a TSK-Gel HW40F column (16 × 390 mm) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Hex S activity was assayed with the artificial substrates MUG or MUGS as described (5Kytzia H.J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures using MUG as substrate contained the following components in a final volume of 200 μl: sodium citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 4.4), 20-μl aliquots of enzyme solution, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 mmMUG. When using MUGS the final substrate concentration was 0.5 mm and the buffer concentration was 25 mm, pH 4.0. The incubation was stopped after 30 min at 37 °C by adding 1 ml of sodium carbonate/glycine buffer (200 mm each, pH 9.5). Then, the amount of 4-methylumbelliferone released was measured fluorimetrically. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of MUG/min at 37 °C. Oligosaccharide degradation by hexosaminidases was assayed as follows: 1–5 nmol of purified N-glycan fragment H3N3 (Fig. 1D), 0.5–2 nmol/oligosaccharide DS-5 (Fig. 1C) or GAG OS, and 4 nmol of C6S-3 (Fig. 1C), respectively, were dried in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator (CVE, Savant). Standard assay mixtures contained 200 milliunits of (MUG) β-hexosaminidase activity and 4 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 40 μl. For subsequent mass spectrometric analysis sample solutions were buffered by ammonium acetate (5 mm, pH 4.0). By addition of 40 μl of methanol the incubation was stopped after 5 h unless indicated otherwise. Concomitantly, samples lacking enzyme activity as well as samples devoid of substrate were incubated as control experiments under identical conditions. The GAG OS mixture isolated from the urine of double knockout mice was incubated with chondroitinase AC (EC 4.2.2.5) and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), respectively, under the same conditions as with the hexosaminidases except that 175 milliunits of enzyme activity and ammonium acetate buffer (5 mm, pH 8.0) were used; the samples were incubated for 9 h at 37 °C and the reaction products were analyzed by FACE. Concomitantly, control assays lacking either enzymes or substrates were run under identical conditions, none of them indicating that any digestion took place. The degradation of glycolipid substrates by the hexosaminidase isozymes was tested in a micellar assay (A) and the hydrolysis of SM2 by Hex S was also examined in a liposomal assay (B). Glycolipids were incubated with the A, S, and B isozymes under the same conditions as described in the oligosaccharide assay with the following alterations: 8 nmol of glycolipid per assay were used and sodium citrate buffer (5 mm, pH 4.3) replaced the ammonium acetate buffer in a final volume of 20 μl. 1.5 μg of GM2AP was added and incubation times ranged from 15 min to 17 h, as indicated in the legends to the figures. After the incubations were stopped with 20 μl of methanol the assay mixtures were dried in a CVE and redissolved in 40 μl of ammonium acetate buffer (0.3 m, pH 7.0). Prior to TLC analysis the samples were desalted by reverse phase chromatography. RP18 columns (0.5 ml) equilibrated with a solution of chloroform, methanol, 0.1 m KCl (3/48/47, v/v/v) were loaded with sample, washed with water, and eluted with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol 1/1 (v/v). The eluted lipids were applied to a TLC plate. LUVs containing SM2 as substrate were incubated with rHexS and GM2AP in a liposomal assay. The micellar assay described above was modified as follows. Standard incubation mixtures contained sodium citrate buffer (10 mm, pH 4.3), 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1.0 μg of GM2AP, and 30 milliunits of rHexS in a final volume of 40 μl. A total volume of 20 μl of protein mixture in citrate buffer was added to the same volume of unilamellar vesicles dissolved in Tris/Cl buffer (1 mm, pH 7.2). The liposomes (1 mm, amount of total liposomal lipids) were composed of 50 mol % PC, 20 mol % Chol, 20 mol % BMP and 10 mol % SM2 or 70 mol % PC, 20 mol % Chol, and 10 mol % SM2. After incubation stop with 40 μl of methanol the mixtures were concentrated to dryness by a stream of nitrogen and then subjected to alkaline methanolysis with 0.1m NaOH in 200 μl of methanol for 4.5 h at 37 °C to remove the phospholipids. After neutralization with 1.2 μl of glacial acetic acid, the samples were desalted by reverse phase chromatography on RP18 and applied to HPTLC plates. Desalted assay samples were applied to thin layer Silica Gel 60 or HPTLC plates (Merck Darmstadt, Germany). The chromatograms were developed with chloroform, methanol, 0.22% (w/v) CaCl2 in water (60/35/8, v/v/v). After development, plates were air-dried, sprayed with 8% (w/v) H3PO4 containing 10% (w/v) CuSO4, and charred at 180 °C for 10 min, and lipids were quantitated by photodensitometry (Shimadzu Kyoto, Japan). This method is based on the fluorescence labeling of glycans by reductive amination with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-tris-sulfonic acid (23Jackson P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). 5 μl of a 0.15m solution of the fluorophore in 15% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 5 μl of 1.0 m sodium"
https://openalex.org/W2157178116,"Pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is characterized by massive airway inflammation, which comprises significant cytokine production. Although mast cells are abundant in the lung and are potent sources of various cytokines, a role of mast cells in P. aeruginosa infection remains undefined, and P. aeruginosa-induced signaling mechanisms in mast cells have not been studied previously. Here we demonstrate that human cord blood-derived mast cells, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, and the mouse mast cell line MC/9 produce significant amounts of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in response to P. aeruginosa. This response was accompanied by a stimulation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) phosphorylation and PKC activity and was significantly blocked by the PKC inhibitors Ro 31-8220 and PKCα pseudosubstrate. Interestingly, mast cells treated with P. aeruginosa had reduced protein levels of phosphatase 2A catalytic unit (PP2Ac), which prompted us to determine whether a direct association between PKCα and PP2A occurs in mast cells. In mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and MC/9 cells, as well as in the human mast cell line HMC-1, PP2A coimmunoprecipitated with PKCα either using PKCα- or PP2Ac-specific antibodies, suggesting that PKCα and PP2Ac are physically associated in mast cells. The PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid induced P. aeruginosa-like responses in mast cells including increased PKCα phosphorylation, stimulated PKC activity, and augmented IL-6 production, the last being blocked by the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220. Finally, okadaic acid potentiated the P. aeruginosa-induced IL-6 production. Collectively, these data provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of both a direct physical association of PP2A and PKCα in mammalian cells and their coinvolvement in regulating mast cell activation in response toP. aeruginosa.

Some studies suggest that impairment of IL-6 regulation may represent an important component of the excessive inflammatory response observed during P. aeruginosa infection (1Nixon L.S. Yung B.

One recent study demonstrated that stimulation of RBL 2H3 cells, a rat mast cell line, with antigen leads to a transient translocation and activation of PP2A (9Ludowyke R.I. Holst J. Mudge L.M. Sim A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6144-6152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The rate of translocation of PP2A to the membrane coincides with the kinetic pattern of degranulation (9Ludowyke R.I. Holst J. Mudge L.M. Sim A.T. J. Biol.

In addition, several studies have described in human and rodent mast cells that okadaic acid blocks IgE-dependent and IgE-independent degranulation (10Estevez M.D. Vieytes M.R. Louzao M.C.

However, the molecular target of PP2A in the regulation of mast cell function or the role that PP2A plays during cytokine production remains to be determined. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases comprising at least 12 different isoforms that have been grouped into three categories: conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, and η) and atypical PKCs (ζ, τ, λ, and μ). PKC isoform expression appears to be cell type-specific (15Bassini A. Zauli G. Migliaccio G. Migliaccio A.R. Pascuccio M. Pierpaoli S. Guidotti L. Capitani S. Vitale M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1178-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC isoforms that have been characterized in mast cells include PKCα, βI, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, and ξ (15Bassini A. Zauli G. Migliaccio G.

Compared with other PKC isoforms, PKCα has distinct roles in a number of processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis (21Mandil R. Ashkenazi E. Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Rosenthal G.

In vivo, overexpression of PKCα in transgenic mice results in striking alterations of proinflammatory mediator production during inflammation (24Wang H.Q. Smart R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3497-3506PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, Escherichia coli infection induces PKCα translocation from cytosol to membrane in T84 carcinoma cells (25Crane J.K. Oh J.S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting bacteria-induced activation of PKCα. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced mediator production is enhanced significantly by overexpression of PKCα (26Li S. Huang F.L. Feng Q. Liu J. Fan S.X. McKenna T.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant negative version of PKCα strongly inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production by macrophages (27St.-Denis A. Chano F. Tremblay P., St.- Pierre Y. Descoteaux A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32787-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Impaired PKCα function induced by Leishmania donovani in macrophages correlates with defective phagosome maturation and survival of the parasite in host cells (28Holm A. Tejle K. Magnusson K.E. Descoteaux A. Rasmusson B. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCα appears to play an important role during pathogen-induced inflammatory responses. In mast cells, PKCα has been implicated in several functions (29Razin E. Pecht I. Rivera J. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 370-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) such as antigen-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids (16Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cytokine production (30Chang E.Y. Szallasi Z. Acs P. Raizada V. Wolfe P.C. Fewtrell C. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2624-2632PubMed Google Scholar). PKCα kinase activity is regulated by phosphorylation of three conserved residues in its kinase domain: the activation loop site Thr-497, the autophosphorylation site Thr-638, and the hydrophobic C-terminal site Ser-657 (31Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Without phosphorylation at these sites, PKCα has little or no activity (31Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at the C-terminal site Ser-657 plays a critical role in controlling the net phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates (32Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In vitro, PKCα activity can be inhibited through dephosphorylation by PP2A (33Ricciarelli R. Azzi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The removal of phosphate from these sites is crucial to the desensitization of PKCα (34Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In intact cells, circumstantial evidence has implied that the dephosphorylation of PKCα is catalyzed by a membrane-associated PP2A (35Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32785-32788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of PP2A in the regulation of PKCα activity, okadaic acid, a potent PP2A inhibitor (36Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), induces numerous effects through mimicking or enhancing the actions of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent PKC activator (37Newell S.W. Perchellet E.M. Gao X.M. Chen G. Perchellet J.P. Cancer Lett. 1996; 98: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 38Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of PKC by PMA induced PP2A translocation to the membrane. Cumulatively, this evidence suggests an intimate interaction between PP2A and PKCα. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that PP2Ac and PKCα are physically associated in mast cells and that the associated enzymes participate in the regulation of P. aeruginosa-induced IL-6 production by mast cells. Rabbit anti-PKCα antibodies, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, Triton X-100, sodium deoxycholate, prostaglandin E2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Rabbit anti-phospho-PKCα (Ser 657) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse anti-PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories of BD Biosciences (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Protein A/G PLUS-agarose immunoprecipitation beads, donkey anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell culture media, okadaic acid, antibiotics, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Ro 31-8220 and cell-permeable myristoylated PKC inhibitor peptide 19–27 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. The HMC-1 5C6 human mast cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Prior to experimental treatment, HMC-1 5C6 cells were starved overnight (18–24 h) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium alone at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. For treatment, cells were resuspended in complete medium at a higher density, typically 2 × 106 cells/ml. After treatment cells were harvested in 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes and pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were harvested from the femurs and tibias of C57-black mice (Charles River Laboratories, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Briefly, two or three mice were sacrificed and dissected, and the legs were cleaned of fur and harvested. Tissue was then removed in a sterile environment, and the cleaned bones were kept moist in a dish containing RPMI 1640 medium. The ends were then cut off with sterile surgical scissors, and RPMI medium was run through the shaft using a 30-ml syringe and a 31.5-gauge needle. Cells were collected, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended at a density of 0.5 × 106cells/ml (disregarding erythrocytes) in BMMC complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium, 50 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 nmprostaglandin E2). Nonadherent cells were resuspended in fresh complete medium twice/week and transferred to a fresh flask once/week. After 4–6 weeks, mast cell purity of >98% was achieved as assessed by alcian blue or toluidine blue staining of fixed cytocentrifuge preparations. Before experimental treatment BMMC were starved for 6 h in nonsupplemented RPMI 1640 at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. For treatment, cells were resuspended in complete medium at a higher density; typically 2 × 106 cells/ml. After treatment cells were harvested in 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes and pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Highly purified cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMC, >95% purity) were obtained by long term culture of cord blood progenitor cells as described previously (39Lin T.J. Issekutz T.B. Marshall J.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The percentage of mast cells in the cultures was assessed by toluidine blue staining (pH 1.0) of cytocentrifuged samples. After >8 weeks in culture, mature mast cells were identified by their morphological features and the presence of metachromatic granules and used in our study. P. aeruginosa strain 8821 (a kind gift from Dr. A. Chakrabarty, University of Illinois, Chicago) is a mucoid strain isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient (40Kamath S. Kapatral V. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth and harvested when the culture reached an optical density at 640 nm of 2 units (early stationary phase). Bacteria were washed in phosphate buffer and their density adjusted to 1 optical density unit before treatment with 100 μg/ml gentamycin for 2 h. Mast cells were typically treated withP. aeruginosa, for the indicated times, at a mast cell:bacteria ratio of 1:50. Cell pellets (∼20 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) containing freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA. Lysates were typically left on ice for at least 30 min and homogenized further by passage 5–10 times through a 21-gauge needle. Lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any cellular debris. In some cases RIPA buffer was replaced with extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). To 1 ml of clarified total cell lysate was added at least 1 μg of primary antibody, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Immunoreactive proteins and protein complexes were then precipitated with the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end mixing. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed four times with ice-cold PBS (NaCl concentration adjusted to 1.0m) before the addition of 40 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and storage at −20 °C until further SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Human and mouse IL-6 levels in supernatants were measured using an “in-house” ELISA assay. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with anti-human IL-6 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis) or anti-mouse IL-6 (Endogen, Woburn, MA) at 1 μg/ml for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding to the plates was blocked using a 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 solution in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. A total of 50 μl/well IL-6 standard (human rIL-6, R & D Systems; murine rIL-6, Endogen) and samples were added to the plate and incubated for 18–20 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated anti-human IL-6 (R & D Systems) and anti-murine IL-6 (Endogen) (0.2 μg/ml) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 50 μl/well of a 1/2,000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) was added according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The minimal detectable dose was 3 pg/ml for human IL-6 and 10 pg/ml for murine IL-6 using this system. PKC activity was measured based on the phosphorylation of a PKC substrate peptide using a radioactive PKC assay kit or a nonradioactive protein kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (both from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co.). Confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate the colocalization of PP2Ac and PKCα in mast cells. HMC-1 cells (5×105 cells/test) were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. After washing, cells were resuspended in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS and stored at −80 °C. Thawed cells were washed and incubated with 0.1% saponin and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with mouse anti-PP2Ac IgG1 and rabbit anti-PKCα IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. Then cells were incubated further for 45 min with Alexa Fluor®-594 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, F(ab′)2, and Alexa Fluor®-488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, F(ab′)2 (Molecular Probes Inc.). Cells were washed three times and resuspended in 1% formalin. Cytospins of fluorescence-labeled mast cells were made by vortexing slides in a Cytospin 3 (Shandon, U. K.) at 600 rpm for 3 min. Antibleaching solution (10 mm n-propyl gallate (Sigma), 8.1 m glycerol in Tris-buffered saline) was dropped onto slides before coverslip attachment. Cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Jena, Germany). PP2Ac would then be tagged in red and PKCα ingreen. A yellow color indicates the colocalization of these two enzymes (overlay of red andgreen). IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is produced during the course of infectious and inflammatory disorders and plays a crucial role in both local and systemic inflammatory responses (41Zitnik R.J. Elias J.A. Lenfant C. Lung Biology in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 229-280Google Scholar, 42Wang J. Homer R.J. Chen Q. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4051-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 43Xing Z. Gauldie J. Cox G. Baumann H. Jordana M. Lei X.F. Achong M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). To test whether mast cells produce the cytokine IL-6 after P. aeruginosastimulation, the mouse mast cell line, MC/9 cells, and primary cultured mouse and human mast cells, BMMC and CBMC, were employed in this study. Mast cells at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml were treated with cystic fibrosis-associated P. aeruginosastrain 8821 (mast cell:bacteria ratio of 1:50) for 3–48 h. IL-6 levels in cell free supernatants were determined by ELISA. P. aeruginosa treatment for 24 h stimulated IL-6 production by BMMC and MC/9 significantly (Fig. 1,a and b). In CBMC, significant IL-6 production was observed as early as 6 h after P. aeruginosatreatment (Fig. 1, c and d). To determine the role of PKCα in P. aeruginosa-induced mast cell activation, PKCα phosphorylation and PKC activity were determined in MC/9 cells after P. aeruginosa treatment. MC/9 cells were treated with P. aeruginosa strain 8821 for 3 h or 12 h and lysed in extraction buffer. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with Ab to phosphorylated PKCα on serine 657. Increased phosphorylation of PKCα on serine 657 was seen in mast cells after treatment with P. aeruginosa (Fig.2 a). Interestingly, significant PKCα phosphorylation was seen in both the shorter (3 h) and longer (12 h) exposures to P. aeruginosa, suggesting a sustained stimulation of PKCα. Treatment of mast cells with P. aeruginosa did not affect the total PKCα levels, suggesting that the increase of phosphorylated PKCα is not the result of the increase of total PKCα levels. It is noteworthy that no degradation of PKCα protein was observed after sustained stimulation of mast cells withP. aeruginosa for 12 h. To determine the effect of P. aeruginosa treatment on mast cell PKC activity, MC/9 cells were incubated with P. aeruginosa for 1, 2, or 3 h and lysed in extraction buffer. PKC activity was determined in cell lysates. As shown in Fig.2 b, treatment with P. aeruginosa for 1 h stimulated PKC activity in mast cells significantly. Similar stimulatory effects on PKC activities were observed when mast cells were treated with P. aeruginosa for 2 or 3 h, suggesting a sustained PKC activation. No PKC activity was observed inP. aeruginosa lysates (data not shown). The involvement of PKC in P. aeruginosa-induced mast cell activation was confirmed further by using PKC inhibitors, Ro 31-8220 and PKC inhibitor peptide. BMMC and CBMC were treated with Ro 31-8220 at a dose of 10 μm during the course of P. aeruginosa stimulation. Treatment of mast cells with Ro 31-8220 dramatically blocked P. aeruginosa-induced IL-6 production by BMMC (Fig. 2 c) and CBMC (Fig. 2 d). To confirm further the specific effect of PKCα on IL-6 production, a cell-permeable PKC pseudosubstrate sequence from PKCα (IC50 = 8 μm in fibroblasts according to the manufacturer) was incubated with CBMC during P. aeruginosastimulation. P. aeruginosa-induced IL-6 production by CBMC was inhibited significantly by PKC peptide at the dose of 20 μm (Fig. 2 e). Given that PP2A has been shown in vitro to regulate PKCα activity and phosphorylation (33Ricciarelli R. Azzi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the effect of P. aeruginosa treatment on mast cell PP2Ac was assessed. MC/9 cell and BMMC were treated withP. aeruginosa strain 8821 for 18 h and lysed in RIPA buffer. Total cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis and probed with Ab to PP2Ac. P. aeruginosa treatment induced a decrease of PP2Ac protein in both BMMC (Fig.3 a) and MC/9 cells (Fig.3 b). Based on circumstantial evidence, it has been proposed that activation of PP2A by stimuli will lead to dephosphorylation and inactivation of PKCα and subsequent responses in smooth muscle cells and Molt-4 human leukemia cells (44Ricciarelli R. Tasinato A. Clement S. Ozer N.K. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 45Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The stimulation of PKCα phosphorylation and PKC activity and reduction of PP2Ac protein byP. aeruginosa treatment of mast cells, together with thein vitro functional inter-regulation between PKCα and PP2Ac (33Ricciarelli R. Azzi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggest that PKCα and PP2Ac may interact closely in the regulation of P. aeruginosa-induced mast cell responses. However, interactions between these two enzymes in mast cells have not been previously described. To determine whether PP2Ac and PKCα are physically associated in mast cells, human mast cell line HMC-1 5C6, mouse primary cultured BMMC, and mouse mast cell line MC/9 were used in our study. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed the constitutive expression of both PKCα and PP2Ac in unstimulated mast cells (Fig. 4, b andd). As seen in Fig. 4 a, immunoprecipitates of PKCα, when probed with anti-PP2Ac Ab, demonstrated the presence of PP2Ac. To confirm further the association of PP2Ac and PKCα, mast cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Ab to PP2Ac and"

We report that the circulating glucose metabolite, methylglyoxal (MGO), enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis by activating protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). We found that treatment of myeloma cells with the antioxidantN-acetylcysteine completely blocked cisplatin-dependent intracellular GSH oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and apoptosis. Importantly, co-treatment of cells with the reactive carbonyl MGO and cisplatin increased apoptosis by 90% over the expected additive effect of combined MGO and cisplatin treatment. This same synergism was also observed when ROS generation was examined. MGO and cisplatin increased PKCδ activity by 4-fold, and this effect was blocked by the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin but not by NAC. Furthermore, rottlerin blocked combined MGO and cisplatin-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Finally, MGO and cisplatin induced c-Abl activation and c-Abl:PKCδ association. Rottlerin blocked c-Abl activation, but the c-Abl inhibitor STI-571 increased MGO and cisplatin-induced apoptosis by 50%. Taken together these data indicate that MGO synergistically enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis through activation of PKCδ and that PKCδ is critical to both cell death and cell survival pathways. These findings suggest that in the patient with diabetes mellitus heightened oxidative stress can enhance the cytotoxicity of agents that induce DNA damage.

Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). One of these important complications is increased susceptibility to therapeutic drug side effects including those that induce nausea, anorexia, glucose intolerance, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxcity. In the diabetic patient with cancer, these complications often alter approaches to chemotherapy, accelerate cancer progression, and increase morbidity and mortality (2Stewart D.J. Eapen L. Hirte W.E. Futter N.G. Moors D.E. Murphy P.G. Irvine A.H. Genest P. McKay D.E. Evans W.K. Rasuli P. Peterson R.A. Maroun J.A. J. Urol. 1987; 138: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Mollman J.E.

Pain Symptom Manage. 1997; 13: 339-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Presently, however, the cellular mechanisms by which DM complicates chemotherapy are not well understood. The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial identified hyperglycemia as a risk factor for the development of DM complications (6The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (22937) Google Scholar). Importantly, hyperglycemia results in increased intracellular and extracellular concentrations of reactive carbonyls (1Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these compounds appear to impact significantly on the progression of DM complications (1Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar, 7Thornalley P. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 8Thornalley P.J. Hooper N.I.

The reactive carbonyl, methylglyoxal (MGO), is increased by 3–5-fold in the blood and tissues of diabetic patients (8Thornalley P.J. Hooper N.I. Jennings P.E. Florkowski C.M. Jones A.F. Lunec J. Barnett A.H. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1989; 7: 115-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and circulates at a concentration as high as 8 μm (9McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Benn J. Sonksen P.H. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1994; 87: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Additionally, MGO-derived dilysine imidazoline cross-links and arginine adducts are also markedly increased (1Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). MGO is predominantly generated by the non-enzymatic degradation of triose phosphate intermediates through fragmentation and removal of phosphate from the phospho-ene-diolate form of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (10Thornalley P.J. Langborg A. Minhas H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In hyperglycemia, MGO formation is enhanced due to elevated concentrations of triose phosphate precursors like glucose, fructose, dihydroxyacetone, and d-glyceraldehyde (1Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar, 7Thornalley P. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Detoxification of MGO is mainly via the glyoxalase pathway that is present in the cytosol of all mammalian cells (7Thornalley P. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This pathway is composed of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II, which converts MGO toS-d-lactoylglutathione and d-lactate in an enzymatic reaction that requires GSH as a co-factor (7Thornalley P. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Platinum-derived chemotherapeutic agents including the parent compound cisplatin (cis-platinum(II)diammine dichloride) are widely used in the treatment of various malignancies including ovarian (11Ozols R.F. Young R.C. Semin. Oncol. 1991; 18: 222-232PubMed Google Scholar), testicular (12Hartmann J.T. Kanz L. Bokemeyer C. Drugs. 1999; 58: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and bladder (13Witjes J.A. Drugs. 1997; 53: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) cancers. For the diabetic patient, however, platinum-based drugs are used with reservation due to the concern for exacerbating DM-induced peripheral neuronal and renal damage (2Stewart D.J. Eapen L. Hirte W.E. Futter N.G. Moors D.E. Murphy P.G. Irvine A.H. Genest P. McKay D.E. Evans W.K. Rasuli P. Peterson R.A. Maroun J.A. J.

Cisplatin causes apoptotic cell death by generating DNA and protein adducts that include DNA-protein cross-links, DNA monoadducts, inter- and intra-strand DNA cross-links, protein-protein cross-links, and protein adducts (14Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, inhibitors of ROS (15Miyajima A. Nakashima J. Tachibana M. Nakamura K. Hayakawa M. Murai M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) can block cisplatin-induced apoptosis indicating that pathways involved in and/or activated by oxidative stress are critical to cisplatin bioactivity. In fact, increased concentrations of intracellular GSH are found in cells resistant to cisplatin (16Godwin A.K. Meister A. O'Dwyer P.J. Huang C.S. Hamilton T.C. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity can be blunted by systemic administration of NAC (17Sheikh-Hamad D. Timmins K. Jalali Z. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1640-1644PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, depletion of intercellular GSH with GSH synthesis inhibitors increases the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and correlates with enhanced intracellular production of ROS (15Miyajima A. Nakashima J. Tachibana M. Nakamura K. Hayakawa M. Murai M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Miyajima A. Nakashima J. Yoshioka K. Tachibana M. Tazaki H. Murai M. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PKCδ is implicated as a critical mediator of oxidative and genotoxic stress (19Sun X. Wu F. Datta B. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKCδ activity is elevated in the diabetic patient with hyperglycemia and is believed to play a role in the development of diabetic vascular complications (22Ishii H. Koya D. King G.L. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The PKC family is currently composed of at least 10 related isozymes that have been divided into three groups based on their structure and cofactor requirements. The conventional PKC isoforms (cPKC) α, βI, βII, and γ require diacylglyerol, phosphatidylserine, and Ca2+for activity. The novel isoforms δ, ε, η, and θ require diacylglyerol and phosphatidylserine but not Ca2+ for activity, and the atypical isoforms ζ and ι require only phosphatidylserine for activity (reviewed in Refs. 23Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar, 24Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 25Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Structurally PKCδ is a 78-kDa protein that contains a C-terminal catalytic domain, two conserved regions C2 and C3 essential for activity, a substrate binding domain, and an N-terminal regulatory domain with an inhibitable pseudo-substrate domain and two cysteine-rich zinc fingers (28Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In the presence of lipid binding, the pseudo-substrate is liberated from the active site, and PKCδ autophosphorylates and becomes active. Rotterlin, which competitively blocks the ATP-binding site of PKCδ, is a specific inhibitor with an IC50 value between 3 and 6 μm (29Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Importantly, activation of PKCs has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin (30Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 31Isonishi S. Andrews P.A. Howell S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3623-3627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of PKCδ activity with rottlerin blocks caspase activation and cisplatin-induced cell death (32Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We show that MGO enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis by activating PKCδ and that PKCδ activation is critical to both cell death and survival.

Minshall C. Kelley K.W. Freund G.G. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated as indicated, and after 18 h, 0.9 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 was added to cells at 37 °C for 3 min. PI (6 μg/ml) was then added, and cells were incubated on ice for 5 min. Ten thousand cells were analyzed, and apoptotic cells were identified as those with increased Hoechst fluorescence, low forward angle light scatter, and low PI fluorescence. Flow cytometric detection of intracellular peroxide was performed as previously described (34Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). For intracellular peroxide measurements, cells were treated as indicated and then loaded with 5 μmH2DCF-DA for 3 h. Ten thousand cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and peroxide-containing cells were identified as those with increased fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence of oxidized H2DCF-DA.

Fluorescence of released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was measured at an excitation of 380 nm and an emission of 460 nm. GSH was determined as previously described (36Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2.5% sulfosalicylic acid, and total proteins were determined in clarified lysates with the Bio-Rad protein reagent. Total GSH was assayed using a version of Giffith's method (37Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) monitoring the change of absorbance at 412 nm in the presence of 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzioc acid), 0.15 mm NADPH, and 1 unit of GSH reductase/ml in a phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. GSH concentration was calculated by comparison with an internal GSH standard and expressed as nanograms of GSH equivalents/μg of protein. Western analysis was performed as previously described (38Cengel K.A. Freund G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, 15 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold 1% Triton X-100, 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris base, pH 7.4. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (250 μg/lane) under reducing conditions in 10% gels and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the indicated primary antibodies and ECL reagents followed by autoradiography and densitometry. PKCδ assays were performed as previously described (21Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated as indicated and then lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm benzamidine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Lysates were clarified, and PKCδ was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with an anti-PKCδ antibody. Immune complexes were extensively washed and kinase reactions performed at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 10 mmMgCl2, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (16.7 μCi/nmol), and 200 μg/ml H1 histone. Reactions were terminated after 5 min by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE load buffer and analyzed in 15% acrylamide gels by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry. c-Abl assays were performed by a modification of a procedure previously described (39Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Fan M.M. Sawyers C. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26457-26460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

Lysates were clarified, and c-Abl was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with an anti-c-Abl antibody. Immune complexes were extensively washed and kinase reactions performed at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μm[γ-32P]ATP (16.7 μCi/nmol), and 5 μg/ml IRS-1-(511–772). Reactions were terminated after 10 min by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE load buffer and resultant phosphoproteins resolved under reducing conditions in 15% gels. Serine and threonine phosphoamino acids were base-hydrolyzed (38Cengel K.A. Freund G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were analyzed by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. Where indicated experimental data were analyzed either by the Student's t test for comparison of means using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) or by a two- or three-factor factorial assuming unequal variances using Statistical Analysis Software (Cary, NC). ROS accumulation and GSH reduction are critical to the bioactivity of cisplatin (15Miyajima A. Nakashima J. Tachibana M. Nakamura K. Hayakawa M. Murai M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Godwin A.K. Meister A. O'Dwyer P.J. Huang C.S. Hamilton T.C. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yoshioka K. Tachibana M. Tazaki H. Murai M. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but the timing of these intracellular changes has not been fully defined. Fig.1A (left panel) demonstrates that after 18 h of cisplatin treatment a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis occurred as measured by dual staining with Hoechst and PI. At 1 μg/ml cisplatin, 11.1 ± 1.9% of cells were apoptotic. At 5, 7.5, and 15 μg/ml cisplatin, 32.1 ± 3.3, 50.7 ± 2.5, and 67.4 ± 0.5% of cells were apoptotic. Cells not treated with cisplatin were 3.7 ± 0.3% apoptotic. Fig. 1A (right panel) shows that the antioxidant NAC reduced cisplatin-dependent apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.5 mm NAC, apoptosis was decreased 12% from 68.7 ± 0.9 to 60.5 ± 4.0%. At 1, 5, 10, and 25 mm NAC, apoptosis was reduced 29, 82.4, 91, and 92%, respectively. Untreated cells were 3.7 ± 0.5% apoptotic. To examine further cisplatin-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 activation was measured during 15 μg/ml cisplatin treatment. Fig.1B (top panel) shows that after cisplatin treatment caspase-3 became activated between 6 and 9 h, and this activity peaked at 4-fold over basal at 15 h. Pretreatment of cells for 15 min with either NAC (10 mm) or the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp (50 μg/ml) blocked cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Because thiol-containing compounds like NAC can block ROS accumulation, we next looked at cisplatin-dependent intracellular ROS accumulation and GSH concentration. Fig. 1C (top panel) shows that 15 μg/ml cisplatin induced a measurable increase in intracellular peroxide between 6 and 9 h after cisplatin treatment. At 12, 15, and 18 h, cellular peroxide levels increased 2.7-, 3.2-, and 5.8-fold, respectively. Pretreatment of cells for 15 min with 10 mm NAC reduced cisplatin-dependent peroxide generation by 100% at 9 h, 89% at 12 h, 78% at 15 h, and at 93% at 18 h. Fig.1C (middle panel) demonstrates that intracellular GSH decreased along a similar time course. After 15 μg/ml cisplatin treatment, the first detectable loss of intracellular GSH occurred between 6 and 9 h and by 18 h GSH was reduced by 8-fold. When cells were pretreated with 10 mm NAC for 15 min, GSH reduction induced by cisplatin was completely blocked, but basal intracellular GSH levels were not significantly affected. Fig.1C (bottom panel) shows that NAC pretreatment did not interfere with the early cisplatin-signaling event of increasing p53 mass between 0 and 6 h. Taken together, these findings indicate the following: 1) that cisplatin induces an NAC-inhibitable accumulation of ROS and GSH loss between 6 and 9 h after cisplatin treatment, 2) that blockage of ROS accumulation prevents cisplatin-dependent caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, and 3) that certain early events likely related to DNA damage as in p53 accumulation are unaffected by NAC and its impact on ROS and GSH. MGO is a cytotoxic glucose metabolite (1Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R.

Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). To determine whether MGO increased cisplatin cytotoxicity, apoptosis was examined by dual staining with Hoechst and PI. Fig.2A demonstrates that when cells were treated with 3 μg/ml cisplatin for 18 h apoptosis increased from 1.17 ± 0.23 to 18.72 ± 3.6%. When cells were treated concurrently with 5 or 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin, apoptosis increased to 35.14 ± 6.6 and 46.7 ± 6.46%, respectively. By itself, the apoptosis induced by 5 and 10 μm MGO was 1.31 ± 0.29 and 5.2 ± 2.3%, respectively. Importantly, the apoptosis induced by MGO + cisplatin (18.72 ± 3.6 to 35.14 ± 6.6% and 18.72 ± 3.6 to 46.7 ± 6.46% for 5 and 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin, respectively) was significantly different at α = 0.05 than the additive affects expected (1.31 ± 0.29 + 18.72 ± 3.6%, for 5 μm MGO + cisplatin and 5.2 ± 2.3 + 18.72 ± 3.6% for 10 μm MGO + cisplatin). Because oxidative stress and GSH play a critical role in the bioactivities of both MGO and cisplatin, the next step was to investigate the combined impact of MGO + cisplatin on these pathways. Fig. 2B shows that pretreatment of cells for 15 min with 10 mm NAC completely blocked apoptosis induced by 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin. Fig. 2C (left panel) demonstrates that 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin increased intracellular peroxides by 4-fold at 15 h when compared with cisplatin or MGO alone. Fig. 2C (right panel) shows that 10 mm NAC pretreatment completely inhibited ROS accumulation at 15 h induced by either 3 μg/ml cisplatin, 10 μm MGO, or 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin in combination. Taken together, these findings indicate that MGO and cisplatin work in synergy to induce apoptosis by increasing intracellular ROS generation. Inhibition of PKCδ activity with rottlerin has been shown to block cisplatin-dependent apoptosis (32Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCδ was required for MGO/cisplatin-dependent cytotoxicity, flow cytometry was performed. Fig. 3Ademonstrates that pretreatment of cells with 5 μmrottlerin for 15 min completely blocked apoptosis induced by 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin. Fig. 3B shows that pretreatment with rottlerin also completely blocked ROS formation induced by 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin treatment. As an additional control, 5 μm rottlerin was also examined for its ability to block apoptosis and ROS generation induced by 15 μg/ml cisplatin which it did (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was critical to MGO + cisplatin-dependent cytotoxicity, apoptosis assays were performed using cells pretreated with 25 μm of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. As Fig. 3C demonstrates, MEK inhibition did not block apoptosis induced by MGO + cisplatin but instead enhanced it by 40%. Taken together these results indicate that cytotoxicity induced by MGO + cisplatin requires the activity of PKCδ but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. PKCδ has been shown to be important in the response of cells to oxidative and/or genotoxic stress (20Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

Fig. 4A (top panel) demonstrates that treatment of cells with 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin leads to a 4-fold increase in PKCδ activity at 60 min as measured by the ability of PKCδ to phosphorylate H1 histone. Western analysis of PKCδ immunoprecipitates (middle panel) showed that PKCδ autophosphorylation of serine 660 peaked between 60 and 90 min. Importantly, PKCδ mass was unaffected by MGO + cisplatin treatment (bottom panel). Fig.4B demonstrates that as expected pretreatment of cells with 5 μm rottlerin for 15 min blocked 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin-induced PKCδ autophosphorylation. Rottlerin, however, did not block all actions of MGO + cisplatin leaving unaffected the increase in p21Cip mass induced by 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin as measured by Western analysis between 0 and 3 h (Fig. 4C). Finally, Fig.4D demonstrates that pretreatment of cells for 15 min with 10 mm NAC did not alter peak PKCδ kinase activity induced by MGO + cisplatin. At 60 min, 10 μm MGO increased PKCδ activity 25%, 3 μg/ml cisplatin increased PKCδ activity 2-fold, and 10 μm MGO + 3 μg/ml cisplatin increased PKCδ activity 4-fold. NAC pretreatment did not block this 4-fold effect. Taken together these results indicate that the activation of PKCδ induced by MGO + cisplatin is an early signal transduction event with peak activation occurring within 60 min of MGO + cisplatin addition to cells. In addition, this activation event is not"

The epidermis is an active site of cholesterol synthesis, but inhibition of epidermal cholesterol synthesis with topically applied statins only modestly affects epidermal permeability barrier function, suggesting a possible compensatory role for extraepidermal cholesterol. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is a recently described cell surface receptor for high density lipoproteins (HDL) that mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from circulating HDL. In the present study, we demonstrate that SR-BI is present in cultured human keratinocytes and that calcium-induced differentiation markedly decreases SR-BI levels. Additionally, the cell association of [3H]cholesterol-labeled HDL decreased in differentiated versus undifferentiated keratinocytes. Furthermore, the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with simvastatin resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in both SR-BI mRNA and protein levels, whereas conversely, addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol suppressed SR-BI levels by approximately 50%. SR-BI mRNA is also expressed in murine epidermis, increasing by 50% in parallel with cholesterol requirements following acute barrier disruption. Because the increase is completely blocked by occlusion with a vapor-impermeable membrane, changes in epidermal SR-BI expression are regulated specifically by barrier requirements. Lastly, using immunofluorescence we demonstrated that SR-BI is present in human epidermis predominantly in the basal layer and increases following barrier disruption. In summary, the present study demonstrates first that SR-BI is expressed in keratinocytes and regulated by cellular cholesterol requirements, suggesting that it plays a role in keratinocyte cholesterol homeostasis. Second, the increase in SR-BI following barrier disruption suggests that SR-BI expression increases to facilitate cholesterol uptake leading to barrier restoration.

Extracellular lamellar membranes in the stratum corneum that contain primarily ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol provide this permeability barrier (1Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These lipid lamellar membranes are delivered to the stratum corneum via the secretion of lamellar body contents from highly differentiated keratinocytes in the outermost stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis (1Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the formation and the secretion of lamellar bodies are regulated specifically by barrier requirements; disruption of the permeability barrier results in: (a) rapid delivery of profound lamellar body contents to the stratum corneum-stratum granulosum interface (2Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 279-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), followed by (b) the accelerated formation and secretion of nascent lamellar bodies (2Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 279-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The specific link to the barrier is shown by the fact that artificial barrier restoration by occlusion with an impermeable membrane prevents both the formation and secretion of nascent lamellar bodies (2Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 279-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The formation of lamellar bodies requires the generation of abundant lipid precursors; accordingly, inhibition of cholesterol, ceramide, or fatty acid synthesis inhibits lamellar body formation and secretion (3Feingold K.R.

Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Brown B.E. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Feingold K.R. Brown B.E. Lear S.R. Moser A.H. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 588-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yet disruption of the permeability barrier results in a further increase in epidermal cholesterol synthesis (8Feingold K.R. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Systems. 1991; 8: 193-210PubMed Google Scholar, 9Proksch E. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is accompanied by increases in the activities, protein, and mRNA levels of 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA)1 reductase (9Proksch E.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1307-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the expression of other key enzymes in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, including HMG-CoA synthase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and squalene synthase, also increase with permeability barrier disruption (11Harris I.R. Farrell A.M. Grunfeld C. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J Invest Dermatol. 1997; 109: 783-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Occlusion with a vapor-impermeable membrane prevents the increase in cholesterol synthesis following barrier disruption (6Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Brown B.E. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Feingold K.R. Brown B.E. Lear S.R. Moser A.H. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 588-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), indicating that changes in transepidermal water movement regulate epidermal cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, topical applications of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors block epidermal cholesterol synthesis and delay barrier recovery following barrier disruption (3Feingold K.R. Man M.Q. Menon G.K. Cho S.S. Brown B.E. Elias P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Mao-Qiang M. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 185-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that epidermal cholesterol synthesis is critical for normal cutaneous permeability barrier homeostasis. Yet despite a marked inhibition of epidermal cholesterol synthesis, some lamellar bodies continue to be formed, and recovery of permeability barrier function proceeds in the face of inhibitor blockade, albeit at a modestly delayed rate (3Feingold K.R. Man M.Q. Menon G.K. Cho S.S. Brown B.E. Elias P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cholesterol could be delivered to the epidermis from extracutaneous sites following barrier disruption, providing lipid precursors and allowing replenishment of lamellar bodies leading to barrier recovery. Lipid uptake into cells is mediated by receptors on the plasma membrane. The LDL receptor, which is capable of binding lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein E, is present on keratinocytes (13Ponec M. te Pas M.F. Havekes L. Boonstra J. Mommaas A.M. Vermeer B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 50S-56SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Williams M.L. Mommaas-Kienhuis A.M. Rutherford S.L. Grayson S. Vermeer B.J. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 428-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but LDL receptor density declines above the basal layer (13Ponec M. te Pas M.F. Havekes L. Boonstra J. Mommaas A.M. Vermeer B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 50S-56SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Mommaas-Kienhuis A.M. Grayson S. Wijsman M.C. Vermeer B.J. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 513-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the LDL receptor is positioned to be involved in the uptake of LDL from the circulation into epidermis. Because LDL receptor protein and mRNA levels increase following barrier disruption (10Jackson S.M. Wood L.C. Lauer S. Taylor J.M. Cooper A.D. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1307-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that LDL receptor-mediated lipid uptake plays a role in permeability barrier homeostasis. Recently, the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) receptor was identified and shown to mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol from lipoprotein particles by a mechanism that requires neither endocytosis nor degradation of the entire particle (16Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). SR-BI is abundantly expressed both in the liver and in steroidogenic tissues that require cholesterol for synthetic processes (17Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 20Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the adrenal gland and ovary, SR-BI expression is up-regulated when the requirements for cholesterol for steroid synthesis increase (20Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Sun Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1799-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, SR-BI receptor knockout mice demonstrate a marked decrease in adrenal cholesterol stores (23Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), further demonstrating the importance of this receptor as a pathway for cholesterol uptake. Thus, SR-BI is a key lipoprotein receptor of cholesterol homeostasis in certain tissues. Because of the requirement for large amounts of cholesterol by the epidermis for the formation of lamellar bodies and the cutaneous permeability barrier, we hypothesized that keratinocytes would express SR-BI. In the present study, we demonstrate that: (a) SR-BI is present in cultured human keratinocytes and in both murine and human epidermis, where it localizes mostly to the basal layer, (b) SR-BI expression decreases with keratinocyte differentiation and cholesterol excess but increases with sterol depletion, and (c) barrier disruption up-regulates SR-BI expression in a manner that is blocked by artificial barrier restoration. Together, these results suggest that SR-BI may be important for the restoration of extracellular cholesterol needed to maintain permeability barrier homeostasis. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 μCi/ml) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). The Multiprime DNA labeling system was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. SR-BI cDNA probe was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from the mouse liver (oligonucleotide primers: upper, 5′-ATGCAGGTCCATGAAGCTGAC-3′, and lower, 5′-CTATAGCTTGGCTTCTTGCAGC-3′). 25-OH cholesterol and simvastatin were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), respectively. Human foreskin keratinocytes, second passage, were maintained in 0.07 mm Ca2+keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; Clonetics, San Diego, CA). To determine the effect of differentiation, culture media were changed to KGM containing either 0.03 or 1.2 mm Ca2+ when the cells reached 80% confluence. These cells were maintained for 7 days changing the media once every 2 days. In some experiments, human foreskin keratinocytes, second passage, were grown to 80–90% confluence in 0.07 mm Ca2+ KGM. The cells were then treated with 25-OH cholesterol (12.5 μm), simvastatin (10 μm), or vehicle (ethanol) for 24 h for Northern blot and 48 h for Western blot analysis. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated as described previously (24Harris I.R. Farrell A.M. Holleran W.M. Jackson S. Grunfeld C. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 412-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human keratinocytes were lysed in 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 200 μg of proteinase K/ml. After the incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the oligo(dT)-cellulose was washed, the poly(A)+ RNA was eluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and precipitated with ethanol. Male hairless mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), 8–10 weeks old, were treated either with sequential applications of cellophane tape or with acetone until the transepidermal water loss reached 6–10 mg/cm2/h measured with an electrolytic moisture analyzer (Meeco, Inc., Warrington, PA) as described previously (6Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Brown B.E. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Occlusion was performed by wrapping mice with one finger of a Latex glove immediately after barrier disruption as described previously (25Wood L.C. Elias P.M. Sequeira-Martin S.M. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 834-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To separate whole epidermis, the skin was incubated in 10 mm EDTA in calcium and magnesium-free PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C. The epidermis was then scraped off the dermis with a scalpel. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described previously (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified, and poly(A)+ was isolated with oligo(dT)-cellulose and precipitated with ethanol as described above. The concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically. Equal amounts of poly(A)+ (8–10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. The RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) after electrophoresis. [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes were prepared by the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) following the instructions. Blots were prehybridized with ULTRAhybTM(Ambion, Austin, TX) for 1 h, followed by hybridization with32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the blots were washed with a solution of 0.2% SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a 15-min wash at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −70 °C. The relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry GS 710 (Bio-Rad). The blots were probed with either β-actin or cyclophilin to normalize data. Cultured keratinocytes were homogenized by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and then the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was rehomogenized in the same buffer as above plus 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Protein levels were determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein were electrophoresed on 8.5% polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal anti-SR-BI antibody (1:1000; Novus Biochemicals Inc., Littleton, CO) was used to determine SR-BI protein levels, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry GS 710 (Bio-Rad). Cholesterol synthesis was determined as described previously (27Williams M.L. Rutherford S.L. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 955-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human keratinocytes were grown in 0.07 mm calcium KGM to 90% confluence and then treated with either ethanol or 10 μm simvastatin for 24 h. [14C]Acetate (20 μCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and 1 mm cold acetate (Sigma) were added to the cultured keratinocytes for the last 3 h before harvest. The lipids were extracted with petroleum ether after saponification and separated by thin layer chromatography. The band corresponding to standard cholesterol was scraped from the plate, and the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol was determined as amount of cholesterol synthesis. The values were normalized by protein amount and expressed as percentages of control. Cultured human keratinocytes maintained either in low calcium (0.03 mm) or high calcium (1.2 mm) KGM for 7 days were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation with blocking buffer (0.1% fish gelatin, 0.8% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 80 in PBS), the slides were treated with polyclonal anti-SR-BI antibody (1:200; Novus Biochemicals Inc.) overnight at 4 °C, followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig G antibody (1:200; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Counterstaining for nuclei was carried out with propidium iodide (Sigma). After washing, the coverslips were mounted, and the samples were viewed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany). Punch biopsies were taken from the forearms of a healthy volunteer. The basal transepidermal water loss was measured with a Tewameter TM210 (Courage + Khazaka, Köln, Germany) on both arms, and then one arm was tape stripped until an ∼8-fold increase in transepidermal water loss. The equivalent site on the other arm served as a basal state. Transepidermal water loss was measured again 3 h after tape stripping, and biopsies were carried out. Frozen sections were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min at −20 °C and processed as follows. After 1 h of incubation with blocking buffer (0.1% fish gelatin, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 80 in PBS), the slides were treated with purified polyclonal anti-SR-BI antibody (1:100; Novus Biochemicals) overnight at 4 °C, followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were counterstained with propidium iodide (Sigma). After washing, the coverslips were mounted, and the samples were viewed using a confocal microscope. The sections, when the anti-SR-BI antibody was omitted, served as a negative control. Human high density lipoprotein subfraction 3 was isolated from the fresh plasma of a healthy volunteer by density gradient ultracentrifugation method as described by Redgraveet al. (28Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Isolated HDL (see Fig. 4A) was dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA-PBS, and then HDL was labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleolyl ether (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as follows. Purified HDL (1.5 mg of protein) was mixed with [3H]cholesteryl oleolyl ether (100 μCi) and lipoprotein-deficient plasma on a glass microfiber in a scintillation vial. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h shaking gently. Radiolabeled HDL was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA-PBS (specific activity, 7.5 × 104 dpm/μg CE was obtained). The content of total cholesterol and free cholesterol was measured by a cholesterol CII kit (Wako Chemicals) and a free cholesterol C kit (Wako Chemicals), respectively. The protein levels were determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 50 μg/ml protein of labeled HDL in the presence or absence of a 25-fold excess of unlabeled HDL was added to keratinocytes cultured in either 0.03 or 1.2 mmCa2+ KGM for 7 days. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (pH 7.4) and a fourth time with PBS alone. The cells were lysed in PBS by sonication, and the cell association of HDL was determined by counting tritium radioactivity in the cell homogenate. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. We first assessed whether SR-BI is present in keratinocytes and regulated by changes in extracellular calcium. As shown in Fig.1, a single band corresponding to SR-BI mRNA is detected by Northern blotting of mRNA from cultured human keratinocytes, grown under proliferative conditions (0.03 mm calcium). The transcript size of SR-BI mRNA under these conditions is similar to that reported in other human tissues (∼2.8 kb) (21Cao G. Garcia C.K. Wyne K.L. Schultz R.A. Parker K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that cultured human keratinocytes remain in a proliferative state when grown in low calcium (0.03–0.07 mm), whereas exposure to higher calcium concentrations (>0.1 mm) inhibits proliferation inducing several keratinocyte-specific differentiation-linked proteins (29Dlugosz A.A.

Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1809-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, exposure to high calcium (1.2 mm) leads to a decrease in SR-BI mRNA levels (∼70%) (Fig. 1). To determine whether the calcium-induced decrease in SR-BI mRNA levels leads to a reduction in SR-BI protein levels, we next quantitated SR-BI protein levels in Western blots from human keratinocytes grown in either 0.03 or 1.2 mm calcium for 7 days. As shown in Fig. 2, a band was detected at ∼80 kDa, which is similar to the molecular mass of SR-BI protein reported in other human tissues (21Cao G. Garcia C.K. Wyne K.L. Schultz R.A. Parker K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, as observed with mRNA measurement, SR-BI protein levels declined significantly in 1.2 mm calcium (∼70%). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis visualized a strong green signal for SR-BI that was localized to the plasma membrane of keratinocytes grown in low calcium, whereas almost no green signal was observed in high calcium (Figs. 3, A and B versus C and D). These results demonstrate first that SR-BI is present in human keratinocytes and second that keratinocyte SR-BI expression decreases in response to calcium-induced differentiation.Figure 3Immunofluorescence staining for SR-BI. Human keratinocytes were incubated either in low calcium (0.03 mm) or high calcium (1.2 mm) KGM for 7 days, and then immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Confocal microscopy visualized a strong green signal for SR-BI localized to the plasma membrane of undifferentiated keratinocytes (A and B). In contrast, almost no green signal was observed in differentiated keratinocytes (C and D). Strong red signals show nuclei revealed by propidium iodide. In C and D the red staining is primarily in the nuclei, but because of the strong intensity of the staining there is some spillover into the cytoplasm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from HDL (17Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). As described above, SR-BI is present in cultured human keratinocytes, and both mRNA and protein levels for this receptor decline with calcium-induced differentiation. To determine whether the calcium-induced decrease in SR-BI alters the cell association of HDL cholesteryl esters by keratinocytes, we next compared [3H]CE-HDL cell association by human keratinocytes grown in either 0.03 or 1.2 mm calcium for 7 days. Keratinocytes were incubated with 50 μg protein/ml of [3H]CE-HDL in the presence or absence of a 25-fold excess of unlabeled HDL for 3 h, and tritium counts in the cell homogenate were measured. Cell association of [3H]CE-HDL significantly declined in high calcium-treated keratinocytes (Fig.4B), indicating that calcium-induced changes in expression of SR-BI induce parallel changes in cell association of HDL cholesterol. Previous studies in rodent adrenal gland and ovary have shown that decreases in cellular cholesterol levels stimulate SR-BI expression (20Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1799-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether changes in keratinocyte sterol levels also regulate SR-BI expression, we first examined the effects of cellular cholesterol depletion on SR-BI mRNA and protein levels. Human keratinocytes exposed to 10 μm simvastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, displayed a 3-fold increase in SR-BI mRNA levels (Fig. 5) and a 4-fold increase in SR-BI protein levels (Fig.6), in parallel with more than 90% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis compared with control (control (100 ± 6.7%) versus simvastatin (2.1 ± 0.7%)n = 4, p < 0.001). In contrast, when cellular sterol levels were increased by exposing keratinocytes to 12.5 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol, SR-BI mRNA and protein levels declined significantly (∼50%; Figs. 5 and 6). These results indicate that cellular sterol levels regulate SR-BI expression in cultured human keratinocytes.Figure 6Sterols regulate SR-BI protein levels in cultured human keratinocytes. Human keratinocytes were grown in 0.07 mm calcium KGM to 90% confluence and then treated with either 12.5 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol or 10 μm simvastatin for 48 h. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were applied to each lane, and Western blots were carried out using anti-SR-BI antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative blot is shown here.

Depletion of nutrients results in cellular stress, which evokes adaptive and protective responses, one of which is the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a 32-kDa endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in heme degradation. Incubation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells in glucose-free medium resulted in an increased HO-1 mRNA content, reaching a maximum of ∼25-fold over control cells after 12 h. The glucose-dependent induction of HO-1 mRNA was concentration-dependent (k½ ∼0.5 mm) and was attenuated by fructose, galactose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose, but not by the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 3-O-methylglucose. Tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or azetidine 2-carboxylate, each of which activates the unfolded protein response pathway, did not induce HO-1 mRNA expression, whereas glucose-regulated protein 78 mRNA was increased. These results demonstrate that glucose availability regulates transcription of the HO-1 gene via a pathway that is different from the unfolded protein response. The induction of HO-1 may serve as a protective response in hypoglycemic circumstances and underscores the importance of understanding nutrient control of the HO-1 gene.

Starvation for amino acids is known to activate many genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and other cellular processes (2Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Additionally, a decrease in cellular carbohydrate levels causes the transcriptional regulation of a number of genes that encode proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (1Clarke S.D. Abraham S. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3146-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), for example, the glucose-regulated proteins (GRP)1 78 and 94 and the transcription factor GADD153/CHOP (for growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene, C/EBP-homologous protein; reviewed in Ref. 3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Collectively, the changes following glucose starvation are the result of a cellular recognition of abnormal protein accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), called the unfolded protein response (UPR) in yeast, also known as the ER stress response in mammalian cells (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The transcription of this same set of genes can be increased by treatment of cells with other agents that cause ER stress, the glycoprotein biosynthesis inhibitor tunicamycin (4Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), the calcium ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (5Wooden S.K. Li L.J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell.

Kim K.S. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cellular heme derived from ubiquitously disposed heme-containing proteins, such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes, peroxidases, catalase, nitric-oxide synthases, and respiratory burst enzymes, is degraded by the heme oxygenase enzyme (7Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar, 8Platt J.L. Nath K.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1364-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Agarwal A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 965-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of O2 and NADPH, the heme oxygenase enzyme opens the heme ring liberating equimolar quantities of biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). Three isoforms of heme oxygenase, HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3, have been characterized. HO-1 and HO-2 are known to share ∼43% amino acid homology (10Kutty R.K. Kutty G. Rodriguez I.R. Chader G.J. Wiggert B. Genomics. 1994; 20: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and HO-3 shares ∼90% amino acid homology with HO-2 and exhibits only low enzyme activity (11McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). HO-1 is inducible and ubiquitously distributed in mammalian tissues, and HO-2 is constitutively expressed in several tissues (7Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar, 8Platt J.L. Nath K.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1364-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Agarwal A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 965-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that HO-2 may function as a physiologic regulator of cellular function, whereas HO-1 plays a role in modulating tissue responses to injury in pathophysiologic states (12Wagener F.A. da Silva J.L. Farley T. de Witte T. Kappas A. Abraham N.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 416-423PubMed Google Scholar). HO-1 is induced by heme products and a wide variety of non-heme stimuli, which include hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet A radiation, heavy metals, endotoxin, cytokines, growth factors, oxidized low density lipoprotein, and others (9Agarwal A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 965-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of HO-1 is thought to be a beneficial response that offers cytoprotection to cells/tissue against oxidant stress (13Stocker R. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of glucose availability on the expression of HO-1. We observed that glucose deprivation, over a physiological range of concentrations, resulted in a significant induction of HO-1 mRNA content in HepG2 human hepatoma cells. Induction of HO-1 by glucose deprivation was reversed by the presence of specific sugars including 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG), but not by the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG). Activation of the UPR pathway by tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or Aze caused significant up-regulation of GRP78 mRNA, but did not induce HO-1. Removal of glutamine from the medium blocked the induction of HO-1 by glucose deprivation, suggesting that the generation of reactive oxygen species via intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle may result in HO-1 induction. These results demonstrate that glucose availability regulates expression of HO-1 and that glucose deprivation can activate transcription via a pathway that is different from the UPR. We speculate that the induction of HO-1 may serve as a protective response in circumstances wherein cells are deprived of glycolytic substrates, such as glucose, and underscores the importance of further studies to understand the nutrient control of the HO-1 gene. Tissue culture media, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and media supplements were obtained from Invitrogen and Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Tunicamycin, Aze, 2-DOG, 3-OMG, fructose, mannose, and galactose were purchased from Sigma. Thapsigargin was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-HO-1 antibody (SPA-895) was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The anti-GRP78 antibody and cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Susan Frost (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM), pH 7.4, supplemented with NaHCO3 (25 mm), glutamine (4 mm), streptomycin sulfate (10 μg/ml), penicillin G (100 μg/ml), gentamicin (28.4 μg/ml),N-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (0.23 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.2%), and FBS (10%). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide in T-75 flasks. To induce expression of the HO-1 gene, cells were transferred to either 60- or 100-mm dishes, cultured to near 80% confluence, rinsed two times with PBS, and then incubated in complete MEM or glucose-free MEM, pH 7.4, each supplemented with NaHCO3 (25 mm), glutamine (4 mm), streptomycin sulfate (10 μg/ml), penicillin G (100 μg/ml), gentamicin (28.4 μg/ml),N-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (0.23 μg/ml), and 10% dialyzed FBS. When cells were incubated with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, Aze, 2-DOG, fructose, mannose, galactose, or actinomycin D, they were pretreated for 30 min prior to the addition of complete MEM or glucose-free MEM. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells grown in 60-mm plates using the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and purified using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA (15–20 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, electrotransferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 1.0-kb human HO-1 cDNA probe (16Agarwal A. Shiraishi F. Visner G.A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for GRP78 was a 1498-bp sequence between the PstI and EcoRI sites (17Lee A.S. Delegeane A. Scharff D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4922-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for the ribosomal protein L7a was a 600-bp sequence between two PstI sites that covered a portion of the coding and untranslated regions within the 3′ half of the full-length cDNA. The cDNA probe for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was a 983-bp fragment generated by reverse transcription-PCR using primers from CLONTECHlaboratories (Palo Alto, CA). The nylon membranes were stripped and rehybridized with a human L7a cDNA probe or a human GAPDH cDNA probe to control for RNA loading. All experiments were repeated with at least two or three additional independent RNA preparations to show reproducibility. To quantitate expression levels, autoradiographs were scanned on a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet 4C using Deskscan II software and densitometry was performed using NIH Image 1.60 software. Experiments were adjusted for loading using L7a or GAPDH mRNA quantification, then normalized and expressed as arbitrary units. For HO-1 immunoblots, cells were treated with stimulus at the concentrations and times indicated in each figure legend. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of aprotinin (10 μg/ml), EDTA (5 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration of lysates was assessed by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Samples were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-HO-1 antibody, followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. Membranes were also probed with an anti-GRP78 antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for 1.5 h, followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Labeled protein bands were revealed using a chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Pierce). A ∼4.5-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the human HO-1 gene, extending from −4.5 kb to +80 bp, was generated by long range PCR performed on human genomic DNA using rTth DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 4.5-kb PCR product was ligated into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and verified by restriction analysis and sequencing (16Agarwal A. Shiraishi F. Visner G.A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BamHI sites were incorporated in the primers to enable subcloning into the BglII site of the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). This promoter-reporter gene construct (pGL3/−4.5) was used for transient expression studies in HepG2 cells grown to ∼75% confluence. A plasmid containingRenilla luciferase (Promega) was used as a control for transfections. A ratio of 6 μg of DNA (4 μg of −4.5 kb HO-1 and 2 μg of Renilla luciferase) per 36 μl of SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) per 6.6 × 106 cells/100-mm dish was constant in each transfection. The cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated with the transfection mixture for 3 h at 37 °C in 5.0 ml of MEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. After transfection, cells were washed once with PBS, fresh culture medium was added, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The 100-mm dishes of HepG2 cells were then split into 12-well plates, and the next day the cells were incubated in either glucose-containing or glucose-free MEM for 16 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega). DNA fragmentation was performed as a measure of cell injury. HepG2 cells incubated with complete MEM, MEM lacking glucose, or MEM lacking glucose and glutamine for 0, 12, and 24 h in 100-mm plates were collected by scraping and centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 5 min at room temperature. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), followed by the addition of 900 μl of lysis buffer (TE plus 0.5% Triton X-100), and then incubation on ice for 15 min. The samples were subjected to centrifugation for 10 min and supernatants treated with 50 μg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteinase K (100 μg/ml) and 0.5% SDS were added and allowed to incubate for 2 h at 50 °C. Fragmented DNA was extracted using equal volumes of phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The nucleic acid pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of TE and subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test or ANOVA and the Student-Newman-Keuls test. All results are considered significant at p < 0.05. HO-1 gene expression is responsive to a wide variety of stress-related stimuli (8Platt J.L. Nath K.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1364-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Agarwal A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 965-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the ER stress response induced by glucose deprivation (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 4Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to test the effect of this nutritional stress on HO-1 expression. HepG2 cells were incubated in MEM in the presence or absence of 5.5 mm glucose for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h (Fig. 1A) or 0, 4, 12, 18, and 24 h (Fig. 1B) before isolation of RNA for Northern analysis. Glucose deprivation-induced HO-1 mRNA content was detectable at 12 h (∼25-fold) and remained elevated at 18 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 1C). The blots were reprobed with cDNA probes for GRP78 (as a positive control) and the ribosomal protein L7a (as a negative control). The GRP78 mRNA content was also increased following glucose deprivation (Fig. 1), consistent with previous studies on induction of GRP78 mRNA in HepG2 cells (18Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data illustrate the responsiveness of HO-1 expression to glucose availability, and the lack of a change in L7a mRNA level illustrates that the increased content of HO-1 and GRP78 mRNA was a specific response. To establish whether or not the HO-1 protein content was also increased following glucose deprivation, HepG2 cells were incubated in MEM in the presence or absence of 5.5 mm glucose for 12, 16, 20, or 24 h (Fig.2). Cells incubated for 20 or 24 h in the absence of glucose had a significant increase in the amount of HO-1 protein. The data clearly show that the increased HO-1 mRNA following glucose deprivation is translated into protein and, as expected, the increase in protein temporally lagged behind that of the mRNA, In contrast to HO-1, immunoblot analysis for GRP78 showed accumulation as early as 12 h, reaching a maximal level by 24 h (Fig. 2). To determine the glucose concentration range over which the HO-1 mRNA content was altered, HepG2 cells were incubated for 12 h in MEM containing 0.001–15 mmglucose (Fig. 3). Between 0.5 and 5 mm, the HO-1 mRNA content was inversely proportional to glucose concentration. The HO-1 mRNA content was slightly more suppressed than GRP78 at glucose concentrations of 1 mm or more. The k½ (concentration causing a half-maximal response) of glucose-dependent repression of HO-1 mRNA was ∼0.5 mm, whereas that of GRP78 mRNA was 1 mm. Whether or not mammalian cells use specific sugar molecules to detect the availability of carbohydrate has not been confirmed conclusively. Data have been reported that phosphorylated glucose intermediates, such as glucose 6-phosphate, or metabolites within the pentose phosphate pathway are putative candidates for genes activated by the presence of carbohydrate (19Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To investigate the responsiveness of the HO-1 gene to the presence of specific carbohydrates, HepG2 cells were incubated for 12 h in MEM lacking glucose or MEM supplemented with specific metabolites (Fig.4). As expected from the previous results, HO-1 mRNA content was increased by complete glucose deprivation. The presence of 5.5 mm glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, or 2-DOG prevented an increase in the HO-1 mRNA content. In contrast, including the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 3-OMG, did not block induction of the HO-1 mRNA content (Fig. 4). The changes in HO-1 mRNA paralleled changes in GRP78 expression, with the exception of 2-DOG, which failed to repress glucose deprivation-mediated GRP78 mRNA induction. These results eliminate free glucose or osmotic changes as the sensor for carbohydrate availability. Furthermore, the 2-DOG sensitivity reveals a striking difference between HO-1 and GRP78 regulation. To determine whether changes in HO-1 mRNA content in response to glucose deprivation involved transcriptional control of the gene, a 4.5-kb human HO-1 proximal promoter fragment was evaluated in transient transfection experiments. We have reported previously that this fragment mediates increased transcription in response to heme and cadmium, known inducers of the HO-1 gene (16Agarwal A. Shiraishi F. Visner G.A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This HO-1 promoter fragment demonstrated a significant increase (∼1.7-fold) in transcriptional activity, as measured by luciferase expression (Fig.5A), suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms contribute, at least in part, to glucose deprivation-mediated HO-1 mRNA induction. Interestingly, the degree of luciferase reporter gene expression did not recapitulate the level of HO-1 induction seen at the Northern level, suggesting that additional sequences outside of the 4.5-kb promoter region or mRNA stability may be required for complete transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene in response to glucose deprivation. To test for a possible role of mRNA stability in the induction of HO-1 mRNA following stimulation with glucose-free MEM, the half-life of HO-1 mRNA in HepG2 cells was measured. Confluent HepG2 cells were exposed to glucose-free MEM for 12 h, and then placed in complete MEM or glucose-free MEM both containing actinomycin D (4 μm) (Fig. 5B). Total cellular RNA was collected at the indicated time points and Northern analysis performed. In the absence of de novo RNA synthesis, the half-life of HO-1 mRNA was ∼4 h and did not increase but, in fact, was somewhat shorter following additional glucose deprivation. These results indicate that increased mRNA stability is not responsible for the induction of HO-1 mRNA by glucose deprivation. The UPR pathway controls the transcription of several glucose-regulated genes (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 4Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Given the increase in HO-1 mRNA in response to glucose deprivation, the UPR pathway was a candidate for the mechanism by which this process was mediated. To test whether or not the HO-1 gene responds to other recognized activators of the UPR pathway, HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), thapsigargin (300 nm), or Aze (5 mm). When cells were incubated in complete MEM containing these UPR activators, HO-1 mRNA was not induced, whereas significant induction of GRP78 was observed (Fig. 6, A–C). These results document that activation of the UPR pathway does not lead to induction of the HO-1 gene; thus, a previously unidentified signal transduction pathway is triggered following glucose deprivation in HepG2 cells. Although most cells in culture are highly glycolytic, following removal of glucose from the culture medium, cells are dependent on energy via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. As a result, amino acids, such as glutamine, serve as the primary substrates for ATP synthesis via oxidation by the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Indeed, glutamine is usually included in tissue culture media at 2–4 mm as a primary fuel. To determine the role of oxidation of carbon skeletons via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, HO-1 mRNA content was measured in HepG2 cells incubated for 12 h in glucose-free MEM containing 4 mm glutamine or glucose- and glutamine-free MEM. The induction of HO-1 mRNA by glucose deprivation was completely attenuated by the simultaneous removal of glutamine from the medium, whereas GRP78 mRNA was only partially blocked (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, the induction of HO-1 by glucose deprivation requires a concentration of at least 4.0 mm glutamine, whereas enhanced GRP78 expression was not affected until the concentration of glutamine was reduced to 0.1 mm or lower, at which expression was decreased by ∼35%. To demonstrate that incubation of HepG2 cells with MEM lacking either glucose alone or glucose and glutamine did not result in cell damage, we performed DNA fragmentation studies as well as observed the cells by phase contrast microscopy. Neither DNA fragmentation (Fig.7C) nor evidence of cell injury (cell rounding, detachment, vacuolization) was observed in cells incubated with glucose-free MEM for up to 24 h and up to 12 h in cells incubated in MEM lacking both glucose and glutamine. These data demonstrate that glucose deprivation-mediated HO-1 induction is dependent on glutamine and that these changes in gene expression are not because of nonspecific effects of cell injury per se. The present data demonstrate that glucose deprivation induces expression of HO-1, a critical enzyme in heme metabolism that exhibits antioxidant and cytoprotective effects. The second novel contribution is that the pathway by which this activation occurs is different from the UPR pathway, the only previously recognized mechanism for transcriptional activation by glucose deprivation. The third important observation is that the glucose deprivation-mediated HO-1 induction involves a glutamine-dependent mechanism. The beneficial effects of heme oxygenase activity are a consequence of its robust induction as an adaptive response in cells/tissues exposed to a wide variety of injurious stimuli. These include excess heme, ultraviolet radiation, hydrogen peroxide, cytokines, endotoxin, growth factors, heavy metals, oxidized low density lipoprotein, shear stress, hyperoxia, nitric oxide (NO), and NO donors: all stimuli imposing a significant shift in cellular redox (8Platt J.L. Nath K.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1364-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Agarwal A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 965-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The responsiveness of HO-1 mRNA content to glucose concentration qualitatively paralleled that of GRP78, but HO-1 appeared to be slightly more responsive to glucose. The observation that the extracellular glucose concentration must be below 1 mm for significant gene induction is consistent with previous studies with GRP78 and asparagine synthetase expression (18Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the rapid metabolism of glucose within the cell, the intracellular level of glucose will be substantially less. Furthermore, the lack of repression by 3-OMG indicates that the concentration of a metabolite, rather than free glucose, will be the critical factor. However, our studies demonstrate that cells do respond to extracellular fluctuations in glucose concentrations with extensive adaptive responses, such as induction of the UPR pathway and the HO-1 pathway, suggesting that this is a physiological response. The contribution of mRNA stability in the induction of HO-1 mRNA by glucose deprivation was analyzed, and the data documented that the estimated half-life was not increased by glucose starvation (indeed, it was slightly shortened). Therefore, mRNA stability is not responsible for the increase in HO-1 mRNA. This result is consistent with the accepted belief that, for most of the previously studied stimuli, regulation of HO-1 expression occurs at the transcriptional level (20Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22858-22867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M.K. J. Biol.

Consistent with this belief, studies using a 4.5-kb upstream fragment that contains the human HO-1 promoter indicated that transcriptional activation occurs following glucose deprivation. A number of genes are transcriptionally activated following glucose deprivation as the result of abnormal protein accumulation within the ER and subsequent activation of the UPR signal transduction pathway (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 4Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with the glycoprotein biosynthesis inhibitor tunicamycin, or with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of microsomal calcium-ATPase, or with amino acid analogues that incorporate and cause improper folding, such as Aze, causes activation of the UPR pathway (4Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 5Wooden S.K. Li L.J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell.

The present results demonstrate that, in contrast to GRP78, induction of the HO-1 gene does not occur in response to any of these activators, documenting that HO-1 induction following glucose deprivation occurs via a pathway completely different from the UPR pathway. Consistent with these experimental results, computer analysis of a BAC clone sequence (accession no. Z82244), containing the entire human HO-1 gene and >20 kb of 5′-flanking region, did not reveal a mammalian UPR element (5′-CCAAT-N9-CCACG-3′). To investigate the role of glucose metabolism on HO-1 mRNA induction, the ability of specific sugars and glucose analogs to maintain the basal HO-1 mRNA content was tested. The data illustrate that fructose, galactose, mannose, or 2-DOG repressed the induction of HO-1 mRNA under conditions of glucose deprivation. In contrast, the glucose analog, 3-OMG, which is transported into cells, but is not phosphorylated, was unable to repress the induction of HO-1. The 2-DOG, which is phosphorylated but not readily metabolized further, blocked HO-1 induction completely, but had no effect on induction of GRP78. These data for GRP78 are consistent with previously published reports (18Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Lee J. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kruman Y. Chan S.L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and illustrate two important points: (i) the sensing mechanism for glucose metabolites of the new signal transduction pathway differs from the UPR, and (ii) free glucose is not the repressive signal molecule for HO-1 gene expression, but glucose 6-phosphate might be detected. During glucose deprivation, steady state levels of intracellular pro-oxidants, such as hydroperoxides, increase immediately (25Blackburn R.V. Spitz D.R. Liu X. Galoforo S.S. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that hydroperoxides are produced by non-glycolytic metabolic processes and that their rate of production is increased or their metabolic decomposition is compromised by the removal of glucose, possibly via a decrease in intracellular NADPH and pyruvate (26Averill-Bates D.A. Przybytkowski E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5294-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that, in the absence of glucose, increased pro-oxidant production occurs via the mitochondrial electron transport chain (27Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5294-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) because fatty acid and amino acid carbon skeletons provide the primary fuel as substrates for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Foremost among these is glutamine, an essential amino acid for growth of cells in culture because of its importance as an oxidative fuel. The present results demonstrate a pivotal role for glutamine oxidation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle as a prerequisite for HO-1 mRNA induction following glucose deprivation and suggest that pro-oxidant molecules, arising from increased electron transport activity, may contribute to activation of the HO-1 gene. Recent evidence has demonstrated the critical importance of HO-1 expression in mediating anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects (28Shiraishi F. Curtis L.M. Truong L. Poss K.D.

In addition, the phenotype of the HO-1 knock-out mouse, characterized by chronic renal and hepatic inflammation, tissue iron deposition, anemia, and increased sensitivity to oxidant stress, underscores the functional and biological significance of HO-1 (31Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 35Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The beneficial effects of HO-1 induction occur via several postulated mechanisms. Increased HO-1 activity results in degradation of the heme moiety, a potentially toxic pro-oxidant (36Nath K.A. Grande J.P. Croatt A.J. Likely S. Hebbel R.P. Enright H. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 100-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and generates bilirubin, an antioxidant capable of scavenging peroxy radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation (37Stocker R.

Acta. 1994; 1223: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Another product, CO, has also received considerable attention as a signaling molecule, similar to NO, with vasodilatory effects mediated via cGMP, as well as anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects (8Platt J.L. Nath K.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1364-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Agarwal A. Nick H.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 965-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Otterbein L.E.

Ferritin, an intracellular iron repository, is often co-induced with HO-1, thus allowing safe sequestration of unbound iron liberated from heme degradation (39Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of intracellular iron stores and increased iron efflux has recently been suggested as a mechanism for the cytoprotective effects of HO-1 (40Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Baranano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Collectively, the results indicate that the induction of HO-1 mRNA serves as an adaptive, and likely protective, response in circumstances wherein cells are deprived of glucose. Prior to these studies, the only known signaling pathway to initiate a cellular response to glucose limitation was the UPR (3Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 4Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). That the induction of HO-1 following glucose deprivation occurs via a novel signal transduction pathway, different from the UPR, provides an exciting new avenue for research on nutrient control of gene expression.

AREs cause this instability by provoking the rapid shortening of the poly(A) tail of the mRNA. The deadenylation of mRNAs mediated by AREs containing repeats of the AUUUA motif (class I/II AREs) is conserved in Xenopusembryos. Here, we first extend these observations by showing that c-Jun ARE, a representative of class III (non-AUUUA) AREs, also provokes the deadenylation of a reporter RNA in Xenopus embryos. Next, by immunodepletion and immunoneutralization experiments, we show that, in Xenopus, the rapid deadenylation of RNAs that contain the c-Jun ARE, but not an AUUUA ARE, requires EDEN-BP. This RNA-binding protein was previously shown to provoke the rapid deadenylation of certain Xenopus maternal RNAs. Finally, we show that CUG-BP, the human homologue of EDEN-BP, specifically binds to c-Jun ARE. Together, these results identify CUG-BP as a plausible deadenylation factor responsible for the post-transcriptional control of c-Jun proto-oncogene mRNA in mammalian cells.

In a large number of cases, this control is exerted via the 3′-terminal poly(A) tail. In general, mRNAs with a long poly(A) tail are much more actively translated and stable than mRNAs that have a short or no poly(A) tail (reviewed in Refs. 1Sachs A.B. Buratowski S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 2Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic activities that alter the length of the poly(A) tail are therefore potent regulators of gene expression. These activities are often modulated by sequence elements that reside within the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR)1 of mRNAs. Among the sequence elements that provoke the shortening of the poly(A) tail (deadenylation), and thereby destabilization, the best known in mammalian somatic cells is probably the family of A/U-rich elements (ARE) (for a review, see Ref. 3Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). AREs are present in the 3′-UTRs of many unstable mRNAs such as those encoding proto-oncogenes or cytokines. Based on their sequences, AREs have been divided into three classes. Class I AREs, examplified by c-Fos ARE, contain several (AUUUA) motifs interspersed within a less defined region. Class II AREs, such as GM-CSF ARE, contain overlapping (AUUUA) motifs. Finally, class III AREs, exemplified by c-Jun ARE, contain no AUUUA motif (3Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar,4Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is highly probable that the three classes of AREs act by binding specific factors that target rapid deadenylation. Several class I and II (AUUUA-containing) ARE-binding factors have been identified. Two factors, HuR and hnRNPD/AUF1 have been specifically studied. Overexpression of HuR in a variety of cell lines leads to a stabilization of class I/II ARE-containing RNAs (5Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 6Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 7Levy N. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Cell lines depleted of HuR by an antisense strategy were recently established. This depletion leads to a destabilization of class I/II ARE-containing RNAs (8Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 9Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that HuR, in binding to AUUUA-containing AREs, stabilizes these RNAs. The function of hnRNPD/AUF1 binding to AUUUA-containing AREs is less clear and may be cell type-specific. Overexpression of this protein in K562 cells during hemin-induced differentiation destabilizes class I/II ARE containing RNAs (10Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the same protein in NIH3T3 cells stabilizes class I/II ARE-containing RNAs (11Xu N. Chen C. Shyu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6960-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To date, no factor involved in the control of the stability of class III, non-AUUUA ARE-containing RNAs has been characterized. Xenopus embryos are a powerful biological model to identify deadenylation factors for several reasons. First, in Xenopusembryos, mRNA deadenylation and degradation, though functionally coupled, are temporally uncoupled. Deadenylated RNAs are as stable as their polyadenylated counterparts until the blastula stage, several hours after fertilization (12Audic Y. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Voeltz G.K. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7537-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This allows these two phenomena to be analyzed separately. Second, deadenylation-proficient cell-free extracts can be made (14Legagneux V. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. RNA. 1995; 1: 1001-1008PubMed Google Scholar, 15Voeltz G. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that permit several biochemical manipulations. Finally, and most importantly, the functions of several sequences and factors that target rapid deadenylation are conserved between Xenopus and mammals. For instance, AUUUA AREs provoke mRNA deadenylation in Xenopus embryos (13Voeltz G.K. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7537-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Voeltz G. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the human and Xenopus oocyte poly(A)-specific ribonucleases (PARN) are functionally equivalent (16Korner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Accordingly, studying deadenylation mechanisms in Xenopus embryos should give important clues to understand these mechanisms in mammals. In the present study, we have used Xenopus embryos to study c-Jun ARE, a representative class III, non-AUUUA, ARE (4Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We first show that c-Jun ARE-dependent rapid deadenylation is conserved between mammals and Xenopus. Secondly, we show that, in Xenopus embryos, the rapid deadenylation conferred by c-Jun ARE requires EDEN-BP. EDEN-BP (EDEN-binding protein) is a factor which by binding to a specific cis sequence named EDEN (embryo deadenylation element), targets certain maternal XenopusmRNAs to rapid deadenylation after fertilization (17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The maternal EDEN-containing mRNAs are in a polyadenylated form in unfertilized eggs because of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation that takes place during oocyte maturation. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation requires a cis element different from the EDEN, and named a CPE (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element) (18Fox C.A. Sheets M.D. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We show that the requirement of EDEN-BP for rapid deadenylation of c-Jun is specific, as inactivating EDEN-BP has no effect on AUUUA ARE-mediated deadenylation. Finally, we show that the human sequence homologue of EDEN-BP, CUG-BP (20Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), specifically binds to c-Jun ARE, making it a plausible factor to be responsible for c-Jun mRNA rapid deadenylation and degradation in mammalian cells. c-Jun ARE (4Peng S.S.

Annealed primers sense, CTAGAAGCTTAGATCTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTACTAGTGGTACC; antisense, CTAGGTACCACTAGTAAATAAATAAATAAATAAATAAATAAATAAATAGATCTAAGCTT were cloned in the XbaI and NheI sites of the same vector to give the pGBORF-AUUUA plasmid. The Xenopus EDEN-BP and human CUG-BP open reading frames were amplified by RT-PCR using the pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and either Xenopus ovary RNA or HeLa cell RNA. The sequences of the PCR primers were Xenopus sense, TAGAAGATCTGCCATGAACGGCACAATGGACC; Xenopus antisense, GCTCTAGATCAGTAGGGTTTGCTGTCATTC; Human sense, TAGAGGATCCGCCATGAACGGCACCCTGGACC; Human antisense, GCTCTAGATCAGTAGGGCTTGCTGTCATTC. The PCR products were cloned into the BglII and SpeI sites of the pT7TS vector (22Cleaver O. Patterson K. Krieg P. Development. 1996; 122: 3549-3556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the constructions were fully sequenced. Capped, polyadenylated, and radiolabeled GbEg2-410 (14Legagneux V. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. RNA. 1995; 1: 1001-1008PubMed Google Scholar), GbORF (12Audic Y.

Large scale uncapped RNA for recombinant proteins production were obtained from EcoRI-linearized pT7TS matrices by in vitro transcription using the Promega Ribomax kit. Microinjections of 20–30 nl of in vitro transcripts into Xenopus two-cell embryos were done following standard procedures. Coinjections of in vitrotranscripts with purified antibodies are described elsewhere. 2C. Le Clainche, D. Maniey, D. Ogereau, H. B. Osborne, and L. Paillard, manuscript in preparation. Deadenylation proficient egg extracts have been described (14Legagneux V. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. RNA. 1995; 1: 1001-1008PubMed Google Scholar). Deadenylation activities were analyzed either by incubating RNAs in the extracts at 22 °C for the indicated time, or by incubating the injected embryos at 22 °C for the indicated times. After incubation, RNAs were extracted, electrophoresed on a 4% acrylamide-urea gel, and autoradiographed as described (14Legagneux V. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. RNA. 1995; 1: 1001-1008PubMed Google Scholar). UV cross-linking and antibody methods have been described (14Legagneux V. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. RNA. 1995; 1: 1001-1008PubMed Google Scholar, 17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test whether the capacity of c-Jun ARE to target rapid deadenylation in human cells (4Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) is conserved in Xenopusembryos, this sequence element was cloned 3′ of the globin open reading frame (ORF). The resulting plasmid was used as a template to synthesize a capped, polyadenylated transcript (GbORF-jun). This transcript was injected into two-cell Xenopus embryos, and its deadenylation behavior was analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1). A completely deadenylated form of the GbORF-jun transcript could be detected as early as 1 h after injection (lane 6), and the transcript was predominantly deadenylated 3 h after injection (lane 8). In contrast, and as previously shown (12Audic Y. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), no completely deadenylated form of the reporter RNA alone (GbORF) could be detected, even 3 h after injection (lane 4). The deadenylation pattern of the GbORF transcript is evocative of default deadenylation, a slow activity for which the only sequence specificity is an absence of a CPE, which is stimulated during oocyte maturation and persists after fertilization (23Fox C.A. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2287-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Varnum S.M. Wormington W.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2278-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Stebbins-Boaz B. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5870-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results show that c-Jun ARE targets RNAs for rapid deadenylation in Xenopusembryos, demonstrating a functional conservation of this sequence element in vertebrates. As a representative class III ARE, c-Jun ARE contains no AUUUA motif (see Introduction). Examination of its sequence revealed the presence of a putative CPE UUUUUUAAUU, the element that drives cytoplasmic polyadenylation in Xenopus maturing oocytes (18Fox C.A. Sheets M.D. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and of numerous U/purine dinucleotides (Fig.2). We have previously shown that an EDEN, the element that drives RNA deadenylation inXenopus embryos is also enriched in U/purine dinucleotides (17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Audic Y. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6879-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests therefore that c-Jun ARE acts as an EDEN sequence to target rapid deadenylation in Xenopus embryos. In this case, c-Jun ARE-mediated RNA deadenylation would require active EDEN-BP, the factor that specifically binds to EDEN sequences (17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In Xenopus cytoplasmic eggs extracts, immunodepletion of EDEN-BP completely abolishes EDEN-dependent RNA deadenylation (17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3A(upper bands) is shown the behavior of GbORF-jun RNA in EDEN-BP- or mock-depleted extracts. In mock-depleted extracts (lanes 1–3), GbORF-jun RNA was deadenylated, as shown by the appearance of a completely deadenylated form of the transcript after 1.5 h of incubation, which was more evident after 3 h of incubation. The deadenylation of GbORF-jun was strongly diminished by EDEN-BP immunodepletion, as no completely deadenylated form of the transcript was detected even after 3 h of incubation (lanes 4–6). In contrast, and as previously shown (17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), immunodepletion of EDEN-BP had no effect on the slow, default-type deadenylation of the reporter GbORF transcript (lower bands). Therefore, c-Jun ARE-dependent deadenylation in Xenopus egg extracts specifically requires EDEN-BP. The deadenylation of the GbORF-jun transcript is significantly less efficient in extracts than in living embryos (compare Figs.3A and 1). It could be argued therefore that in living embryos the behavior of this transcript is mainly due to an EDEN-BP-independent deadenylation mechanism. This hypothetical mechanism would be lost while preparing cell-free extracts. To test this hypothesis, we used purified antibodies directed against EDEN-BP to immunoneutralize this protein in Xenopus living embryos. EDEN-BP immunoneutralization specifically inhibits EDEN-dependent deadenylation as measured using an Eg2-derived probe (data not shown). When the GbORF-jun transcript was injected together with anti-EDEN-BP antibodies, the deadenylation of this RNA was abrogated (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). Indeed, in EDEN-BP immunoneutralized embryos, the GbORF-jun transcript was further polyadenylated, as evidenced by the reduction of its electrophoretic mobility. This is probably due to the action of the putative CPE that is present in c-jun ARE (see Fig. 2). In contrast, the deadenylation of the GbORF-jun transcript was maintained when this transcript was injected with control, nonimmune antibodies (Fig.3B, lanes 5–8). The above data show that c-Jun ARE requires an active EDEN-BP to target an mRNA to rapid deadenylation in Xenopus embryos. To test if this requirement is specific for class III ARE, or if it concerns any ARE, we analyzed the deadenylation behavior of an RNA harboring an AUUUA ARE in EDEN-BP immunoneutralized embryos. It was shown previously that RNAs containing repeats of the (AUUUA) motif were deadenylated in Xenopus embryos, demonstrating the conservation of class I/II ARE mediated deadenylation betweenXenopus and mammals (13Voeltz G.K. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7537-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Voeltz G. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when the GbORF reporter RNA containing a eight (AUUUA) repeat (GbORF-AUUUA transcript) was injected with nonimmune antibodies, it was rapidly deadenylated (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–8). This behavior was not affected by the injection of anti-EDEN-BP antibodies (lanes 1–4). Therefore, RNAs that contain c-Jun ARE, but not AUUUA-type ARE, are rapidly deadenylated in Xenopus embryos by an EDEN-BP-dependent pathway. It can be hypothesized that, as EDEN-BP is responsible for c-Jun ARE-mediated rapid RNA deadenylation in Xenopus embryos, a human sequence homologue of EDEN-BP may target c-Jun mRNA for rapid deadenylation in human cells. This hypothesis requires that the human homologue of EDEN-BP should bind to c-Jun ARE. The closest human sequence homologue of EDEN-BP is CUG-BP, which is 88% identical to XenopusEDEN-BP at the amino acid level (20Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To test if CUG-BP can bind to c-Jun ARE, recombinant human CUG-BP andXenopus EDEN-BP were expressed in wheat germ extracts. The capacity of these recombinant proteins to bind to c-Jun ARE were assayed by UV cross-linking (Fig. 4). A strong UV cross-linking signal was detected with wheat germ expressing either EDEN-BP (lane 3) or CUG-BP (lane 5). In contrast, no similar signal was observed with unprogrammed wheat germ extracts (lane 1), demonstrating that the observed signals are due to the recombinant proteins. To test the specificity of the interaction between c-Jun ARE and EDEN-BP or CUG-BP, cross-linking to c-Jun ARE was assayed in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled RNA containing the Eg5 EDEN (17Paillard L. Omilli F. Legagneux V. Bassez T. Maniey D. Osborne H.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cross-linking signal was strongly diminished by this excess of competitor (lanes 4 and 6). Hence, both EDEN-BP and CUG-BP can bind specifically to c-Jun ARE. In the present article, we show that the ability of c-Jun (class III) ARE to provoke rapid RNA deadenylation is conserved between human somatic cells and Xenopus embryos. Similar results on AUUUA (class I/II) AREs have been published (13Voeltz G.K. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7537-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Voeltz G. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hence, the function of the three classes of AREs is conserved between mammalian somatic cells and Xenopus embryos. It should be noticed however that ARE-mediated deadenylation leads to mRNA degradation in mammalian somatic cells, but not in early Xenopus embryos. Deadenylated mRNAs are stable in Xenopus embryos until the blastula stage, several hours after fertilization (this study and Refs. 12Audic Y. Omilli F. Osborne H.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 15Voeltz G. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Next, we used immunodepletion and immunoneutralization experiments to show that c-Jun ARE-mediated deadenylation in Xenopusembryos required EDEN-BP, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we have shown that neutralizing EDEN-BP did not affect the deadenylation of a AUUUA-containing reporter RNA. By overexpressing hnRNPD/AUF1, Xu et al. (11Xu N. Chen C. Shyu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6960-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) recently showed that the different isoforms of this ARE-binding protein have different destabilizing effects on class I and class II AREs. However, the deadenylation mediated by c-jun ARE was not affected in these experiments. Together therefore, these results show that mRNAs containing different classes of AREs are regulated by different trans-acting factors, and it is at least theoretically possible for the cell to regulate the deadenylation of the various ARE-containing mRNAs independently. This observation may be especially important considering that c-Fos proto-oncogene mRNA contains several AUUUA motifs (3Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), and that c-Fos and c-Jun proteins are subunits of the AP-1 transcription complex (27Dam H.v. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Differential post-transcriptional regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos would be a way to alter the composition of the AP-1 complex, which may have important implications on its targets. Having shown the requirement of EDEN-BP for c-Jun ARE-mediated deadenylation in Xenopus embryos, it was tempting to hypothesize that the closest human sequence homologue of EDEN-BP, CUG-BP (20Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), is responsible for the post-transcriptional regulation of c-Jun mRNA in human cells. In support of this hypothesis, we show that CUG-BP indeed binds to c-Jun ARE. c-Jun ARE is enriched in dinucleotides U/purine. This characteristic of the cis-element bound by CUG-BP is in agreement with data obtained using a tri-hybrid assay (28Takahashi N. Sasagawa N. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, in a UV cross-linking experiment, CUG-BP binds BRE sequences that consist mainly of U/purine repeats (29Good P. Chen O. Warner S. Herring D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28583-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It remains to be demonstrated conclusively that CUG-BP is a deadenylation factor in human cells, where it would regulate the expression of c-Jun proto-oncogene. This may be attempted using an antisense RNA strategy similar to that used for HuR protein (8Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 9Wang W. Caldwell M.C. Lin S. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A role for CUG-BP in class III ARE-dependent deadenylation could appear contradictory with the described nuclear function for this protein as an alternative splicing regulator of the cardiac troponin T and the insulin receptor pre-mRNAs (30Philips A.V. Timchenko L.T. Cooper T.A. Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 31Savkur R. Philips A. Cooper T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, CUG-BP has been detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (32Roberts R. Timchenko N. Miller J. Reddy S. Caskey C. Swanson M. Timchenko L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13221-13226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, most ARE-binding factors are nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling proteins, with different functions in these two compartments (reviewed in Ref. 33Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a dual role for CUG-BP as both a splicing regulator and a deadenylation factor is conceivable.

We explored the mechanism of antimalarial activity of clotrimazole in relation to hemoglobin catabolism in the malaria parasite. Because free heme produced from hemoglobin catabolism is highly toxic to the malaria parasite, the parasite protects itself by polymerizing heme into insoluble nontoxic hemozoin or by decomposing heme coupled to reduced glutathione. We have shown that clotrimazole has a high binding affinity for heme in aqueous 40% dimethyl sulfoxide solution (association equilibrium constant: Ka = 6.54 × 108m−2). Even in water, clotrimazole formed a stable and soluble complex with heme and suppressed its aggregation. The results of optical absorption spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy revealed that the heme-clotrimazole complex assumes a ferric low spin state (S = ½), having two nitrogenous ligands derived from the imidazole moieties of two clotrimazole molecules. Furthermore, we found that the formation of heme-clotrimazole complexes protects heme from degradation by reduced glutathione, and the complex damages the cell membrane more than free heme. The results described herein indicate that the antimalarial activity of clotrimazole might be due to a disturbance of hemoglobin catabolism in the malaria parasite.

Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM press (American Society for Microbiology), Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar). Furthermore, artemisinin-resistant strains ofPlasmodium falciparum have been developed in the laboratory (2Inselburg J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1985; 34: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, there has been extensive research into a new series of antimalarial drugs. The antifungal agent clotrimazole (CLT) (Fig.1) inhibits the growth of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains in vitro (3Saliba K.J. Kirk K. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1998; 92: 666-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Tiffert T. Ginsburg H. Krugliak M. Elford C. Lew V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of the antimalarial activity of CLT have been proposed in relation to Ca2+ ions; CLT inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump and capacitative Ca2+channels of malaria-infected red blood cells, causing the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (5Benzaquen L.R. Brugnara C. Byers H.R. Gattoni-Celli S. Halperin J.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Tiffert T. Staines H.M. Ellory J.C. Lew V.L. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ induces the activation of protein kinase R and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in the parasite (7Aktas H. Fluckiger R. Acosta J.A. Salvage J.M. Palakurthi S.S. Halperin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8280-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the actual mechanism of CLT antimalarial action at the molecular level remains equivocal. During development and proliferation in human erythrocytes, malaria degrades hemoglobin to use as a major source of amino acids, accompanied by the release of free heme. As free heme is highly toxic to the malarial parasite, the parasite has developed a means of detoxifying heme through polymerization to non-toxic, insoluble hemozoin (8Francis S.E. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) or by degradation with GSH (9Atamna H. Ginsburg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24876-24883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Ginsburg H. Famin O. Zhang J. Krugliak M. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1999; 98: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is found at millimolar concentrations in red blood cells and parasite compartments (12Atamna H. Ginsburg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Luersen K. Walter R.D. Muller S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). About 30–50% of free heme is detoxified by polymerization at the trophozoite stage (10Ginsburg H. Famin O. Zhang J. Krugliak M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 14Wood P.A. Eton J.W. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 48: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and the remainder is detoxified by GSH-dependent degradation. The two detoxification processes of free heme are initiated by heme histidine-rich protein (HRP) 2 and heme-GSH complex formation, respectively. Antimalarials such as quinine and CQ also bind to free heme and inhibit its degradation. Furthermore, the imidazole moiety of CLT behaves as an axial ligand, binding free heme. We therefore considered that CLT exerts antimalarial activity by forming complexes with heme, similar to the heme-binding antimalarials, CQ and quinine. In this study, the coordination reaction between CLT and heme was investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The structure of the heme-CLT complex was characterized based on spectroscopic evidence. Furthermore, we compared the effects of CLT and CQ on GSH-dependent heme degradation and heme-induced hemolysis, and we propose a mechanism of antimalarial CLT action. GSH, CLT, CQ, imidazole, and hemin (heme) were from Sigma. Mesoheme was from Porphyrin Products Inc. (Logan, UT). Human blood was drawn from healthy volunteers. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals were of the highest commercially available grade. At the start of each experiment, a stock heme solution was prepared by dissolving hemin chloride in 20 mm NaOH and then removing the remaining hemin crystals by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm. The heme concentration was estimated from absorbance at 385 nm (εmm = 58,400) in 100 mm NaOH (16Shaklai N. Shviro Y. Rabizadeh E. Kirschner-Zilber I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and adjusted to 1.0 mm. This stock reagent was stored in the dark on ice and used within 24 h. All absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3300 double-beam spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) using a 1.0-cm light-path quartz cuvette at 23 °C. A solution of 17 μm heme in 40% Me2SO and 20 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.4) revealed Soret at 401 nm and Q band absorption maxima at 493 and 616 nm, and the ratio of absorption of the Soret (401 nm) and Q band (616 nm) was 28.72, indicating that the heme in the present system exists as a monomeric mode (17Beaven G.H.

The optical absorption spectra of the heme-CLT and heme-imidazole complexes were recorded 5 min after adding CLT (final concentration, 100 μm) and imidazole (final concentration, 500 μm) to heme (final concentration, 17 μm) in 40% Me2SO buffered with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The total volume of the reaction mixture was 1.0 ml. Differential absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-3300 spectrophotometer as follows. The drug, CLT or CQ, was added sequentially to a sample cuvette containing heme solution. The reference compartment held two cuvettes, one containing an identical heme solution aliquot to which a buffer other than the drug was added and the other containing a solution without heme and the same amount of the drug. In the case of CLT titration, both the sample cuvette and the first reference cuvette contained 17 μm heme in 40% Me2SO buffered by 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and the second reference cuvette contained the same solution without heme. Increasing amounts of CLT (0 μm–105.6 μmin 6.6 μm increments) in Me2SO were titrated with the contents of the sample cuvette and the second reference cuvette, in which the total volume of the reaction mixture was maintained at 1.0 ml. Before adding CQ, the sample cuvette and the first reference cuvette contained 5 μm heme in 40% Me2SO buffered by 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and the second reference cuvette contained the same solution without heme. During the titration of heme-CQ complex formation, increasing amounts of CQ (0–36 μm in 4 μm increments) were added to both the sample and the second reference cuvettes, where the total volume of the reaction mixture was 1.0 ml during the titration. All differential spectra were recorded at wavelengths between 350 and 700 nm, and the concentrations of heme-CLT and heme-CQ complexes were evaluated based on absorbance at 416 and 401 nm, respectively. The binding mode of CLT and CQ to heme was analyzed in terms of Hill (20Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 62-64Google Scholar, 21Brault D. Rougee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Scatchard (22Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar, 23Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part III. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 849-863Google Scholar) plots. The equilibrium association constants for the formation of heme-CLT and heme-CQ complexes, as well as the number of ligands that bind to heme, were calculated from Hill plots using Eq. 1,H+nL⇄H(L)nEquation 1 and analyzed using the standard equation (Eq. 2),logA−A0A∞−A=logKa+nlog[L]Equation 2 where A0, A∞, and A are the absorbance of the initial, final, and mixed species, respectively; H represents heme; L is the ligand (CLT or CQ); n is the number of ligand molecules that bind to heme; and Ka is the equilibrium association constant of the heme-ligand complex. ESR measurements were continued for heme-CLT complexes that were formed in Me2SO at molar ratios of heme to CLT of 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8. After an overnight incubation at room temperature, the ESR spectrum of heme-CLT complex was recorded at 4.2 K by a JES-TE 300 spectrometer with 100-kHz field modulation. The integrated frequency counter monitored the microwave frequency of each measurement. The magnetic field strength was calibrated by hyperfine splitting of Mn(II) ion (8.69 milliteslas (mT)) doped in MgO powder. Powdered lithium-tetracyanoquinodimethane radical (g = 2.0025) was used as the standard g value. The ESR data were analyzed and calibrated using a Winrad system (Radical Research Inc., Tokyo). The typical conditions for ESR measurements were as follows: microwave power, 6.0 milliwatts; modulation magnitude, 0.68 mT; sweep range 30 mT to 500 mT; sweep time, 4 min; and time constants, 0.1 s. Heme degradation by GSH was monitored by measuring spectral change as described by Atamna and Ginsburg (9Atamna H. Ginsburg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24876-24883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fresh GSH stock solution (200 mm) was prepared in isotonic standard buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate containing 68 mmNaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, and 1.2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) (24Chou A.C. Chevli R. Fitch C.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 25Fitch C.D. Chevli R. Gonzalex Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1974; 6: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Heme (final concentration, 3 μm) and GSH (final concentration, 2 mm) were mixed in isotonic standard buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C. Absorption spectra (300–600 nm) were recorded at 6-min intervals after mixing, using the same spectrophotometer. The rate constant and t½of GSH-dependent heme degradation in the absence of CLT and CQ were calculated from the decrease of absorbance at 365 nm in terms of first-order reaction kinetics. In the presence of CLT (6 μm) or CQ (6 μm), the time-dependent spectral measurements were obtained by the same procedure. CLT in Me2SO and CQ in HEPES buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) were all prepared as 3 mmstock solutions. Heme (3 μm), GSH (2 mm), and either CLT or CQ (6 μm) were mixed in 0.2 mHEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C. In the control experiment, Me2SO (final concentration, 0.2% (v/v)) was added to the mixture of heme (3 μm) and GSH (2 mm) instead of CLT and CQ. The time-dependent change of absorbance at 396 nm was recorded as an indicator of heme degradation. Fresh blood from healthy donors was heparinized (1 mg of heparin/ml blood) to suppress clotting. The erythrocytes were separated from plasma by centrifugation at 1,500 × gfor 3 min and washed six times with isotonic standard buffer. Thereafter, the effects of CLT and CQ on hemolysis induced by heme were examined in 0.5% cell suspensions in isotonic standard buffer. Erythrocyte suspensions (0.6 ml) were shaken with various concentrations of heme (0–20 μm) and CLT or CQ (0, 1, 5, and 10 μm) at 37 °C for 150 min at 140 cycles/min. Intact erythrocytes were then removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 3 min, and the amount of hemoglobin released from the hemolyzed erythrocytes into the supernatant was determined by measuring absorbance at 578 nm (26Shviro Y. Shaklai N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After the pelleted intact erythrocytes were lysed with water and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant, the hemoglobin content in intact erythrocytes was measured as absorbance at 578 nm. The degree of hemolysis was calculated from the ratio of hemoglobin content released from erythrocytes hemolyzed by heme to the total heme content of the erythrocytes (26Shviro Y. Shaklai N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When using heme-bound erythrocytes, 0.5% of red blood cells in isotonic standard buffer, pH 7.4, were incubated with 10 μm heme at room temperature for 10 min. The erythrocyte suspension was separated by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g for 3 min, and the pellet was washed three times with isotonic standard buffer to remove free heme, thus providing heme-bound erythrocytes. A sample of 0.6 ml of a 0.5% suspension of heme-bound erythrocytes was prepared in isotonic standard buffer, Me2SO (1%), CLT (10 μm), CQ (10 μm), or GSH (2.5 mm) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The hemolysis degree was calculated from three such experiments. Fig.2, curve 1, shows Soret and Q band absorption at 401, 493, and 616 nm by heme (17 μm) in 40% Me2SO, which is characteristic of high spin ferric complexes assuming a five-coordinate structure (27Kaminsky L.S. Byrne M. Davison A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,28Pasternack R.F. Gillies B.S. Stahlbush J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 2613-2619Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with weak axial ligand such as water or chloride anion. When excess CLT (final concentration, 100 μm) was added to the mixture, the Soret shifted toward red wavelengths at 412 nm, and Q band absorption was evident at 536 and 560 nm, as shown in Fig. 2,curve 2. The observed spectrum was classified into a six-coordinate ferric complex having nitrogenous ligands at both axial positions. In fact, the spectroscopic properties coincided with those of similar solutions of heme and imidazole (Soret, 410 nm; Q bands, 535 and 560 nm) shown in Fig. 2, curve 3. Furthermore, heme-bis-imidazole complexes have similar spectra (29Babcock G.T. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Oerling W.A. Metz J.G.

Commun. 1987; 149: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as summarized in Table I. These results support the notion that CLT, like imidazole, has affinity for the heme chromophore. It is likely that the imidazole moiety of CLT is the nitrogenous donor.Table IAbsorption maxima for protoheme (ferric protoporphyrin IX) complexed with CLT, CQ, imidazole, N-methylimidazole, or hexapeptide containing two histidine residuesSampleAxial ligandAdditiveSolventAbsorptionReferencenmProtohemenonenone40% Me2SO1-a40% Me2SO, 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4.401493616This workProtohemeCLTnone40% Me2SO1-a40% Me2SO, 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4.412536560This workProtohemeImidazolenone40% Me2SO1-a40% Me2SO, 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4.410535560This workProtohemeCLTnoneHEPES buffer1-b20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4.416533564This workProtohemeCLTGSHHEPES buffer1-b20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4.416533564This workProtohemenoneCQHEPES buffer1-b20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4.390594This workProtohemenoneCQ + GSHHEPES buffer1-b20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4.390594This workProtohemeN-methylimidazolenonePhosphate buffer1-cpH 7.4.413535564Ref.29Babcock G.T.

Open table in a new tab The heme-CLT complex in the absence of Me2SO gave a similar absorption spectrum, as indicated by a Soret band at 416 nm and Q bands at 533 and 564 nm (Table I). In contrast, the spectrum of the heme-imidazole complex in the absence of Me2SO included a broad peak at 433 nm (data not shown), which is derived mainly from the aggregated form of heme (31Gallagher W.A. Elliotte W.B. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Campbell V.M. Studies on Hemin and Cobalt Corrinoids in Aqueous SolutionPh.D. thesis. University of Witwaterstrand, 1981Google Scholar). The heme-CLT complex, prepared in HEPES buffer in the absence of Me2SO, was quite stable under ambient conditions. The values of the absorption maxima of the heme-CLT complex in Me2SO and in HEPES buffer did not vary significantly, and heme precipitation was undetectable even in HEPES buffer. These results provide potent evidence of the ability of CLT to stabilize the monomeric form of heme and to inhibit the formation of polymeric heme in aqueous solution. To characterize the binding of heme with CLT, spectrophotometric heme titration was performed by measuring the differential spectra between heme and heme-CLT complex at various CLT concentrations. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” aqueous-Me2SO (40% v/v) buffered by 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, was used because heme in this solution should form a monomer at concentrations up to 26.6 μm (17Beaven G.H. Chen S. D'Albis A. Gratm W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18Collier G.S. De Pratt J.M. Wet R. Tshabalala C.F. Biochem.

Fig.3A shows that CLT perturbs the spectrum of heme, indicating interaction between the drug and heme. Continuous addition of CLT into a heme solution achieves conversion of the heme spectrum to a form with lower Soret molar absorption and a Soret maximum shifted to a longer wavelength. The absorption spectra changed as the CLT concentration increased, through isosbestic points at 409, 467, 514, and 585 nm, indicating that only two absorbing species are present in the reaction mixture. During heme-CQ complex formation, the spectrum change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the intensity of monomeric heme at the Soret and Q bands (Fig. 3B), as described by Egan et al. (19Egan T.J. Mavuso W.W. Ross D.C. Marques H.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 68: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), indicating interaction between CQ and heme. The effects of heme interactions with CLT and CQ on titration behavior were analyzed using Hill plots (20Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 62-64Google Scholar, 21Brault D. Rougee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to determine the number of molecules bound to heme in aqueous Me2SO. Hill plots of our binding data in Fig. 4 show heme-CLT complexes at 17 μm heme and heme-CQ complexes at 5 μm heme. The slopes of these linear graphs are 2 and 1, respectively, within experimental error. The same data are presented in Scatchard plots in Fig.5 (22Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar, 23Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part III. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 849-863Google Scholar). The straight lineindicates the absence of cooperative interaction between heme and CQ, whereas a curved graph is observed for heme-CLT complex, indicating cooperation and the involvement of non-identical interacting binding sites. The analysis using the Hill plot demonstrates that heme binds two CLT molecules with an association constant (Ka) of 6.54 × 108m−2, whereas heme binds one molecule of CQ with a Ka of 1.71 × 105m−1 in aqueous 40% Me2SO at pH 7.4. We further clarified the electronic and coordination structures of the heme-CLT complex by ESR spectroscopy. We recorded ESR spectra at 4.2 K for heme-CLT complexes prepared in Me2SO, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Before adding CLT, the observed ESR spectrum (Fig. 6, curve 1) of heme (0.5 mm) contained the line and g values (g = 6 and g = 2.0) typical of the ferric high spin (S =52) species, taking five-coordinate geometry into account (33Momenteau M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 304: 814-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A weak signal is always observed at about g = 4.3, which may be due to non-heme iron from decomposed heme (34Tajima K. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1989; 163: 115-122Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or impurities in the sample tube and Dewar assembly. On adding CLT (final concentration, 100 mm) to the reaction mixture, the ESR signal intensity of the high spin species decreased significantly with the concomitant formation of a new paramagnetic species with a distorted rhombic ESR line (Fig. 6, curves 2 and 3; g1 = 1.46, g2 = 2.26, and g3 = 2.98), which was characteristic of ferric low spin complex (S = ½) having strong axial ligands at both axial positions. Upon the further addition of CLT, the molar ratio of CLT/heme reached 8, and the ESR signal of the new species was recorded exclusively, suggesting that CLT tended to shift the equilibrium to form the low spin ferric species (data not shown). The observed ESR shape of the low spin species line was quite similar to that recorded for a frozen mixture of heme-imidazole complex (data not shown). In addition, the observed g values of those complexes agreed well (e.g. protoheme-imidazole and protoheme-hexapeptide complex) (TableII). This provided experimental evidence that both complexes, heme-CLT and heme-imidazole complexes, have similar ligands at the axial positions.Table IIThe g values and crystal field parameters (calculated by using Bohan's proposal (37Bohan T.L.

Chem. 1996; 58: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas the spectrum of heme in 40% Me2SO revealed only one Soret band at 401 nm, indicating the monomer form of heme (Fig. 2) (17Beaven G.H.

The maximal absorption of the Soret of heme (3 μm) was shifted to 365 nm after adding GSH (2 mm) as described in Ref. 9Atamna H. Ginsburg H. J. Biol.

Fig. 7 shows that the Soret absorption of heme complexed with GSH declined rapidly as described in Ref. 9Atamna H. Ginsburg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24876-24883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, indicating the degradation of heme by GSH. The rate constant and t½ of the heme degradation were calculated from fitting to the first-order reaction as 4.5 × 10−4 s−1 and 1,540 s, respectively, in isotonic standard buffer at pH 7.4. The absorption spectra of heme-CLT and of heme-CQ complexes did not change upon the addition of GSH, indicating that neither complex interacted with GSH (data not shown). The GSH-dependent degradation of heme (3 μm) in the presence of CLT (6 μm) or CQ (6 μm) was monitored as a decrease of absorbance at 396 nm because heme-CLT complex and heme-CQ complex have similar molecular absorption coefficients at 396 nm. The results shown in Fig. 8 indicate that CLT and CQ inhibit GSH-dependent heme degradation. Hemolysis experiments were performed using fresh blood cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Up to only 2.5% hemolysis occurred in controls in which no heme was added. The hemolysis induced by the presence of heme was potentiated by CLT as well as by CQ (Fig. 9A), and the effects depended on the concentrations of both heme and the added agents. We also observed that CLT alone at up to 20 μmhad no effect on hemolysis in the absence of heme (data not shown). Therefore, the enhancement of heme-dependent hemolysis of erythrocytes may be caused by the formation of heme-CLT complex. The amount of heme-dependent hemolysis enhanced by CQ was almost identical to that observed in a previous study (36Dutta P. Fitch C.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 225: 729-734PubMed Google Scholar). The similar enhancement of heme-dependent hemolysis by CLT and CQ indicates that they have the same potential at high concentrations of heme (5–20 μm), as shown in Fig.9A. However, at lower heme"
https://openalex.org/W2045706309,"Recent kinetics experiments using mutants of thebc1 complex (ubihydroquinone-cytochromec oxidoreductase) iron-sulfur subunit with modified hinge regions have revealed the crucial role played by the large scale movement of its [2Fe-2S] cluster domain during the activity of this enzyme.

This enzyme catalyzes electron transfer from ubihydroquinone (QH2) to a c-type cytochrome (cyt) and couples the energy thus released to proton transport across the membrane. Thebc1 complex is therefore a key component of cellular energy transduction systems and contributes to the establishment of an electrochemical gradient subsequently used for ATP production by the ATP synthase.

Indeed upon QH2 oxidation at this catalytic site, the two electrons released are conveyed to two different electron transport chains. One electron follows a high redox potential chain constituted of the [2Fe-2S] cluster borne by the iron-sulfur subunit and the cyt c1 heme of the cyt c1 subunit, whereas the other electron is transferred to a low redox potential chain constituted by twob-type hemes (low and high potential b-type heme) and reduces a ubiquinone (Q) or semiubiquinone radical in a second catalytic site (ubiquinone reduction site) located on the other side of the membrane (4Darrouzet E.

Use of the phototrophic bacteria of Rhodobacter species as a model system has further advanced these studies especially via the engineering of mutants in the linker domain of the iron-sulfur subunit that acts as a hinge for the large scale domain movement (12Tian H.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15484-15492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Remarkably, one such mutant (+1Ala) with a single alanine residue insertion in the hinge region considerably slowed down the movement and the associated electron transfer that is too fast to be time-resolved in the native enzyme (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This finding allowed us for the first time to unveil the intra-enzyme complex domain motion kinetically and to define its lower and upper limits (4Darrouzet E. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F.

It also established that the motion is not rate-limiting for the function of the bc1 complex because it is faster than the catalytic rate of this enzyme. Although convincing evidence has been accumulated over the past few years about the occurrence and importance of the domain movement during the catalytic cycle of thebc1 complex, little is yet known about whether or not the movement is controlled during the Qo site catalysis and, if so, what are the regions of the enzyme that might be implicated in its control (4Darrouzet E. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)? Previous studies have demonstrated that an optimal combination of length and flexibility is required at the level of the iron-sulfur hinge domain to have a fully functional enzyme (12Tian H. Yu L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15484-15492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additional studies have also revealed that the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain interacts closely with the cd1 andcd2 loops of cyt b (14Xiao K. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38597-38604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this work we present detailed studies of a revertant of the +1Ala mutant of thebc1 complex (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that regains its normal function upon the occurrence of a second mutation, substituting the leucine residue at position 286 of the ef loop of cytb with a phenylalanine. The results reveal that theef loop of cyt b is an important structural feature that interferes with the movement of the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain and acts as a physical barrier that needs to be crossed for multiple turnovers of the bc1 complex. We also demonstrate that even in the absence of the domain movement, remarkably, Qo site catalysis can still take place, and oxidation of a QH2 molecule occurs readily. Therefore, even if the iron-sulfur subunit [2Fe-2S] cluster domain cannot swing away from cyt b toward cyt c1, nonetheless it can still position itself to the appropriate subdomain of the Qo site to catalyze QH2 oxidation. Rhodobacter capsulatus strains were grown under semiaerobic conditions at 35 °C in the dark in enriched medium supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 μg/ml kanamycin or in anaerobic conditions in the same medium and under continuous light (19Darrouzet E.

All biochemical and biophysical techniques, including time-resolved light-induced absorption kinetics and EPR spectroscopy, are described in Refs. 19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar except that a dual wavelength instead of a single wavelength spectrophotometer (Biomedical Instrumentation Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) was used for some of the light-induced cytc rereduction or cyt b reduction kinetics obtained in this work. The +1Ala mutant that contains an insertion of a single alanine residue in the hinge region of the iron-sulfur subunit grows under photosynthetic growth conditions noticeably slower (Psslow) than its wild type parent. This Psslow growth is a result of its impairedbc1 complex function caused by hindered movement of its iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We had noticed that under Ps growth conditions rare Ps+ colonies growing faster than the +1Ala mutant readily appear on enriched medium containing plates. One such Ps+ colony was retained, purified extensively, and analyzed further. Appropriate subcloning and DNA sequencing experiments revealed that this Ps+ revertant contained a second mutation that substituted the leucine residue at position 286 of the ef loop of cyt b by a phenylalanine. To verify that this L286F substitution in cytb was solely responsible for the improved Ps+phenotype of this revertant, the 920-bp XmaI-SfuI DNA fragment of the petABC operon encoding thebc1 complex and containing this mutation was exchanged with its counterpart in a petABC operon also carrying the +1Ala mutation in the iron-sulfur subunit and yielded the mutant +1AlaL286F. Moreover, to define the effect of the secondary mutation L286F alone, and also to probe its ability to suppress the Ps− defect of a +2Ala mutant (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C.

Ps growth properties of the newly obtained L286F, +1AlaL286F, and +2AlaL286F mutants were compared with those of the wild type, +1Ala and +2Ala mutants, respectively. The L286F mutation readily endowed Ps+ growth ability to the +1Ala mutant, but it was ineffective in the case of the +2Ala mutant, whereas the L286F mutation alone did not exhibit any detectable Ps growth defect on plates containing enriched medium (Table I).Table IProperties of the +1AlaL286F revertant and its derivativesPs phenotype1-aPs+ and Ps−refer to photosynthetic growth ability or disability, respectively, and Psslow indicates that the growth rate is significantly (about 2-fold) slower than that of the wild type.AssemblyEm7[2Fe-2S]1-dThe Em7 values were obtained after fitting the EPR gy signal amplitude during potentiometric dark titration of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (23, 24).Steady-state activity1-eSteady-state bc1complex activity refers to the 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone:cyt creductase activity expressed as a percentage of the wild type activity, which was approximately 3 μmol of cyt c reduced min−1 mg of membrane protein−1 (25).Electron transfer QH2 → cytc1-fQH2 to cyt celectron transfer rates were determined at 100 mV by recording cytc rereduction kinetics at 550–540 nm and fitting them to a single exponential equation (19, 20).

Open table in a new tab Next, whether or not the mutants assembled properly the iron-sulfur subunit into their bc1 complexes was probed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses (data not shown). The data indicated that a slight substoichiometry (<50%) was seen in the presence of the L286F mutation in all cases, and this effect was most visible when this mutation was alone. Moreover, the amplitude of the EPR gy signal that reflects the amount of the [2Fe-2S] cluster also indicated a similar defect in the assembly of the iron-sulfur subunit, especially in the case of the L286F (Table I). On the other hand, EPR spectra obtained using chromatophore membranes indicated that in all mutants the interactions of the [2Fe-2S] cluster with Q or the Qo site inhibitor stigmatellin were normal as reflected by their usual gx signals of 1.800 or 1.783, respectively (23Brasseur G. Sled V. Liebl U. Ohnishi T. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11685-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3464-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, the steady-state bc1 complex activities measured using 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone as a substrate analog indicated that the presence of the L286F mutation decreased the ability of the enzyme to reduce cyt c. This activity decrease was partly due to the substoichiometry of the iron-sulfur subunit in the mutants carrying the L286F mutation and possibly enhanced by the increased sensitivity to the detergent used to disperse the membrane preparations under the assay conditions (25Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A similar effect has been encountered previously during the analyses of the iron-sulfur subunit hinge region deletion mutants (20Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15475-15483Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further characterize these mutants, the effect of the L286F mutation on the redox midpoint potential (Em) of the iron-sulfur subunit [2Fe-2S] cluster was also sought. Potentiometric dark titrations (22Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) of the EPR gy signals were performed as previously (23Brasseur G. Sled V. Liebl U. Ohnishi T. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11685-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3464-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig.1), and the redox midpoint potential at pH 7 (Em7) values thus obtained are shown in Table I. Clearly, the presence of the L286F mutation located in theef loop of cyt b decreased theEm7 of the iron-sulfur subunit [2Fe-2S] cluster by about 50 mV in all mutants as compared with their respective parent strains. Next, detailed functional analyses of mutantbc1 complexes in L286F, +1AlaL286F and +2AlaL286F were undertaken, and light-induced time-resolved single turnover cyt c rereduction and cyt b reduction kinetics were recorded as previously (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) at 550–540 and 560–570 nm, respectively, in the presence of 5 μm antimycin A. First, both cyt c and cyt b kinetics were monitored at an ambient potential (Eh) value of 100 mV where the quinone pool contains both Q and QH2, and the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the iron-sulfur subunit is fully reduced, as shown in Figs. 2 and3A. Compared with a wild type strain of R. capsulatus, the L286F mutation had at most a 2-fold decrease on cyt c and cyt b kinetics (Table I). But it had no effect on the mobility of the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain because cyt c rereduction traces obtained in the presence of myxothiazol did not exhibit any slower phase (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, this slower phase, which is clearly visible with the +1Ala mutant, was absent in the case of the +1AlaL286F double mutant (Fig. 2, C andD), indicating that this revertant recovered a faster movement of its iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain, in agreement with its better Ps+ growth ability. It is noteworthy that in the case of the +1AlaL286F mutant the cyt c rereduction rate (∼35% of the wild type) deduced by fitting a single exponential to the visible portion of the kinetic traces obtained in the absence of inhibitor is not faster than that seen with the +1Ala mutant (Table I). Finally, the L286F mutation had almost no beneficial effect in the case of the +2Ala mutant (Fig. 2, E and F), because the +2AlaL286F double mutant was, like its defective parent +2Ala mutant, still unable to exhibit any appreciable cyt crereduction in the absence of inhibitor or in the presence of myxothiazol. Therefore, the overall data clearly indicated that the L286F substitution could only suppress the mobility defect of the iron-sulfur subunit cluster in the case of the +1Ala, but not +2Ala mutants.Figure 3cytb reduction kinetics in various mutants. cyt b reduction kinetics in the presence of 5 μm antimycin A were triggered by flash activation of the photochemical reaction center and recorded at 560–570 nm using chromatophore membranes poised at either 100 mV (A) or 400 mV (B), as described in Refs. 19Darrouzet E.

Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), respectively, the results obtained were quite different (Fig. 3B and TableI). The +1Ala, +1AlaL286F, +2Ala, and +2AlaL286F exhibited cytb reduction kinetics similar to (or even faster in some cases than) that seen with a wild type bc1complex, demonstrating that a single round of QH2 oxidation at the Qo site occurred normally in these mutants. Indeed, this activity was inhibited fully by myxothiazol in all cases (not shown) and absent in a mutant like Y147A that was previously shown to have a defective Qo site (26Saribas A.S. Ding H. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16004-16012Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was slightly reduced in the case of L286F mutant (∼45% of the wild type) in a way similar to that seen at 100 mV (Table I). Therefore, even in the case of the +2Ala mutant QH2 oxidation still occurred at the Qo site provided that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the iron-sulfur subunit is oxidized, although subsequent reduction of cytc1 heme by this cluster was seriously hampered because of its restricted motion. Available structural data for the mitochondrial bc1 complex show that theef loop of cyt b sticks out of the membrane as a surface feature at the Qo site. Hence, it represents a conspicuous barrier on the trajectory of the iron-sulfur subunit that needs to be crossed during the movement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster domain from the Qo site stigmatellin (8Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). This loop appears to be highly flexible because it is located in a different position in comparison with the other structures of the bc1complex (7Xia D. Yu C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) when the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain is in the intermediate position (9Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Although this position of the efloop may be artificial because of stabilizing crystal contacts, nonetheless it suggests that this loop could move. Further, comparisons of various structurally defined positions of the iron-sulfur subunit indicate that its movement is composed of a translation and a rotation. Thus, a too long or too rigid hinge may lead the extrinsic domain of the iron-sulfur subunit to clash with theef loop of cyt b. Indeed, as seen with the +1Ala and +2Ala mutants the longer the hinge is, the more blocked is the movement (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The movement is also prevented when the hinge is too rigid as in the 6Pro mutant (i.e. when six amino acids of the hinge are substituted by six consecutive proline residues), yet it can readily occur when a rigid but shorter hinge is present (i.e. 3ProΔ3 mutant) (20Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15475-15483Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although second site suppressor mutations of the +1Ala revertant located on the ef loop of cyt b are not unexpected, substituting the Leu residue at position 286 (corresponding to 262 in bovine numbering) by a Phe with an even larger side chain may appear surprising at first. However, the side chain of Phe as an aromatic ring is planar unlike that of Leu, which is tetrahedral. Molecular modeling indicates that one of the most favorable rotamers of Phe at this position could place this side chain away from the iron-sulfur cluster domain to diminish any possible steric hindrance as illustrated in Fig.4. Hopefully, resolution of the structure of R. capsulatus bc1 complex, currently in progress, will provide a better understanding of the impact of the L286F second site reversion on the interactions of the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain with the flexible ef loop of cyt b during Qo site catalysis. Interestingly, the L286F mutation alone affects slightly both the assembly of the iron-sulfur subunit to the bc1 complex and the Qo site catalysis. In particular, the slower cytb reduction rates seen at 400 mV, an ambient redox potential at which cyt b kinetics are virtually independent of the movement of the iron-sulfur subunit (Table I), suggest that the L286F substitution in the +1Ala background improved mainly the difficulty of the iron-sulfur subunit to move rather than its ability to catalyze QH2 oxidation. However, this improvement is limited because in the case of the +2Ala mutant the L286F suppressor mutation has little, if any, effect because almost no electron transfer between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and cyt c1 can be observed with the +2AlaL286F double mutant (Fig. 2). Thus, if the hinge becomes too long the L286F substitution is not sufficient to allow the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain to move across the efloop barrier. The effect of the L286F mutation is also seen on the [2Fe-2S] cluster Em with a decrease in the wild type as well as the +1Ala and +2Ala mutant backgrounds, suggesting that the environment of the cluster must have been changed. When the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain is proteolytically cleaved off thebc1 complex into a soluble form or when the Qo site is occupied with myxothiazol that releases the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain away from the stigmatellin position in the Qo site, the Em value of the [2Fe-2S] cluster decreases (11Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3464-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The lowerEm values seen in the presence of the L286F mutation therefore strongly suggest that in these mutants the cluster must be in a more polar environment because of a more leaky shield provided by ef loop around the cluster. If indeed this is the case, then the L286F mutation must be overcoming the steric hindrance inflicted by a longer hinge at the expense of rendering the Qo site more solvent-accessible, in agreement with the slower QH2 oxidation rates observed in the case of the +1AlaL286F mutant. Thus, although the L286F mutation per seis slightly harmful for Qo site catalysis, it improves the movement of the iron-sulfur subunit in the case of the +1Ala mutant, resulting in better growth of the +1AlaL286F double mutant. In the native enzyme, although this region acts as a barrier for the movement, it conceivably may hold the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain in the Qo site in a position optimal for catalysis. The two opposing effects seen with the L286F mutation clearly reflect the dual role of the ef loop of cyt b providing a shield that is tight enough but not too much to not hinder the movement. 3The conclusion that the ef loop is important both for the movement and for the Qo site catalysis is also supported by the analyses of additional mutations in the same region of cyt b, such as the Thr288substitutions and their revertants (E. Darrouzet and F. Daldal, manuscript in preparation). Obviously, additional studies are needed to understand the crucial role played by the ef loop region and its interactions with the iron-sulfur subunit during the catalytic cycle of the bc1complex. In particular, is this loop just a flexible domain pushed away by the iron-sulfur subunit during its motion, or does it play an active role in controlling the movement in response to specific redox events at the Qo site? In this respect, it is noteworthy that when one of the electrons provided by a QH2 oxidation in the Qo site is blocked in the low potential cyt bchain by the presence of antimycin A in the ubiquinone reduction site, this electron cannot return back to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the iron-sulfur subunit in a millisecond time scale, implying coordination of events occurring at the Qo and ubiquinone reduction sites. If this is the case, then could it be due to the efloop prohibiting the iron-sulfur subunit to return back to the Qo site until the opportune time? Additional aspects of thebc1 complex mechanism of function, in particular the role of the different subdomains encountered at the Qosite, are also highlighted in this study. First, a comparison of the cyt b kinetics recorded at 400 mV with the cytc1 kinetics, especially using the +2Ala or +2AlaL286F mutant, clearly show that the rate of the cytc1 rereduction can be casually null, whereas cytb reduction kinetics are quasi-wild type. Thus, the concerted electron bifurcation mechanism at the Qo site must indeed occur between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and cyt low potentialb-type heme and not between the cytc1 and cyt low potential b-type heme, and careful analyses are needed when redox kinetics of these cofactors are considered, especially when the movement of the iron-sulfur subunit may be impaired. Second, the overall data indicate that the movement of the iron-sulfur subunit appears to have two discrete phases with a “micro-movement” at the interface of cyt b moving the cluster domain away from the stigmatellin subdomain of the Qo site and a “macro-movement” crossing theef loop toward cyt c1. In respect to the first step, data obtained using EPR spectroscopy (24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3464-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and proteolysis experiments performed in the presence of myxothiazol (21Valkova-Valchanova M. Darrouzet E. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15484-15492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3464-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggest that the micro-movement still occurs even when the macro-movement is prohibited and is enough to assure QH2oxidation. Indeed the +2Ala and +2AlaL286F mutants, which are blocked for the movement and hence cannot transfer electrons to cytc1, still catalyze QH2 oxidation provided that the [2Fe-2S] cluster is initially oxidized. Moreover, the data also indicate that the macro-movement of the iron-sulfur subunit from the Qo site toward cytc1 is necessary for multiple turnovers of thebc1 complex. Finally, it is noteworthy that the displacement of the cluster domain, required for binding myxothiazol, is more difficult in mutants unable to perform the macro-movement. The +2Ala and 6Pro mutants, like the alanine mutants in yeast (16Nett J.H. Hunte C. Trumpower B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), exhibit increased resistance to myxothiazol because large excess of this inhibitor is required to displace their iron-sulfur subunit out of the stigmatellin subdomain to obtain a pure gxsignal (24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3464-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyt c rereduction kinetics with the +1Ala mutant in the presence of myxothiazol are faster than with no inhibitor (19Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a similar phenomenon called “overshoot” has also been observed by Crofts and co-workers (27Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with theRhodobacter sphaeroides native bc1complex. These observations suggest that in the presence of Q the reduced iron-sulfur subunit needs to break some interactions to move away from the stigmatellin subdomain and that the energy required for it can be seen kinetically even with the native enzyme complex. Hopefully, future work will shed further light on these intriguing aspects of the bc1 complex mechanism of function."
https://openalex.org/W2039034683,"We have performed resonance Raman studies on ferrous NO- and CO-adducts of cytochrome P450cam and investigated the effects of diprotein complex formation with reduced putidaredoxin. We have found that the Fe-NO stretching mode of NO-P450cam can be resolved into two peaks at 551 and 561 cm−1, and the binding of putidaredoxin increases the intensity of the high frequency component. Because the Fe-NO mode has been shown to be more sensitive to the nature of the heme proximal ligand than to the distal pocket environment, such a perturbation upon putidaredoxin binding is suggestive of changes in conformation or electronic structure that affect the proximal iron-cysteine bond. In accordance with this idea, the isotope shifts for the Fe-XO stretching and Fe-X–O bending modes (X = N or C) are insensitive to the presence or absence of putidaredoxin, indicating that the geometry of the Fe-X–O unit is not significantly altered by the complex formation. On the other hand, complex formation does induce a perturbation of the low frequency heme vibrational modes, suggesting that alterations of the heme electronic structure and/or geometry take place when putidaredoxin binds. We also find that cytochromeb5 minimally affects the heme active site of the enzyme, although both putidaredoxin and cytochromeb5 bind to the same or similar site on P450cam. These observations suggest that there is a key specific interaction between P450cam and putidaredoxin, and that this interaction increases the population of a protein conformation that exhibits structural and/or electronic distortions of the heme group associated with the proximal side of the heme pocket and the S → Fe electron donation.

Cytochrome P 450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar). One of the most distinctive features in the structure of cytochrome P450 is the coordination of a thiolate anion, from the proximal cysteine residue, to the heme iron as a fifth ligand (2Champion P.M. Stallard B.R. Wagner G.C. Gunsalus I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5469-5472Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450cam(P450cam)1 from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida (CYP101) catalyzes the regio- and stereospecific hydroxylation of its substrate,d-camphor. The P450cam catalyzed reaction requires an external source of two electrons from NADH through the combined action of the FAD-flavoprotein putidaredoxin reductase and the iron-sulfur (2Fe/2S) protein putidaredoxin (Pd). In addition to its redox role, Pd has been shown to act as an effector in P450cam catalysis. A kinetic analysis suggests that the diprotein complex between oxygenated P450cam and reduced Pd is the active species for camphor hydroxylation (3Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C.

In accordance with this idea, previous spectroscopic studies on the P450cam·Pd complex have shown that the heme active site of P450cam is influenced by Pd (3Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namvedt M.J.

The Chemical Society of Japan, Tokyo1984: 492-493Google Scholar) reported that the Fe-CO (νFe-CO) and C-O (νC-O) stretching frequencies changed when reduced Pd was added to the ferrous CO-P450cam. Similar functional or spectroscopic effects of the complex formation were also observed for other cytochrome P450 systems such as mitochondrial cytochrome P450scc·adrenodoxin (8Tsubaki M. Yoshikawa S. Ichikawa Y. Yu N.-T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8991-8999Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and various microsomal cytochrome P450·cytochrome b5 (cytb5) couples (9Perret A.

It is interesting to note here that P450cam binds cyt b5 and Pd at the same or overlapping sites (11Stayton P.S. Poulos T.L. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8201-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and cytb5 also acts as an effector for P450cam (3Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol.

In a previous study, we have shown that the diprotein complex formation between ferric P450cam and oxidized Pd affects the stretching frequency of the heme iron-proximal Cys357(Fe-S) bond (6Unno M.

This observation suggests that a perturbation of the Fe-S bond takes place upon P450cam·Pd complex formation. The perturbation of the Fe-S bond is in accord with the fact that Pd binds to the proximal surface of P450cam (12Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G.

On the other hand, complex formation with Pd has also been shown to affect distal side ligands (CO or CN−) of the heme iron (4Makino R. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Uno T. Nishimura Y. Tsuboi M.

Recently, Tomita et al. (19Tomita T. Hirota S. Ogura T. Olson J.S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 7044-7054Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Vogel et al.(20Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M.

For the CO ligand, the two main factors that affect the νFe-CO and νC-O frequencies are: 1) the polarity of distal residues in the heme pocket and their proximity to the CO, and 2) the nature of the axial ligand trans to the CO (16Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

Olson J.S. Sage J.T. Champion P.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2670-2671Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the distal pocket polarity has little effect on the Fe-NO mode (19Tomita T. Hirota S. Ogura T. Olson J.S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 7044-7054Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the νFe-NO frequency is more sensitive to the nature of the heme proximal ligand than is νFe-CO (20Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9915-9921Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Indeed, the distal pocket environment has a relatively small influence on νFe-NO in ferrous NO-P450cam. For example, the νFe-CO mode, occurring at 464 cm−1 in the absence of substrate, shifts to 484 cm−1 (+20 cm−1) upon the binding of camphor substrate, whereas the binding of camphor increases the νFe-NO only from 547 to 554 cm−1 (+7 cm−1) (18Uno T.

Therefore, a comparative vibrational study on the CO and NO adducts of heme proteins offers an experimental probe that helps to delineate proximal and distal interactions between the heme and its environment. In this work, we have performed resonance Raman investigations of NO- and CO-adducts of ferrous P450cam in the presence or absence of reduced Pd to obtain information concerning the structural and electronic mechanisms associated with complex formation. As a control, we compare the resonance Raman spectra of the P450cam·Pd complex with spectra from the enzymatically active (but nonphysiological) complex between P450cam and cyt b5. Wild-type P450cam and Pd were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using published procedure (24Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C.

The synthesis and expression of the rat liver cytochrome b5 gene in E. coli have been described previously (25von Bodman S.B. Schuler M.A. Jollie D.R. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9443-9447Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Isotopic Na15NO2 (98% 15N) and13CO (99%, ∼10% 18O) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Inc. The ferrous P450cam was prepared by anaerobically adding 1 μl of sodium dithionite solution (∼570 mm) to the previously degassed enzyme (29 μl of ∼0.2 mm enzyme), from which the CO adducts were generated by exposure of the samples to CO gas. The NO adducts of ferrous P450cam were prepared according to a published protocol (23Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9760-9766Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ferric P450cam sample was degassed by flushing with a water-saturated argon gas for several minutes. It was then reduced by injecting ∼50-fold excess sodium dithionite solution with respect to ferric P450cam, followed by 20-fold sodium nitrite to form the nitric oxide adduct. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained using a Spex 1870B spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, Inc.) and a holographic notch filter (Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc.). The 356.4 and 413.1 nm lines from a krypton ion laser (Coherent Innova 300) and the 441.6 nm line from a helium-cadmium laser (Omnichrome Inc.) were employed as the excitation sources. All the spectra were taken at room temperature. We used a standard quartz fluorimeter cuvette (3 × 3 × 48 mm) (NSG Precision Cells, Inc.) for the ferric P450cam sample, whereas the measurements for the ferrous NO- and CO-adducts enzyme were made using a quartz spinning cell to minimize the contribution of photodissociated species. The noise spikes in the spectra caused by cosmic rays were removed by a commercial derivative filter software routine (Princeton Instruments, Inc.). All Raman spectra were calibrated using neat fenchone. The accuracy of the absolute frequencies is about ± 1 cm−1, and less than ± 0.2 cm−1 for relative shifts of strong and/or isolated bands. The accuracy of the Raman setup was estimated from a statistical analysis of the Fe-His stretching mode of deoxymyoglobin, and the details are described elsewhere (26Christian J.F. Unno M. Sage J.T. Champion P.M. Chien E. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11198-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resonance Raman spectra of a standard sample, such as the uncomplexed P450cam, were taken both before and after a series of Raman measurements to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of the data. The peak positions in the Raman spectra are measured by fitting the data with Lorentzian line shapes on a linear background using a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine. Fig. 1 shows the low frequency resonance Raman spectra of ferrous NO-P450cam. The resonance Raman spectra from the14NO (trace b) and 15NO (trace a) adducts and their difference spectrum (trace d) confirm previous results (23Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9760-9766Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), showing Raman bands near 553 and 446 cm−1 for Fe-NO stretching and Fe-N–O bending modes, respectively. The figure also compares the resonance Raman spectra of ferrous NO-P450cam in the presence (trace c) or absence (trace b) of reduced Pd. As can be seen in the difference spectrum (trace e), the complex formation with reduced Pd significantly perturbs the spectrum of the NO-adduct enzyme. Because the Raman signal from reduced Pd was negligible (data not shown), the observed changes are attributable to NO-P450cam. The most distinct feature is observed for the Fe-NO stretching mode around 550 cm−1, which appears to be up-shifted by ∼5 cm−1 in the P450cam·Pd complex. Fig. 2 further examines the Fe-NO stretching mode region of ferrous NO-P450cam. We have found that all samples examined can be well fit with two major components within the νFe-NO band. Peak fitting analysis identifies the two bands near 551 and 561 cm−1 for the14NO-adduct P450cam and at around 534 and 544 cm−1 for the 15NO-adduct enzyme (TableI). Note that a change in line shape is observed upon isotopic substitution (Fig. 2, traces a and c) and the fits result in different relative intensities for the two bands. On the basis of independent measurements, we estimate that the fitting errors are less than 1 cm−1 and 10% for the frequencies and areas, respectively. Therefore, we attribute the different relative intensities to an underlying porphyrin mode near 545–550 cm−1. The two major peaks are assigned to different protein conformations because the relative peak positions remain fixed between the 14NO and15NO adducts (i.e. Fermi resonance splitting, if present, is a minor effect). Moreover, Fig. 2 demonstrates that the complex formation with reduced Pd significantly changes the fractional contribution of the two components. The Pd-induced redistribution of the two components leads to the apparent up-shift for the νFe-NO band. Note that the Fe-N–O bending mode (δFeNO) is also increased by +1.8 cm−1 upon binding of reduced Pd. The 14NO/15NO isotope shifts of the νFe-NO and δFeNO modes for the NO-P450cam·Pd complex are compared with the isotope shifts of the uncomplexed enzyme in Table I, where it can be seen that the isotope shifts for these vibrational modes are unchanged upon Pd binding.Table IVibrational frequencies and isotope shifts of the NO- and CO-associated Raman bands (cm−1) of cytochrome P450camνFe-XO▵νFe-XO1-a▵νFe-XO and ▵δFeXO indicate the corresponding isotopic shifts of12CO–13CO and 14NO–15NO for CO- and NO-adducts of ferrous P450cam, respectively.δFeXO▵δFeXO1-a▵νFe-XO and ▵δFeXO indicate the corresponding isotopic shifts of12CO–13CO and 14NO–15NO for CO- and NO-adducts of ferrous P450cam, respectively.NO-P450cam νa1-bνa and νb refer to the two conformations associated with the Fe-NO stretching mode.550.6−16.7446.0−1.4 νb1-bνa and νb refer to the two conformations associated with the Fe-NO stretching mode.561.1−17.2NO-P450cam/Pd νa1-bνa and νb refer to the two conformations associated with the Fe-NO stretching mode.551.1−19.6447.8−1.6 νb1-bνa and νb refer to the two conformations associated with the Fe-NO stretching mode.561.3−15.8CO-P450cam482.5−4.5561.4−16.7CO-P450cam/Pd484.9−4.7561.5−17.1Experimental conditions were 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer with 1 mm camphor, pH 7.4.1-a ▵νFe-XO and ▵δFeXO indicate the corresponding isotopic shifts of12CO–13CO and 14NO–15NO for CO- and NO-adducts of ferrous P450cam, respectively.1-b νa and νb refer to the two conformations associated with the Fe-NO stretching mode.

In addition to the affect on νFe-NO and δFeNO, Pd binding weakly perturbs a variety of other porphyrin vibrational modes as seen in Fig. 1. For instance, complex formation with reduced Pd causes a ∼1 cm−1 up-shift of the ν7 mode at 676 cm−1. Other Raman bands, at 356 and 821 cm−1, are also weakly perturbed by Pd binding (Table II).Table IIFrequencies of some heme vibrational modes of cytochrome P450cam (cm−1)ν72-aUnassigned mode.2-aUnassigned mode.2-aUnassigned mode.2-aUnassigned mode.NO-P450cam675.6355.5821.2NO-P450cam/Pd676.7 (+1.1)356.6 (+1.1)822.7 (+1.5)CO-P450cam674.0351.3420.3716.6CO-P450cam/Pd675.9 (+1.9)349.0 (−1.3)422.5 (+2.2)717.9 (+1.3)Experimental conditions were 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer with 1 mm camphor, pH 7.4.

The putidaredoxin-induced shifts are shown in parentheses. We also examine the effects of reduced Pd complexation with ferrous CO-P450cam. The upper two spectra in Fig.3 demonstrate low frequency resonance Raman spectra of 13CO- and 12CO-derivatives of ferrous P450cam. The two Raman bands associated with the Fe-CO unit, Fe-CO stretching (483 cm−1) and Fe-C–O bending (560 cm−1) modes, are apparent from the isotopic difference spectrum shown as trace d of Fig. 3and in Fig. 4. These frequencies are consistent with the reported values (18Uno T. Nishimura Y. Makino R. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Tsuboi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2023-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the results are summarized in Table I. Figs. 3 and 4 further investigate the effects of reduced Pd on CO-P450cam. Similar to the case of NO-P450cam, the complex formation with reduced Pd significantly perturbs the resonance Raman spectrum of the CO-adduct enzyme. As can be seen, the Fe-CO stretching mode at 483 cm−1 is ∼2 cm−1 up-shifted by the complex formation, and this observation agrees with a previous report of Makinoet al. (4Makino R. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Uno T. Nishimura Y. Tsuboi M. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Raman Spectroscopy. The Chemical Society of Japan, Tokyo1984: 492-493Google Scholar). We note here that the observed shift may be because of an altered fraction of the multiple νFe-COmodes in the CO-P450cam·Pd complex (Fig. 4). In fact, the Fe-CO band shape appears to be slightly perturbed by Pd binding, although the band profile is too featureless to fit reliably with multiple peaks to draw a firm conclusion about this point.Figure 4Resonance Raman spectra of ferrous CO-P450cam in the Fe-CO stretching mode region in the presence and absence of reduced putidaredoxin. The difference spectra of the putidaredoxin binding effect for 12CO and13CO are shown in traces e andf, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Evidently, Pd binding does not affect the δFeCO bending mode. Although Fig. 4 shows the presence of a small Pd-induced shift near 560 cm−1 in the difference spectrum (trace e), we assign this to a porphyrin mode because no analogous Pd binding effects for δFeCO are observed near 545 cm−1 in the 13CO-P450cam sample (trace f). We also compared the12CO/13CO isotope shifts of the νFe-CO and δFeCO modes in the presence and absence of reduced Pd. As summarized in Table I, the binding of Pd has little effect on the isotope shifts of these vibrational modes. In addition to changes in νFe-CO, we have found that Pd significantly perturbs ν7 as well as other Raman bands in the low frequency region (Fig. 3, Table II). Most of the other Pd-induced perturbations arise from peak shifts and intensity changes of porphyrin modes in the 400 and 800 cm−1 regions, which can be seen in both the 12CO-P450cam(trace e) and the 13CO-adduct enzyme (trace f). We have also examined the effects of reduced Pd binding to CO-P450cam using optical absorption spectroscopy and found that the absorption spectrum of the uncomplexed ferrous CO-bound enzyme shows an intense Soret absorption band at 446 nm, whereas the Soret band of the CO-P450cam·Pd complex is red-shifted by ∼1.5 nm (data not shown). This suggests that the resonance absorption (Soret) band shift is probably intimately connected with the Pd induced changes in the porphyrin mode Raman intensities shown in Fig. 3. Stayton et al. (11Stayton P.S. Poulos T.L. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8201-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that Pd competitively inhibits the cyt b5association with P450cam, suggesting that cytb5 and Pd bind to the same or similar site on P450cam. Thus, the effect of cyt b5binding is compared with that for Pd. Fig.5A shows the effect of ferric cyt b5 on the Fe-S stretch at 351 cm−1 and other low frequency vibrations of ferric P450cam. As can be seen in the figure, there are subtle changes in the difference spectrum; however, cytb5 has only a minor affect on the νFe-S frequency. This result clearly contrasts to the case of P450cam·Pd complex, where we found a ∼3 cm−1 up-shift of the νFe-S mode (6Unno M. Christian J.F. Benson D.E. Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. Champion P.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6614-6620Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Note that we used 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer in this experiment, so that the fraction of the complex formation is more than 90% using the reported dissociation constant (Kd = 1.1 μm) (28Stayton P.S. Fisher M.T. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13544-13548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the negligible effect of cytb5 binding is not because of the presence of uncomplexed enzyme in the sample. Thus, Fig. 5A demonstrates that the influence of the cyt b5 binding on P450cam is distinct from that of Pd, although these two proteins bind to the same or a similar site on P450cam. Resonance Raman spectroscopy was also performed on an equal molar mixture of ferrous CO-P450cam/ferrous cytb5, and the results are shown in Fig.5B. We observed no significant cyt b5effect on the CO-P450cam Raman spectrum. Because the optical absorption spectrum of the ferrous CO-P450cam/ferrous cyt b5 mixture also shows no evidence of perturbation (data not shown), these results demonstrate that, in contrast to Pd, ferrous cytb5 binding does not significantly affect the CO-P450cam heme optical or vibrational properties. However, it remains possible (but improbable) that CO binding affects the affinity between ferrous cyt b5 and ferrous CO-P450cam to such an extent that complex formation does not occur. Determination of the dissociation constant for the ferrous CO-P450cam/ferrous cyt b5 couple would be required to clarify this point. The iron-exogenous ligand vibrations, such as νFe-XO and νX-O, have been studied as a sensitive structural probe of various heme proteins (29Kerr E.A. Yu N.-T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 39-96Google Scholar), and the vibrational properties of the FeCO moiety have been characterized extensively. The Fe-CO bonds are dominated by Fe dπ → CO π* back-bonding donation; as this increases, the Fe-C bond order goes up and the C-O bond order goes down. Thus, there is a negative νFe-COversus νC-O frequency correlation (17Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 21Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). One of the main factors that affects the back-bonding donation is the polarity of distal residues in the heme pocket and their proximity to the CO (16Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

For instance, a positive polar interaction, such as hydrogen bonding between the distal pocket and the bound CO, increases the back donation, thereby increasing the νFe-CO and decreasing the νC-O. Makino et al. (4Makino R. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Uno T. Nishimura Y. Tsuboi M. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Raman Spectroscopy. The Chemical Society of Japan, Tokyo1984: 492-493Google Scholar) reported that the binding of Pd decreases the νC-O frequency of CO-P450cam by 8 cm−1, whereas the νFe-CO is increased by 2 cm−1. The Pd-induced up-shift of the Fe-CO stretching mode is further confirmed in this study (Figs. 3 and 4). On the basis of the negative νFe-CO/νC-O correlation mentioned above, the Pd-induced up-shift of νFe-CO along with the down-shift of νC-O might be attributed to protein structural changes that increase the positive polar character of the distal pocket. However, the magnitude of the shifts caused by Pd binding is not quantitatively consistent with the back-bonding correlation. This correlation predicts roughly 1.5-fold larger shift for the νC-O compared with that for the νFe-CO (7Sjodin T. Christian J.F. Macdonald I.D.G. Davydov R. Unno M. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M.

Previously, the electron paramagnetic resonance signature of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and its redox midpoint potential (Em) value have been used extensively to characterize the interactions of the [2Fe-2S] cluster with the occupants of the ubihydroquinone oxidation (Qo) catalytic site. In this work we analyze these interactions in various iron-sulfur subunit mutants that carry mutations in its flexible hinge region. We show that theEm increases of the iron-sulfur subunit [2Fe-2S] cluster induced either by these mutations or by the addition of stigmatellin do not act synergistically. Moreover, theEm increases disappear in the presence of class I inhibitors like myxothiazol. Because various inhibitors are known to affect the location of the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain, the measured Em value of the [2Fe-2S] cluster therefore reflects its equilibrium position in the Qo site. We also demonstrate the existence in this site of a location where theEm of the cluster is increased by about 150 mV and discuss its possible implications in term of Qo site catalysis and energetics.

Using three redox-active subunits (cyt b, cytc1, and the iron-sulfur protein) and two active sites (Qo and ubiquinone reduction sites), it catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubihydroquinone (QH2) to ac-type cyt according to a mechanism known as the modified ubiquinone (Q) cycle (4Mitchell P.

This electron transfer is coupled to a proton transport across the membrane and contributes to the generation of the electrochemical gradient subsequently used for ATP synthesis via the ATP synthase. The key of the bc1 complex energetics relies on the bifurcation of electrons at the Qosite. Upon QH2 oxidation at this catalytic site one electron is transferred to a high potential chain constituted of a [2Fe-2S] cluster carried by the iron-sulfur subunit and ac-type cyt borne by the cyt c1subunit. The other electron is transferred to a low potential chain constituted of two b-type hemes (high potentialb-type heme and low potential b-type heme (bL)) and then to a Q or a semiubiquinone radical at the ubiquinone reduction site, all carried by the cytb subunit.

Although we now know that oxidation of QH2 at the Qo site is followed by an apparently concerted transfer of the two electrons, the movement of the iron-sulfur subunit, and the release of two protons, little is known about the details of these reactions. In particular, the order of the events of electron transfer, deprotonation, and proton release and how the movement is controlled and coordinated in respect to other redox events remain unknown. Thus, information concerning the position of the cluster domain in the Qo site and its interactions with the Qo site occupants or with different subdomains of the Qo site is important. In recent years, the EPR signature of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster and its redox midpoint potential (Em) value and the orientation of itsg tensors have been used extensively for this purpose (6Ding H.

In this work we show that the Em value of the [2Fe-2S] cluster reflects the equilibrium position of the iron-sulfur subunit cluster domain in the Qo site. We also demonstrate the existence in this site of a location where theEm of this cluster is greatly increased and discuss the possible implications of these findings in terms of the energetics of Qo site catalysis.

Trumpower (Darmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). Tridecyl-stigmatellin and MOA-stilbene were generous gifts from T. E. Wiggins (ICI Agrochemicals, Bracknell, UK), and P. R. Rich (University College, London, UK). Previously, we had isolated several mutations in theR. capsulatus iron-sulfur subunit hinge region (between the residues 43 and 49) to investigate its role in the large scale domain movement of this subunit during Qo site catalysis (23Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4567-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F.

Detailed analyses of mutant bc1 complexes indicated that indeed many of these mutations perturbed at varying degrees the Qo site events. In particular, several of these mutations, such as the +1Ala and +2Ala insertions (insertion of one or two alanine residues between Ala46 and Met47) (23Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15475-15483Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), led to the striking observation that the redox midpoint potential at pH 7 (Em7) values of their [2Fe-2S] cluster were increased by 30–140 mV above that of the wild type [2Fe-2S] cluster (Fig.1A and TableI). Because of the large distance (over 20 Å) between the location of these mutations and the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the iron-sulfur subunit, these effects were considered unlikely to be direct. Rather, they could be mediated by a change in the position of the cluster domain in the Qo site leading to a change of the environment of this cofactor. However, for the +2Ala and 6Pro (Fig. 1B), the V44L and A46T (40Brasseur G. Sled V. Liebl U. Ohnishi T. Daldal F.

Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that this inhibitor does not drastically change the Em value of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the iron-sulfur subunit in the native bc1complex (30von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42von Jagow G. Ljungdahl P.O. Graf P. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6318-6326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the case of the mutants described above, we have found that myxothiazol had a drastic effect and decreased theEm7 value of the 6Pro mutant by about 150 mV. It also brought down the Em7 values of the +1Ala and +2Ala insertion mutants to the range of 290–320 mV (Fig.2A and Table I). A slight decrease in the Em7 value of the wild typebc1 complex could also be observed, but this change was certainly within the reliability (approximately ± 25 mV) of these measurements using chromatophore membranes. Remarkably,Em7 values ranging from 270 to 320 mV for the iron-sulfur subunit of the wild type bc1 complex from R. capsulatus can be found in the literature (43Robertson D.E. Ding H. Chelminski P.R.

On the other hand, in contrast to the unmodified EPR signals seen with all of the mutants in the absence of inhibitor (i.e. in the presence of native Q), alterations of the gxpeak shape could be readily detected in the presence of myxothiazol. This effect was clearly seen with the +2Ala and 6Pro mutants (Fig.2B), where the position of the gxresonance peak became narrower and shifted downfield. The effect of MOA-stilbene, which is another class I inhibitor, on theEm value of the +1Ala mutant [2Fe-2S] cluster was also tested and found to be similar to that seen with myxothiazol (not shown). Indeed, the Em7 value of 370 mV observed in the absence of inhibitor in this mutant decreased to about 315 mV in the presence of MOA-stilbene. This finding is in agreement with the earlier report that this inhibitor decreases theEm value of the [2Fe-2S] cluster by about 30 mV in the case of the native enzyme (45Sharp R.E. Gibney B.R.

Crystallographic data indicated that in the presence of a class I inhibitor, less electron density attributable to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the iron-sulfur subunit was located in theb position, suggesting that the cluster domain moved toward a more “released” position (20Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 46Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M.

Stimulation of smooth muscle cells by IGF-I requires αVβ3 ligand occupancy, and enhanced αVβ3 ligand occupancy augments IGF-I actions. Therefore, IGF-I-induced changes in αVβ3 ligand binding may act to further enhance IGF-I actions. Integrin-associated protein (IAP) has been shown to be associated with αVβ3 and is required for the binding of αVβ3 to vitronectin-coated beads. We therefore investigated whether IGF-I could stimulate IAP-αVβ3 association resulting in enhanced ligand binding. IGF-I stimulated an increase in IAP-αVβ3 association. This was due, at least in part, to an IGF-I-stimulated redistribution of IAP from the Triton-insoluble fraction of the cell to the Triton-soluble fraction of the cell, where most of the αVβ3 was located. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway blocked both the redistribution of IAP and the increase in IAP-αVβ3 association, providing further evidence that the redistribution of IAP is essential for the increase in association. An anti-IAP monoclonal antibody, blocked both the IGF-I-stimulated increase in IAP-αVβ3complex formation and cell migration.

The αVβ3 integrin is an important cellular membrane receptor that is utilized by IGF-I to regulate vascular smooth muscle cell migration. Specific inhibitors of αVβ3 ligand occupancy block IGF-I-stimulated migration (4Clemmons D.R. Horvitz G. Engleman W. Nichols T. Moralez A. Nickols G.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4616-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, treatment of cells with IGF-I has been shown to increase ligand binding by αVβ3 (5Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This IGF-I-induced change in αVβ3 affinity may be an important component of its ability to stimulate cell migration. The mechanism by which IGF-I stimulates the increase in ligand binding is unknown. IGF-I does not physically associate with αVβ3 (6Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which suggests that IGF-I may be acting via an intermediary protein to exert its effects on αVβ3 affinity. Signals from within the cell can result in changes in integrin ligand affinity and avidity. One of the proteins implicated in these events is integrin-associated protein (IAP), also termed CD47. IAP was first identified due to its association with αVβ3purified from placenta (7Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). IAP is expressed on many mammalian cells and consists of a N-terminal (extracellular) immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-type domain followed by five potential membrane-spanning hydrophobic helices and a cytoplasmic tail (8Rosales C. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Its involvement in integrin signaling is suggested both by its physical association with integrins (7Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and by experimental results showing that antibodies to IAP affect a large number of functions associated with αVβ3 (9Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, anti-IAP antibodies inhibit the binding of αVβ3 in a variety of cells lines (11Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) to vitronectin (Vn)-coated beads. Furthermore, it has been shown that the IAP-negative cell line OV10 (an ovarian carcinoma cell line) can only bind Vn-coated beads if these cells are made to express IAP (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because IGF-I exposure enhances ligand binding to αVβ3, we determined whether IGF-I receptor activation altered the physical association of IAP with αVβ3 and thereby increased its ability to bind to ligands and whether inhibition of IAP-αVβ3 association resulted in inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated cell migration. To investigate the mechanism by which IGF-I stimulated IAP-αVβ3association, we determined whether αVβ3 and IAP were associated with different lipid compartments of the cellular membrane and whether IGF-I could alter this distribution, thus allowing better access of IAP to αVβ3. Human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Polyvinylidene difluoride filters were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Autoradiographic film was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Polyclonal anti-αV and anti-β3antisera were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal antibody used to detect IAP (B6H12) was a kind gift from Dr. Eric Brown (Washington University, St Louis, MO). Polyclonal antibody against IAP was raised in rabbit against amino acids 50–70 of the human IAP extracellular domain. The polyclonal antibody against β3was raised in rabbit against amino acids 60–85 of the porcine β3 sequence. Biotinylated human Vn was a kind gift from Wayne Engleman (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise stated. Porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (pSMCs) were isolated as described previously (13Gockerman A. Prevette T. Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 ng/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum in 10-cm tissue culture plates. The cells were used between passage 5 and 16. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 48-well plates. The cells were then incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H plus 0.01% bovine serum albumin (SFM) and then exposed to 100 ng/ml IGF-I for the appropriate length of time. The cells were then washed three times with SFM plus 20 mm HEPES and incubated with biotinylated Vn (10−8m) in SFM containing 20 mmHEPES for 5 h at 4 °C. The cells were rinsed again in SFM before lysis at 4 °C in ice-cold buffer A (150 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein were then separated under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, 8% gel. The amount of biotinylated vitronectin in each sample was visualized as described below. Cells were incubated overnight in SFM and then exposed to 100 ng/ml IGF-I as indicated in each figure. Cells were then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed by the addition of 900 μl of boiling 2× Laemmli buffer. Cell lysates were scraped from the dish into microcentrifuge tubes and boiled for 5 min. To reduce viscosity, samples were then sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged again for 5 min. Lysates were then separated under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, 8% gel. The level of each protein was then determined by Western immunoblotting as described below. Cells were incubated overnight in SFM and then exposed to 100 ng/ml IGF-I for the appropriate length of time before lysis at 4 °C in ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (buffer B)). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min 4 °C. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 4 μg/ml B6H12 (an anti-IAP monoclonal antibody) before the addition of IGF-I. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out as described below. Cells were incubated in SFM and then exposed to 100 ng/ml IGF-I for the appropriate length of time before lysis at 4 °C in buffer B. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was termed the Triton-soluble fraction. The remaining pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer C (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The resuspended pellet was re-centrifuged at 14,000 × g for an additional 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was considered to be the Triton-insoluble fraction of the cell, excluding the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. This method has been shown to separate proteins that are bound to membrane rafts (Triton-insoluble) from those that are not raft-associated (Triton-soluble), as verified by sucrose gradient density centrifugation (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 15Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). 10 μl of 4× nonreducing Laemmli buffer was added to 50 μl of each supernatant and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% gel) and then visualized by Western immunoblotting as described below. To test the effect of the various inhibitors on IGF-I-stimulated IAP-integrin association and IGF-I-stimulated redistribution of IAP, following overnight incubation in SFM, the cells were incubated with either 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) or the appropriate inhibitor (100 nm wortmannin or 1 μm Ly294002) for 30 min before the addition of IGF-I. We have previously shown that wortmannin and Ly294002 at these concentrations specifically inhibit different physiological actions of IGF-I and that their inhibitory activity can be maintained for at least 24 h (18Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody (polyclonal anti-αV antibody at 1:1000, polyclonal anti-β3 antibody at 1:1000, or monoclonal anti-IAP antibody (B6H12) at 1:500). Immune complexes were then precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose and incubation for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer. The pellet was suspended in 45 μl of nonreducing Laemmli buffer and heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, 8% gel. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with one of four primary antibodies (the IAP monoclonal antibody (B6H12) at 1:500, the IAP polyclonal antibody at 1:500, the β3 polyclonal antibody at 1:500, or the αVpolyclonal antibody at 1:500) overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times in TBST before incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. To visualize the biotinylated vitronectin, membranes were incubated with extravidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). Binding of the peroxidase-labeled antibody was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown to confluence over a 7-day period with one media change. Wounding was performed as described previously (5Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, a razor blade was used to scrape an area of cells, leaving a denuded area and a sharp visible wound line. The wounded monolayers were then rinsed three times in SFM, and then ten 1-mm areas along the wound edge were selected and recorded for each treatment. The wounded monolayers were then incubated with SFM (plus 2% fetal bovine serum) with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-I. To test the effect of B6H12 on IGF-I-stimulated migration, the wounded monolayers were incubated with B6H12 (4 μg/ml) for 2 h before the addition of IGF-I. The cells were then fixed and stained (Diff Quick; Dade Behring, Inc., Newark, DE), and the number of cells migrating into the wound area was counted. At least five of the previously selected 1-mm areas at the edge of the wound were counted for each data point. Our previous analysis of the wounded monolayer by [3H]thymidine autoradiography demonstrated that the labeling index of pSMCs at the wounded edge was 7 ± 4% at the basal level and 18 ± 7% after treatment with IGF-I. Therefore, <10% of cells present in the denuded area at the end of the migration assay are considered to result from cell division rather than cell migration (5Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Student's t test was used to compare differences between treatments. Band intensities on autoradiographs were measured by scanning densitometry and analyzed using NIH Image, version 1.61. The results shown are representative of at least three similar experiments. A 24-h incubation with IGF-I followed by measurement of biotinylated Vn binding to the cell surface showed that binding was significantly increased (6.1 ± 1.4-fold, mean ± S.E.; n = 3; p< 0.05). This effect required at least 12 h of incubation because no increase was observed at earlier time points. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.1A. There was no significant change in the level of either αV (Fig. 1B) or β3 (Fig. 1C) during the time course of this experiment, and this confirms our previous observation that there was no increase in αVβ3 receptor number in response to IGF-I (5Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This suggests that the increase in αVβ3 ligand binding that occurs after IGF-I receptor stimulation is not simply due to an increase in integrin receptor number and is probably due to a change in the affinity of αVβ3 for vitronectin. The IGF-I receptor does not physically associate with the αVβ3integrin (6Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which suggests that IGF-I exerts its effects on integrin ligand binding via an intermediary protein. Previous reports have suggested that the direct physical association of the extracellular domain of IAP with the αVβ3 integrin is necessary and sufficient for αVβ3 binding to Vn-coated beads (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because both IAP and αVβ3 are expressed on the cell surface, we investigated whether treatment of pSMCs with IGF-I increased the physical association of IAP with αVβ3, thus contributing to the enhancing effect of IGF-I on αVβ3 ligand affinity. We have shown previously that the majority of αV on the surface of pSMCs is associated with β3 (5Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); we therefore used an antibody against the αV subunit to immunoprecipitate the αVβ3 integrin receptor and then immunoblotted for IAP to examine changes in complex formation. Fig.2A shows that in pSMCs, minimal IAP was associated with the αVβ3integrin in the basal state. In contrast, after a 12-h incubation with IGF-I, there was a 6-fold increase in IAP-αVβ3 association, and this increased still further after a 24-h incubation with IGF-I (6.5 ± 1.75-fold, mean ± S.E.; n = 3; p< 0.05). Importantly no increase in IAP-αVβ3 association was detected at the earlier 6 h time point. This time course is the same as that observed for the increase in vitronectin binding shown in Fig. 1. Because IAP forms a complex with the αVβ3dimer but not with either subunit alone, to control for loading differences we immunoblotted for β3 because this would be precipitated with the αV, and we therefore believe it is a better index of the total amount of αVβ3that was immunoprecipitated in each lane. Immunoblotting for β3 shows that there was no change in the amount of αVβ3 immunoprecipitated between the different treatments that would account for the increase in IAP (Fig.2B). Fig. 2C shows that there was no increase in the total cellular content of IAP during the time course of the experiment. It has been shown previously that increasing the expression of IAP or αVβ3 can increase complex formation (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, there were no changes in the total amount of αV, β3, or IAP during the time course of the experiment. It is known that plasma membrane proteins can be associated with different microdomains of the membrane, based upon the polarity of the lipid groups (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient density centrifugation has been used to separate membrane raft proteins from proteins associated with non-raft domains (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Extraction of these membrane subfractions with Triton at 4 °C has shown that the Triton-insoluble fraction corresponds to proteins associated with membrane rafts as determined by sucrose gradient density centrifugation (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 15Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 16Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F.G. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Iwashita S. Slot J.W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). IAP-αVβ3 complex formation can only be detected after lysis in a Triton buffer, which suggested that the increase in their association might be due to a specific increase in the levels of one or both of the complex components in the Triton-soluble fraction. We therefore investigated the distribution of complex components between the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions of the cell before and after IGF-I stimulation following protein extraction at 4 °C. To first confirm that proteins from the Triton-insoluble fraction had been separated from proteins from the Triton-soluble fraction, we immunoblotted for caveolin, a protein known to be associated almost exclusively with membrane rafts (17Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar) and therefore found in the Triton-insoluble fraction of the plasma membrane. Fig. 3A confirms that 82 ± 6.5% (mean ± S.E.; n = 3) of caveolin was detected in the Triton-insoluble fraction. In Fig.3B, it can be seen that the majority of αV(top panel; 94 ± 6%, mean ± S.E.;n = 3) and β3 (bottom panel; 93 ± 7%, mean ± S.E.; n = 3) was associated with the Triton-soluble fraction of the cell, and there was no significant change in αVβ3 distribution after IGF-I treatment. In contrast, Fig. 3C shows that in the basal state, 85 ± 7.7% (mean ± S.E.; n= 3) of the total IAP was associated with the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction. Importantly, after incubation with IGF-I, there was a marked decrease (2.2-fold) in the amount of IAP in the Triton-insoluble fraction and an increase (3-fold) in IAP in the Triton-soluble fraction. After treatment with IGF-I, 79.7 ± 10.5% (mean ± S.E.; n = 3) of the total IAP was associated with the Triton-soluble fraction. To provide further evidence that the IGF-I-stimulated redistribution of IAP is important for the increase in complex formation, we examined the effect of various inhibitors on both IGF-I-stimulated IAP redistribution and IAP-integrin complex formation. We have previously shown that inhibitors of the PI3K pathway effectively block IGF-I-stimulated migration (18Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4A shows, as before, that IGF-I stimulates a 1.7-fold decrease in IAP levels in the Triton-insoluble fraction (top panel) and a 2.2-fold increase in the Triton-soluble fraction (bottom panel). However, in the presence of two structurally distinct PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, the IGF-I-stimulated redistribution of IAP from the Triton-insoluble fraction to the Triton-soluble fraction was inhibited. This inhibition of IAP translocation from the Triton-insoluble fraction to the Triton-soluble fraction was associated with an inhibition in IGF-I-stimulated complex formation (Fig.4B, top panel). Reprobing of the membrane with the β3 antibody (Fig. 4B, bottom panel) showed that the reduction in IAP-αVβ3 association was not due to changes in the amount of αVβ3 immunoprecipitated under each condition. Neither of the inhibitors had any effect on basal IAP-integrin association (data not shown). To determine whether the IGF-I-stimulated increase in IAP binding to αVβ3 was required for IGF-I-stimulated migration, we determined the effect of inhibiting complex formation on this process. Fig.5A (top panel) shows that the monoclonal anti-IAP antibody (B6H12) potently inhibited the IGF-I-stimulated increase in IAP-integrin complex formation. Reprobing of the membrane with the β3 antibody (Fig.5A, bottom panel) showed that the reduction in association was not due to changes in the amount of αVβ3 immunoprecipitated under each condition. Fig. 5B shows that although IGF-I stimulated a significant (3.3 ± 0.1-fold, mean ± S.E.; n= 3; p < 0.05) increase in cell migration, this increase was completely inhibited if cells were preincubated with B6H12. Similar to some types of transmembrane receptors, integrins have the ability to modulate their affinity for extracellular ligands in response to various signals from within the cell. This change can result in a switch from an inactive to an activated state (22Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Binding of the activated integrin to extracellular proteins then generates signals that regulate cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. Several studies have shown that IAP can modulate αVβ3 affinity for its ligand, Vn. Using both anti-IAP antibodies and IAP-negative cells, it has been shown that IAP is required for αVβ3 binding to Vn-coated beads (11Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Membrane-anchored IAP containing one IgG domain in the extracellular region of the molecule is required to detect a positive effect of IAP on integrin signaling (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that a direct physical association between the extracellular domain of IAP and the extracellular regions of αV and/or β3 occurs. In previous studies, we have shown that IGF-I can stimulate a significant increase (2.4-fold) in αVβ3 ligand binding to the disintegrin kistrin and that this change requires 12 h. In this study, we have extended that observation to show that IGF-I can stimulate a 7-fold increase in the binding of αVβ3 to soluble Vn and that this increase requires at least 12 h of incubation with IGF-I. The results from this study show that IGF-I stimulates a 6.5-fold increase in IAP association with αVβ3 over the same time course. In light of the clearly established role of IAP in modulating the binding of Vn to αVβ3 and the similar time course, we propose a model whereby IGF-I stimulates this increase in ligand binding by stimulating the physical association of IAP and αVβ3. Both IAP and αVβ3 have been shown to be expressed on the cell surface independently of each other, and complex formation is believed to be in equilibrium with nonassociated IAP and αVβ3 (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that increasing the level of expression of either αVβ3 or IAP in the Triton-soluble fraction led to increased complex formation and increased vitronectin-coated bead binding (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results show that IGF-I treatment stimulates this increase in IAP-αVβ3 association, at least in part, by stimulating the redistribution of IAP from the Triton-insoluble fraction to the Triton-soluble fraction, the fraction with which >90% of the αVβ3 is associated. Our conclusion that the increase in IAP association with αVβ3 requires translocation of IAP to the Triton-soluble fraction is supported by our findings using the inhibitors of PI3K. Blocking the PI3K pathway inhibited both redistribution of IAP to the Triton-soluble fraction and IAP-αVβ3 complex formation. Because we have shown that inhibiting PI3K inhibits the cellular migration response to IGF-I (18Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results support the conclusion that redistribution of IAP is required for IGF-I-stimulated increase in IAP-αVβ3 association and that this change could lead to stimulation of cell migration. It remains to be determined whether this is only one of several steps required for IGF-I to increase IAP-αVβ3 association or whether this is the only change required. Because both IAP and αVβ3 undergo conformational changes (19Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), these changes could also be necessary for the observed increase in complex formation to occur. Previous studies have suggested that the cellular localization of IAP may be important in the regulation of its activity (20Green J.M. Zhelesnyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Plasma membranes contain specialized glycosphingolipids and cholesterol-rich domains (membrane rafts) that have been proposed to be regulators of cell surface signal transduction via the segregation of membrane constituents. The proteins associated with membrane rafts can be isolated because of their resistance to solubilization by nonionic detergents at 4 °C (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that membrane rafts are efficient sites for the initiation of signal transduction due to the sequestration of specific components of signaling complexes within this membrane fraction. However, in some cases, signaling molecules are also translocated out of rafts. Previous studies have demonstrated that IAP is associated predominantly but not exclusively with membrane rafts (20Green J.M. Zhelesnyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was shown in C32 melanoma cells that αVβ3 within the membrane raft was four times more likely to form a complex with IAP compared with αVβ3 in the Triton-soluble component and that cholesterol, which is necessary for stabilization of raft formation, is also required for complex assembly and signaling (20Green J.M. Zhelesnyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In a different context, e.g. T-cell signaling, the association of IAP with membrane rafts was associated with its ability to stimulate an increase in f-actin-stimulated cell spreading and the association of protein kinase C with the cytoskeleton (21Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it was also shown in the C32 melanoma cells that IAP in the Triton-soluble fraction formed a complex with β3 and G proteins and that association with membrane rafts was not necessary for the IAP enhancement of αV integrin binding to Vn-coated beads (12Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, in T cells, IAP participation in phospholipase C and Ca2+ signaling was not dependent on its raft association (21Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies have demonstrated that IAP is capable of interacting with both integrins and signaling cascades both within and outside of membrane rafts. Because insolubility in Triton detergent at 4 °C is a characteristic of proteins associated with membrane rafts (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), and given that caveolin, a marker protein for membrane rafts (17Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar), was also found almost exclusively in the Triton-insoluble fraction, it seems likely that in our experiments extraction with Triton at 4 °C accurately reflected both IAP and caveolin associated with membrane rafts. Because αVβ3 was associated almost exclusively with the Triton-soluble fraction, consistent with previous reports (23Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and complex formation only occurred after redistribution of IAP into the Triton-soluble fraction, our studies suggest that the site of localization of both αVβ3 and IAP appears to be a major determinant of whether they will interact. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the stimulation of translocation of IAP from the Triton-insoluble to the Triton-soluble fraction, and it suggests that IGF-I may be an important regulator of IAP activity through its ability to regulate its cellular distribution. Exactly how IGF-I stimulates this redistribution remains to be elucidated. Possible mechanisms include the alteration of an abundant raft protein such as caveolin-1 or changes in potential posttranslational modifications within IAP that have been shown to account for raft association such as glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchoring, palmitylation, or myristylation (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). In the absence of appropriate cells that do not express IAP, we cannot say definitively that the IGF-I-stimulated increase in IAP association with αVβ3 results in the increase in ligand binding. However, previous studies demonstrating such a role for IAP strongly support this interpretation. However, our study does show that IAP plays an important role in IGF-I-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cell migration because the anti-IAP monoclonal antibody can block both the IGF-I-stimulated increase in IAP association with αVβ3 and IGF-I-stimulated migration. This is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated that an IAP-integrin association was involved in stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell migration in response to thrombospondin-1 (24Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, in that study, the integrin involved was α2β1; because our cells express very low levels of α2β1 (5Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we cannot determine whether IGF-I can have a similar effect on IAP association with this integrin. Despite the differences in integrin expression, both studies suggest that the IAP regulation of integrin ligand binding is an important mechanism in the regulation of smooth muscle cell migration in response to different stimuli. Additional studies will be necessary to elucidate whether the IAP also has additional signaling effects contributing to IGF-I-stimulated migration independent of its effect on αVβ3. In summary, we have shown that IGF-I can stimulate an increase in IAP-integrin association via a PI3K-dependent pathway. This increase appears to result from an increase in IAP association with the Triton-soluble fraction of the cell. Taken together with previous evidence showing that IAP can increase αVβ3binding to Vn, the data presented here suggest that the IGF-I regulation of IAP cellular distribution may be involved in the ability of IGF-I to alter the ligand binding capacity of αVβ3. Because ligand binding by integrins triggers signals inside the cell necessary for cell migration, our findings suggest that the IAP-induced alteration in αVβ3 ligand binding is important in the regulation of IGF-I-stimulated cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W2081435829,"Pneumococcal LicC is a member of the nucleoside triphosphate transferase superfamily and catalyzes the transfer of a cytidine monophosphate from CTP to phosphocholine to form CDP-choline. The structures of apo-LicC and the LicC·CDP-choline·Mg2+ ternary complex were determined, and the comparison of these structures reveals a significant conformational change driven by the multivalent coordination of Mg2+. The key event is breaking the Glu216·Arg129 salt bridge, which triggers the coalescence of four individual β-strands into two extended β-sheets. These movements reorient the side chains of Trp136 and Tyr190 for the optimal binding and alignment of the phosphocholine moiety. Consistent with these conformational changes, LicC operates via a compulsory ordered kinetic mechanism. The structures explain the substrate specificity of LicC for CTP and phosphocholine and implicate a direct role for Mg2+in aligning phosphocholine for in-line nucleophilic attack and stabilizing the negative charge that develops in the pentacoordinate transition state. These results provide a structural basis for assigning a specific role for magnesium in the catalytic mechanism of pneumococcal LicC."
https://openalex.org/W2028776941,"Binding of short chain phosphatidylserine (C6PS) enhances the proteolytic activity of factor Xa by 60-fold (Koppaka, V., Wang, J., Banerjee, M., and Lentz, B. R. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 7482–7491). In the present study, we locate three C6PS binding sites to different domains of factor Xa using a combination of activity, circular dichroism, fluorescence, and equilibrium dialysis measurements on proteolytic and biosynthetic fragments of factor Xa. Our results demonstrate that the structural responses of human and bovine factor Xa to C6PS binding are somewhat different. Despite this difference, data obtained with fragments from both human and bovine factor Xa are consistent with a common hypothesis for the location of C6PS binding sites to different structural domains. First, the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain binds C6PS only in the absence of Ca2+ (kd ∼ 1 mm), although this PS site does not influence the functional response of factor Xa. Second, a Ca2+-dependent binding site is in the epidermal growth factor domains (EGFNC) that are linked by Ca2+ and C6PS binding to the Gla domain. This site appears to be the lipid regulatory site of factor Xa. Third, a Ca2+-requiring site seems to be in the EGFC-catalytic domain. This site appears not to be a lipid regulatory site but rather to share residues with the substrate recognition site. Finally, the full functional response to C6PS requires linkage of the Gla, EGFNC, and catalytic domains in the presence of Ca2+, meaning that PS regulation of factor Xa involves linkage between widely separated parts of the protein. Binding of short chain phosphatidylserine (C6PS) enhances the proteolytic activity of factor Xa by 60-fold (Koppaka, V., Wang, J., Banerjee, M., and Lentz, B. R. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 7482–7491).

Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and on the structure of factor Xa, as documented here, indicate that phosphatidylserine (PS) may act as an allosteric regulator of prothrombin activation. PS located on the cytoplasmic face of resting platelet plasma membranes is exposed on the surface of activated platelet vesicles (2Sandberg H. Bode A.P. Dombrose F.A. Hoechli M. Lentz B.R. Thromb. Res. 1985; 39: 63-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Sims P.J. Faioni E.M. Wiedmer T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18205-18212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The implication of this PS exposure and of the effect of PS on factor Xa and on its ability to catalyze activation of prothrombin is that PS may act as a second messenger in regulating thrombin formation. Because of the crucial role of thrombin in hemostasis, the exposure of PS may be a crucial regulatory step in blood coagulation. To better define this regulatory process, it is important to know the locations of the PS binding sites on factor Xa. The organization of factor X into structural domains is illustrated below in Fig. 1. Factor X consists of two peptides. The light chain consists of an N terminus γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich region (Gla module) and two Cys-rich cassette modules. The heavy chain consists of the serine protease catalytic domain. The two cassette modules of the light chain show strong sequence and structural homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF) (4Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are thus referred to as EGFN and EGFC, where N and C indicate the domain nearer to the N and C termini, respectively. Crystal structures of Gla domain-less factor Xa (GDFXa) have been published (5Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 6630-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the EGF cassette modules extend from the catalytic domain to make an extended molecule. In the structure of the analogous serine protease, factor IXa, the EGFN module is bent at the inner-EGFC hinge region to right angles with the EGFC, which is tucked along the catalytic module (8Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It may be that the EGF modules form a hinge region that modulates the global structure of factor Xa. The factor IXastructure also differs from that of GDFXa in containing the Gla domain. Although the Gla domain is critical for membrane binding and may modulate the structure of the EGF modules, little is known about the structure of Gla in whole factor Xa. We have only a model structure of factor Xa Gla domain based on the prothrombin Gla domain (9Sabharwal A.K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mathur A. Gorka J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ to factor X is reportedly required for activation by factor VIIa/tissue factor or by factor IXa/VIIIa (10Jesty J. Nemerson Y.

Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding is also required for PS regulation of factor Xa proteolytic activity (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binds mainly to the Gla module (13Henriksen R.A. Jackson C.M. Arch. Biochem.

A Ca2+-dependent interaction between the EGF-like and Gla modules appears to enhance the affinity of the site on the EGF-like module to the point that it is tighter (17Persson E. Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22531-22539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Valcarce C. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kd ∼ 120 μm) than the catalytic domain site. Consistent with this, nuclear magnetic resonance shows that Ca2+ binding tightens the fold of the isolated EGFN domain and bends Gla and EGFNdomains toward each other around a hinge located in the Gla domain, referred to as a helical or hydrophobic stack(19Sunnerhagen M. Olah G.A. Stenflo J. Forsen S. Drakenberg T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11547-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite considerable information about Ca2+ binding to factor Xa, we have virtually no information about the location of PS binding sites on this key enzyme. The aims of this work have been to locate the lipid regulatory site(s) in factor Xa and to identify the structural domains of factor Xa necessary to see the C6PS regulatory effect on factor Xa activity. 1,2-Dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (C6PS) and 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C6PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.

Human factor X for stoichiometry and CD measurements was purified from recovered human plasma obtained from the American Red Cross, according to the method of Dahlback et al. (22Dahlback B. Stenflo J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Factor X obtained as above was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, concentrated (Centricon-10 concentrator supplier), and then stored at −70 °C at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml in 5 mmTris, 20 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 m NaCl, pH 7.4. A final purification of factor X was performed 1 day before an experiment by high-performance liquid chromatography on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Isopure LC system using a Mono Q HR 5/5 ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Norwalk, CN). The purified factor X was dialyzed into buffer (50 mm Tris, 175 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) for activation. Factor X (10 μm) with 5 mm Ca2+ was activated at 25 °C with RVV-X that had been covalently linked to agarose beads (10Jesty J. Nemerson Y.

Factor Xa was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column, and the isolated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Factor Xa concentration was measured by determining the rate of S-2765 hydrolysis in a plate reader-based assay (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R.

The RSV-PL4 expression vector was used to express factor X, GDFX, and a construct missing both the Gla and first EGF domain (E2FX) in human 293 cells (16Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GDFX was also prepared for stoichiometry measurements as described by Morita and Jackson (27Morita T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4015-4023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from isolated factor X. Purified factor X was reacted with α-chymotrypsin (1:400 factor X:α-chymotrypsin) at 22 °C for 45 min, a time sufficient to convert 95% of factor X to GDFX, as judged by SDS-PAGE on a 6% gel. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate, and Gla-domainless factor X was chromatographed on a Mono Q column. GDFX Y99T mutant was also prepared as described (28Vindigni A. Winfield M. Ayala Y.M. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 29Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

The amidolytic activities of expression products of a human factor Xa cDNA and of expression products of two of its deletion mutants (GDFXa, E2FXa) were measured in the presence of 3 mm Ca2+ using the synthetic substrate S-2765 and the microplate reader-based assay described above. Samples, containing 20 nm protein, various concentrations of C6PS and 3 mm Ca2+ in a buffer (50 mmTris, 175 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.6% PEG, were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before measuring activities. The amidolytic activities were estimated from measured initial rates of S-2765 hydrolysis, using a standard curve obtained with active site-titrated factor Xa (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Amidolytic activities of GDFXa and Y99T were measured using the chromogenetic substrate Spectrozyme PCa (SpPCa) also as described earlier (29Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23807-23814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples containing 20 nm protein, various concentrations of C6PS (0, 400, 900 μm), and 0.6% PEG (to prevent adsorption of protein to the plate) were incubated in buffer (50 mm Tris, 175 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) in polypropylene Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C for 5 min before being added to a flat-bottomed polypropylene 96-well plate (Greiner America, Inc.) preincubated at 37 °C. The initial rates of SpPCa amidolysis were determined on a Versamax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at five substrate concentrations (50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 μm) and analyzed in terms of the Michaelis-Menten model using non-linear regression methods available in Sigma Plot 6.0. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were generally recorded from 250 to 200 nm on an Aviv Model 620S spectrometer (Aviv Associates, Inc., Lake Wood, NJ) in a 1-cm path-length cell at 24 °C with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Data points were collected at every 0.5 nm with an average time of 5 s on each point. Some data were obtained down to 195 nm on an Applied Photophysics Pi* spectrometer in a 1-mm path-length cell with a bandwidth of 1 nm and data collection at every 0.5 nm. Baseline CD spectra of buffer containing various concentrations of soluble C6PS were collected in the absence and in the presence of 3 mmCa2+ and were subtracted from sample spectra. The baseline-corrected digital data were processed, smoothed, and converted to molar ellipticity, ΔΘ. We have previously determined the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of C6PS at different Ca2+ and protein concentrations (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but controls to detect micelle formation were in all cases still performed by watching for sudden drops in ellipticity in the range of 240–250 nm. For human and bovine factor Xa, 2J. Wang, R. Majumder, and B. R. Lentz, submitted for publication. the CMC seen in this way was similar to the CMC reported earlier by quasi-elastic light scattering methods (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ellipticity ratio Θ222/Θ208 (32Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) is used here as a convenient parameter to follow changes in the secondary structure of factor Xa and its fragments upon addition of C6PS. In addition, we have estimated α-helix content using published software packages CDSSTR and CONTIN (33Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar) to give context to the Θ222/Θ208 ratio. The ability of CD spectra taken to 200 nm to define α-helix content but not β-sheet or turn content is well documented (34Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We could not collect spectra to 185 nm to perform a complete secondary structure analysis in a buffer containing NaCl, because Na+ increases the buffer absorbance in the deep UV (34Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Na+ was necessary in our studies, because Ca2+ binding is required for regulation of factor Xa by C6PS (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ binding is linked to Na+ binding (35Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity measurements were carried out on an SLM 48000 spectrofluorometer (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL). Slits were closed between measurements to avoid photodegradation of the sample. All buffer solutions were filtered using 0.2-μm filters (Nalge Co., Rochester, NY). DEGR-E2FXa was prepared by sequential addition of 5 μl of DEGR-CK (1 mg/ml in 0.02 mTris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5) to 1 ml of about 1 μm purified factor E2FXa. The extent of labeling at the active site was followed by the loss of enzymatic activity, as monitored by the S-2765 assay. Labeling was stopped when no activity remained. DEGR-E2FXa was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, to remove free reagent (37Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DEGR-E2FXa(100 nm) in 1.0 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) was incubated in a stirred micro-cuvette (Hellma Cells, Jamaica, NY) with 0.15 mm NaCl or 3 mmCa2+ or both at 25 °C for 20 min. Following additions of C6PS (1–2 μl each addition for a maximum of 4% dilution) and an equilibration of at least 4 min, fluorescence intensity was recorded using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm (bandpass 8 nm) and an emission wavelength of 550 nm (bandpass 4 nm). For each addition, several intensity measurements were performed and averaged and corrected for dilution. Control experiments were performed in which buffer was titrated with soluble lipid in the absence of protein. The lipid solution showed very minor background fluorescence or light scattering signal (which was subtracted from sample signal) until the critical micelle concentration was reached. The critical micelle concentration for C6PS in the presence and absence of 1 μm factor Xa were determined previously to be 0.95 and 2.5 mm, respectively (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The critical micelle concentrations for C6PC under similar conditions were even higher (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data were not analyzed above the critical micelle concentration. Gla-EGFNC (100 nm) in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, in the presence and in absence of 3 mm Ca2+ was titrated with soluble C6PS, and the intrinsic fluorescence was monitored at 345 nm (bandpass 4 nm) followed by excitation at 285 nm (bandpass 8 nm). Control experiments were as mentioned for DEGR-E2FXa fluorescence. C6PS and C6PC solutions were prepared from measured quantities of 10 mg/ml stock solutions in chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The lipid was re-dissolved in cyclohexane, and this solution was frozen on the wall of a capped test tube and then lyophilized overnight. The resulting dry powder was dispersed in the appropriate volume of buffer and vortexed thoroughly to reach a concentration of ∼100 mm. The final concentration of this phospholipid stock solution was determined by an inorganic phosphate assay (38Chen Jr., P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Analyt. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5835) Google Scholar). The stoichiometries of soluble C6PS binding to factor Xa, GDFXa, Gla-EGFNC, and Gla in the absence and in the presence of 3 mm Ca2+ were determined by equilibrium dialysis measurements. This procedure not only establishes stoichiometry but also confirms indirect binding results by a direct measurement. Experiments were performed using 2.0-ml Teflon dialysis cells (Spectrum Medical, Los Angeles, CA) with the two cells separated by a 2000 molecular weight cut-off membrane. Both chambers contained equal amounts of C6PS, enough to saturate >85% of the protein present in one-half of the dialysis cell at varying concentrations (30–100 μm). The lipid concentrations used depended on the crude binding constants estimated in CD titrations. Depending on the particular combination of lipid and protein concentration in a given experiment and on the stoichiometry of binding for a particular peptide, between 79 and 94% of lipid remained unbound at equilibrium. The two chambers were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 24 h while being rotated horizontally at 20 rpm. The protein concentration gradient between the two halves of the cell causes a difference in the total phosphate concentration between the two halves of the cell. The concentration of protein-bound C6PS was measured as the difference in total phosphate concentration (ΔP) (38Chen Jr., P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Analyt. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5835) Google Scholar) between the two chambers of the dialysis cell. Assuming a simple model of binding of lipid to n equivalent and independent sites, it is easy to show that ΔP should vary with protein concentration as follows, ΔP=[L]n[P]kdn+[L]Equation 1 where [L] is free lipid concentration andkd/n is the observed stoichiometric dissociation constant for lipid binding, assuming a single site model. For [L] ≫ kd/n, this is roughly a straight line with a slope proportional to n. In our experiments, we maintained [L] >kd/n, but the total lipid concentration had to remain less than the CMC of the lipid. Thus, to obtainn, we had to fit a plot of ΔP versusprotein concentration to the non-linear equation given in Equation 1, using standard non-linear regression procedures and the program SigmaPlot (version 6 for Windows 2000; Jandel Scientific). In our experiments, soluble lipid was added to the protein solution, and the observed response was taken as representing the fraction of protein bound (f) to lipid at concentration [L] given by,f=[L]Kd+[L]Equation 2 where Kd is the apparent stoichiometric binding constant for soluble lipid binding to the protein. Any observable value that changes from an initial value ofR0 to a final value at saturation,Rsat, as a result of binding can be written as follows,RR0=1+Rsat−R0R0×fEquation 3 We have shown previously that C6PS enhances proteolytic activity of human factor Xa by roughly 60-fold but inhibits the amidolytic activity toward S-2765 by 60% (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The variation of amidolytic activity of expressed human factor Xa, GDFXa, and E2FXa (Fig. 1) in the presence of 3 mm Ca2+ with soluble C6PS concentration is shown in Fig. 2. The highest C6PS concentration used (0.8 mm) was still below the CMC for C6PS in the presence of 3 mm Ca2+(∼2.5 mm) (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The amidolytic activities of factor Xa and GDFXa were decreased by 79 and 9%, respectively, at saturation with C6PS (TableI), but C6PS had negligible effect on the amidolytic activity of E2FXa. The functional responses of factor Xa and its constructs to C6PS binding were reasonably well described by a single binding site model (see “Methods”), and the binding parameters are given in Table I. The apparent Kd for C6PS binding to the expressed human factor Xa in this experiment (39 ± 6 μm) was comparable to but somewhat smaller than we have reported previously for factor Xa isolated from outdated human plasma (65 ± 5 μm) (1Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the percent inhibition was also greater (80 versus 60%). This probably reflects the slight difference between Xa from human plasma and factor Xa from a single cDNA clone, as used here.Table IParameters describing binding of soluble C6PS to human factor Xa and its constructs in terms of changes in amidolytic activityProtein/domainKd1-aKd, apparent stoichiometric dissociation constant.ΔRsat1-bΔRsat, percent change in activity upon addition of saturating concentration of C6PS.μmHuman Xa39 ± 6−79Human GDFXa86 ± 18−9Human E2FXaNA1-cNA, not applicable.01-a Kd, apparent stoichiometric dissociation constant.1-b ΔRsat, percent change in activity upon addition of saturating concentration of C6PS.1-c NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab The effects of soluble C6PS on the CD spectra of expressed human factor Xa and its constructs, GDFXa and E2FXa, were studied in the absence and presence of 3 mmCa2+. CD spectra of human factor Xa are shown at various concentrations of C6PS in the presence (Fig.3A) and in the absence of 3 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). Although it is reported to bind Ca2+ (17Persson E. Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22531-22539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human factor Xa did not undergo a detectable change in secondary structure upon addition of 3 mm Ca2+, as seen from the solidand dotted curves in Fig. 3A and from the Θ222/Θ208 ratio and α-helical content (Table I). Secondary structure analysis yielded an estimate of 11% helical content in the presence or absence of Ca2+, in good agreement with the reported helicity for the analogous factor IXa crystal structure (10.6%) (8Brandste"

In postmitotic neurons, it may serve as an adaptor molecule, functionally connecting c-abl and cdk5, and supporting neurite growth. Here we report that ik3-1 binds to p53 and p73 in vivo. Ectopically expressed ik3-1 potentiates p53-induced cell death but not p73-induced cell death in U2OS cells. On the contrary, coexpression of ik3-1-ΔC, an ik3-1 deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 134 amino acids (corresponding to the cyclin box-homologous region), inhibits p73-induced cell death but not p53-induced cell death. ik3-1-ΔC-mediated inhibition of p73-induced cell death are partially attenuated by overexpression of ik3-1. These data indicate that ik3-1 is not only a regulator for p53-induced cell death but also an essential regulator for p73-induced cell death, and ik3-1-ΔC competes with ik3-1 only in p73-induced cell death. Furthermore, functional domains of p53 responsible for its interaction with ik3-1 are partially different from those of p73. In conclusion, we found that ik3-1, a putative component of cell cycle regulation, is functionally connected with p53 and p73, but in distinct fashions."

Research conducted over the past 2 decades has demonstrated that the temporal and spatial control of translation is, in part, regulated by the cytoskeleton (1Hesketh J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Hovland R. Hesketh J. Pryme I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Early biochemical and in situ mRNA localization studies indicated that a large percentage of polysomes in the cell are associated with the cytoskeleton, and components of the translational apparatus, including initiation and elongation factors, were also cytoskeleton-bound (3Howe J.G. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1984; 37: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Lenk R. Ransom L. Kaufmann Y. Penman S.

Nature. 1990; 347: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This interaction was interpreted to function as a mechanism to concentrate the components of the translational machinery to achieve a critical mass of these components and therefore allow for more efficient translation. More recently, a significant amount of research has been aimed at studying the mechanisms responsible for subcellular mRNA localization. These studies have further demonstrated the association of mRNAs with the cytoskeleton matrix (8Jansen R.-P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Subcellular mRNA localization contributes to the establishment of asymmetries within cells by directing the synthesis of proteins to specific cytoplasmic regions, and also facilitates the efficient import of proteins into organelles (9Jansen R.-P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). There are now over a hundred examples of mRNA localization, most of which have been identified in animal cells. Detailed studies have indicated that the transport and anchoring of many of these mRNAs is either directly or indirectly dependent on the cytoskeleton (10Lipshitz H.D. Smibert C.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2000; 10: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11St. Johnston D. Cell. 1995; 81: 161-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In many cases, the localization and translation of mRNAs are coordinately regulated to ensure that protein synthesis does not take place until the mRNA reaches its final destination within the cell (10Lipshitz H.D. Smibert C.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2000; 10: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). During directional transport on cytoskeletal elements, multiple mRNAs are packaged into large ribonucleoprotein complexes that can contain RNA-binding proteins as well as components of the translational machinery, including elongation factors, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and ribosomes (12Barbarese E. Koppel D.E. Deutscher M.P. Smith C.L. Ainger K. Morgan F. Carson J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2781-2790PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR1 of localized mRNAs typically contains the localization signal, and several RNA-binding proteins that interact specifically with these signals have been identified (13Deshler J.O. Highett M.I. Abramson T. Schnapp B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Elisha Z. Havin L. Ringel I. Yisraei J.K.

These proteins are often associated with the cytoskeleton either indirectly through interactions with other proteins or membranes or they can bind to the cytoskeleton directly. There are also cytoskeleton-associated RNA-binding proteins that bind nonspecifically to any mRNA sequence. These general RNA-binding proteins have been proposed to function in anchoring populations of mRNA to the cytoskeleton to regulate mRNA transport and/or translation (18DeFranco C. Chicurel M.E. Potter H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Kraemer D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9119-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RNA-cytoskeleton interactions have also been reported in plant cells (20Davies E. Abe S. Larkins B.A. Clore A.M. Quatrano R.S. Weidner S. Bailey-Serres J. Gallie D.R. A Look Beyond Translation: Mechanisms Determining mRNA Stability and Translation in Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD1998: 115-124Google Scholar). These interactions are important in the global control of translation in response to environmental stresses such as wounding and hypoxia, and they also play a role in the localization of specific RNAs within cells (21Okita T.W. Choi S.-B. Ito H. Muench D.G. Wu Y. Zhang F. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1081-1090Google Scholar, 22Vayda M.E. Webster C. Bailey-Serres J. Gallie D.R. A Look Beyond Translation: Mechanisms Determining mRNA Stability and Translation in Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD1998: 102-114Google Scholar). One of the best characterized examples of RNA localization in plants is the movement of RNA to and through plasmodesmata. Viral movement proteins are RNA-binding proteins that are important in plasmodesmatal trafficking of viral RNA genomes, and these proteins mediate the direct interaction between the RNA and the cytoskeleton (23Boyko V. Ferralli J. Ashby J. Schellenbaum P. Heinlein M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24McLean B.G. Zupan J. Zambryski P.C.

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plant paralogs of movement proteins also have been identified and function in trafficking endogenous plant transcripts over short and long distances, possibly playing a role in developmental programming and defense signaling (26Ruiz-Medrano R. Xoconostle-Cázares B. Lucas W.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Xoconostle-Cázares B. Xiang Y. Ruiz-Medrano R. Wang H.-L. Monzer J. Yoo B.-C. McFarland K.C. Fraceschi V.R. Lucas W.J. Science. 1999; 283: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Another well studied example of RNA localization in plant cells is the sorting of prolamine seed storage protein mRNAs to a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (the protein body ER) in rice endosperm cells (28Choi S.-B. Wang C.W. Muench D.G. Ozawa K. Franceschi V.R. Wu Y. Okita T.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 29Li X. Franceschi V.R. Okita T.W.

Planta. 2000; 211: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This specific intracellular sorting mechanism appears to involve a number of components, including a topogenic signal located within the prolamine mRNA, as well one or more protein factor(s) that likely mediate interactions between the prolamine mRNA and the cytoskeleton. However, to date, none of these putative cytoskeleton-associated proteins have been identified. In an effort to isolate plant proteins that play a role in RNA-cytoskeleton interactions and possibly subcellular mRNA localization, we purified a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) fraction from developing rice seeds, and we used protein-RNA UV cross-linking assays to identify RNA-binding proteins in this MAP fraction. We hypothesized that proteins identified using this procedure might be involved in the localization of prolamine mRNA to the protein body ER, or in the localization or translation of other mRNAs in a specific or general fashion. We identified a 72-kDa protein that had RNA and microtubule binding activities. This protein was purified to homogeneity, and amino acid sequencing revealed it was the multifunctional protein (MFP), a peroxisomal matrix protein that is known to possess several distinct enzymatic activities, each of which is involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids (32Preisig-Müller R. Gühnemann-Schäfer K. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20475-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant version of this protein also showed RNA and microtubule binding activities and possessed at least two β-oxidation enzyme activities. Based on the results, we propose that rice MFP carries out a cytoplasmic role in mRNA localization or translational control, in addition to its enzymatic roles in the β-oxidation of fatty acids within the peroxisomal matrix. Thirty grams of developing rice seeds (10–15 days after pollination) were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen and then ground in 40 ml of extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, and 2.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). After filtering through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem), the extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 × g at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge (model L7, Beckman), and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again for 90 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to remove debris and insoluble proteins. The supernatant from the 100,000 × g centrifugation step was then clarified further by filtering through a 0.45-μm nylon filter. Four different chromatography columns,i.e. tubulin and microtubule columns from either bovine or plant tubulin sources, were used to purify putative MAPs. Bovine brain tubulin was prepared using standard procedures involving cycles of temperature-dependent assembly and disassembly (33Williams R. Lee J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). After the assembly-disassembly cycling, a cation-exchange filter (S15, Sartorius) was used to purify the MAPs away from tubulin (34Sloboda R.D. Belfi L.M. Protein Expression Purific. 1998; 13: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Tubulin from developing rice seed tissue was purified using a taxol-salt procedure as described elsewhere (35Schellenbaum P. Vantard M. Peter C. Fellous A. Lambert A.-M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 253-260Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The purified tubulin from bovine and plant sources was polymerized into microtubules by incubating in microtubule-stabilizing buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA and 1 mm GTP) followed by the addition of 1, 5, and 20 μm taxol in a stepwise fashion at 34 °C for 45 min. Microtubule and tubulin columns were constructed using a similar procedure to that reported previously (36Miller K.G. Field M.F. Alberts B.M. Kellogg D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Due to the difference in tubulin yield from bovine and plant tubulin preparations, the bovine microtubule and tubulin columns were 5-ml bed volume, whereas the plant columns were 1 ml. Equal volumes of Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) and Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) were poured into empty PD-10 or Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences) and washed several times by periodic stirring, first with cold double-distilled water, and then with column washing buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). The matrix was left for 30 min to partially inactivate the resin. One-half column volume of taxol-stabilized microtubules or unpolymerized tubulin (each at 2 mg/ml) with the pH adjusted to pH 7.5 were added, and after gentle mixing with a spatula, the column matrix was incubated for 15 h at 4 °C. Unbound microtubules or tubulin were removed with column washing buffer containing 500 mm KCl, followed by equilibration of the matrix in washing buffer. A 5-ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) control column was also prepared using the same coupling procedure. The clarified rice extract was loaded onto these columns (90 mg of protein for the 5-ml columns and 20 mg of protein for the 1-ml columns) at a rate of 0.5 column volumes per h at 4 °C. The columns were washed thoroughly with 20 column volumes of column washing buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 2.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. The putative MAPs that bound to the affinity column were eluted with this supplemented washing buffer containing 500 mm KCl. For single-stranded (ss) DNA-affinity chromatography 40 μg of the MAP fraction from the bovine tubulin column was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 250 μg/ml heparin and 150 μg/ml yeast tRNA in RNA-binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% glycerol) and then loaded onto a ssDNA-cellulose (Sigma) column that was previously equilibrated first in TE buffer followed by RNA-binding buffer at 4 °C. Thirty column volumes of RNA-binding buffer were passed over the column, and bound proteins were then eluted with RNA-binding buffer containing 200 mm KCl. SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE), and protein gel blot analysis were carried out as described previously (37Wu Y. Muench D.G. Kim Y.-T. Hwang Y.-S. Okita T.W. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For protein gel blots, rice MFP and elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) antisera were both used at a dilution of 1:500, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used at a dilution of 1:3000. Proteins used for antiserum production were purified by two-dimensional NEPHGE and stained in 0.05% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in water, and the stained gel was briefly destained with water. Protein spots were excised from the gel, and the gel pieces were macerated and then used for rabbit immunizations and the production of antibodies. RNA probes were synthesized using [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mm, ICN) and a T3 or T7 RNA synthesis kit (MaxiScript, Ambion) from Bluescript II plasmids (Stratagene). The lengths of the individual RNA probes and unlabeled competitors, not including RNA sequence encoded by the vector (∼30–40 nucleotides), were as follows: 206 nucleotides for the prolamine 5′-untranslated region; 447 nucleotides for the prolamine coding region; 116 nucleotides for the prolamine 3′-untranslated region; 67 nucleotides for the glutelin 3′-untranslated region; 340 nucleotides for the MFP 3′-untranslated region; 1500 nucleotides for the catalase mRNA; 1600 nucleotides for the actin mRNA; 900 nucleotides for the γ-tubulin mRNA; and 2100 nucleotides for the β-tubulin mRNA. The prolamine and glutelin DNA templates used for RNA synthesis were provided by Thomas Okita (Washington State University). The catalase, actin, and tubulin cDNA templates were provided by the Japanese Rice Genome Research Program of the National Institute of Agrobiological Resources and the Institute of the Society of Techno-Innovation in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. The approximate range of the synthetic homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNAs (Sigma) used in competition experiments was from 100 to 2000 nucleotides in length. For UV cross-linking experiments, varying amounts of the MAP fraction or recombinant protein were preincubated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 4 μg of yeast tRNA, 5 μg of heparin, and 1 unit of prime RNase inhibitor (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) for 10 min on ice followed by incubation with 1–3 ng (200,000 cpm) of synthetic radioactively labeled RNA probe for 10 min in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. When used, cold nucleic acid competitors were preincubated with the reaction mix prior to the addition of probe. The mixture was then cross-linked with 120,000 μJ/cm2 of UV light (254 nm wavelength) for 10 min using a cabinet UV light box (UVC-508, UltraLum), followed by treatment with 20 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film from 24 to 48 h. Gel mobility shift experiments were conducted as described previously (38Black D.L. Chan R. Min H. Wang J. Bell L. Smith C.W.J. RNA-Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 108-136Google Scholar). Reagent composition and incubation conditions for the gel mobility shift experiments were identical to that of the UV cross-linking experiments except that the samples were not exposed to UV light. One-third of the sample was then run on a 10% non-denaturing PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 12 h. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for the MFP-RNA interaction was estimated from the gel mobility shift assay by determining the protein concentration that resulted in 50% of the RNA bound and present in the shifted bands (38Black D.L. Chan R. Min H. Wang J. Bell L. Smith C.W.J. RNA-Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 108-136Google Scholar). Each of the UV cross-linking and gel mobility shift experiments was repeated at least twice. Amino acid sequence analysis using microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem-mass spectrometry was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility on a Finnigan LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Spectra were then correlated with known sequences in the data base using the algorithm Sequest (39Eng J. McCormick A. Yates J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar). The corresponding rice EST clone was obtained from the Japanese Rice Genome Research Program of the National Institute of Agrobiological Resources and the Institute of the Society of Techno-Innovation in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. DNA sequence analysis was performed at the University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Facility. Sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal and Boxshade programs. PCR was used to amplify the entire coding region of rice MFP (GenBankTM accession number C26129), and the resulting PCR fragment was cloned intoBamHI-PstI-digested pQE30 plasmid vector (Qiagen) to produce a fusion construct that coded for rice MFP and an amino-terminal His epitope tag. This expression construct was transformed into Escherichia coli (strain JM109), and the induction and batch purification of native recombinant protein using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin were performed as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The purified protein was desalted and concentrated using a Centricon-10 microfiltration apparatus (Amicon). Assembled microtubules were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a bench top ultracentrifuge (Beckman model TL-100) at 24 °C and then resuspended in microtubule-stabilizing buffer containing 10 μm taxol. The microtubule co-sedimentation assays were performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, 0.1 mm GTP, 1 mm EGTA, and 2.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin in a final volume of 20 μl and contained varying concentrations of microtubules, BSA, MFP, or labeled RNA. The reaction was incubated at 24 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE directly or used in UV cross-linking assays. Each of the microtubule co-sedimentation experiments were repeated twice. The binding stoichiometry andKd value for the MFP-microtubule interaction was derived from a plot of bound versus free MFP at a constant microtubule concentration as described previously (40Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratase activities of rice MFP were measured using assays described elsewhere (41Binstock J. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, thel-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase assay was based on the substrate-dependent oxidation of NADH determined by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm at 25 °C. Enoyl-CoA hydratase activity was assayed by measuring the hydration of the Δ2,3-enoyl-CoA substrate at 263 nm at 25 °C. Extinction coefficients of 6700 and 6220 m−1cm−1 were used to calculatel-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratase activities, respectively. Both of the enzyme activity assays were repeated twice. We used both microtubule- and tubulin-affinity chromatography to purify the MAP fraction from developing rice seeds as a first step in the identification of MAPs with RNA binding activity. Four chromatographic columns were prepared using either taxol-stabilized microtubules or unpolymerized tubulin as the ligand, from either bovine brain or plant tubulin sources. A BSA column served as an appropriate control to identify proteins that interacted solely based on nonspecific ionic interactions, because the isoelectric point of BSA (pI = ∼4.7) is similar to that of tubulin (pI = ∼4.6). Soluble protein extracts from developing rice seeds were loaded onto each column, which were then washed extensively with buffer containing 50 mmKCl, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 500 mm KCl. The resulting MAP fractions from either the bovine or plant microtubule and tubulin columns all appeared quite similar when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, differing primarily in the quantity of each protein rather than the presence or absence of different proteins (Fig.1A). Notably, a previous study (42Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 893-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) aimed at isolating MAPs from cultured carrot cell extracts also reported that microtubule- and tubulin-affinity chromatography resulted in the purification of similar protein profiles. Fig. 1Ashows also that the eluate from a BSA control column contained only a few proteins in low abundance, indicating that the microtubule and tubulin columns were specific in the proteins that they bound and did not behave simply as cation-exchange columns. Due to the similarity of the MAP fraction profiles from each column, bovine tubulin columns were used for all subsequent large scale isolations of MAP fractions because of the ease of purifying high quantities of tubulin from bovine brain and the increased stability of the tubulin columns compared with microtubule columns. The interaction of plant MAPs with animal tubulin has been well documented (35Schellenbaum P. Vantard M. Peter C. Fellous A. Lambert A.-M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 253-260Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Gardiner J.C. Harper J.D.I. Weerakoon N.D. Collings D.A. Ritchie S. Gilroy S. Cyr R.J. Marc J.

Two-dimensional NEPHGE demonstrated that the rice MAP fraction that bound to the bovine tubulin column contained ∼40–50 abundant proteins and about 100 less abundant proteins (Fig. 1B). The isoelectric points of a majority of these proteins was between 7 and 10, which is consistent with the general observation that MAPs are basic proteins (45Nogles E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 277-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). To confirm that the columns were indeed enriching for authentic MAPs, we probed two-dimensional gel blots of the MAP fraction with a polyclonal antiserum directed against EF-1α, a well characterized MAP (42Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 893-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Durso N.A. Leslie J.D. Cyr R.J. Protoplasma. 1996; 190: 141-150Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This antibody recognized a prominent cluster of EF-1α isoforms in the MAP fraction (Fig.1C). In an effort to identify rice MAPs that possessed RNA binding activity, in vitro UV cross-linking assays were performed. The 3′-UTR of the mRNA that encodes a class of rice prolamine seed storage proteins was used as a radioactively labeled probe in these assays. The prolamine mRNAs are localized to a distinct subdomain of the ER in rice endosperm cells, and a topogenic signal that resides, at least partially, within the 3′-UTR of the transcript is necessary for trafficking to that ER subdomain (28Choi S.-B. Wang C.W. Muench D.G. Ozawa K. Franceschi V.R. Wu Y. Okita T.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The MAP fractions from each of the tubulin and microtubule columns as well as BSA and the crude rice seed extract were preincubated in UV cross-linking buffer, and after the addition of the prolamine 3′-UTR probe, bound proteins were cross-linked to the labeled RNA with UV light. A single protein of ∼72 kDa in size (p72) displayed RNA binding activity in each of the four different MAP fractions tested (Fig. 2A). BSA alone did not cross-link to the probe, and only diffuse labeling of a smaller number of low molecular mass proteins was visible when crude rice endosperm extract was used in the UV cross-linking assays (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that when either the prolamine mRNA coding region, the glutelin 3′-UTR, actin mRNA, or γ- and β-tubulin mRNAs were used as probes with the bovine tubulin column MAP fraction protein in the UV cross-linking assay, p72 was cross-linked with each of the probes. We then determined the effect of salt on the formation of the p72-RNA complex. A KCl concentration between 150 and 250 mm prevented the formation of this complex in UV cross-linking assays (Fig. 2C). To characterize further the sequence specificity of the p72 RNA binding activity in the MAP fraction, UV cross-linking assays using the prolamine 3′-UTR as the probe were performed in reactions that were preincubated with an excess amount (i.e. 10-, 100-, 200-, and 1000-fold excess) of unlabeled nucleic acid competitors. When mRNAs or regions of mRNAs, such as the prolamine 3′-UTR, 5′-UTR, or coding region, were used as cold competitors at 1000-fold excess by weight, probe binding to p72 was essentially eliminated (Fig.2D, 1st row). The prolamine 3′-UTR was the most effective of the mRNA competitors tested, consistently showing a visible reduction in probe binding at as"

Following DNA damage or cellular stress, p53 is phosphorylated within the Mdm2 binding domain on threonine 18 and serine 20. To analyze the roles of these phosphorylation events, residues 18 and 20 were mutated to alanines. Transient transfection into p53-null cells demonstrated that the T18A protein can be expressed stably, but the S20A protein is very unstable, precluding further analysis. When expressed stably at low basal levels in p53-null human fibroblasts or fibrosarcoma cells, the T18A mutant accumulated 5–10-fold less well than wild-type p53 following exposure to UV. Analysis of p53-dependent transcription following UV revealed that the phosphorylation of threonine 18 is required for transactivation of the p21, Hdm2 (the human ortholog of Mdm2), and GADD45 genes. The phosphorylation of serine 33, another early event following DNA damage, is not required for p53 accumulation or p53-dependent transactivation following UV.

Loss of p53 function increases the potential for cell proliferation in the presence of damaged DNA (1Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Prives C.

Control of p53 function is enforced, in large part, by its negative regulator mouse double minute 2 (Mdm21 or Hdm2 in human cells). p53 and Mdm2 comprise a feedback loop. Mdm2 binds to the N-terminal domain of p53 (amino acids 17–27), blocking its transactivation function. Because Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, it also modifies p53 and targets it for proteosome-mediated degradation (4Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar, 5Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 6Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). p53, in turn, is a transcription factor for the Mdm2 gene (7Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, the p53-Mdm2 interaction is lost, and the p53 protein accumulates and binds to DNA (8Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The properties of human tumors and Mdm2-null mice exemplify the importance of this regulatory loop. Mdm2-null mice do not survive because of overexpression of p53, but Mdm2-null, p53-null mice do survive (9Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Mdm2 was first identified as a protein overexpressed in a mouse tumor cell line carrying an amplification of the gene in double minute chromosomes (10Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Hdm2 has been found to be amplified in human tumors (11Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). In these cases, overexpression of Mdm2 or Hdm2 depletes cellular p53. In unstressed cells, p53 is present at a low basal level in a complex with Mdm2 (8Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, the human p53 N-terminal region is phosphorylated on serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 33, and 37 and threonine 18. The association with Mdm2 is lost (8Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T.

These post-translational modifications also enable p53 to bind to DNA and transactivate its target genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Mdm2 binds to p53 within a region spanning amino acids 17–27 (18Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Threonine 18 and serine 20 are the only p53 phosphorylation sites within the p53-Mdm2 interaction domain; therefore, they are the most likely to regulate the p53-Mdm2 interaction. Consistent with this idea, p53-derived peptides phosphorylated on threonine 18 or serine 20, but not on serines 15, 33, or 37, showed reduced affinity for Mdm2 (13Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The role of CKI in the DNA damage response is not known. However, CKI recognition sites are phosphorylated more efficiently when a negative charge is present three residues away in the direction of the N terminus, creating a recognition site for this ubiquitously expressed kinase (reviewed in Ref. 23Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For example, serine 15, which is phosphorylated by stress-activated kinases such as DNA-PKII, ATM, and ATR, is three residues away from threonine 18. The phosphorylation of serine 15 may make threonine 18 more susceptible to phosphorylation by CKI (24Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C.

Tainsky M.A. Friend S.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1233-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar). Mutations in Chk2 have been identified in human tumors, and p53 is not stabilized in cells from Chk2-null mice following DNA damage (37Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Taken together, this evidence suggests a critical role for Chk2 in signaling to p53, probably through the phosphorylation of serine 20. Use of phosphospecific antibodies has demonstrated that both threonine 18 and serine 20 are phosphorylated after DNA damage, suggesting a role for these sites in regulating p53-Mdm2 association and therefore, in p53 protein stability (14Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 20 after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR) or UV correlates with the timing of p53 protein accumulation, which occurs 1–2 h after IR and 4 h after UV (13Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 14Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The timing of threonine 18 phosphorylation has not been studied as carefully, although one report does show phosphorylation of this site 2 h after IR (13Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylations of threonine 18 and serine 20 are relatively early events following DNA damage and are likely to play a role in the dissociation of p53 from Mdm2. Serine 33 is also phosphorylated very soon after DNA is damaged, within 1 h following irradiation with UV or IR (14Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Serine 33 is phosphorylated by Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (40Ko L.J. Shieh S.Y. Chen X. Jayaraman L. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7220-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This interaction could provide a signal to p53 from RNA polymerase that has been stalled by polymerase poisons or bulky DNA lesions. We have previously restored wild-type and phosphorylation-site mutant p53 cDNAs to p53-null fibroblasts by using a tetracycline-regulated system (41Bean L.J.H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This system allowed us to express p53 at low basal levels in cells with a normal p53 response and to examine the properties of these mutant proteins. In the current study, we examine the effect of mutating additional residues that are phosphorylated soon after DNA-damaging events on p53 accumulation and p53-dependent transactivation following DNA damage. pTO and pTA.hygro were previously reported (42Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar). pTO.neo and pTO.p53 wt.neo were previously described (41Bean L.J.H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). pTO.p53.S20A.neo and pTO.p53.S33A.neo were generated by PCR-SOEing (41Bean L.J.H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using the S20A mutagenic forward primer, 5′-GGAAACATTTGCAGACCTATGG-3′; reverse mutagenic primer, 5′-CCATAGGTCTGCAAATGTTTCC-3′; S33A forward mutagenic primer, 5′-CAACGTTCTGGCCCCCTTGCC-3′; and reverse mutagenic primer, 5′-GGCAAGGGGGCCAGAACGTTG-3′. The T18A mutation was created by amplifying pTO.p53.neo, using the long forward primer T18A.l-F (5′-GTCACTGCCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAGCATTTTC-3′) with the reverse primer p53UTR-R (5′-GGCTGGGGCGCGGAGCTGG-3′). The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with NcoI, and ligated into pBS.p53 and then pTO.neo as previously described (41Bean L.J.H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting construct, pTO.p53.T18A-P.neo and all previously described pTO.p53 constructs contain a proline residue at amino acid 72. pTO.p53.T18A-R.neo was constructed by removing the p53 NcoI N-terminal fragment from p53-18ApCB6+ (a gift from Margaret Ashcroft, National Institutes of Heath, Bethesda, MD) and ligating it into pBS.p53 and pTO.neo. This construct contains an arginine residue at amino acid 72. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. MDAH041, a spontaneously immortalized Li-Fraumeni skin fibroblast cell line, was described previously (43Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Yim S.O. Pratt D.R. Siciliano M.J. Giovanella B.C. Tainsky M.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 183-186PubMed Google Scholar) as were MDAH041 cells stably transfected with pTA (44Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The Mwt (previously described in Ref. 41Bean L.J.H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar as TRwt cells), M18, and M33 cell lines were generated by calcium phosphate transfection of pTO.p53.neo constructs into MDAH041.pTA (hygro) cells in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml). M18-R clones have an arginine residue at amino acid 72. All others have a proline residue at amino acid 72. Selection of stable clones was done with G418 (400 μg/ml active). Clones screened by Western transfer for p53 expression were prepared by first removing tetracycline for 24 h, then treating the cells with adriamycin (ADR) (200 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h to increase the levels of p53. Clones Mwt-3, M18-2R, M18-3R, M33-2, and M33-3 had more p53 protein than Mwt-2; therefore, they were used in the presence of tetracycline (0.01 μg/ml) to normalize the basal p53 levels to that of Mwt-2 cells. The 3-7 cells were derived from HT1080 cells through a mutagenesis strategy described in Agarwal et al.(45Agarwal M.L. Ramana C.V. Hamilton M. Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Bean L.J.H. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.K. Wolfman A. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2527-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and express 99% less p53 mRNA and p53 protein than parental HT1080 cells. The 3-7.pTA cells were generated by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of 3-7 cells with pTA.hygro (described in Ref. 42Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected in 250 μg/ml hygromycin. Because the pTA protein is required for pTO promoter function, positive transfectants were identified by their capability to express luciferase following calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfection of pTO.luciferase. Luciferase expression was assayed with the Promega assay system. SV2-βgal was co-transfected as a control. A single 3-7.pTA clone, selected for an intermediate level of pTA expression, was chosen as the parental 3-7.pTA line. Hwt, H18, and H33 clones were generated by transfection of 3-7.pTA cells with pTO.p53.neo, pTO.p53.T18A-P.neo, or pTO.p53.S33A.neo in the presence of hygromycin and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Stable clones were selected in 600 μg/ml (active) G418 and screened for p53 expression by Western analysis. Four separate Hwt, H18, or H33 clones expressing similar low p53 basal levels were identified. Clones were maintained individually. For each experiment, Hwt, H18, or H33 cells were counted using a hemocytometer, pooled in equal numbers, and plated for 24 h prior to treatment. Western transfers onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) were performed with whole cell extracts after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide). Protein concentrations of lysates were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal quantities of protein were loaded for each sample. To detect p53, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm EDTA; 1 mmphenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 25 μg/ml leupeptin; and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The membranes were probed with the DO-1 monoclonal antibody to p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was detected with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Dupont Pharmaceuticals). To quantify the levels of p53, the membranes were analyzed by using enhanced chemifluorescence (Dupont Pharmaceuticals) and read using a StormImager (Molecular Dynamics). The results were analyzed with ImageQuant software. Serine 15 phosphorylation was detected using phospho-p53 (Ser15) antibody (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), separated by electrophoresis in a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action, and probed with32P-labeled probes for HDM, p21, GADD45, or GAPDH. Quantitation was performed by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the results were analyzed with ImageQuant software. All treatments were performed 24 h after removal of tetracycline. The UV dose in all cases was measured by using a Traceable Ultra Violet Light Meter (Control Company). The optimal dose for each cell type was the dose that gave the highest level of p53 accumulation without down-regulating p53-responsive genes. MHAD041-derived clones were treated with 25 J/m2, and HT1080-derived clones were treated with 20 J/m2. UV irradiation was performed after removal of most of the culture medium. The optimal adriamycin dose was determined by a dose response curve. Maximal p53 accumulation was achieved at 200 ng/ml medium in MDAH041-derived cells and 300 ng/ml medium in HT1080-derived cells. An estimate of the mean for each individual clone was calculated as best linear unbiased estimates, where individual clones were considered to be random effects and each mean was regressed toward the overall mean for each clone type (46Robinson G. Stat. Sci. 1991; 6: 15-51Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The overall mean for each type of clone was estimated as a least squares mean, with individual clones considered to be random effects. Calculated p-values among clone types were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey-Kramer method to maintain an overall 0.05 significance level for each hypothesis (47Kramer C. Biometrics. 1956; 12: 310Crossref Google Scholar). Standard errors for each clone type and individual clone were calculated as the square root of the variance of the mean, which was a function of the within- and between-clone variability. Analyses were done using Mixed Procedure (SAS Statistical Software). To examine the importance of threonine 18 or serine 20 in regulating p53 stability and function, pTO.p53wt, pTO.p53.T18A-P, and pTO.p53.S20A were transfected transiently into p53-null MDAH041 cells. Western analysis revealed that, although the wild-type and T18A mutant proteins were expressed at high levels, the S20A mutant protein was nearly undetectable (Fig. 1). Northern analysis revealed high levels of all three mRNAs, indicating that it is the S20A protein and not the S20A mRNA that is unstable (Fig. 1). Consistent with the data from transient transfections, clones stably expressing the S20A protein could not be generated. These results indicate that serine 20 is required for basal stability of the p53 protein. We have used a tetracycline-regulated system to express wild-type and phosphorylation site mutant p53 proteins at low basal levels in MDAH041 fibroblasts (41Bean L.J.H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of relatively high levels of wild-type p53 in these cells results in the transactivation of downstream genes and in growth arrest (44Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Six independent 041-derived clones stably expressing T18A were isolated. Clones M18-1P and M18-2P have a proline residue at position 72, whereas M18-1R through M18-4R have an arginine residue at this position. All other wild-type and mutant clones have a proline at amino acid 72. This naturally occurring polymorphism at position 72 does not affect the accumulation of p53 after DNA damage (see below). The accumulation of the T18A mutant protein in response to UV was impaired compared with that of the wild-type clone Mwt3 (Fig.2A). To quantify the difference between the accumulation of these two proteins, the levels of p53 were measured by chemifluorescence 18 h after irradiation with UV (Fig. 2B). For each clone, the mean percentage increase and the standard error were determined as described in “Materials and Methods.” The average percentage increase for all T18A clones was determined and compared with the wild-type average. Analysis of variance for pairwise comparisons of each type of clone indicated that the accumulation of the protein in M18 clones (average 87%) was significantly lower than in wild-type clones (average 460%;p < 0.001). Therefore, threonine 18 is required for the p53 protein to accumulate efficiently following irradiation with UV in MDAH041 cells. A second p53-null cell line was also utilized. Following mutagenesis (45Agarwal M.L. Ramana C.V. Hamilton M. Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Bean L.J.H. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.K. Wolfman A. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2527-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the 3-7 clone was isolated from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which express high levels of wild-type p53. p53 mRNA and protein expression are reduced by 99% in 3-7 cells (data not shown). The levels of exogenous p53 must be carefully regulated in HT1080-derived cells because, no accumulation was observed after DNA damage in clones that express a high level of p53. Four 3-7-derived clones expressing wild-type (Hwt clones) and four expressing the T18A mutant (H18 clones) were isolated and compared with a pool of Hwt cells. Accumulation of the T18A mutant protein was also compared with wild-type protein in 3-7 cells. Western analysis showed that pooled H18 clones accumulated less p53 protein than pooled Hwt clones (Fig. 2D). The percentage increase in wild-type or mutant p53 was quantified over the 24-h time course and is represented graphically. As in MDAH041 cells, threonine 18 is required for p53 to accumulate efficiently after UV damage. Because serine 15 is required for p53 to accumulate after UV damage, its phosphorylation was analyzed in M18 and H18 clones after UV irradiation using a phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 2, C andD). Phosphorylation of serine 15 was observed in both M18 and H18 clones, albeit at a much lower level than in wild-type controls. This deficiency corresponds to the lower levels of mutant protein after UV damage. These results could not be quantified by StormImager analysis because of the relatively weak phosphospecific antibody signal. Four MDAH041-derived clones stably expressing low basal levels of the S33A mutant protein (M33 clones) were isolated and compared with Mwt clones for p53 accumulation following DNA damage. Four 3-7-derived clones expressing the S33A mutant proteins (H33 clones) were also isolated, pooled, and compared with pooled Hwt clones. p53 in Mwt clones and M33 clones accumulated similarly for 24 h following UV (Fig.3A). The phosphorylation of serine 15 was normal in M33 clones compared with Mwt clones. p53 accumulation was quantified by chemifluorescence 18 h after irradiation with UV in four independent clones. Analysis of variance for pairwise comparisons between clone types revealed no significant difference between wild-type and mutant clones (Fig. 3B). Similarly, there was no difference in accumulation or serine 15 phosphorylation between wild-type and S33A mutant proteins in pooled 3-7 clones following irradiation with UV (Fig. 3C). Because serine 33 is phosphorylated very soon after irradiation with UV (14Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,39Sakaguchi K.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), the accumulation of p53 in Mwt and M33 clones 1, 2, and 3 h and Hwt and H33 pools 30, 60, and 90 min after exposure to UV was examined. The accumulation and serine 15 phosphorylation of the wild-type and S33A proteins were similar in both cell systems (Fig. 3D). Mwt, M18, and M33 clones were treated with 200 ng/ml adriamycin, and the accumulation of p53 was compared with Mwt clones over a 24-h time course. The accumulation of p53 in all three was similar (data not shown). The phosphorylation of serine 15 was observed in wild-type, M18, and M33"

Expression of one family member, PTG, in the liver of normal rats improves glucose tolerance without affecting other plasma variables but leaves animals unable to reduce hepatic glycogen stores in response to fasting. In the current study, we have tested whether expression of other targeting subunit isoforms, such as the liver isoform GL, the muscle isoform GM/RGl, or a truncated version of GM/RGl termed GMΔC in liver ameliorates glucose intolerance in rats fed on a high fat diet (HF). HF animals overexpressing GMΔC, but not GL or GM/RGl, exhibited a decline in blood glucose of 35–44 mg/dl relative to control HF animals during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) such that levels were indistinguishable from those of normal rats fed on standard chow at all but one time point. Hepatic glycogen levels were 2.1–2.4-fold greater in GL- and GMΔC-overexpressing HF rats compared with control HF animals following OGTT. In a second set of studies on fed and 20-h fasted HF animals, GMΔC-overexpressing rats lowered their liver glycogen levels by 57% (from 402 ± 54 to 173 ± 27 μg of glycogen/mg of protein) in the fasted versusfed states compared with only 44% in GL-overexpressing animals (from 740 ± 35 to 413 ± 141 μg of glycogen/mg of protein). Since the OGTT studies were performed on 20-h fasted rats, this meant that GMΔC-overexpressing rats synthesized much more glycogen than GL-overexpressing HF rats during the OGTT (419 versus 117 μg of glycogen/mg of protein, respectively), helping to explain why GMΔC preferentially enhanced glucose clearance. We conclude that GMΔC has a unique combination of glycogenic potency and responsiveness to glycogenolytic signals that allows it to be used to lower blood glucose levels in diabetes.

One method for increasing liver glycogen content is to increase the activity of the glucose phosphorylating enzyme, glucokinase. Indeed, overexpression of this enzyme in liver of normal rats (4O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar) or mice (5Hariharan N.

However, these changes are accompanied by increases in circulating free fatty acids, triglycerides, and lactate (4O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar), consistent with the large increase in glycolytic flux caused by overexpression of glucokinase in hepatocytes or hepatoma cells (7O'Doherty R.M.

More specific stimulation of glycogen synthesis in liver may be achievable by manipulation of the expression of proteins that function distal to the glucose phosphorylation step. In particular, recent studies have highlighted an important role for glycogen-targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1)1 in spatial organization and regulation of glycogen metabolism (9Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Google Scholar). Prominent members of this gene family include GM or RGl(hereafter referred to as GM/RGl), expressed primarily in striated skeletal muscle (10Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Google Scholar), GL, expressed primarily in liver (11Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.

These proteins bind to glycogen and protein phosphatase-1 and have differential capacities for binding to glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (9Newgard C.B. Brady M.J.

It has become apparent that a major challenge inherent in considering glycogen-targeting subunits as molecules for enhancing hepatic glucose disposal is to choose or design a protein with the optimal combination of regulatory features. Thus, overexpression of glycogen-targeting subunits reveals that all family members tested stimulate glycogen deposition in rat hepatocytes but with clear differences in potency in the order GL > PTG > GM/RGl(15Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar). Cells with overexpressed targeting subunits also exhibit differences in response to glycogenolytic agents such as glucagon and forskolin in the order (from more to less responsive) of GM/RGl > GL ≈ PTG (15Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar, 16Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). To date, we have performed one in vivo study in which hepatic overexpression of PTG in normal rats was shown to improve glucose tolerance without perturbation of lipid homeostasis (17O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar). However, these animals also had markedly elevated liver glycogen levels in the fed state and almost no reduction in hepatic glycogen stores in response to an overnight fast, suggesting that they might be more susceptible to perturbations in glycemic control during prolonged fasting, sustained exercise, or other stressful circumstances. These findings have recently led us to design and test a novel form of glycogen-targeting subunit derived from GM/RGl(16Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). Native GM/RGl is distinct from other members of its gene family in that it contains two consensus sequences for protein kinase A-mediated serine phosphorylation. One of these sites resides within the PP-1 binding site of GM/RGl, and its phosphorylation leads to dissociation of the phosphatase, contributing to inactivation of glycogen synthesis (10Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Google Scholar, 18Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Google Scholar, 19Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (.20)): 13858-13864Google Scholar). GM/RGl is also distinguished from other targeting subunits by virtue of its large C terminus that includes a hydrophobic domain that mediates binding of the protein to sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle (10Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Google Scholar, 20Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 189: 245-249Google Scholar). Removal of 735 C-terminal amino acids from native GM/RGlyields a 275-amino acid molecule that we have termed GMΔC that can be directly aligned with the similarly sized native GL and PTG proteins. Overexpression of GMΔC and native GM/RGl in hepatocytes reveals that the former protein is more effective at stimulating glycogen synthesis (16Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike PTG- or GL-overexpressing cells, cells with GMΔC overexpression retain responsiveness to glycogenolytic signals such as forskolin or lowering of media glucose concentrations. These promising findings have led us, in the current study, to compare the metabolic impact of GMΔC, GL, and GM/RGl overexpression in whole animals. These studies have been performed in rats fed on a high fat diet for 7 weeks to cause a syndrome of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance such as is seen in early stage type 2 diabetes. We find that GMΔC is unique among the molecules tested in its capacity to reverse diet-induced glucose intolerance. All procedures were carried out in accordance with animal care guidelines of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and the National Research Council. Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA and Harlan Tekland Laboratory, Winfield, IA) weighing 175–200 g were housed on a 12-h light-dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and either standard laboratory chow (65% carbohydrate, 4% fat, 24% protein; Harlan Tekland Laboratory diet 7001) or high fat diet (19% lard, 1% corn oil; Harlan Tekland Laboratory diet 96001) unless otherwise specified. The rats were housed under these conditions for 7 weeks before adenovirus administration. Rats were treated with cyclosporin (15 mg/kg; Calbiochem) for 3 consecutive days starting on the day prior to adenovirus administration and Depo-Medrol (1.5 mg/kg; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) on the day of adenoviral treatment. The preparation and testing of recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNAs encoding GL (AdCMV-GL), GM/RGl (AdCMV-GM/RGl), a truncated form of GM/RGl with its 735 C-terminal amino acids deleted (AdCMV-GMΔC), or β-galactosidase (AdCMV-βGAL) have been described previously (15Gasa R.

Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Google Scholar). Aliquots of these viruses were amplified and purified for the current study as described previously (22Becker T. Noel R. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Google Scholar). Between 0.5 and 1.5 × 1012 recombinant adenovirus particles were administered via tail vein injection to rats anesthetized with Nembutal (50 μg/g of body weight intraperitoneally; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) or a 50:5:1 mixture of ketamine (Avoco, Fort Dodge, IA), Rompun (Avoco), and acepromazine (Haver, Shawnee, KS) as described elsewhere (4O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar, 23Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Google Scholar). After viral administration, animals were individually caged to allow monitoring of food intake and body weight before initiation of experiments. Two experimental protocols were performed. In the first, animals were infused with AdCMV-GL, AdCMV-GM/RGl, AdCMV-GMΔC, or AdCMV-βGAL viruses. Ninety hours after virus administration, animals were fasted for 20 h with free access to water. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed by anesthetizing animals with Nembutal (50 μg/g of body weight intraperitoneally) and administration of a bolus of 2 g of glucose/kg of body weight by gavage of a 45% solution of glucose in water. Blood samples (∼20 μl/sample from the tail vein) were collected immediately before administration of the bolus and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after the bolus for measurement of circulating glucose concentrations. Animals were sacrificed immediately after the 180-min time point for collection of blood and liver. The liver samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until further analysis. In the second protocol, animals were infused with AdCMV-GL, AdCMV-GMΔC, or AdCMV-βGAL viruses. Ninety hours after virus administration, animals were either fasted for 20 h or allowed to continue feeding ad libitum. Thereafter, all animals were anesthetized with Nembutal (50 μg/g of body weight intraperitoneally), blood samples were taken, and liver was excised and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until further analysis. The procedure used was based on methods described previously (15Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar, 17O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from powdered liver or muscle tissue using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA was prepared using 0.5 μg of total RNA, the Superscript RT kit, and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The cDNA was diluted 1:6 in distilled water, and PCR was carried out using 5 μl of the diluted cDNA and a PCR mix containingTaq DNA polymerase (2.5 units) and buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), dNTP mix (final concentrations of 40 mm of each dNTP except dCTP, which was present at 20 mm; Invitrogen) and with or without 1.25 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (2,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 25-μl reaction volume. Four primer sets (5 pmol of each primer) were used in these studies. The first set specifically amplified a 181-bp fragment from the GL transgene and did not amplify endogenous rat GL because the upstream primer hybridizes to 5′ untranslated sequence derived from the adenovirus vector (5′ primer, CGAGCTCGGTACCAACTTC; 3′ primer, GAAGGTGAAGCGCTCTCTG). The second set amplified a 162-bp product from either the full-length endogenous GM/RGlor GMΔC transgene as described previously (15Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar). The third oligonucleotide pair specifically amplified a 900-bp fragment of GMΔC derived by expression from the AdCMV-GMΔC adenovirus because the upstream primer hybridizes to sequence within the GMΔC cDNA sequence, while the 3′ primer hybridizes to the 3′ untranslated region derived from the adenovirus vector (5′ primer, CTCAAAGGAAGATCTTATGCAAC; 3′ primer, GGTAGTTTGTCCAATTATGTCAC). The last oligonucleotide pair amplified one of the following as internal standards: a 186-bp fragment of the endogenous TATA-binding protein transcript, a 201-bp fragment of the elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) mRNA (17O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar), or a 250-bp fragment of the α-tubulin gene (5′ primer, GCGTGAGTGTATCTCCATCCA; 3′ primer, GGTAGGTGCCAGTGCGAACTT). In experiments involving inclusion of [α-33P]dCTP, PCR conditions were an initial incubation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 22 or 24 cycles (the latter only when studying full-length GM/RGl transgene expression) of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The final PCR products were mixed with 98% formamide denaturing loading buffer and separated on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the resulting scan was analyzed using ImageQuant from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, California). In the experiments designed to assess expression of the GMΔC transgene in extrahepatic tissues, PCRs were carried out in the absence of [α-33P]dCTP. For these experiments, PCR conditions were an initial incubation at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. 5 μl of the PCR product was resolved on an agarose gel, and products were visualized by incubation of the gel with 0.6 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Plasma insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma triglyceride, ketone, and lactate levels were measured using kits from Sigma Chemical Co. Plasma free fatty acids were measured using a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Plasma glucose was measured using a HemoCue Glucose Analyzer (HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). Liver glycogen content was measured by an amyloglucosidase-based assay as described elsewhere (24Newgard C.B. Hirsch L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8046-8052Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student'st test using the statistics module of Microsoft Excel (version 5.0; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Adenovirus-mediated expression of the various glycogen-targeting subunit isoforms in liver was evaluated by semiquantitative multiplex RT-PCR analysis in animals fed on the high fat diet (HF). A representative gel is shown in Fig.1A. Animals treated with AdCMV-βGAL exhibited either no signal or background at the positions expected for the reverse-transcribed and amplified fragments of GL, GMΔC, or GM/RGl. Rats infused with AdCMV-GL, AdCMV-GM/RGl, or AdCMV-GMΔC showed clear expression of the respective transgene mRNAs. When normalized to the internal control, TATA-binding protein, GL and GMΔC mRNA levels were found to be indistinguishable and ∼3-fold greater than the levels of GM/RGl transgene RNA (Fig. 1B). The lower apparent efficiency of GM/RGloverexpression relative to the other two targeting subunits is consistent with our previous findings in isolated hepatocytes (15Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar, 16Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). No attempt could be made to correct for the clearly lower level of GM/RGl expression since infusion of higher viral titers began to have toxic effects as assessed by an increase in the activity of a liver enzyme, aspartyl aminotransferase (PGOT) in the blood of these animals (data not shown). It should also be pointed out that our main goal was to compare the highly glycogenic targeting subunit GL with our novel construct GMΔC. To test the capacity of the various glycogen-targeting subunits to improve glucose homeostasis, we performed OGTTs in the HF animals evaluated for targeting subunit expression in Fig. 1 as well as a group of rats that were fed on normal chow and infused with AdCMV-βGAL. As shown in Fig. 2, AdCMV-βGAL-treated animals fed on normal chow had normal glucose tolerance with a rapid decline of blood glucose from a maximum of 170 mg/dl at 30 min after the glucose load and a return to basal levels by 150 min. In sharp contrast, AdCMV-βGAL-treated HF rats were clearly glucose-intolerant with a higher excursion of blood glucose to a peak value of 210 mg/dl at 60 min after the glucose bolus and a slow decline thereafter that failed to approach baseline values by 180 min. Surprisingly, HF rats treated with AdCMV-GM/RGlor AdCMV-GL exhibited no significant improvement in glucose tolerance during OGTT. In contrast, HF animals treated with AdCMV-GMΔC had glucose levels indistinguishable from those of AdCMV-βGAL-treated rats fed on normal chow, except at 150 min where glucose was slightly elevated compared with the standard chow controls but still lower than that in the other three treatment groups. To determine whether the differential effects of the various glycogen-targeting subunits on glucose levels in the OGTT were related to glycogen deposition, liver glycogen levels were measured in animals at the conclusion of the experiment (180-min time point) summarized in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows that high fat feeding per se did not increase liver glycogen stores relative to feeding with normal chow (both of these control groups were treated with AdCMV-βGAL). Treatment of HF rats with AdCMV-GM/RGl did not enhance glycogen accumulation compared with either control group. However, treatment of HF animals with AdCMV-GL or AdCMV-GMΔC resulted in 108 and 138% increases in liver glycogen, respectively, relative to the AdCMV-βGAL-treated HF controls. Thus, both GL- and GMΔC-overexpressing animals had higher liver glycogen levels following OGTT, but only the AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats had improved glucose tolerance. A large aliquot of blood was collected from animals at the conclusion of the OGTT experiment summarized in Fig. 2 (180-min time point), allowing several plasma variables to be measured. As summarized in TableI, in HF animals, overexpression of the various glycogen-targeting subunit isoforms had no effect on circulating free fatty acids, ketones, lactate, or insulin relative to AdCMV-βGAL-treated controls. Treatment of animals with AdCMV-GL or AdCMV-GM/RGl also did not alter circulating triglyceride (TG) levels. However, AdCMV-GMΔC treatment did cause an 80% increase in TG levels relative to those of AdCMV-βGAL-treated controls that was significant at the level of p = 0.045.Table IPlasma variables in AdCMV-βGAL-, AdCMV-GL-, AdCMV-GM/RGl-, and AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats after the OGTT protocolAdCMV-βGAL (n = 12)AdCMV-GL (n = 6)AdCMV-GM/RGl (n = 7)AdCMV-GMΔC (n = 7)Triglycerides (mg/dl)106.2 ± 14.289.0 ± 18.192.0 ± 19.8191.8 ± 33.3*FFAs (mmol/l)0.26 ± 0.020.20 ± 0.020.23 ± 0.030.28 ± 0.03Ketones (mg/dl)2.84 ± 0.582.06 ± 0.532.33 ± 0.722.74 ± 0.73Lactate (mg/dl)16.0 ± 3.19.1 ± 1.311.4 ± 1.010.9 ± 1.4Insulin (ng/ml)3.78 ± 0.392.90 ± 0.413.65 ± 0.754.67 ± 0.38Male Wistar rats were fed a high fat diet for 7 weeks.

In previous studies involving systemic infusion of recombinant adenoviruses to deliver the glucokinase or glucose-6-phosphatase genes in rats, we found no evidence of transgene expression in extrahepatic tissues such as muscle, fat, brain, or kidney and only very low levels of expression in lung (4O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar, 28Trinh K. O'Doherty R. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31615-31620Google Scholar). However, even modest expression of targeting subunits in a large tissue mass such as muscle could potentially affect the conclusions of the current study. To eliminate this possibility, we used RT-PCR to measure expression of the GMΔC transcript in liver and skeletal muscle of AdCMV-βGAL- and AdCMV-GMΔC-infused animals. This assay used an oligonucleotide pair that specifically amplifies the transcript derived from the adenovirus construct and not endogenous GM/RGl. As a positive control, treatment of 293 cells with AdCMV-GMΔC and RT-PCR analysis of RNA derived from such cells resulted in amplification of a band of the predicted size of 900 nucleotides (Fig. 4). RT-PCR analysis was also performed on RNA isolated from liver and muscle samples taken from three AdCMV-βGAL- or three AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats subjected to OGTT. As shown in Fig. 4, a band of the same size as that in the AdCMV-GMΔC-treated 293 cells was clearly detected in liver samples of AdCMV-GMΔC-treated, but not AdCMV-βGAL-treated, rats. However, a band of this size was not amplified from muscle RNA regardless of whether the animals were treated with AdCMV-GMΔC. These findings clearly demonstrate that the improved glucose tolerance reported in Fig. 2 is due to expression of GMΔC in liver and not in muscle. In an effort to better understand the differential effects of GMΔC and GL overexpression on glucose tolerance (Fig. 2), we next studied liver glycogen levels in fed and fasted HF animals treated with AdCMV-GMΔC or AdCMV-GL. Multiplex RT-PCR analysis of transgene expression levels in these animals is summarized in Fig.5. In both the AdCMV-GL- and AdCMV-GMΔC-treated groups, transgene expression tended to be lower in fasted animals, but this difference was not significant in either group. Comparison of GMΔC to GLmRNA levels in fed versus fed or fastedversus fasted groups also revealed no significant differences. As shown in Fig. 6, AdCMV-βGAL-treated HF rats contained 317 ± 46 μg of glycogen/mg of protein in the fed state and depleted this reserve by 68%, to 103 ± 15 μg of glycogen/mg of protein, in response to a 20-h fast. Interestingly, fed AdCMV-GL-treated rats accumulated 740 ± 35 μg of glycogen/mg of protein, 2.3 times more than fed AdCMV-βGAL-treated controls, and were only able to lower glycogen by 44% in response to fasting to a level of 413 ± 141 μg of glycogen/mg of protein. In sharp contrast, fed AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats contained 402 ± 54 μg of glycogen/mg of protein in liver and reduced their glycogen stores by 57% in response to the 20-h fast to 173 ± 27 μg of glycogen/mg of protein, a value slightly higher than that in fasted AdCMV-βGAL-treated controls. Importantly, the liver glycogen level in fasted AdCMV-GL-treated rats was 80% of that in AdCMV-GL-treated rats following OGTT. In contrast, liver glycogen content in fasted AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats was only 29% of that in AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats following OGTT. In other words, AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats synthesized 419 μg of glycogen/mg of protein during the OGTT compared with an increment of only 117 μg of glycogen/mg of protein in AdCMV-GL-treated animals (value"
https://openalex.org/W2122287746,"ICln is an ion channel identified by expression cloning using a cDNA library from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In all organisms tested so far, only one transcript for the ICln protein could be identified. Here we show that two splice variants of the ICln ion channel can be found in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, we show that these two splice variants of the ICln channel protein, which we termed IClnN1 and IClnN2, can be functionally reconstituted and tested in an artificial lipid bilayer. In these experiments, the IClnN1-induced currents showed no voltage-dependent inactivation, whereas the IClnN2-induced currents fully inactivated at positive potentials. The molecular entity responsible for the voltage-dependent inactivation of IClnN2 is a cluster of positively charged amino acids encoded by exon 2a, which is absent in IClnN1. Our experiments suggest a mechanism of channel inactivation that is similar to the “ball and chain” model proposed for the Shaker potassium channel,i.e. a cluster of positively charged amino acids hinders ion permeation through the channel by a molecular and voltage-dependent interaction at the inner vestibulum of the pore. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that synthetic peptides with the same amino acid sequence as the positive cluster can transform the IClnN1-induced current to the current observed after reconstitution of IClnN2. Furthermore, we show that the nematode ICln gene is embedded in an operon harboring two additional genes, which we termed Nx and Ny. Co-reconstitution of Nx and IClnN2 and functional analysis of the related currents revealed a functional interaction between the two proteins, as evidenced by the fact that the IClnN2-induced current in the presence of Nx was no longer voltage-sensitive. The experiments described indicate that the genome organization in nematodes allows an effective approach for the identification of functional partner proteins of ion channels.

The activation of these channels permits the exit of ions, which in turn leads to the exit of water, therefore allowing an effective regulatory volume decrease (3Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). The molecular entity of the regulatory volume decrease-induced “anionic” channels (RVDCs) is still elusive. Our hypothesis that ICln is a candidate for RVDCs is supported by the fact that the selective knockdown of the ICln protein in fibroblasts and epithelial cells leads to a substantial decrease in swelling-induced RVDC activation (4Chen L. Wang L. Jacob T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C182-C192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gschwentner M. Nagl O.U. Wöll E. Schmarda A. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nucleotide sensitivity of ICln expressed in oocytes was also found for RVDCs (5Gschwentner M. Nagl O.U.

Med. 1995; 1: 407-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), again demonstrating that ICln and RVDCs are closely related. Heterolog expression experiments were not able to unambiguously prove the channel nature of ICln, especially because we demonstrated that the ICln protein, despite its localization in the membrane, can also be identified (water-soluble) in the cytosol of growing cells. The successful reconstitution of the ICln ion channel in black lipid bilayers proved the channel nature of ICln; and the hypothesis that the water-soluble ICln protein could be directly transposed from the cytosol into the bilayer membrane, a mechanism that is well established for bacterial toxin channels (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Nature. 1989; 337: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), but so far unique for channel proteins in eukaryotic cells, was also proven by the very same approach. The reconstitution of ICln in bilayers furthermore allowed us to establish the binding site for the nucleotides on the ICln molecule and therefore to explain the nucleotide-induced block of the ICln current at a molecular level. The putative model of ICln is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets revealed a nucleotide-binding motif at the predicted extracellular vestibulum of the pore. Mutation of this motif was indeed followed by a block of the inhibitory effect of nucleotides on the induced current in oocytes (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickmann K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) as well as after reconstitution of the mutant ICln proteins in a lipid bilayer (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ion selectivity of reconstituted ICln channel proteins seemed to argue against our hypothesis that ICln is the molecular entity of RVDCs (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 623-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the reconstitution of ICln in a mixture of heart lipids (11Garavaglia L. Bazzini C. Bottà G. Fürst J. Gschwentner M. Jakab M. König M. Meyer G. Provenzano J. Ritter M. Rodighiero S. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indeed revealed the anionic selectivity of ICln, underscoring its prime role as the molecular RVDC candidate. Besides the channel nature of the ICln protein, other functions of ICln that are not directly related to ion permeation seem to be feasible (10Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 623-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Gschwentner M. Fürst J. Schmarda A. Bazzini C. Wöll E. Ritter M. Dienstl A. Scandella E. Oehl B. Hohlrieder M. Paulmichl M. Okada Y. Cell Volume Regulation: The Molecular Mechanism and Volume Sensing Machinery. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1998Google Scholar). Sm proteins able to bind the ICln protein were identified using the yeast two-hybrid system (13Pu W.T. Krapivinsky G.B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Schmarda A. Fresser M. Gschwentner M. Fürst J. Ritter M. Lang F. Baier G. Paulmichl M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because it is obvious that the ICln protein can bind to an array of different proteins (14Schmarda A. Fresser M. Gschwentner M. Fürst J. Ritter M. Lang F. Baier G. Paulmichl M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we were interested in the identification of proteins that are able to functionally interact with the specific channel function of ICln. For this reason, we hoped to utilized the particular genome organization in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In this organism, some genes are organized in operons. The genes in the same operon are transcribed together and controlled by a common promoter, and the assumption can be made that the products of these different genes are functionally linked. Therefore, we set out to clone the C. elegans homolog of ICln and to define whether or not the ICln gene is embedded in an operon. Our experiments revealed two splice variants of the ICln ion channel protein and the presence of an operon in which the ICln gene is embedded. Besides the ICln proteins termed IClnN1 and IClnN2, two additional proteins termed Nx and Ny were identified as part of the same operon. The functional reconstitution of the two splice variants of ICln in black lipid bilayers revealed (i) a current (IClnN1) similar to the current obtained after reconstitution of the MDCK homolog of ICln (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) a current (IClnN2) characterized by a marked voltage-dependent inactivation at positive potentials. The molecular entity responsible for the inactivation was identified as a positively charged cluster of amino acids encoded by exon 2a, which is missing in IClnN1. The mechanism for the channel inactivation seems to be similar to the “ball and chain: mechanism responsible for the voltage-dependent inactivation of theShaker potassium channels. The functional co-reconstitution of IClnN2 and Nx, one of the proteins encoded by the common operon, leads to a marked reduction of the voltage-dependent inactivation, thus demonstrating the functional interaction of the two proteins. This underscores the fact that the special genomic structure of the nematode genome allows the identification of functional partner proteins for ion channels. The nematode strain (N2) used in this work was provided by theCaenorhabditis Genetics Center. The nematodes were grown onEscherichia coli strain OP50, harvested, and homogenized, and mRNA and genomic DNA were isolated according to standard protocols (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Standard PCR protocols with Taq or Pfupolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Stratagene) were applied (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed according to standard protocols (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). To increase the specificity of the RT-PCR, we used a modified poly(T) primer with an additional GC-rich tail sequence and G, A, or C at the 3′-end (5′-GCA TCG ATC GCG CGA CTC TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TT(A/G/C)-3′, termed “poly(T) hook primer”). Using this primer, we performed reverse transcription of nematode mRNA, and this reaction was followed by two additional PCRs. In the first reaction, we used a primer starting at the predicted first ATG codon (5′-ATG ATT CTC ACT GAA GTC AGC C-3′) and a second primer complementary to the GC-rich hook sequence attached to the poly(T) sequence. In the second PCR step, the primer starting at the first ATG codon (see above) and a primer placed in the fourth exon of nematode ICln (5′-CCA TTT CCT CTT CTT CGT CGT CAT AC-3′) were used. The different PCR products were subcloned and sequenced thereafter. For this purpose, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using the poly(T) hook primer described above, followed by two PCRs specific for Nx orNy. For Nx, the two primers used for the second PCR were 5′-ATG GCT CGT GGT CAA CAA AAG ATC-3′ and 5′-TCA AAG CTT CAA CGA GTT CTG CTG-3′. For Ny, the respective primers were 5′-ATG GCA ATG AAA ACC TTT CAG CAA AAA AC-3′ and 5′-ACG ACG TGG AAT TGG AGC AG-3′. Both PCR products were subcloned and sequenced. The first strand cDNA was made using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction was heat-inactivated and subjected to RNase A treatment. Unincorporated nucleotides and enzymes were removed using a QIAquick PCR purification column (QIAGEN Inc.). Where indicated, polyadenosine tails were added to the 5′-end using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (MBI, Inc.). Second strand synthesis was carried out by PCR using Taq polymerase (MBI, Inc.) and the respective primers. To enhance the specificity of the PCR approach, the PCR products were usually subjected to a second ”nested“ PCR amplification. For Nx, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using a primer with the sequence 5′-TCA AAG CTT CAA CGA GTT CTG CTG-3′. After the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3′-end of the newly synthesized cDNA, a nested PCR was performed using the poly(T) hook primer in the forward direction and the 5′-TCA AAG CTT CAA CGA GTT CTG CTG-3′ primer in the reverse direction. For the second PCR (nested PCR), the GC-rich sequence of the forward primer was used together with a second reverse primer (5′-TGG GCT CTT TGG GTG CTT GTT C-3′). ForNy, the sequence-specific primer used for the first strand cDNA synthesis and for the first PCR was 5′-ACG ACG TGG AAT TGG AGC AG-3′, and that used for the second PCR was 5′-CAA TTG GTT TCG TAT GCT CGT ATG G-3′. The same primers for the Nx RACE were used as forward primers (see above). All PCR products were sequenced using an automatic sequencer (LiCor Gene ReadIR 4200) with the protocols suggested by the manufacturer. The bicistronic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH) was used for transient transfection. This vector contains an MCS site, the cytomegalovirus promoter, the IRES sequence, and EGFP for positive selection of transfected cells. The IClnN1 gene was cut out of the pET3-His vector (kindly provided by T. Hai, Ohio State University) (16Chen B.P.C. Hai T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with XhoI and BamHI, extracted from the gel, subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP, and sequenced. The IClnN1/IRES/EGFP vector construct was purified by conventional techniques and used for transient transfection. The IClnN1/IRES/EGFP expression vector was transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using a method described previously (5Gschwentner M. Nagl O.U. Wöll E. Schmarda A. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells (passages 40–100) were seeded the day before transfection (70,000 cells/3.5-cm Petri dish) and grown overnight. On the day of transfection, a mixture of 15 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was diluted in 300 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma); 4 μg of plasmid DNA was added, followed by careful mixing. After 10–15 min at room temperature (20–25 °C), this mixture was overlaid onto 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the Petri dish, and the cells were incubated for 6–10 h. Thereafter, cells were either detached and reseeded on glass coverslips for the experimental procedure on the next day (24 h) or fed 2 ml of 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, detached after 24 h, and reseeded for experiments on the second day (48 h). The transfection rate was usually 20–30%. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 44 mmNaHCO3, 280 μm penicillin, 114 μm streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (5Gschwentner M. Nagl O.U. Wöll E. Schmarda A. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). An Olympus OSP3-IMT2 microscope equipped with a xenon arc lamp was used to detect transfected cells expressing EGFP or cells loaded with dextran fluorescein. The dyes were excited at 488 nm, and emission was detected at 507 nm. The ORFs of IClnN1,IClnN2, and Nx were cloned in frame into the pET3-His vector, adding a histidine tag to the N terminus of the respective proteins. The His tag allows purification of the different proteins on an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc.). As shown in Fig. 1, overexpression of IClnN1, IClnN2, and Nx in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (and their subsequent purification) led to protein bands of the expected sizes. The purified proteins were stored at −74 °C in elution buffer (50 mm K2HPO4 and 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.4–8.0) at a concentration of ≈0.1 μg/μl. To express the Nx protein in bacteria, a codon optimization had to be performed. For this, the codon for R22 was changed from AGA to CGT, and that for G25 was changed from GGA to GGT. The experimental procedure used for the “black” lipid bilayer experiments is described in detail elsewhere (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The lipid bilayer was painted on an aperture of 1-mm diameter in a Teflon diaphragm separating the cis- andtrans-chambers, each holding 5 ml of aqueous solution (100 mm KCl and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For the lipid bilayer membrane, 1% (w/v) 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) in n-decane and butanol was employed. After the membrane had turned optically black in the reflected light, the protein was added to the cis- and trans-chambers. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The membrane current was measured by a pair of Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (Metrohm) connected in series with a voltage source (cis) and a “current to voltage converter” (trans), which was made using a Burr Brown operational amplifier (9407/0541F). The signal was recorded with a strip chart recorder (BBC, Inc.). To determine the ion selectivity of reconstituted ICln, a gradient for the ions was established (trans: 150 mm KCl and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; cis: 10 mm KCl and 5 mm HEPES pH 7.4). Because the establishment of the bilayer membrane requires time (during this period, the concentration gradient becomes reduced in both chambers, communicating through the circular hole (area of 0.8 mm2)), the chloride gradient (ΔPDCl) was measured after each experiment using chloride-selective electrodes before the membrane was disrupted (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔPDCl value of every single experiment was used to calculate the pK/pCl value according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (18Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The respective reversal potentials were determined graphically by interpolation. For the tip-dip experiments, the planar lipid bilayer was established on patch pipettes (7Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Bottà G. Benz R.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 1,2-Diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was dissolved inn-decane for membrane formation. All measurements were performed in symmetrical KCl solutions (pipette and bath: 300 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The protein was added only to the bath solution. Single channel and whole cell currents were measured using a patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA) and Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments, Inc.)), and the data were stored on tape or hard disc (20Meyer G. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1995; 36: 23-31Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For analysis, the data were filtered at 0.2 kHz. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The procedures for whole cell patch-clamp experiments with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and data analysis are described in detail by Gschwentner et al. (5Gschwentner M. Nagl O.U. Wöll E. Schmarda A. Ritter M. Paulmichl M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The control bath solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm mannitol, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH), pH 7.2. The hypotonic symmetrical solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted with NaOH), pH 7.2. The pipette solution contained 125 mmCsCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm raffinose, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 10 mmHEPES (adjusted with CsOH), pH 7.2. The different peptides were added to the pipette solution at a final concentration of 3.4 μm. The diffusion of the peptide was controlled in a separate set of experiments using dextran fluorescein (Mr 3000; Molecular Probes, Inc.) added to the pipette at a final concentration of 10 μm. Of 65 cells tested, 59 cells showed a bright and 6 cells showed a lower fluorescence when tested within the same time frame of 5 min, used to determine the effect of peptides 1, 2, and 4. The holding potential in the different experiments was −60 mV, and voltage steps from −120 to +100 mV were performed (increments of +20 mV for 500 ms) under control as well as hypotonic conditions. To test the effect of the peptides, repetitive voltage steps were performed from a holding potential of −60 mV to +40 mV every 20 s. All salts, chemicals, and drugs used were “pro-analysis” grade. All values are given as means ± S.E. Data were tested for differences in the means by Student's t test. A statistically significant difference was assumed at p≤ 0.05. The genome of C. elegans has been fully sequenced (21The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar) 2www.genome.wustl.edu/gsc/Projects/C.elegans/science98.php.; therefore, genes of interest can be identified by computer-aided sequence analysis. Using the N-terminal ICln amino acid sequence from zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) (22Schmarda A. Nagl O. Gschwentner M. Fürst J. Hofer S. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 7: 298-302Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a Blast search 3blastp, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. was performed, revealing similarity to a sequence from C. elegans that forms part of a cosmid clone (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number Z68213). This cosmid clone is termed C01F6 and bears the fem-3 locus of chromosome 4. Sequence analysis revealed that, in this cosmid clone, only part of the sequence coding for ICln is present. The remaining genomic sequence can be identified on the “downstream” cosmid clone of the same chromosome 4, i.e.ZC410 (accession number Z68270). The low homology among the C-terminal amino acid sequences of all ICln homologs cloned so far made it impossible to unambiguously define the exact ORF coding for nematode ICln by using simple sequence analysis. RT-PCR using C. elegans mRNA was performed to define the ORF coding for ICln. RT-PCR and nested PCR using the primer described under “Identification of the Nematode ICln ORF” should reveal a DNA fragment of 451 bp. However, we obtained two fragments of different sizes: one of 511 bp and a second, as expected, of 451 bp. This experiment unveiled the possibility that, in nematodes, two splice variants of ICln mRNA could be expressed, which was surprising because no other organism is known so far to exhibit splice variants of the ICln gene. After subcloning both fragments, the respective cDNAs were sequenced and indeed revealed the expected splice variants of the ICln mRNA. The entire ORFs of both splice variants were subsequently determined by additional PCR steps. The ORF of one splice variant is composed of 618 bp and codes for a protein of 205 amino acids (aa), termed IClnN1(GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberAF202931) (Fig. 2). The ORF of the second splice variant is composed of 678 bp and codes for a protein of 225 aa (accession number AF202932) (Fig. 2), termedIClnN2. The coding region of IClnN1 is composed of five exons (Fig. 3,Ex1–5). The second splice variant (IClnN2) is characterized by an additional exon (exon 2a) located between exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 3, Ex2a), which consists of 60 bp coding for a string of 20 aa with the sequence VRRRRRAPVLRTIQEDDEQR (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of IClnN1 is homologous to the ICln sequences identified in different species, e.g. human (accession number U17899; 54% similarity), dog (accession number X65450; 54% similarity), rabbit (accession number D26076; 54% similarity), rat (accession number D13985/L26450; 54% similarity), X. laevis(accession number L26449; 52% similarity), and zebrafish (accession number Y08484; 51% similarity). The additional amino acid string encoded by exon 2a is unique for the nematode IClnN2 sequence and cannot be found in the ICln homologs of all other organisms tested so far. It is notable, however, that the first 10 aa determined by exon 2a are 70% homologous to a sequence (ARRRRRGPVA) of the voltage-dependent calcium channel BI-2 (accession number X57477), a splice variant of the rabbit BI calcium channel (23Mori Y.

Accordingly, also in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, deglycosylated degradation intermediates are accumulated in the cytosol. For US2- and US11-dependent degradation of the MHC class I heavy chain, the cytoplasmic tail of MHC class I heavy chain is required, although the dislocation does not require the proteasome (22Story C.M.

A mutated 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor is degraded by the proteasome even after leaving the Golgi compartment (23Breuer P. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33254-33258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unassembled murine MHC class I molecules do not accumulate in the ER, but in vesicles assigned to the ER/cis Golgi (ERGIC) intermediate compartment and co-localize with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (24Raposo G. van S.H. Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator accumulates under these conditions near the centrosome in so called aggresomes (25Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) and co-localizes with components of the proteasome system (26Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar).This would predict that eucaryotic cells recognize proteins, which should not reach their final destination, in different compartments of the secretory pathway. Accordingly, multiple mechanisms may exist that ultimately lead to the breakdown of these proteins by the cytosolic proteasome.The type I transmembrane glycoprotein gp48 encoded by the murine cytomegalovirus gene m06, interferes with the MHC class I pathway of antigen presentation (27Reusch U. Muranyi W. Lucin P. Burgert H.G. Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It binds to properly folded β2-microglobulin (β2m)-associated MHC class I molecules in the ER and transports them through the Golgi compartment into the lysosomes, where the gp48-MHC class I complex is degraded. To our knowledge the m06/gp48 gene is the most effective MHC class I regulating principle of MCMV. To fulfil its function m06/gp48 has to be expressed in abundance to bind as many MHC class I molecules as possible. Consequently, situations should exist under which gp48 does not bind its physiological partner MHC class I. Here, we have studied the fate of such gp48 molecules. We demonstrate that gp48 molecules that fail to associate with MHC class I are degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. In vitro reconstitution experiments showed that the cytoplasmic tail of gp48 is not required for the export of the protein out of the microsomal membrane, a process that is nevertheless proteasome-dependent.DISCUSSIONIn pioneering studies on viral protein-induced MHC class I heavy chain degradation it was shown that US2 and US11, two glycoproteins encoded by HCMV, are responsible for the rapid degradation of MHC class I heavy chains by the proteasome (14Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 15Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Binding of the viral proteins to the MHC class I heavy chain leads to the transport of the substrate through the Sec61 translocon to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Further investigations clearly demonstrated that the proteasomal degradation pathway is a common part of the ER quality control machinery. Despite the evidence that ER membrane export was independent of a functional proteasome (14Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), other reports indicated a direct involvement of the proteasome in the retranslocation event (19Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 42Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp.

Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Here, we used the viral protein gp48 as a model system to get further insight into the mechanism of proteasome-dependent degradation of a glycoprotein, which is destined for degradation when it lacks its partner for assembly, the MHC class I molecule. The abundantly expressed glycoprotein gp48 of MCMV is a type I transmembrane protein, which binds to MHC class I molecules in the ER for transport through the Golgi and re-routing to lysosomal degradation (27Reusch U. Muranyi W. Lucin P. Burgert H.G. Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unassembled excess gp48, however, is degraded by a pathway, which depends on a functional proteasome as demonstrated by proteasomal inhibitors and by reconstitution of microsomal membranes with purified proteasome.Upon treatment of cells expressing gp48 with proteasomal inhibitors, the majority of the unassembled viral protein is neither rapidly transported into the cytosol nor accumulated in aggresome-like structures (25Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 26Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Instead this viral protein is sorted to the ER/ERGIC where the proteasomal degradation of the protein probably takes place. These findings are in accordance with earlier observations on other substrates, namely that unassembled MHC class I molecules destined for degradation accumulate in vesicles assigned to the ERGIC compartment rather than to the ER and co-localize with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (24Raposo G. van S.H. Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that also the ERGIC can represent a compartment from which glycoproteins can be extracted and degraded. Whereas US2 and US11 directed degradation of the MHC class I heavy chain is a matter of minutes, the degradation kinetics of gp48 is slow and comparable with the CD3-δ subunit of the T cell antigen receptor, which takes about 2–3 h (42Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Perhaps it is the dynamics of the process that defines the location at which a specific molecule is subjected to export and degradation.As revealed by proteinase K digestion, gp48 remains correctly inserted into microsomal membranes upon inhibition of the proteasome. This suggests that a functional proteasome is involved in the transport of gp48 out of the membrane. For the degradation of the CD3 δ−subunit of the T-cell receptor (42Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the unassembled immunoglobulin light chain (44Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and of Pdr*, a yeast protein (19Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), retranslocation is coupled to a functional proteasome. A short-lived synthetic model transmembrane protein required the protease activity of the proteasome already for the dislocation process itself (40Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This process was dependent upon the cytosolic tail of the target protein, which was marked for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination. In agreement with this observation, the degradation of gp48 is tightly coupled to a functional proteasome. Different is the lack of a cytosolic tail and its ubiquitination as a signal for direct proteasomal interaction. We also failed to detect any other ubiquitinated forms of gp48 during proteasomal inhibition (data not shown). Therefore the example of gp48 demonstrates that a link between the proteasome and a membrane-inserted substrate must exist, which does not require a cytosolic tail.In isolated microsomes containing gp48 the addition of ATP and proteasome reconstituted the degradation process. This confirmed the direct influence of the proteasome in the degradation of gp48 and there was no protein export from the microsomal membrane in the absence of a functional proteasome. Thus, both transport to the cytosol and degradation of the viral glycoprotein gp48 and gp48ΔCT is dependent on a functional proteasome.Our data suggest that different cellular mechanisms for substrate delivery to subsequent proteasomal degradation must exist. First, from different cellular compartments the degradation process can be initiated. Furthermore, there are different extraction mechanisms for the proteins out of the membrane. For some viral glycoproteins the transport process is proteasome-independent (14Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 15Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L.

A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This could be due to the intrinsic properties of the viral proteins US2 and US11 to initiate substrate export. For other substrates the export can be proteasome dependent and mediated through the cytosolic tail of the protein (40Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since for gp48 the cytosolic tail of the substrate is not required, we propose that translocon-associated polypeptides connect intrans the substrate with the cytosolic proteasome. Along this line, Yu and Kopito (43Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 45Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that the proteasomal degradation of T cell antigen receptor α is dependent on a functional ubiquitination system, although there was no evidence of ubiquitination of the substrate itself. They proposed that ubiquitin might have an indirect effect on one or more translocon-associated proteins, perhaps by recruiting proteasomes to the dislocation site. Interestingly, during degradation of the misfolded lumen protein α1−antitrypsin, the ubiquitination of the chaperone calnexin was induced during interaction with the lumen substrate (46Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). gp48 is also associated with calnexin (data not shown) but it remains open whether this chaperone connects between proteasomal activity and dislocation of gp48. Recent data of Bordallo and co-workers (47Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 48Bordallo J. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the ER resident protein Hrd 1p/Der3p serves as a component programming the translocon for retrograde transport of ER proteins. Depending on the individual substrate tested, the ER-associated degradation was either dependent or independent of HRD genes (49Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus examples for yeast and individual substrates in mammalian cells suggest collectively that also in higher eukaryotes an indirect connection between the proteasome and its substrate must exist. Secretory and membrane proteins are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1(1Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), where they are covalently modified, folded into their three-dimensional conformation (2Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator accumulates under these conditions near the centrosome in so called aggresomes (25Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) and co-localizes with components of the proteasome system (26Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This would predict that eucaryotic cells recognize proteins, which should not reach their final destination, in different compartments of the secretory pathway. Accordingly, multiple mechanisms may exist that ultimately lead to the breakdown of these proteins by the cytosolic proteasome. The type I transmembrane glycoprotein gp48 encoded by the murine cytomegalovirus gene m06, interferes with the MHC class I pathway of antigen presentation (27Reusch U. Muranyi W. Lucin P. Burgert H.G. Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It binds to properly folded β2-microglobulin (β2m)-associated MHC class I molecules in the ER and transports them through the Golgi compartment into the lysosomes, where the gp48-MHC class I complex is degraded. To our knowledge the m06/gp48 gene is the most effective MHC class I regulating principle of MCMV. To fulfil its function m06/gp48 has to be expressed in abundance to bind as many MHC class I molecules as possible. Consequently, situations should exist under which gp48 does not bind its physiological partner MHC class I. Here, we have studied the fate of such gp48 molecules. We demonstrate that gp48 molecules that fail to associate with MHC class I are degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. In vitro reconstitution experiments showed that the cytoplasmic tail of gp48 is not required for the export of the protein out of the microsomal membrane, a process that is nevertheless proteasome-dependent. DISCUSSIONIn pioneering studies on viral protein-induced MHC class I heavy chain degradation it was shown that US2 and US11, two glycoproteins encoded by HCMV, are responsible for the rapid degradation of MHC class I heavy chains by the proteasome (14Wiertz E.J.

Binding of the viral proteins to the MHC class I heavy chain leads to the transport of the substrate through the Sec61 translocon to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Further investigations clearly demonstrated that the proteasomal degradation pathway is a common part of the ER quality control machinery. Despite the evidence that ER membrane export was independent of a functional proteasome (14Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Here, we used the viral protein gp48 as a model system to get further insight into the mechanism of proteasome-dependent degradation of a glycoprotein, which is destined for degradation when it lacks its partner for assembly, the MHC class I molecule. The abundantly expressed glycoprotein gp48 of MCMV is a type I transmembrane protein, which binds to MHC class I molecules in the ER for transport through the Golgi and re-routing to lysosomal degradation (27Reusch U. Muranyi W. Lucin P. Burgert H.G. Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unassembled excess gp48, however, is degraded by a pathway, which depends on a functional proteasome as demonstrated by proteasomal inhibitors and by reconstitution of microsomal membranes with purified proteasome.Upon treatment of cells expressing gp48 with proteasomal inhibitors, the majority of the unassembled viral protein is neither rapidly transported into the cytosol nor accumulated in aggresome-like structures (25Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 26Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Instead this viral protein is sorted to the ER/ERGIC where the proteasomal degradation of the protein probably takes place. These findings are in accordance with earlier observations on other substrates, namely that unassembled MHC class I molecules destined for degradation accumulate in vesicles assigned to the ERGIC compartment rather than to the ER and co-localize with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (24Raposo G. van S.H. Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that also the ERGIC can represent a compartment from which glycoproteins can be extracted and degraded. Whereas US2 and US11 directed degradation of the MHC class I heavy chain is a matter of minutes, the degradation kinetics of gp48 is slow and comparable with the CD3-δ subunit of the T cell antigen receptor, which takes about 2–3 h (42Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Perhaps it is the dynamics of the process that defines the location at which a specific molecule is subjected to export and degradation.As revealed by proteinase K digestion, gp48 remains correctly inserted into microsomal membranes upon inhibition of the proteasome. This suggests that a functional proteasome is involved in the transport of gp48 out of the membrane. For the degradation of the CD3 δ−subunit of the T-cell receptor (42Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the unassembled immunoglobulin light chain (44Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and of Pdr*, a yeast protein (19Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), retranslocation is coupled to a functional proteasome. A short-lived synthetic model transmembrane protein required the protease activity of the proteasome already for the dislocation process itself (40Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This process was dependent upon the cytosolic tail of the target protein, which was marked for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination. In agreement with this observation, the degradation of gp48 is tightly coupled to a functional proteasome. Different is the lack of a cytosolic tail and its ubiquitination as a signal for direct proteasomal interaction. We also failed to detect any other ubiquitinated forms of gp48 during proteasomal inhibition (data not shown). Therefore the example of gp48 demonstrates that a link between the proteasome and a membrane-inserted substrate must exist, which does not require a cytosolic tail.In isolated microsomes containing gp48 the addition of ATP and proteasome reconstituted the degradation process. This confirmed the direct influence of the proteasome in the degradation of gp48 and there was no protein export from the microsomal membrane in the absence of a functional proteasome. Thus, both transport to the cytosol and degradation of the viral glycoprotein gp48 and gp48ΔCT is dependent on a functional proteasome.Our data suggest that different cellular mechanisms for substrate delivery to subsequent proteasomal degradation must exist. First, from different cellular compartments the degradation process can be initiated. Furthermore, there are different extraction mechanisms for the proteins out of the membrane. For some viral glycoproteins the transport process is proteasome-independent (14Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This could be due to the intrinsic properties of the viral proteins US2 and US11 to initiate substrate export. For other substrates the export can be proteasome dependent and mediated through the cytosolic tail of the protein (40Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since for gp48 the cytosolic tail of the substrate is not required, we propose that translocon-associated polypeptides connect intrans the substrate with the cytosolic proteasome. Along this line, Yu and Kopito (43Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 45Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that the proteasomal degradation of T cell antigen receptor α is dependent on a functional ubiquitination system, although there was no evidence of ubiquitination of the substrate itself. They proposed that ubiquitin might have an indirect effect on one or more translocon-associated proteins, perhaps by recruiting proteasomes to the dislocation site. Interestingly, during degradation of the misfolded lumen protein α1−antitrypsin, the ubiquitination of the chaperone calnexin was induced during interaction with the lumen substrate (46Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). gp48 is also associated with calnexin (data not shown) but it remains open whether this chaperone connects between proteasomal activity and dislocation of gp48.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the ER resident protein Hrd 1p/Der3p serves as a component programming the translocon for retrograde transport of ER proteins. Depending on the individual substrate tested, the ER-associated degradation was either dependent or independent of HRD genes (49Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol.

Testosterone, the main male sex hormone, is one of the structurally similar steroid hormones. Measurement of serum testosterone levels is important in the evaluation of conditions associated with hyperandrogenism in women (1Wheeler M.J. The Immunoassay Handbook.

Development of monoclonal antibodies that would fulfill the high affinity and selectivity requirements needed for the accurate measurement of testosterone levels in serum samples has not been successful with the use of hybridoma technology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies are used in most current immunoassays of steroid hormones. However, the supply of polyclonal reagents with consistent quality is a severe problem for the immunodiagnostic industry and requires continuous immunization of many animals. The inherent batch-to-batch variation of the polyclonal sera makes it necessary to optimize the assay parameters for each new serum batch. The three-dimensional structures of steroid binding Fab fragments are important for a general understanding of the molecular basis of specific interactions between antibodies and hydrophobic molecules such as steroids. The molecular basis of steroid antibody interactions has been studied in detail by determining the structures of a progesterone-binding antibody (DB3) in its free and bound form and with different high affinity cross-reactive progesterone derivatives (5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Arevalo J.H. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Arevalo J.H. Hassing C.A. Stura E.A. Sims M.J. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 663-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The binding site of the DB3 antibody is a hydrophobic pocket, and the binding affinity and specificity are determined by van der Waals interactions and a few hydrogen bonds formed with the progesterone hapten (5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding mode of a number of progesterone derivatives is due to two alternate docking orientations for the steroid skeleton (6Arevalo J.H. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the cases of the anti-digoxin 26-10 and 40-50 antibodies, the high affinity binding mode is mainly determined by hydrophobic shape complementarity (8Jeffrey P.D. Sheriff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10310-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Jeffrey P.D. Schildbach J.F. Chang C.Y. Kussie P.H. Margolies M.N. Sheriff S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; (28360): 248344Google Scholar, 10Walliman P. Marti T. Fürer A. Diederich F. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1567-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The most striking differences in these two anti-digoxin Fab structures is the presence of hydrogen bonds between the Fab 40-50 and ouabain hapten and their absence in the Fab 26-10 complex structure with digoxin. The binding site of the 40-50 antibody is a groove on the protein surface, whereas in the 26–10 antibody the binding site is a deep cleft (8Jeffrey P.D. Sheriff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10310-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Jeffrey P.D. Schildbach J.F. Chang C.Y. Kussie P.H. Margolies M.N. Sheriff S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; (28360): 248344Google Scholar, 10Walliman P. Marti T. Fürer A. Diederich F. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1567-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The basis of the binding specificity of steroid hormone binding antibodies has also been elucidated by determining the crystal structures of the Fv4155 fragment in complex with two closely related steroid hormone glucoronides (11Trinh C.H. Hemmigton S.D. Verhoeyen M.E. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Fv4155 binds principal urinary metabolites of estradiol, estrone β-d-glucuronide (E3G)1 and estriol 3-β-d-glucuronide (EI3G) with different affinities. The binding affinity of E3G is about ten times higher than that of EI3G, although EI3G differs from E3G only in the addition of a hydroxyl group and the reduction of an adjacent carbonyl at positions 16 and 17 of the steroid d-ring, respectively (11Trinh C.H. Hemmigton S.D. Verhoeyen M.E. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both haptens bind in similar orientations into the long, deep hydrophobic cleft. The monoclonal antibody (3-C4F5) has been produced by hyperimmunizing mice with a testosterone-3-carboxymethyloxime-thyroglobulin conjugate, and genes encoding its Fab fragment have been previously cloned. The (3-C4F5) antibody has a reasonably high affinity for testosterone (Ka ∼ 3 × 108m−1) with an overall good specificity profile, e.g. its cross-reactivity with 5αa-dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione is low (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The main problem with the 3-C4F5 antibody is its 1% cross-reaction with dehydroepiandrosteronesulphate (DHEAS), due to the high DHEAS concentration in sera, this cross-reaction prevents the diagnostic use of the 3-C4F5 antibody. The binding site of the recombinant (3-C4F5) Fab fragment has recently been targeted to random mutagenesis, and mutants with significantly improved affinity and specificity have been isolated by phage display selections (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hautoniemi L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Immunotechnology. 1998; 4: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the structures of the free and testosterone-bound form of the recombinant (3-C4F5) Fab at 2.72 and 2.60 Å, respectively. On the basis of the structures, we are able to describe the details of the testosterone binding and also interpret previous results obtained in the fine-tuning of the anti-testosterone binding site (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hautoniemi L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Immunotechnology. 1998; 4: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When the results were compared with other available structures of anti-steroid antibodies, interesting, similar features in the binding mechanism among these antibodies were observed. For the large scale production of the (3-C4F5) Fab fragment, the pKKtac expression vector (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain RV308 (su−, ΔDlacX74, galISII::OP308, strA). Cells were grown in a bioreactor in a defined medium using the fed-batch technique (14Pack P. Kujau M. Schroeckh V. Knupfer U. Wenderoth R Riesenberg D. Plückthun A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1271-1277PubMed Google Scholar, 15Plückthun A. Krebber A. Krebber C. Horn U. Knüpfer U. Wenderoth R. Nieba L. Proba K. Riesenberg D. Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach. IRL, Oxford1996: 203-252Google Scholar). The production level of the anti-testosterone Fab fragment was about 50 mg/liter. The Fab fragment was purified from the culture supernatant first by a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) followed by a protein G column (Hi Trap, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Coomassie Blue-stained protein gels showed that the purified Fab fragments were essentially homogeneous and correctly assembled. Amino acid sequences of the heavy and the light chain variable regions are presented below in Fig.1. Crystals of the free and testosterone-complexed 3-C4F5 Fab fragment were grown as described previously (16Valjakka J. Hemminki A. Teerinen T. Takkinen K Rouvinen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Crystals without testosterone were grown by the hanging-drop method, from 9 mg/ml protein solutions buffered with 0.1 m BTP (Bis-Tris propane) (pH 5.6) and using 15% PEG3350 as the precipitant. Crystals with testosterone were grown by the same method, but the crystallization solution contained 0.1 m MgCl2 as its additive and 20% PEG3350 as its precipitant. In the case of the testosterone complex, the 0.1m BTP (pH 5.6) buffer was added into the well and not to the drops. For diffraction data collection, all crystals were harvested into a cryoprotectant solution, and flash-frozen in a cold stream at 120 K (using an Oxford Cryosystem cryostream cooler). The PEG3350 as a 35% solution worked as the cryoprotectant for the free crystals. In the case of testosterone complex crystals, the cryoprotectant solution was 20% PEG3350 with 20% ethanol. All diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku RU-200HB rotating-anode generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA, equipped with a new MSC Confocal Blue Optics (17Yang C. Courville A. Ferrara J.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and an RAXIS-II imaging plate system. In all cases, the crystal to image plate distance was 120 mm and the oscillation range was 1°. All data were indexed and processed with the DENZO program (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar), and space groups were defined by the XPREP program (SHELXTL software package). Table I (see below) summarizes the data collection statistics for both the free and testosterone-bound data sets. The crystals were not resistant in the x-ray beam at room temperature, and the crystal decay was significant after a few hours' exposure. However, it was possible to collect data from single crystals by using cryotechniques. After soaking, crystals were rapidly placed in a nitrogen gas coldstream maintained at 120 K. Data from individual image plates were scaled, and reflection intensities were merged using the SCALEPACK program (Yale University).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsAnti-testosterone Fab fragmentHapten-TestosteroneSpace groupI222P21212Cell dimensions (Å)a = 90.46a = 89.87b = 90.85b = 95.56c = 137.10c = 67.22Mosaicity (°)0.9540.879Resolution limit (Å)2.722.60Measured reflections10373952788Unique reflections1555716913Rmerge(%)6.98.530.4 shell 2.72–2.82 Å29.9 shell 2.60–2.69 ÅCompleteness (%)99.991.799.9 shell 2.72–2.82 Å95.7 shell 2.60–2.69 ÅOverallI/ς(I)11.712.34.4 shell 2.72–2.82 Å4.2 shell 2.60–2.69 ÅRefinement Resolution range (Å)2.72–5002.60–500 Protein atoms33453345 Hapten atoms-21 Water molecules88337 Average B-factor (Å2)49.725.8 Protein50.025.2 Solvent36.631.7 Hapten-21.0 Rfactor/Rfree(‖F‖ > 1ς) (%)19.5/25.218.8/25.5 r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)1-ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.0.00660.0062 r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.401.341-a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab The molecular replacement was performed with the AmoRe program (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin 4-4-20 Fab (20Herron J.N. He X.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Edmundson A.P. Proteins. 1989; 5: 271Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), having high sequence homology with the anti-testosterone Fab, was used as the search model for rotation and translation calculations. The homologies of the light chain and the heavy chain were 72 and 90%, respectively. Initial searching for rotation solution with the entire model was successful, but it failed with the translation solution. For this reason, it was necessary to perform a search for the constant and variable domains separately. Each model was used in separate rotation searches using data in the range 8- to 4-Å resolution and a sphere radius of 18 Å. The correlation coefficient for the variable domain rotation was 21.0 (next peak 19.5); for the constant domain the rotation correlation coefficient was 17.3 (next peak 16.7). Once the rotation orientation was determined, the AmoRe program was used to search for a translation solution. The first 20 peaks from the rotation function were used in the translation search at 8- to 4-Å resolution. Initially, each model was used separately in the translation searches. Numbers 10 and 11 solutions from the rotation function of the constant domain produced peaks 20.9 and 21.1 ς above the mean, respectively. Fixing solution number 11 of the constant model with a subsequent search for a variable model provided the best solution, as judged by the highest correlation coefficient 33.0. Rigid body refinement was carried out using data from 8 to 4 Å, and rigid body refinement gave an R factor of 44.3%. Data refinement, including individual temperature factor refinement, was done by the CNS program (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar), and after that an electron density map was calculated. Manual rebuilding of the anti-testosterone Fab structure was performed with the O program (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) by mutating the 4-4-20 Fab sequence in those positions where it differed from the anti-testosterone Fab fragment. Water molecules were added manually, as they became apparent in the map. Water molecules, which had lower temperature factor than 60 Å2, were kept in the model. Testosterone atoms in the bound structure were not included in the refinement until refinement of the protein had reached convergence and the electron density was clear enough. Omit maps were calculated by eliminating atoms of interest from the model followed by a round of simulated annealing refinement. The refined structure of the testosterone-bound structure was used as the search model for the molecular replacement into the free data. A summary of both refinement results is given in TableI. The final free structure has a conventional crystallographic R factor of 19.5% with anRfree of 25.2% (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) for all data between 8- and 2.72-Å resolution. In comparison, the testosterone-bound structure has a crystallographic R factor of 18.8% with anRfree of 25.5% for all data between 8- and 2.6-Å resolution. As reported by the PROCHECK program (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), all residues of the protein lie in or close to allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. According to this analysis, 79.5% of the residues in the free structure and 87.2% of the residues in the testosterone-bound structure lie in the most favored areas with further residues of 18.4 and 12.2%, respectively, occurring in additional allowed areas. Co-ordinates for the structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (24Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27319) Google Scholar) (codes 1I9I and 1I9J). The determined structures show the typical Fab immunoglobulin fold, and the backbone atoms of the protein frameworks can be superimposed with other general Fab structures. The free and testosterone-bound structures display different elbow angles making the overall superposition difficult. The superposition of the Cα atoms of the testosterone-bound and free structures of the variable domains is shown in Fig.2. The variable domains show an overall root mean square deviation for all atoms and for Cα atoms of 0.99 and 0.55 Å, respectively. When the variable domains of the heavy and light chain were superimposed individually, the deviation of Cα atoms was 0.31 and 0.62 Å, respectively. We have also compared the previously build molecular model of the testosterone-3-C4F5 antibody complex (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the testosterone-bound structure. The root mean square values of Cα atoms and all atoms in variable domains were 1.17 and 1.73 Å, respectively. The electron density map allowed to trace all six CDR loops of the Fab-testosterone structure. Weak electron density was observed for the side chains of Gln27L to Val27cL and Asn30L residues in the CDR-L1 of the free structure. The electron density of the residues His27dL to Gly29L in the CDR-L1 of the free structure was also unclear. Residues (129H-133H) in the constant domains were not visible, and they were, therefore, presumed to be disordered in both structures. These residues have generally been observed to be disordered in other Fab structures (5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Jeffrey P.D. Sheriff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1992; 227: 122-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To do pairwise comparisons, the CDR regions (according to the Kabat definition (29Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Protein of Immunological Interest.5th Ed. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar)) of the free and testosterone-bound structures were superimposed (TableII)I. O. The root mean square deviations of all atoms show that the free and testosterone-bound Fabs differ significantly (>1.0 Å) in the CDR-L1 and CDR-H3. The electron density for the CDR-L1 is weak, and, therefore, the real structure rearrangement caused by testosterone binding or normal thermal motion is uncertain. Differences between all atoms in residues of the CDR-H3 have also been observed to be large in previous studies (30Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 31Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Lewitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M.

The CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and the CDR-L2 loops do not undergo a large change upon testosterone binding even though some residues form close contacts with testosterone.Table IICDRs of the anti-testosterone Fab fragmentRegionr.m.s.d.2-ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.ResidueDistanceTestosteroneCDR-loopCanonical structureCα atomsAll atomsÅL1: Arg24–Glu3440.771.58Y32CG6.3B-ring, C7Q34OE14.5D-ring, C16L2: Lys50–Ser5610.180.52K50N9.5D-ring, C16L3: Phe89–Thr9710.410.97F89CE23.6D-ring, C15V94CG23.7A-ring, C4V94CG24.6A-ring, O3P96CG3.8B-ring, C6H1: Thr31–Ser3510.180.30A33CB4.0C-ring, C12S35OG3.4C18H2: Ser50–Gly6510.220.76S50OG3.7C-ring, C11V52CG13.7A-ring, C1Y58ring4.1A-ring, C2H3: Glu95–Tyr102-0.451.73Y99ring3.8A-ring, C1Y99O3.8D-ring, C15G100′N3.6D-ring, C16G100′O2.7D-ring, OH20Comparison of the root mean square deviations (Å) between the free and testosterone-bound CDR regions and analysis of the shortest distances between CDR residues and testosterone.

Five of the CDR-loops, L1, L2, L3, H1, and H2, of the anti-testosterone Fab, have their size and residues at specific sites that indicate previously reported canonical structures (32Chothia C.

Currently, there is no available specific classification for the CDR-H3 loop, but many authors have analyzed and classified CDR-H3 loops in several forms. In the case of the anti-testosterone Fab, which contains Arg94H but lacks Asp101H, the so-called torso region is not related to either the bulged conformation or the non-bulged one (35Shirai H. Kidera A. Nakamura H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol.

The testosterone molecule is deeply bound between the light and heavy variable domains in the binding pocket, which is mainly formed by the CDR-H3 and -L3 loops. The molecular surface complementarity between the Fab fragment and hapten is evident (Fig. 3). The cyclohexened-ring with the 20-hydroxyl group is buried deepest in the pocket. The cyclopentane A-ring with the 3-keto group, which has been used for the conjugation of testosterone to thyroglobulin in the original immunogen, is directed toward the solvent (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The testosterone-Fab complex shows that the highly selective binding mode is mainly determined by shape complementarity between the protein and testosterone. Testosterone is placed in a sandwich between the ring structures of the framework residue Trp47H and Tyr99H of the CDR-H3. The two methyl groups of the testosterone molecule are directed toward the Trp47H. Tyr58H of the CDR-H2 is also in a close vicinity to the A-ring of the testosterone molecule. Using a maximum distance criterion of 4.1 Å, a total of 15 residues make van der Waals contacts with the testosterone. Residues Glu95H and Tyr99H-Leu100KH of the CDR-H3 largely form the binding pocket with the co-operation of the residues Phe89L, Gly91L, Val94L, and Pro96L of the CDR-L3 loop. Residues Ala33H and Ser35H from the CDR-H1 loop; Ser50H, Val52H, and Tyr58H of the CDR-H2 loop; and Glu34L of the CDR-L1 loop also take part in the binding site formation. The CDR-L2 is not directly involved in the binding of the testosterone. The two negatively charged residues, Glu95H and Glu34L, at the bottom of the binding site make it less hydrophobic. The only direct hydrogen bond is between the d-ring hydroxyl group at position 17 and the main chain oxygen in Gly100JH. Two indirect hydrogen bonds are formed between the d-ring oxygen of testosterone and the main-chain oxygen of Ala33H and the side chain of Ser35H through a water molecule. Upon testosterone binding, the largest spatial movements occur in the side chains of residues Glu95H and Tyr99H (Fig. 4). In the free conformation, these residues sterically block testosterone access, so rearrangements appear to be necessary for the binding of testosterone. The residues Glu95H and Tyr99H are packed against each other in the free structure. These conformational changes from free form to testosterone-bound form are related by two rotations in Glu95H (Cδd-Cγ-Cβ-Cα) from −70° to 173° and (Cγ-Cβ-Cα-N) from −65° to 70° and one in Tyr99H (Cγ-Cβ-Cα-C) from 87° to 177°. At medium resolution it is not possible to firmly determine main-chain conformation. However, by inspecting omit electron density maps in the region Gly98H to Val100H in the CDR-H3 loop, we found evidence for conformational flexibility in the main chain (Fig.5). The conformational change in the Glu95H side-chain results in the “pep-flip” in the position of Gly98H (the carbonyl oxygen has been moved to point in the opposite direction). This allows the formation of a new hydrogen bond between the side chain of Glu95H and the main-chain N atom of Tyr99H.Figure 5The OMIT maps showing the positions of carbonyl oxygens in the (A) free and (B) testosterone-bound Fab fragments. The Omit electron-density maps were calculated without sigma cut-off from Gly98H to Val100H after residues had been removed. Map calculations of Gly98H and Val100H were separated from each other. The simultaneous “pep-flip” of Gly98H is a requirement for testosterone binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have compared the structure of the anti-testosterone Fab with those of anti-progesterone (5Arevalo J.H.

The structure of the immunogen originally used in the production of different anti-steroid monoclonal antibodies as well the affinity and specificity thresholds of the screening methods used in the isolation of the hybridoma clones have influence in the anatomy of the binding site. In the case of the anti-testosterone (3-C4F5) and anti-progesterone (DB3) antibodies, the aim has been to develop high binding selectivity toward the free steroid (12Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Gani M. Coley J. Piron J. Humphreys A.S. Arevalo J. Wilson I.A. Taussig M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the surface representations of the binding sites of these antibodies show that the binding sites are narrow, deep pockets (Fig.7). The structures of the free and steroid-bound structures show the conformational changes of Tyr99H in the anti-testosterone Fab (Fig. 7, a and b) and Trp100H in the anti-progesterone Fab (Fig. 7, c andd) upon binding. The binding site of the anti-testosterone Fab is partly negative (Fig. 7b), this is due to the residue Glu34L being located at the bottom of the binding site. The other binding sites studied here do not have a similar negatively charged region. The molecular surface of the anti-digoxin Fab fragment (Fig.7e) shows that the digoxin binding site is also a pocket, whereas the biding site of the Fv4155 fragment (Fig. 7f) is a groove. In the Fv4155 structure the carbohydrate group of the hapten makes three hydrogen bonds to the protein (11Trinh C.H. Hemmigton S.D. Verhoeyen M.E. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate moiety is oriented to the solvent also in the digoxin-Fab complex, but no hydrogen bonds or salt-bridge interactions are formed between the digoxin and the antibody. Molecular surfaces of the anti-digoxin Fab fragment (Fig. 7e) and the Fv4155 fragment (Fig.7f) show that larger steroids are binding in the deep pocket or in the groove on the surface of the antibody. The molecular interactions that affect antibody specificity for steroid molecules have been previously discussed in a few articles (5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Arevalo J.H. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Arevalo J.H.

Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in the anti-progesterone complex structures, whereas a single hydrogen bond exists between the steroid and the protein in the Fv4155 structures (11Trinh C.H. Hemmigton S.D. Verhoeyen M.E. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in the anti-testosterone Fab structure. Thus, high affinity and specificity displayed by steroid binding antibodies primarily arises from shape complementarity (5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Arevalo J.H. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Arevalo J.H.

Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The binding mode is very similar in the steroid-related Fab structures. The binding sites of steroid-specific Fab structures are mainly hydrophobic. There are only two charged residues in the binding site of the anti-testosterone Fab fragment. One of them, Glu95H, rotates away and leaves space for testosterone. Another residue, Glu34L, makes charged surroundings in the location of testosterone on the bottom of the binding site. A comparison between the anti-testosterone Fab and the anti-progesterone Fab structures showed clear structural and functional similarities. The sandwich structure made by Trp47H and Tyr99H in the anti-testosterone Fab, and Trp50H and Trp100H in the anti-progesterone Fab structure (5Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Taussig M.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) will have an important role in the steroid binding (Fig. 8). The anti-testosterone Fab shows similarly “open” and “closed” conformation as the anti-progesterone Fab. In both cases, the free binding site is occupied by an aromatic residue. In the presence of the steroid hapten, this aromatic residue will be reconstituted as a part of a “sandwich structure.” The digoxin molecule is also sandwiched between the aromatic residues Tyr50H and Trp100H, but no similar open and closed conformational changes between complexed and free structures were observed. In the absence of free structure of the Fv4155, it can only be speculated whether Tyr100H of the Fv4155 will have a similar role in the closed conformation (11Trinh C.H. Hemmigton S.D. Verhoeyen M.E. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Fv4155 structures tightly bind with metabolites of estradiol by making a sandwich between Leu95H and Tyr100H residues, and there are no aromatic residues available in the favorable surround. Three residues, which are located in a similar position in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 9) and in the three-dimensional structure, presumably affect steroid hormone binding mode (Fig. 10). At the bottom of the binding pocket there is a bulky hydrophobic residue, 100KH on the CDR-H3. This residue is leucine, phenylalanine, or methionine. The residues 96L (from the CDR-L3 loop) and 95H (from the CDR-H3 loop) allow steroids to enter or restrict steroids from entering into the interior of the Fab variable domain. 96L positions are occupied by the side chains of proline or leucine. In the position 95H, the side chain of Glu95H is oriented away from the binding pocket in the anti-testosterone Fab complex structure. In the anti-progesterone Fab, there is a small glycine residue in this position. In the cases of the anti-digoxin Fab 26-10 and the Fv4155 fragments, the binding pocket is not so large; there is leucine or serine in position 95H. The shortest distance between 96L and 95H in the side of the binding site can range from a narrow 4 Å in the Fv4155 to a larger 11 Å in the anti-testosterone Fab.Figure 10Schematic diagrams of the steroid binding sites.

Niemi S. Hoffren A.-M. Hakalahti L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hautoniemi L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Immunotechnology. 1998; 4: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only one of the important binding site residues has been changed in the isolated mutants, namely the CDR-H3 residue Glu95H, located at the side of the binding site. Based on the structure, the mutation Glu95HAla, which was selected from the mutant library based on improved specificity, will provide more free space for the testosteroned-ring. In the affinity maturation selection, two different clones having extensive mutations within the CDR-L1 loop were isolated (13Hemminki A. Niemi S. Hautoniemi L. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Immunotechnology. 1998; 4: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One clone of the mutant CDR-L1 loop, designated A60, contained the sequence RSSEVIVTRNGYTPIE, and the other, designated A58, contained the sequence RSSQRMVQRNGHTPLE. When compared with the wild-type CDR-L1 loop sequence, RSSQSIVHSNGNSYLE, the A60 clone contains eight and the A58 clone seven mutations, respectively. Surprisingly, these mutated CDR-L1 loops, which improve the affinity about 10-fold, are not in direct contact with the testosterone. The mutated residues primarily locate on the surface of the protein. Therefore, it is difficult to explain their impact on affinity improvement. Probably, the main influence is on the mobility of the loop. The increased flexibility in the CDR-L1 loop may allow more compact binding of testosterone to the Fab fragment. The determined free and testosterone-bound structures now allow more rational planning of mutations. However, improvements of the binding properties in the anti-testosterone antibody (3-C4F5) can also be achieved by mutating CDR residues, which are not in direct contact with the hapten.

https://openalex.org/W2062240349,"Native antithrombin (AT) has an inactive reactive site loop conformation unless it is activated by a unique pentasaccharide fragment of heparin (H5). Structural data suggests that this may be due to preinsertion of two N-terminal residues of the reactive site loop of the serpin into the A-β-sheet of the molecule. Relative to α1-antitrypsin, the reactive site loop of AT has three additional residues, Arg399, Val400, and Thr401, at the C-terminal P′ end of the loop. To determine whether a longer reactive site loop of AT is responsible for loop preinsertion in the native conformation, mutants of the serpin were expressed in which these residues were individually or in combination deleted. Kinetic analysis suggested that deletion of two residues, Val400 and Thr401, changed the solution equilibrium of the serpin in favor of the active conformation, thereby enhancing the inhibition of factor Xa by an order of magnitude independent of H5. Interestingly, the reactivity of this mutant with thrombin was impaired by the same order of magnitude in the absence, but not in the presence of H5. These results suggest that a longer reactive site loop in AT is responsible for its inactive native conformation toward factor Xa, while at same time AT requires this feature to regulate the activity of thrombin.

Similar to other inhibitory serpins, AT inhibits its target proteinases by binding to their active sites through an exposed reactive center loop and undergoing a conformational change which traps the enzymes in inactive, stable complexes (4Gettins P.G.W.

Unlike most other inhibitory serpins, however, AT has a reactive site loop that has an inactive conformation (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A unique high affinity pentasaccharide (H5) fragment of heparin can bind and allosterically activate AT to promote its reactivity with factor Xa (fXa) by several hundred-fold (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Google Scholar, 10Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the allosteric activation of AT by H5 has no effect on the reactivity of the serpin with thrombin. In this case, longer chain heparins containing H5 plus at least 13 additional saccharides are required to efficiently accelerate the inhibition reaction by an alternative ternary complex bridging or template mechanism (11Lane D.A. Denton J. Flynn A.M. Thompson E.A. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 725-732Google Scholar, 12Danielsson A. Raub E. Lindahl U. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15467-15473Google Scholar). The molecular basis for differential reactivity of fXa and thrombin with the activated conformation of AT is not known. Structural data suggest that the inactive native conformation of the reactive site loop of AT is caused by preinsertion of two N-terminal P14 and P15 (nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (13Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar)) residues of the loop into the A-β-sheet of the serpin and that the binding of the cofactor to AT causes the expulsion of this inserted region and, thereby, activation of the serpin (6Jin L.

The structural feature(s) in the reactive site loop of the serpin that may be responsible for preinsertion of the two N-terminal residues into the A-β-sheet of the molecule has not been identified. Moreover, it is not known why activation of AT by H5 specifically promotes AT inhibition of fXa, but not that of thrombin. To address these questions, the amino acid sequence of the reactive site loop of AT was compared with those of other inhibitory serpins to determine whether a unique feature exists in the reactive site loop of AT that may be responsible for its inactive native conformation. It was noted that relative to α1-antitrypsin, the archetypical inhibitor of the serpin superfamily, and other inhibitory serpins that have a basic heparin-binding D-helix (Fig.1), the reactive site loop of AT has three insertion residues, Arg399, Val400, and Thr401, at the most C-terminal end of the loop between the P5′ site and s1C-sheet (16Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of these residues to the inactive, partially buried reactive site loop conformation of AT, several mutants of the serpin were generated in which these residues were individually or in combination of two and three deleted from human AT cDNA and expressed in mammalian H293 cells. Following purification to homogeneity, the properties of these mutants were characterized with respect to their ability to bind heparin and react with fXa and thrombin in both the absence and presence of high affinity heparin and the H5 fragment of high affinity heparin. The results suggest that mutagenesis of all three residues leads to loss of affinity of the mutant for heparin, as well as its inhibitory property toward both fXa and thrombin. However, deletion of one or two residues shifts the conformational equilibrium of the AT mutants toward the activated state, thereby promoting the inhibition of fXa independent of H5. Interestingly, however, the abilities of mutants to inhibit thrombin are impaired in the absence, but not in the presence of H5, suggesting that these residues in the native conformation of AT enable the serpin to interact with the catalytic pocket of thrombin. Consistent with the conformational equilibrium model for AT (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Google Scholar, 8Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Google Scholar, 17Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Google Scholar), improvement in the reactivity of a double mutant lacking Val400 and Thr401 (des-VT) with fXa (∼12-fold) is identical to the extent of impairment of the mutant's reactivity with thrombin. This leads to a similar rate-accelerating effect for H5 in des-VT inhibition of both fXa and thrombin. These results suggest that a longer reactive site loop of AT at the P′ end of the loop is responsible for the partially buried loop of the serpin in the native conformation, which renders it inactive toward fXa. AT, however, requires this feature to regulate the activity of thrombin in the native conformation, which explains the differential reactivity of two proteinases with the native and H5-activated conformers of the serpin. The significance of this unique structural feature with respect to the physiological function of AT is discussed. Recombinant human antithrombin (rAT) and its deletion derivatives in which the three insertion residues, Arg399, Val400, and Thr401, were individually (des-R, des-V, and des-T), or in combination of two (des-VT) or three (des-RVT) deleted by standard PCR mutagenesis methods, expressed in H293 cells using RSV-PL4 expression/purification vector system as described previously (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 2308-2313Google Scholar). Accuracy of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing prior to expression. Wild type and mutant serpins were purified from cell culture supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 antibody linked to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) followed by a HiTrap-Heparin (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) ion exchange chromatography with a gradient elution from 0.1 to 2.0m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 as described previously (19Rezaie A.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 2308-2313Google Scholar). Concentrations of the AT derivatives were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,700 m−1 cm−1and by stoichiometric titration of the serpins with calibrated heparin as monitored from changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence (20Nordenman B. Nystrom C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Google Scholar). Human plasma AT (pAT), the active AT-binding H5 fragment of heparin and full-length high affinity heparin containing the H5 with an average molecular mass of ∼21,000 Da (∼70 saccharides, H70) were generous gifts from Dr. Steven Olson (University of Illinois, Chicago). Concentrations of heparins were based on the AT binding sites and were determined by stoichiometric titration of AT with the polysaccharides, with monitoring of the interaction by changes in protein fluorescence (10Olson S.T.

Recombinant human thrombin was expressed and purified as described previously (22Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar). Human fXa was purchased from (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT). The chromogenic substrates, Spectrozyme FXa (SpFXa) and Spectrozyme PCa (SpPCa) were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Polybrene was purchased from Sigma. An Aminco-Bowman series 2 spectrophotometer (Spectronic Unicam, Rochester, NY) was used for protein fluorescence measurements at 25 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 340 nm, respectively. The bandwidths were set at 1 nm for excitation and 8 nm for emission. Heparin titration was performed by the addition of a 2–5 μl of high concentration of stock solution of heparin into a 50 nmconcentration of each AT sample in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, (TBS buffer, ionic strength = 0.12) containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000. Addition of heparin diluted samples less than 5% of the original volume (500 μl). Data from at least three experiments were analyzed as the ratio of change in the fluorescence intensity of the sample containing heparin to the initial intensity of the control protein lacking heparin. The affinity of each AT derivative for heparin was calculated by nonlinear least squares computer fitting of the data by the quadratic binding equation as described previously (21Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). The rate of inactivation of fXa and thrombin by the AT derivatives in both the absence and presence of heparin was measured under pseudo-first order conditions by a discontinuous assay method as described previously (22Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 23Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Google Scholar). Briefly, in the absence of heparin, a 1 nm concentration each proteinase was incubated with 200–500 nm AT in TBS buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% PEG 8000, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. All reactions were carried out at room temperature in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene plates. After a period of time (1–60 min depending on the rate of the reactions), 50 μl of the chromogenic substrate SpFXa or SpPCa (500 μm) in TBS was added to each well, and the remaining enzyme activities were measured by a VmaxKinetics Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The reaction conditions with both proteinases in the presence of a saturating concentration of H5 (500 nm) were the same except that concentrations of the AT derivatives ranged from 5 to 200 nm and the incubation time was reduced to 0.5–20 min. The observed pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) were determined by computer fitting of the time-dependent change of the proteinase activity to a single exponential function and the second order association rate constants (k2) for uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions were obtained from the slopes of linear plots ofkobsversus the concentrations of AT as described previously (22Rezaie A.R.

The heparin concentration dependence of wild type and mutant AT inhibition of both fXa and thrombin were evaluated by incubating a 0.2 nm concentratino of each proteinase with AT (1.5–2.5 nm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of H70 (0–8.2 μm) in TBS as described previously (22Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 23Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Google Scholar). Following incubation for 10–120 s at room temperature, 50 μl of SpFXa or SpPCa in TBS containing 1 mg/ml Polybrene was added, and the kobs andk2 values for the heparin-catalyzed inactivation were determined as described above. Wild type and mutant antithrombin derivatives were expressed in H293 cells and purified to homogeneity by a combination of HPC4 immunoaffinity and HiTrap-Heparin column chromatography as described previously (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 2308-2313Google Scholar). Except for des-RVT, which eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl, recombinant wild type (rAT) and all other mutants of AT were eluted at ∼0.7–0.8 m NaCl from the HiTrap-Heparin column (data not shown). Since des-RVT did not bind heparin with high affinity and exhibited insignificant inhibitory activity toward either fXa or thrombin in both the absence and presence of heparin, it was not included in the further studies described below. SDS-PAGE analysis of all other mutants under nonreducing conditions suggested that the AT derivatives have been purified to homogeneity and that all migrate with relative molecular masses identical to human pAT (Fig. 2). It is known that the binding of high affinity heparin to AT is associated with an ∼30–40% intrinsic protein fluorescence enhancement (21Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). The dissociation constants (KD) of the heparin binding to each mutant were determined by monitoring the fluorescence emission spectra as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.3, binding of H70 to wild type and mutant serpins resulted in a similar enhancement in the intrinsic protein fluorescence. The KD values measured for the serpin derivatives (pAT, 43.3 ± 0.9 nm; rAT, 28.3 ± 1.5 nm; des-R, 17.0 ± 3.3 nm; des-V, 21.4 ± 4.6 nm; des-T, 29.2 ± 7.6 nm; and des-VT, 15.4 ± 4.0 nm) suggested that the affinity of mutants for binding to heparin was either normal or improved. The most improvement in affinity (2-fold) was observed for the des-VT double deletion mutant. These results suggested that the mutants have been properly folded. Furthermore, consistent with previous observation by others (7Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Google Scholar, 17Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Google Scholar), a high affinity interaction with heparin suggested that mutants might have adopted activated conformations. k2values for the association of the wild type and mutant serpins with fXa and thrombin in both the absence and presence of H5 or H70 are presented in Tables Iand II. As expected from the purity on SDS-PAGE, rAT and pAT exhibited identical reactivities with both proteinases in either the absence or presence of cofactors. Except for des-R, which exhibited a near wild type reactivity with fXa, all other mutants inhibited fXa better than the wild type serpin in the absence of the cofactors (Table I). The improvement in the reactivities of the mutants with fXa ranged from ∼2–3-fold for des-V and des-T to ∼12-fold for the double mutant des-VT. Interestingly, the 200–300-fold rate-accelerating effect of H5 in AT inhibition of fXa was reduced by a similar extent in inhibition by the mutant serpins. Thus, in contrast to ∼300-fold catalytic effect of H5 in rAT inhibition of fXa (Table I), this value was reduced to only 35-fold in inhibition by the des-VT mutant. Similarly, the extent of the cofactor effect of the full-length heparin, H70, in inhibition of fXa by the mutant serpins was decreased (Table I). We previously demonstrated that the cofactor effect of H70 in AT inhibition of fXa is mediated by ∼300-fold enhancement through activation and ∼200–300-fold enhancement through template mechanism in the presence of a physiological concentration of Ca2+ (22Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 23Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Google Scholar). Thus, analysis of data in Table I suggests that the observed decrease in the rate-accelerating effect of H70 in inhibition of fXa by the mutant serpins is not due to a decrease in the extent of the template effect of heparin, but rather due to mutants being in constitutively activated conformations. This is derived from the observation that the ratio of the cofactor effect of H70 to that of H5 is not significantly affected with the mutant serpins (Table I).Table ISecond-order inhibition rate constants (in m1s−1) for reactions of the wild type and mutant AT derivatives with fXa in the absence and presence of high affinity ∼70-saccharide heparin (H70) and pentasaccharide fragment of heparin (H5)Cofactor (× 103)H5 (× 105)H70 (× 107)Fold catalytic effectH5H70pAT2.6 ± 0.15.9 ± 0.417.7 ± 1.222768,077rAT2.3 ± 0.17.3 ± 0.413.8 ± 0.731760,000Des-R1.6 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.16.7 ± 0.216341,875Des-V5.0 ± 0.52.7 ± 0.33.5 ± 0.2547,000Des-T5.7 ± 0.63.5 ± 0.410.0 ± 0.46117,544Des-VT27.0 ± 0.49.6 ± 0.912.8 ± 0.6364,741The second-order rate constants (k2) in both the absence and presence of H5 were determined by incubation of 1 nm fXa with 5–500 nm AT derivatives in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 2.5 mmCa2+ for 0.5–30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values in the presence of optimal concentration of H70 (∼50 nm) were determined by the same procedure except that 0.2 nm fXa was incubated with AT derivatives for 10–20 s.

All values are averages of at least three independent measurements ± S.D. Unlike the reactions with fXa, the ability of mutant serpins to inhibit thrombin was impaired 4–15-fold (Table II). However, the cofactor function of H5 and H70 partially or completely restored the impairment in the reactivities of the mutants with thrombin. The extent of impairment in the reactivity of des-VT with thrombin was nearly identical to the extent of improvement in the reactivity of this mutant with fXa. Such a property resulted in the interesting observation that the rate accelerating effect of H5 in fXa (35-fold) and thrombin (44-fold) inhibition by this mutant was essentially similar (Tables I and II). Consistent with the results observed for fXa, the extent of the template effect of H70 (ratio of H70 to H5) in thrombin inhibition by the AT derivatives was not significantly altered. Taken together, these results suggested that reducing the length of the reactive site loop of AT by one and two residues has a reciprocal effect on the ability of the serpin to inhibit the two proteinases in the absence of cofactors, thus improving the inhibition rates with fXa and impairing them with thrombin. Unlike all other mutants, the reactivity of des-R with fXa was not improved and was impaired most with thrombin. Based on previous results of our own (24Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Google Scholar) as well as those of others (25Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3530-3533Google Scholar), it is believed that Arg399 interacts productively with the acidic Glu39 (chymotrypsin numbering) of both fXa and thrombin, thus its deletion impairs the rate of reaction with both proteinases. In support of this, the reactivity of wild type AT with the Glu39 → Lys mutant of thrombin (24Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Google Scholar) was impaired ∼5–10-fold independent of H5 (data not shown). Thus, the lack of improvement in the reactivity of this mutant with fXa is irrelevant for the conformational state of the reactive site loop of the mutant serpin. Consistent with previous results (10Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar, 22Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar), a bell-shaped dependence on the H70 concentrations (optimal 20–200 nm) was observed for all AT derivatives in reaction with both fXa and thrombin (data not shown). Similar to previous results with the wild type AT (10Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar), inhibition stoichiometries of ∼1 in the absence of heparin, and ∼1–1.5 in the presence of heparin, were observed for all mutant serpins in reaction with both fXa and thrombin. This was consistent with the observation that both proteinases formed SDS-stable complexes with all AT derivatives to a similar extent (data not shown), suggesting that the mutagenesis has not affected the substrate pathway of the reactions. It has been hypothesized that AT exists in equilibrium between two conformationally active and inactive states (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Google Scholar, 8Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Google Scholar, 17Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Google Scholar). In the inactive state, which predominates the solution equilibrium of the serpin, the two N-terminal P14 and P15 residues of the reactive site loop of AT are inserted into the A-β-sheet of the molecule in the native conformation of the serpin (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Google Scholar, 8Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Google Scholar). This unique structural feature, which is only observed in AT renders the serpin inactive toward reaction with fXa (8Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Google Scholar), but it is not influential in reaction with thrombin (10Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). Recent crystal structure determination of AT in complex with H5 suggests that the binding of H5 on thed-helix of the serpin results in expulsion of the two N-terminal P14 and P15 residues (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Google Scholar), which is accompanied by a 200–300-fold enhancement in the reactivity of AT with fXa with no significant effect on its reaction with thrombin (10Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). The molecular basis for differential reactivity of fXa and thrombin with the native and activated conformations of AT is not known. Relative to α1-antitrypsin, the reactive site loop of AT has three additional residues, Arg399, Val400, and Thr401, at the C-terminal P′ end of the loop (Fig. 1). Since the conformation of the reactive site loop in AT is mobile and linked to the heparin-binding d-helix of the serpin (3Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Google Scholar, 8Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Google Scholar), it was hypothesized in this study that there might be a size limitation for the length of the loop between the A and C sheets, and any excess in its length causes a constraint on the loop, leading to insertion of two N-terminal residues into β-sheet A and thus preventing the reactive site loop from accepting an optimal conformation to fit into the active site pocket of fXa. To test this hypothesis, several single, as well as a double, deletion mutants of AT were prepared and characterized. Consistent with the hypothesis, kinetic analysis suggested that deletion of two residues from the reactive site loop of AT shifted the equilibrium by at least an order of magnitude in favor of the activated state in the mutant serpin. This is derived from the observation that the des-VT mutant inhibited fXa 12-fold better than the wild type serpin in the absence of H5, but at a comparable rate in the presence of the cofactor. Interestingly, the reactivity of the double mutant with thrombin was also impaired by the same order of magnitude in the absence, but not in the presence of H5. These results suggest that the interaction of thrombin with AT is sensitive to the length of the reactive site loop of wild type serpin, but not to its conformational state (either preinserted or exposed). It follows, therefore, that the native equilibrium fraction of the des-VT mutant, which has a shorter reactive site loop, exhibited impaired reactivity with thrombin only in the absence of H5. This implies that thrombin, similar to fXa, can react only with the activated conformation of the mutant serpin, since the length of the exposed loop in the mutant des-VT in the presence of H5 is similar to that in wild type AT in the native conformation. Therefore, relative to fXa, the basis for the higher reactivity of thrombin with the native serpin lies in the ability of thrombin, but not fXa to react with the loop preinserted AT, independent of H5. This appears to be due to the P′ insertion residues giving the reactive site loop of AT an optimal length and mobility to fit into the deep canyon-like active site pocket of thrombin in the native conformation. These results strongly support the conformational equilibrium hypothesis of AT and for the first time also provides an explanation for why fXa and thrombin differentially react with the native and heparin-activated conformations of the serpin. The observation that a longer reactive site loop of AT is primarily responsible for the slow reactivity of the serpin with fXa, but is also required for AT to regulate the proteolytic activity of thrombin in the native conformation, has important implications for the physiological function of AT in circulation. AT, by virtue of its unique reactive site loop, can inhibit thrombin in the native conformation, but requires activation before it can effectively inhibit fXa. It follows, therefore, that fXa in vivo can be inhibited primarily by the small fraction of AT that is bound to the heparin-like molecules on the vasculature (6Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Google Scholar, 26de Agostini A.I. Watkins S.C. Slayter H.S. Youssoufian H. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1293-1304Google Scholar). Otherwise, in the presence of a high concentration of circulating active AT (2.3 μm), maintenance of normal hemostasis would have been compromised due to rapid inactivation of fXa, which is generated at a minute concentration (at picomolar range) during the propagation phase of the coagulation cascade (27Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Google Scholar). On the other hand thrombin may be generated at very high concentrations (up to several hundred nm) under various (patho)physiological conditions (28Butenas S. van't Veer C. Mann K.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 2169-2178Google Scholar). If AT were inactive toward thrombin in its native conformation, then thrombosis would have been a common problem. The unique reactive site loop of AT therefore enables the serpin to effectively regulate the activity of several clotting enzymes without compromising hemostasis. Finally, the results of this study suggest that, unlike the mutagenesis of the P site reactive site loop of AT, which interferes with the mechanics of loop insertion, thereby converting all highly reactive mutants to efficient substrates (9Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Google Scholar), the mutagenesis of the P′ residues of the C-terminal end of the reactive site loop of AT does not influence the substrate pathway of the reaction. Rather, it constitutively activates the mutant serpin. Such a mutagenesis approach holds a great promise for development of recombinant AT derivatives capable of specifically inhibiting fXa independent of polysaccharide cofactors.

In adult arteries, the relationship between smooth muscle cells and overlying intact endothelium is responsible for maintaining the health of the vessel. Heparin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell growth in culture and intimal hyperplasia following endothelial denudation. Using gene microarrays, we identified the tyrosine kinase receptor EphB2 as being differentially expressed in response to continuous intravenous heparin administration in the rabbit model of arterial injury. EphB2 protein levels increased in cultured bovine vascular smooth muscle cells following serum stimulation and were decreased in a dose-dependent fashion by heparin. Fc chimeras of the binding domain of the EphB2 ligands blocked the formation of the EphB2 ligand-receptor complex and reduced growth of serum-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Activation of the ligand by an Fc chimera to EphB2 followed a parabolic dose-response growth curve, indicating growth stimulation until the chimera begins to compete with native receptors. Co-administration of EphB2/Fc chimera with heparin shifted the dose-response curve to the right. These data indicate a possible new route of Heparin's antiproliferative effect and a role of EphB2 and its ligands in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.

These proteins are highly conserved membrane-bound receptors that interact with cell surface ligands known as ephrins. There are two classes of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands. Type A ligands bind type A receptors, are membrane-bound, and are entirely extracellular. Type B ligands, which bind type B receptors, possess a cytoplasmic tail capable of kinase signaling activity. Thus, in the case of the type B receptor-ligand complex bidirectional signaling is possible. The extracellular portion of these receptors possesses two fibronectin domains and a cysteine-rich region both of which are implicated in homo- and heterodimerization of the receptor (1Lackmann M.

These multiple binding capacities lead to several pathways that Eph receptors have been demonstrated to regulate, including the Src, Ras, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase families (4Tallquist M.D. Soriano P.

The EphB2 receptor is expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues with decreased levels seen in the latter. Its functions include axonal guidance, and it may play a role in the assembly of several neural structures (5Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Axonal guidance is believed to be conducted through repulsive interactions between the ligand and the receptor. In a similar manner, EphB2 has been implicated in the formation of arterial venous boundaries, vascular morphogenesis, and sprouting angiogenesis (6Adams R.H. Wilkinson G.A. Weiss C. Diella F.

Gene microarrays allowed the screening of thousands of potential genes of interest in the vascular response to injury for the potential of mediating heparin's antiproliferative effect. We observed EphB2 mRNA levels to be down-regulated by continuous intravenous heparin administration. Western blotting of vascular smooth muscle cell samples confirmed an effect of heparin on EphB2 protein levels. Fc chimeras to the binding region of the receptor and its ligand produced a growth stimulatory effect through the formation of the complex. Thus, by screening thousands of candidate genes with gene microarrays, we have discovered a new mediator of vascular smooth muscle cell growth and of heparin's antiproliferative effect and a stronger link between the biology of arterial development and vascular repair. The iliac arteries of 18 New Zealand White rabbits were denuded with three passes of a 3F embolectomy catheter. Nine rabbits received heparin via an osmotic pump implanted subcutaneously on the animals flank with an intravenous line delivering 0.3 mg/kg/h heparin to the femoral vein. At 3, 7, and 14 days, six rabbits were sacrificed, and iliac tissue was harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared from each frozen tissue sample, and 1 μg of sample was used to prepare33P-labeled cDNA that was hybridized to the Research Genetics Human “Named Genes” GeneFilters® Microarrays Release 1. Paired experiments were prepared sequentially on the same membrane. The spot intensities and identities were determined by Research Genetics Pathways™ software. Fold changes greater than 3 were considered significant, and intensity values within 2-fold of background were considered insignificant. The ratios of spot intensities between samples hybridized to the same array were calculated and averaged across each time point. Smooth muscle cells were isolated from bovine aortas obtained through Research 87 (Cambridge, MA). Small explants of tissue with removed endothelium were placed in 15 × 30 tissue culture dishes. Smooth muscle cells were grown and expanded from these explants to create cell stocks for future experiments. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% Pen-Strep and l-glutamine and calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for normal cell growth and experiment. Cells between passages 3 and 6 were seeded at 1,000 cells/well of a 48-well plate in media supplemented with 10% calf serum for cell growth assays. The next day, these cells were starved at 0.1% calf serum-supplemented media for 24 h. Then ephrin B1/Fc, ephrin B2/Fc, and EphB2/Fc chimeras (R & D Systems) and heparin were added at the indicated concentrations to the cells in 1–2.5% calf serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Each condition was performed in triplicate. After a 3-day incubation period, the smooth muscle cell population for each condition was counted using a Z1 Coulter Counter. To study heparin's effect on EphB2 protein levels, vascular smooth muscle cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture (Costar) dishes at subconfluent levels (1–1.25 million cells) and then serum-starved the following day in 0.1% calf serum-supplemented medium. After 24 h, the cells were given a dose of 100 μg/ml heparin in 5% calf serum-supplemented medium after the starvation period. Cells were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h. The cells were harvested using radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmNaCl) supplemented with Complete MiniTablet protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Relative EphB2 protein levels were determined using Western blotting and antibodies to EphB2 (R & D Systems). A separate set of cultures prepared in the same manner were grown in 5% calf serum containing 1, 10, or 100 μg/ml heparin and EphB2 levels were measured as above. Using gene microarrays to perform differential display, EphB2 and other members of theEph receptor family were identified as novel candidate mediators of the arterial repair. In the rabbit iliac artery model of arterial injury, EphB2 levels were seen to increase from insignificant levels at 3 days to 3.6-fold over uninjured arteries at 7 days. At 14 days, the mRNA for EphB2 returned to insignificant levels. Continuous intravenous heparin administration blocked the increase in EphB2 mRNA level seen in untreated tissues. Analysis of the levels of mRNA versus control of the array showed a similar profile for EphB2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 which showed insignificant levels at 3 and 14 days and a 4.2-fold increase over the uninjured arteries at 7 days. Again heparin administration attenuated the increase, limiting VEGF mRNA to 3-fold over control at 7 days. To confirm heparin's effect on EphB2 expression in smooth muscle cells, bovine aortic smooth muscle cells were exposed to heparin and harvested at various time points (Fig. 1). A dose-dependent response to heparin was observed with 100 μg/ml heparin causing a nearly 6-fold decrease in protein levels. Peak down-regulation was observed at 6 h with a return to near normal expression levels at 12 h. Based on previously published data, an Fc chimera of ephrin B1 served as a competitive antagonist to the activation of the receptor (Fig.2) (23Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Administration of ephrin B2/Fc chimera yielded a similar growth inhibition about 70% of that seen with the ephrin B1/Fc chimera. The concentrations required to achieve this growth inhibition were comparable with previous studies (24Huynh-Do U. Stein E. Lane A.A. Liu H. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sakano S. Serizawa R. Inada T. Iwama A. Itoh A. Kato C. Shimizu Y. Shinkai F. Shimizu R. Kondo S. Ohno M. Suda T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The addition of control Fc fragments had no significant effect on growth. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells grown in the presence of these chimeras demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition, the maximum growth inhibition being comparable with that seen in heparin-treated cells, at a molar ratio of heparin to chimera of ∼2.5. Similarly, an Fc chimera of the ligand-binding portion of the EphB2 receptor has been shown to stimulate ligand activity (27Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 28Kalo M.S. Yu H.H. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). When aortic smooth muscle cells are grown in the presence of this chimera, a parabolic dose-dependent cell growth curve was observed (Fig. 3). The cell number increased to a maximum, above which less growth stimulation was seen. This maximum probably represents the point at which all free ligand has been bound either by either native receptor or by the exogenous chimera. At concentrations above this level, the native EphB2 receptor is probably competing with the chimera for free ligand, causing a decrease in the growth stimulation. When heparin was added to this medium, reducing the number of native receptors and thereby freeing more ligand for binding to the chimera, the percentage of stimulation was similar, but the amount of chimera that was added before a maximum was reached increased (Fig. 4). This manifests itself as a shift in the dose response to the right.Figure 4EphB2-Fc chimera effect in the presence of heparin. Vascular smooth muscle cells were grown for 3 days following starvation in 1% calf serum alone (CS) and with 100 μg/ml heparin supplemented with 1, 10, and 100 μg/ml EphB2/Fc chimera. *, p < 0.01 when compared with serum alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an adult artery, the interactions between the endothelium, circulating platelets, and inflammatory cells and the underlying layer of smooth muscle cells help maintain vascular homeostasis. The removal of or disease in the endothelial monolayer leads to a cascade of surface and intramural events that includes cell adhesion and activation, inflammation, thrombosis, proliferation, cell migration, and matrix remodeling that can create a neointima that limits luminal integrity. Continuous intravenous heparin administration inhibits virtually all of these processes in animal models (30Clowes A.W. Karnowsky M.J. Nature. 1977; 265: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In examining the potential molecular modification of vascular repair, we found increased mRNA expression of the Eph family of ligands and receptors after arterial denudation and attenuation of this family with heparin administration. Similar results were obtained in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. EphB2 was not detected in growth-arrested smooth muscle cells, but Western blotting indicated an increase in EphB2 protein levels within 3 h of the addition of serum, which was reduced by heparin in a dose-dependent fashion. EphB2 and its ligands have been linked with vascular development (4Tallquist M.D. Soriano P. Klinghoffer R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7917-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Adams R.H.

Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Expression of ephrin B2 and EphB2 at the interface between the mesenchyme and endothelium in developing embryos suggests that they play a role in the regulation of the interactions between these two arterial layers and, as a result, may well help control the vascular response to injury and vascular repair. Signaling of the class B Eph ligand receptor complex is bidirectional, allowing for a phosphorylation of both the ephrin and the Eph receptor. Activation of the ligand is achieved by the binding to a single receptor, while the receptor requires a clustering of multiple ligands to produce an effect (31Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Fc chimeras of the ephrin binding domain blocked the binding of native ligand to its receptor and therefore prevented the activation of the receptor. When added to serum, these chimeras inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. At high concentrations, this inhibition equaled that of the heparin. Increases in the concentration of serum lead to a shift in the dose-response curve to the right. Since the increases in cell number will be accompanied by increases in the number of receptors present, it follows that higher dosing levels would be required at higher serum concentrations. It is also interesting to note that free ephrins have been detected in the conditioned media of some epithelial cell lines (25Sakano S. Serizawa R. Inada T. Iwama A. Itoh A. Kato C. Shimizu Y. Shinkai F. Shimizu R. Kondo S. Ohno M. Suda T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 813-822PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the release of free ligand from an overlying endothelial layer could prevent the formation of the receptor-ligand complex between adjacent smooth muscle cells in a normal artery. Blocking the formation of the receptor-ligand complex inhibits smooth muscle cell growth, but since signaling is complex and might follow from activation of the ligand as well as the receptor complex, it is not clear exactly whether one or both signaling pathways are critical for growth control. Our data support the importance of both the ligand and receptor in smooth muscle cell proliferation and suggest that the specific effect of heparin is probably limited to down-regulation of the receptor alone. To determine the effect of activation of the ligand, Fc chimeras of the binding domain of the receptor were used to activate ephrin B1 and ephrin B2 without receptor complex formation (32Kozlosky C.J. Maraskovsky E. McGrew J.T. VandenBos T. Teepe M. Lyman S.D. Srinivasan S. Fletcher F.A. Gayle III, R.B. Cerretti D.P. Beckmann M.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 299-306PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bennett B.D. Zeigler F.C. Gu Q. Fendly B. Goddard A.D. Gillett N. Matthews W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The addition of this chimera to the serum of cultured smooth muscle cells increased cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the activation of the ligand does indeed play a role in the proliferative response. However, as the dose was increased, a dose-dependent decrease in growth was seen. If only the ligand's activation affected growth, a plateau in growth would be seen as we saturated the available ligands with chimera. Instead, a decrease in growth stimulation was seen, probably due the chimera sequestering ligand that would have otherwise been bound by native receptor. This reduces the number of native receptors activated and leads to the decrease in growth stimulation. Furthermore, when heparin is included in the growth medium, a shift in the dose response to the right is seen. Heparin's down-regulation of the native receptors creates more free ligand for the chimera to bind. The growth stimulation continues to increase to doses well above the previous initial dose, demonstrating that the previous loss of stimulation was due an antagonistic effect of the chimera on the ligand binding native receptor. Therefore, we conclude that activation of both the ephrin ligand and Eph receptor are capable of stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation. The Eph receptors have been linked to a large number of pathways, and there is significant overlap with those pathways identified as sensitive to heparin. Heparin inhibits activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase; however, the effect appears to be proximal to this kinase and perhaps through negative feedback (19Lille S. Daum G. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. J. Surg. Res. 1997; 70: 178-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Ottlinger M.E. Pukac L.A. Karnovsky M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19173-19176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, Eph receptors have been linked with numerous signaling proteins that function proximal to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Activation of Eph receptors is known to lead to the docking of adapter proteins, including members of the Grb and Src family members (23Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Binding of these adapter proteins leads to a kinase cascade that can ultimately effect the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and the proto-oncogenes associated with its activation. Heparin is also known to increase α smooth muscle actin in proliferating smooth muscle cells (35Desmouliere A. Rubbia-Brandt L. Gabbiani G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 244-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, EphB2 binds RasGAP, an inhibitor of the Ras cascade that can also drive a reduction in α smooth muscle actin expression. These mechanisms serve as examples of how Eph signaling and heparin function may be related. The gene array data suggest a possible functional link between heparin and EphB2. Vascular endothelial growth factor was seen to follow the expression pattern of EphB2. Numerous studies have implicated VEGF as a key growth involved in angiogenesis (36Poole T.J. Finkelstein E.B. Cox C.M. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 37Patan S. J. Neurooncol. 2000; 50: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recently, Helblinget al. (38Helbling P.M. Saulnier D.M.E. Brandli A. Development. 2000; 127: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that angiogenesis proceeds in three phases with the initial step, sprouting, being under control of VEGF, and the second phase, invasion, being regulated by EphB receptors and their ligands. Heparin has been utilized as an antiangiogenic factor. When co-administered with steroids, heparin functions synergistically to inhibit angiogenesis in tumors (39Beck D.W. Olson J.J. Linhardt R.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1986; 45: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 40Folkman J. Langer R. Linhardt R.J. Haudenschild C. Taylor S. Science. 1983; 221: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Heparin formulations enriched in 2.5- and 5-kDa fragments was found to block angiogenesis in a tumor model without the additional steroid (41Norrby K. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since the expression profile of both EphB2 and VEGF both show a similar response both to injury and to heparin treatment, it is possible that heparin's effect seen here is largely that of an antiangiogenic factor. Further studies into VEGF's relationship to heparin and EphB2 will elucidate whether these factors are functioning together in vasculoproliferative disease. The mechanism by which heparin down-regulates EphB2 levels is still unclear, but we have shown that EphB2 is capable of modulating the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and that one effect of heparin on these cells is a decrease in this receptor. Determination of whether other members of the Eph family of tyrosine kinases possess similar activity requires further investigation, but it is a new area in which heparin may exert its antiproliferative activity and a further link between the biology or vascular development and arterial repair."
