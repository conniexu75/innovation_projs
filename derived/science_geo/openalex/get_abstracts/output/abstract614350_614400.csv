https://openalex.org/W2813174558,"Background Assessment of people with dementia is challenging; with undetected and under treated symptoms and concerns resulting in avoidable distress, and few evidence-based interventions to support this. We aimed to understand the mechanisms of action of a measure to support comprehensive assessment of people with dementia in care homes; and its acceptability, feasibility, and implementation requirements. Methods A qualitative study with an embedded quantitative component in three residential care homes, underpinned by an initial theoretical model of mechanisms of action. The measure, the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale for Dementia (IPOS-Dem), was introduced into the care of residents with dementia for 12 weeks. Qualitative data comprised focus groups and semi-structured interviews with family, care home staff, general practitioners and district nurses; and non-participant observations. Quantitative data comprised IPOS-Dem data. Directed content analysis for qualitative data, and descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data. Findings Key mechanisms of action were: improved observation and awareness of residents, collaborative assessment, comprehensive ‘picture of the person’, systematic record keeping, improved review and monitoring, care planning and changes to care provision, and facilitated multi-agency communication. Potential benefit included improved symptom management, improved comprehensive care, and increased family empowerment and engagement. IPOS-Dem was found to be acceptable and feasible. It was perceived as quick and easy to use, with proportion of overall missing data decreasing from 2.1% to 1.1% from baseline to final time points. ‘Trust’ in the measure was important; and leadership essential to ensure integration into care processes. Conclusions In a population with complex care needs, with challenges to assessment and barriers to multi-agency working, a measure introduced into routine care is feasible and acceptable, and supports assessment and management of symptoms and concerns. A refined theoretical model demonstrating the likely mechanisms of action was developed. Further evaluation is required to test its effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2825999142,"Phosphate-solubilizing fungi (PSF) generally enhance available phosphorus (P) released from soil, which contributes to plants' P requirement, especially in P-limiting regions. In this study, two PSF, TalA-JX04 and AspN-JX16, were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) widely distributed in P-deficient areas in China and identified as Talaromyces aurantiacus and Aspergillus neoniger, respectively. The two PSF were cultured in potato dextrose liquid medium with six types of initial pH values ranging from 6.5 to 1.5 to assess acid resistance. Both PSF were incubated in Pikovskaya's liquid media with different pH values containing five recalcitrant P sources, including Ca3(PO4)2, FePO4, CaHPO4, AlPO4, and C6H6Ca6O24P6, to estimate their P-solubilizing capacity. No significant differences were found in the biomass of both fungi grown in media with different initial pH, indicating that these fungi could grow well under acid stress. The P-solubilizing capacity of TalA-JX04 was highest in medium containing CaHPO4, followed by Ca3(PO4)2, FePO4, C6H6Ca6O24P6, and AlPO4 in six types of initial pH treatments, while the recalcitrant P-solubilizing capacity of AspN-JX16 varied with initial pH. Meanwhile, the P-solubilizing capacity of AspN-JX16 was much higher than TalA-JX04. The pH of fermentation broth was negatively correlated with P-solubilizing capacity (p<0.01), suggesting that the fungi promote the dissolution of P sources by secreting organic acids. Our results showed that TalA-JX04 and AspN-JX16 could survive in acidic environments and both fungi had a considerable ability to release soluble P by decomposing recalcitrant P-bearing compounds. The two fungi had potential for application as environment-friendly biofertilizers in subtropical bamboo ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2859516817,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to increase in prevalence in industrialized countries. Major complications of IBD include formation of fibrotic strictures, fistulas, reduced absorptive function, cancer risk, and the need for surgery. In other chronic gastrointestinal disease models, stiffness has been shown to precede fibrosis; therefore, stiffness may be a reasonable indicator of progression toward stricture formation in IBD patients. Herein, we seek to quantify tissue stiffness and characterize fibrosis in patients with IBD and to compare mechanical properties of unaffected human tissue to common animal species used for IBD studies. Inflamed and unaffected tissue from IBD patients and unaffected tissue from mice, pigs, and cows were indented using a custom device to determine the effective stiffness. Histology was performed on matched tissues, and total RNA was isolated from IBD tissue samples and used for gene expression analysis of pro-fibrotic genes. We observed an increase in the effective stiffness (steady-state modulus, SSM) (p < 0.0001) and increased expression of the collagen type I gene (COL1A1, p = 0.01) in inflamed tissue compared to unaffected areas in our IBD patient cohort. We also found that increased staining of collagen fibers in submucosa positively correlated with SSM (p = 0.093). We determined that unaffected animal bowel stiffness is significantly greater than similar human tissues, suggesting additional limitations on animal models for translational investigations regarding stiffness-related hypotheses. Taken together, our data support development of tools for evaluation of bowel stiffness in IBD patients for prognostic applications that may enable more accurate prediction of those who will develop fibrosis and more precise prescription of aggressive therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2813619473,"School-based comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) can help adolescents achieve their full potential and realize their sexual and reproductive health and rights. This is particularly pressing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where high rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs among adolescents can limit countries’ ability to capitalize on the demographic dividend. While many LMICs have developed CSE curricula, their full implementation is often hindered by challenges around program planning and roll-out at the national and local level. A better understanding of these barriers, and similarities and differences across countries, can help devise strategies to improve implementation; yet few studies have examined these barriers. This paper analyzes the challenges to the implementation of national CSE curricula in four LMICs: Ghana, Kenya, Peru and Guatemala. It presents qualitative findings from in-depth interviews with central and local government officials, civil society representatives, and community level stakeholders ranging from religious leaders to youth representatives. Qualitative findings are complemented by quantitative results from surveys of principals, teachers who teach CSE topics, and students aged 15–17 in a representative sample of 60–80 secondary schools distributed across three regions in each country, for a total of around 3000 students per country. Challenges encountered were strikingly similar across countries. Program planning-related challenges included insufficient and piecemeal funding for CSE; lack of coordination of the various efforts by central and local government, NGOs and development partners; and inadequate systems for monitoring and evaluating teachers and students on CSE. Curriculum implementation-related challenges included inadequate weight given to CSE when integrated into other subjects, insufficient adaptation of the curriculum to local contexts, and limited stakeholder participation in curriculum development. While challenges were similar across countries, the strategies used to overcome them were different, and offer useful lessons to improve implementation for these and other low- and middle-income countries facing similar challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2951717324,"The accurate quantification of cellular and mitochondrial bioenergetic activity is of great interest in medicine and biology. Mitochondrial stress tests performed with Seahorse Bioscience XF Analyzers allow the estimation of different bioenergetic measures by monitoring the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of living cells in multi-well plates. However, studies of the statistical best practices for determining aggregated OCR measurements and comparisons have been lacking. Therefore, to understand how OCR behaves across different biological samples, wells, and plates, we performed mitochondrial stress tests in 126 96-well plates involving 203 fibroblast cell lines. We show that the noise of OCR is multiplicative, that outlier data points can concern individual measurements or all measurements of a well, and that the inter-plate variation is greater than the intra-plate variation. Based on these insights, we developed a novel statistical method, OCR-Stats, that: i) robustly estimates OCR levels modeling multiplicative noise and automatically identifying outlier data points and outlier wells; and ii) performs statistical testing between samples, taking into account the different magnitudes of the between- and within-plate variations. This led to a significant reduction of the coefficient of variation across plates of basal respiration by 45% and of maximal respiration by 29%. Moreover, using positive and negative controls, we show that our statistical test outperforms the existing methods, which suffer from an excess of either false positives (within-plate methods), or false negatives (between-plate methods). Altogether, this study provides statistical good practices to support experimentalists in designing, analyzing, testing, and reporting the results of mitochondrial stress tests using this high throughput platform."
https://openalex.org/W2845417761,"Dogs are highly susceptible to the leptospiral infection, notably stray and sheltered dogs. Unsanitary conditions often observed in dog shelters may predispose the introduction and spread of leptospires among sheltered populations, potentially increasing the chances for the inadvertent adoption of asymptomatically infected animals. The present work describes a longitudinal study using a multidisciplinary approach for the identification of chronically infected dogs and the characterization of potentially pathogenic strains circulating among stray and sheltered dog populations in São Paulo, Brazil. A total of 123 dogs from three populations were included. The initial evaluation consisted of blood and urine quantitative PCR testing (qPCR), the detection of specific antibodies by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), physical examination and hematological and serum biochemistry analyses. The qPCR-positive dogs were prospectively examined, and reevaluations also included culture from urine samples. Positive qPCR samples were subjected to 16S rRNA and secY gene phylogenetic analysis. The recovered strains were characterized by Multilocus Sequence Typing, polyclonal serogroup identification and virulence determination. Leptospiruria was detected in all populations studied (13/123), and phylogenetic analysis revealed that 10 dogs had L. interrogans infection. Three dogs (3/13) had L. santarosai infection. The secY phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. santarosai sequences clustered separately from those obtained from other hosts. Ten leptospiruric dogs were reevaluated, and three dogs presented persistent leptospiruria, allowing culturing from two dogs. The strains were characterized as L. interrogans serogroup Canicola (virulent) and L. santarosai serogroup Sejroe (not virulent). Serum samples were retested by MAT using the DU92 and DU114 strains as antigens, and no increased seroreactivity was detected. Asymptomatic L. santarosai infection was observed in all populations studied, suggesting a possible role of dogs in the chain of transmission of this leptospiral species. The results suggest a genetic distinction between lineages of Brazilian L. santarosai maintained by dogs and other animal hosts. Our findings revealed that dogs could act as maintenance hosts for distinct pathogenic Leptospira, highlighting also that asymptomatically infected dogs can be inadvertently admitted and adopted in dog shelters, potentially increasing the risks of zoonotic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2858737451,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of anthocyanins (ANC) present in purple corn to enhance insulin secretion and hepatic glucose uptake in pancreatic cells and hepatocytes, through activation of the free fatty acid receptor-1 (FFAR1) and glucokinase (GK), respectively. Using a dual-layer cell culture with Caco-2 cells, INS-1E or HepG2 cells were treated with an anthocyanin-rich extract from the pericarp of purple corn (PCW), as well as pure ANC cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), peonidin-3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside. Delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (D3G) was used for comparative purposes. Semipurified C3G (C3G-P) and condensed forms (CF-P) isolated from PCW were also used. At 100 μM, the pure ANC enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in INS-1E cells ranging from 18% to 40% (p<0.05) compared to untreated cells. PCW increased GSIS by 51%. D3G was the most effective anthocyanin activating FFAR1 (EC50: 196.6 μM). PCW had activating potential on FFAR1 (EC50: 77 μg/mL). PCW, as well as C3G and D3G increased the expression of FFAR1, PLC, and phosphorylation of PKD, related to the FFAR1-dependent insulin secretory pathway. The treatment with 100 μM of P3G and C3G increased (p<0.05) glucose uptake in HepG2 cells by 19% and 31%. PCW increased the glucose uptake in HepG2 cells by 48%. It was determined that CF-P was the most effective for activating GK (EC50: 39.9 μM) and the PCW extracts had an efficacy of EC50: 44 μg/mL. The ANC in purple corn also reduced AMPK phosphorylation and PEPCK expression in HepG2 cells, known to be related to reduction in gluconeogenesis. It is demonstrated for the first time that dietary ANC can enhance the activity of novel biomarkers FFAR1 and GK and potentially ameliorate type-2 diabetes comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2843029524,"The effect of smoking on microbial dysbiosis and the potential consequence of such shift on markers of HIV disease is unknown. Here we assessed the relationship of microbial dysbiosis with smoking and markers of HIV disease.Oral wash was collected from: (1) HIV-infected smokers (HIV-SM, n = 48), (2) HIV-infected non-smokers (HIV-NS, n = 24), or (3) HIV-uninfected smokers (UI-SM, n = 24). Microbial DNA was extracted and their bacterial and fungal microbiota (bacteriome and mycobiome, respectively) were characterized using Ion-Torrent sequencing platform. Sequencing data were compared using clustering, diversity, abundance and inter-kingdom correlations analyses.Bacteriome was more widely dispersed than mycobiome, there was no noticeable difference in clustering between groups. Richness of oral bacteriome in HIV-SM was significantly lower than that of UI-SM (P ≤ .03). Diversity of HIV-NS was significantly lower than that of HIV-SM or UI-SM at phylum level (P ≤ .02). Abundance of Phylum Firmicutes was significantly decreased in HIV-NS compared to HIV-SM and UI-SM (P = .007 and .027, respectively), while abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly increased in HIV-NS compared to HIV-SM and UI-SM (P = .0005 and .011, respectively). Fungal phyla did not differ significantly between the three cohorts. Cumulative smoking was positively correlated with Facklamia but negatively with Enhydrobacter, and current alcohol use was negatively correlated with Geniculata. Bacteria Facklamia exhibited weakly positive correlation with longer PI duration (r = 0.094, P = 0.012), and a negative correlation with nadir CD4 count (r = -0.345; P = 0.004), while Granulicatella was negatively correlated with nadir CD4 count (r = -0.329; P = 0.007). Fungus Stemphylium correlated negatively with nadir CD4 (r = -0.323; P = 0.008).Dysbiosis of the oral microbiota is associated with clinical and immunologic variables in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2604530815,"Background Disrespectful and abusive practices at health facilities during childbirth discourage many women to seek care at facilities. This may lead to maternal morbidity and mortalities. Despite severe impacts, such practices remain hidden and are rarely reported in developing countries. Objectives The study was carried out to assess the prevalence and determinants of the disrespect and abuse (D & A) during child birth in rural Gujrat, Pakistan. Methods A cross sectional household based study was conducted in tehsil Kharian of district Gujrat. Data was collected using an interview based questionnaire from the women who had a live birth within the previous two months (n = 360). The D & A scale was based on standard Maternal and Child Health Integrated Programme indicators. Multiple logistic regression was used to find out the determinants of reported D & A. Results Almost all women experienced D & A (99.7%) during childbirth according to objective assessment “experienced D & A”. However, only 27.2% reported subjective experience of D & A “reported D & A”. The main determinant of reported D & A was facility based childbirth (OR = 13.49; 10.10–100.16) and lower socio economic strata (OR = 2.89; 1.63–5.11). The risk of reporting D & A was twice in public health facilities as compared to private. Women who had reported D & A were more likely to opt for changing the place of childbirth for next time (OR = 4.37, 95% CI = 2.41–7.90). Conclusion D & A during childbirth is highly prevalent and under-recognized in Pakistan. High prevalence at facilities and particularly at public facilities can be a reason for underutilization of this sector for childbirth. Maternal health policies in Pakistan need to be revised based on the charter of respectful maternity care."
https://openalex.org/W2838639155,"Root systems that improve resource uptake and penetrate compacted soil (hardpan) are important for improving soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) productivity in optimal and sub-optimal environments. The objectives of this research were to evaluate a soybean germplasm collection of 49 genotypes for root traits, determine whether root traits are related with plant height, shoot dry weight, chlorophyll index, and seed size, and identify genotypes that can penetrate a hardpan. Plants were maintained under optimal growth conditions in a greenhouse. Single plants were grown in mesocosms, constructed of two stacked columns (top and bottom columns had 25 and 46 cm height, respectively, and 15 cm inside diameter) with a 2-cm thick wax layer (synthetic hardpan; penetration resistance, 1.5 MPa at 30°C) in between. Plants were harvested at 42 days after planting. Significant genetic variability was observed for root traits in the soybean germplasm collection, and genotypes that penetrated the synthetic hardpan were identified. Genotypes NTCPR94-5157, NMS4-1-83, and N09-13128 were ranked high and PI 424007 and R01-581F were ranked low for most root traits. Shoot dry weight and chlorophyll index were positively related with total root length, surface area, and volume, and fine root length (Correlation coefficient, r ≥ 0.60 and P-value < 0.0001 for shoot dry weight and r ≥ 0.37 and P-value < 0.01 for chlorophyll index]. Plant height was negatively correlated with total root surface area, total root volume, and average root diameter (|r| ≥ 0.29, P-value < 0.05). Seed size was not correlated with any root traits. The genetic variability identified in this research for root traits and penetration are critical for soybean improvement programs in choosing genotypes with improved root characteristics to increase yield in stressful or optimum environments."
https://openalex.org/W2814189118,"Infants who are breastfed are introduced to a variety of flavours from the maternal milk, and thus the transition from maternal milk to complementary foods may be easier for these children. The aim of this study was to investigate if duration of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with pickiness or dietary intake of vegetables, fruit, starchy foods or sugar sweetened beverages among obesity prone normal weight children aged 2–6 years. This cohort study was based on data from the Healthy Start primary intervention study, the Danish Medical Birth registry and the Danish Health Visitor’s Child Health Database. Infant feeding was registered by health nurses while home-visiting the mother and child up to four times within the first year. Information on eating behaviour and diet intake at age 2–6 years was obtained by parents. Crude and adjusted logistic and general linear regression models were used to investigate associations. A total of 236 children had complete information on all variables. Data showed lower odds of picky eating behaviour when exclusively breastfed until age 4–5 months compared to exclusively breastfed for 0–1 months (OR = 0.35, 95CI = 0.16;0.76, p = 0.008). In the crude analysis only, exclusively breastfed until age 6–10 months was associated with a higher daily intake of vegetables (p = 0.04). This study suggests that exclusive breastfeeding duration seems to influence pickiness and may contribute to facilitate the consumption of more vegetables in later childhood in obesity prone normal weight children."
https://openalex.org/W2820382592,"PHR (PAM/Highwire/RPM-1) proteins are conserved RING E3 ubiquitin ligases that function in developmental processes, such as axon termination and synapse formation, as well as axon degeneration. At present, our understanding of how PHR proteins form ubiquitin ligase complexes remains incomplete. Although genetic studies indicate NMNAT2 is an important mediator of PHR protein function in axon degeneration, it remains unknown how PHR proteins inhibit NMNAT2. Here, we decipher the biochemical basis for how the human PHR protein PAM, also called MYCBP2, forms a noncanonical Skp/Cullin/F-box (SCF) complex that contains the F-box protein FBXO45 and SKP1 but lacks CUL1. We show FBXO45 does not simply function in substrate recognition but is important for assembly of the PAM/FBXO45/SKP1 complex. Interestingly, we demonstrate a novel role for SKP1 as an auxiliary component of the target recognition module that enhances binding of FBXO45 to NMNAT2. Finally, we provide biochemical evidence that PAM polyubiquitinates NMNAT2 and regulates NMNAT2 protein stability and degradation by the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2826617513,"Background The current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) into “mild”, “moderate”, or “severe” does not adequately account for the patient heterogeneity that still exists within each of these categories. The objective of this study was to identify “sub-groups” of mild TBI (mTBI) patients based on data available at the time of the initial post-TBI patient evaluation and to determine if the sub-grouping correlates with patient outcomes at 90 and 180 days post-TBI. Methods Data from patients in the TRACK-TBI Pilot dataset who had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 at arrival to the Emergency Department and a closed head injury were included. Considering 53 clinical variables that are typically available during the initial evaluation of the patient with mild TBI, sparse heirarchial clustering with cluster quality assessment was used to identify the optimal number of patient sub-groups. Patient sub-groups were then compared for ten outcomes measured at 90 or 180 days post-TBI. Results Amongst the 485 patients with mTBI, optimal clustering was based on the inclusion of 12 clinical variables that divided the patients into 5 mild TBI sub-groups. Clinical variables driving the sub-clustering included: gender, employment status, marital status, TBI due to falling, brain CT scan result, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, administration of IV fluids in the Emergency Department, alcohol use, tobacco use, history of neurologic disease, and history of psychiatric disease. These 5 mild TBI sub-groups differed in their 90 day and 180 day outcomes within several domains including global outcomes, persistence of TBI-related symptoms, and neuropsychological impairment. Conclusions Sub-groups of patients with mTBI can be identified according to clinical variables that are relatively easy to obtain at the time of initial patient evaluation. A patient’s sub-group assignment is associated with multidimensional patient outcomes at 90 and 180 days. These findings support the notion that there are clinically meaningful subgroups of patients amongst those currently classified as having mTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2871280861,"Multiple DNA damage response (DDR) pathways have evolved to sense the presence of damage and recruit the proper repair factors. We recently reported a signaling pathway induced upon alkylation damage to recruit the AlkB homolog 3, α-ketoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase (ALKBH3)–activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 3 (ASCC3) dealkylase–helicase repair complex. As in other DDR pathways, the recruitment of these repair factors is mediated through a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. However, the machinery that coordinates the proper assembly of this repair complex and controls its recruitment is still poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the ASCC1 accessory subunit is important for the regulation of ASCC complex function. ASCC1 interacts with the ASCC complex through the ASCC3 helicase subunit. We find that ASCC1 is present at nuclear speckle foci prior to damage, but leaves the foci in response to alkylation. Strikingly, ASCC1 loss significantly increases ASCC3 foci formation during alkylation damage, yet most of these foci lack ASCC2. These results suggest that ASCC1 coordinates the proper recruitment of the ASCC complex during alkylation, a function that appears to depend on a putative RNA-binding motif near the ASCC1 C terminus. Consistent with its role in alkylation damage signaling and repair, ASCC1 knockout through a CRISPR/Cas9 approach results in alkylation damage sensitivity in a manner epistatic with ASCC3.

It is important for the cell to coordinate the various alkylation repair pathways, as there is some redundancy in the substrate binding of the numerous repair factors. This overlap in substrate preference may lead to a potential conflict during initial lesion recognition and reduce the efficiency of repair. For example, alkyl-adenine glycosylase (AAG and N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase), which is involved in initiating BER, binds to the 3,N4-ethenocytosine (ϵC) lesion but cannot excise the base (14Gros L. Maksimenko A.V. Privezentzev C.V. Laval J. Saparbaev M.K. Hijacking of the human alkyl-N-purine-DNA glycosylase by 3,N4-ethenocytosine, a lipid peroxidation-induced DNA adduct.J. Biol.

Interestingly, ALKBH2 is capable of repairing ϵC but is inhibited by the presence of AAG (16Fu D. Samson L.D. Direct repair of 3,N(4)-ethenocytosine by the human ALKBH2 dioxygenase is blocked by the AAG/MPG glycosylase.DNA Repair. 2012; 11 (22079122): 46-5210.1016/j.dnarep.2011.10.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because of such competition, it is important for the cell to have a tightly controlled damage response to ensure that repair occurs in an efficient manner, while simultaneously preventing recruitment of inappropriate repair factors. To understand the interplay between these different repair mechanisms, it is first necessary to determine the regulation of the individual alkylation damage repair pathways. However, for alkylation damage repair, little is known about the regulation of repair factor recruitment in vivo. We and others previously found that the ALKBH3 demethylase associates with the Activation Signal Cointegrator Complex (ASCC, also known as ASC-1) (17Jung D.J. Sung H.S. Goo Y.W. Lee H.M. Park O.K.

ASCC is composed of three proteins: ASCC1, ASCC2, and ASCC3 (also known as p50, p100, and p200, respectively) (17Jung D.J. Sung H.S. Goo Y.W. Lee H.M. Park O.K. Jung S.Y. Lim J. Kim H.J. Lee S.K.

Biochemical characterization of this complex revealed that ASCC3 is a DNA helicase, whose unwinding activity is crucial for dealkylation by the ALKBH3 repair enzyme in vitro (18Dango S. Mosammaparast N. Sowa M.E. Xiong L.J. Wu F. Park K. Rubin M. Gygi S. Harper J.W. Shi Y. DNA unwinding by ASCC3 helicase is coupled to ALKBH3-dependent DNA alkylation repair and cancer cell proliferation.Mol.

It is thought that ASCC3 and ALKBH3 work in concert such that ASCC3 generates the single-stranded substrate needed for ALKBH3-mediated repair. Recently, we found that ASCC2 is important for the recruitment of the ALKBH3–ASCC3 complex to nuclear speckle foci specifically during alkylation damage (21Brickner J.R. Soll J.M. Lombardi P.M. Vågbo C.B. Mudge M.C. Oyeniran C. Rabe R. Jackson J. Sullender M.E. Blazosky E. Byrum A.K. Zhao Y. Corbett M.A. Gécz J.

This recruitment depends upon nonproteasomal Lys-63–linked ubiquitination by the E3 ligase RNF113A (21Brickner J.R. Soll J.M. Lombardi P.M. Vågbo C.B. Mudge M.C. Oyeniran C. Rabe R. Jackson J. Sullender M.E. Blazosky E. Byrum A.K. Zhao Y. Corbett M.A. Gécz J.

The ubiquitination is recognized by the ASCC2 subunit, which is responsible for the recruitment of both ASCC3 and ALKBH3 to sites of damage. Loss of ASCC2 results in increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, strongly suggesting that ASCC2-mediated recruitment is critical for efficient repair (21Brickner J.R. Soll J.M. Lombardi P.M. Vågbo C.B. Mudge M.C. Oyeniran C. Rabe R. Jackson J. Sullender M.E. Blazosky E. Byrum A.K. Zhao Y. Corbett M.A. Gécz J. Field M. et al.A ubiquitin-dependent signalling axis specific for ALKBH-mediated DNA dealkylation repair.Nature. 2017; 551 (29144457): 389-39310.1038/nature24484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize ASCC1, the smallest subunit of the ASCC complex. We find that ASCC1, unlike ASCC2 or ASCC3, is constitutively present at nuclear speckle foci, yet it is removed from these nuclear regions upon alkylation damage. As a result, ASCC1 is capable of modulating ASCC3 recruitment during alkylation damage. This behavior of ASCC1 depends upon its C-terminal RNA ligase-like domain. Together, our data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for the ALKBH3–ASCC repair pathway wherein ASCC1 modulates the localization and function of the complex components. We wished to determine what factors associated with the ASCC complex are involved in regulating its function in response to alkylation damage. To this end, we focused on ASCC1, a protein previously shown to copurify with ASCC2 and ASCC3 (17Jung D.J. Sung H.S. Goo Y.W. Lee H.M. Park O.K. Jung S.Y. Lim J. Kim H.J. Lee S.K. Kim T.S. Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Novel transcription coactivator complex containing activating signal cointegrator 1.Mol. Cell.

Harper J.W. Shi Y. DNA unwinding by ASCC3 helicase is coupled to ALKBH3-dependent DNA alkylation repair and cancer cell proliferation.Mol.

To determine how the individual complex components associate with one another, we performed immunoprecipitation of HA-ASCC1 and HA-ASCC2 (Fig. 1A). Both of these factors coimmunoprecipitated ASCC3 from 293T cells. Consistent with this, immunoprecipitation of endogenous ASCC3 from 293T cell extracts yielded ASCC1, suggesting that this physical interaction is present at the endogenous level (Fig. 1B). To test whether ASCC1 and ASCC3 interact directly, we purified all three components of the complex as recombinant proteins. His-tagged ASCC3 bound to immobilized GST-tagged ASCC1, as well as GST-ASCC2, but not GST alone (Fig. 1C). An N-terminal truncation of ASCC3 (NΔ-ASCC3; residues 401–2202) abrogated the interaction with ASCC2 but did not affect ASCC1 binding (Fig. 1C). Thus, both ASCC1 and ASCC2 can bind directly to ASCC3, but likely through distinct regions within ASCC3. Recombinant ASCC1 and ASCC2 did not interact with each other in pulldown assays (Fig. S1A), suggesting that ASCC3 serves as a scaffold between ASCC1 and ASCC2. To test this, we knocked out ASCC3 in PC-3 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. S1B). Immunoprecipitation of HA-ASCC1 from parental PC-3 cells yielded the other two components of the complex, but ASCC2 was not coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of ASCC3 (Fig. 1D). Thus, ASCC3 is required to bridge the interaction between ASCC1 and ASCC2 in vivo. As both ASCC2 and ASCC3 form nuclear foci specifically upon alkylation damage (21Brickner J.R. Soll J.M. Lombardi P.M. Vågbo C.B. Mudge M.C. Oyeniran C. Rabe R. Jackson J. Sullender M.E. Blazosky E. Byrum A.K. Zhao Y. Corbett M.A. Gécz J. Field M. et al.A ubiquitin-dependent signalling axis specific for ALKBH-mediated DNA dealkylation repair.Nature. 2017; 551 (29144457): 389-39310.1038/nature24484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and in light of the physical interactions between the complex components, we reasoned that ASCC1 may also form alkylation-induced foci (Fig. S1, C and D). However, HA-tagged ASCC1 formed foci that colocalized with the nuclear speckle component PRP8 in the absence of any damage (Fig. 1, E and F, and Fig. S1E). Surprisingly, treatment of the cells with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) significantly reduced ASCC1 colocalization with these nuclear domains in a time-dependent manner. This was not due to a reduction in the expression level of the tagged ASCC1 during MMS treatment (Fig. S1F). Taken together, these results suggest that ASCC1 is part of the ASCC complex but may perform a distinct function in response to alkylation damage. We next wished to determine the role of ASCC1 in ASCC3 foci formation. To this end, we knocked out ASCC1 in U2OS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. S2, A and B). Interestingly, loss of ASCC1 significantly increased MMS-induced ASCC3 foci formation (Fig. 2, A and B). This increase was apparent with two different knockout clones, making it unlikely that the induction of foci was due to an off-target effect of CRISPR/Cas9. These results were not attributable to an increase of ASCC3 foci at baseline (i.e. without MMS) in the ASCC1 KO cells (Fig. S2C). In time-course experiments, ASCC3 foci were still resolved in the absence of ASCC1 upon removal of MMS (Fig. S2C). These results suggested that ASCC1 modulates ASCC3 foci formation during alkylation damage. We next asked whether ASCC1 affects the colocalization of other components of the ASCC complex. Upon MMS treatment, nearly 75% of WT cells had colocalizing ASCC3 and HA-ASCC2 foci (Fig. 2, C and D). Under the same conditions, ASCC1 KOs had significantly fewer cells with colocalizing HA-ASCC2 and ASCC3 foci (42%). This was not due to a difference in the expression level of HA-ASCC2 in parental versus ASCC1 KO cells (Fig. S2D). This suggested that ASCC1 may function to promote colocalization of the other two components during alkylation damage. To test this biochemically, we immunoprecipitated endogenous ASCC2 in WT versus ASCC1 knockout PC-3 cells (Fig. S2E). Consistent with the diminished interaction observed by microscopy, less ASCC3 was coimmunoprecipitated with ASCC2 in ASCC1 knockout cells than in WT cells upon alkylation damage (Fig. 2E). Thus, ASCC1 appears to coordinate the proper recruitment of the complex components during alkylation. We reasoned that distinct domains within ASCC1 may be responsible for the interaction with ASCC3 and its removal from the nuclear speckle domains during damage. ASCC1 contains a KH domain adjacent to an unstructured region at its N terminus, as well as an RNA ligase-like C terminus, which has been postulated to be an RNA-binding domain (22Brown R.L.

We created deletion mutants of ASCC1 and tested their ability to associate with ASCC3 (Fig. 3A). Deletion of the N terminus of ASCC1 (ASCC1-NΔ; residues 54–357) abolished its binding to ASCC3, whereas deletion of the C terminus (ASCC1-CΔ; residues 1–243) had no effect on this interaction (Fig. 3, A and B). We then expressed the ASCC1-NΔ and ASCC1-CΔ constructs in ASCC1 knockout cells (Fig. S2, A and B) to prevent interference from any endogenous ASCC1. We analyzed their ability to retain localization within nuclear speckles upon MMS treatment. Strikingly, HA-ASCC1-CΔ maintained foci formation, whereas HA-ASCC1-NΔ behaved like WT ASCC1 (Fig. 3, C and D). This was not because ASCC1-CΔ was expressed at a higher level than WT ASCC1 or ASCC1-NΔ (Fig. S3A). Thus, modular domains within ASCC1 have distinct functions during the alkylation damage response. In analyzing the C-terminal RNA ligase-like domain of ASCC1, we noticed that it contains two conserved His-Xaa-Thr motifs, shown to be important for RNA or nucleotide binding in various proteins (25Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Related domains in yeast tRNA ligase, bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase, and mammalian myelin 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase revealed by amino acid sequence comparison.FEBS Lett. 1990; 268 (2166684): 231-23410.1016/0014-5793(90)81015-GCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Examples of other proteins containing this motif in their nucleotide-binding pocket include the 2′–5′ RNA ligases from Thermus thermophilus and Pyrococcus horikoshii, as well as the AMP-binding protein AKAP18 (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3B) (25Koonin E.V.

Previous structural studies suggest that these HXT motifs line the substrate-binding pocket and interact with the nucleotide through a pseudo 2-fold symmetry (27Gold M.G. Smith F.D. Scott J.D. Barford D. AKAP18 contains a phosphoesterase domain that binds AMP.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375 (18082768): 1329-134310.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.037Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We modeled this domain within ASCC1 using the Phyre2 server (28Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 (19247286): 363-37110.1038/nprot.2009.2Crossref PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar, 29Kelley L.A. Mezulis S. Yates C.M. Wass M.N. Sternberg M.J.

The resulting structural analysis suggested that it forms a similar overall structure to other members of the 2H phosphoesterase family (Fig. 4B) (30Silverman R.H. Weiss S.R. Viral phosphodiesterases that antagonize double-stranded RNA signaling to RNase L by degrading 2–5A.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2014; 34 (24905202): 455-46310.1089/jir.2014.0007Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the predicted structure suggests that the conserved HXT motifs of ASCC1 are positioned such that they also line a putative nucleotide- or RNA-binding pocket similar to the aforementioned RNA ligases and AKAP18. Notably, the ASCC1 domain lacks residues critical for ligase activity (Fig. S3C) (31Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (11058099): 4051-405810.1093/nar/28.21.4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We then mutated both of the HXT motifs of ASCC1 to AXA (ASCC1-AXA: 179HLT → 179ALA and 277HAT → 277AAA) and analyzed its localization during MMS damage. As with ASCC1-CΔ, ASCC1-AXA retained foci under these conditions (Fig. 4, C and D, Fig. S3, D–F). This indicates that the HXT motifs of ASCC1 play a role in its localization during alkylation damage. Because the C terminus of ASCC1 appeared to be critical for regulating its ability to form foci, we asked whether the RNA ligase-like domain played a role in foci formation of other complex components during alkylation damage. To address this question, we rescued ASCC1 knockout cells by expressing exogenous ASCC1 WT, ASCC1-CΔ, or ASCC1-AXA (Fig. S3G). Although the WT ASCC1 partially rescued HA-ASCC2/ASCC3 foci colocalization, neither ASCC1-CΔ nor ASCC1-AXA was able to rescue this phenotype (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, this putative RNA ligase-like domain of ASCC1 plays an important role in the regulation of the ASCC complex localization upon alkylation damage. The previous results suggested that ASCC1 may play a key role in modulating ASCC recruitment during alkylation damage. We then tested whether ASCC1 was functionally important for alkylation damage resistance in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. ASCC1 was knocked out in these cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. S2E). Loss of ASCC1 resulted in an increase in sensitivity to MMS in these cells (Fig. 5A). Again, the increase in sensitivity was observed with two distinct ASCC1 knockout clones. To determine whether this decrease in cell survival in response to MMS was due to the function of ASCC1 within the ASCC complex, or whether this was due to its function in another pathway, we created ASCC1–ASCC3 double knockout cells (ASCC1/3 DKO). We sequentially knocked out ASCC3 in PC-3 cells and then knocked out ASCC1 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figs. S1B and S4, A and B). MMS sensitivity of all four resulting genotypes was then tested. Consistent with our previous work, loss of ASCC3 increased sensitivity to MMS (18Dango S. Mosammaparast N. Sowa M.E. Xiong L.J. Wu F. Park K. Rubin M. Gygi S. Harper J.W. Shi Y. DNA unwinding by ASCC3 helicase is coupled to ALKBH3-dependent DNA alkylation repair and cancer cell proliferation.Mol.

However, the ASCC1/3 DKO cells did not have an increase in MMS sensitivity compared with either the ASCC1 KO or the ASCC3 KO cells (Fig. 5B). These results support the notion that ASCC1 has an epistatic relationship with ASCC3 in alkylation damage resistance. Taken t"

Intra-dialytic cycling is beneficial, but comorbidity and fatigue can prevent this type of training. Low–frequency electrical muscle stimulation (LF-EMS) of the quadriceps and hamstrings elicits a cardiovascular training stimulus and may be a suitable alternative. The main objectives of this trial were to assess the feasibility and efficacy of intra-dialytic LF-EMS vs. cycling Design, setting, participants, and measurements Assessor blind, parallel group, randomized controlled pilot study with sixty-four stable patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Participants were randomized to 10 weeks of 1) intra-dialytic cycling, 2) intra-dialytic LF-EMS, or 3) non-exercise control. Exercise was performed for up to one hour three times per week. Cycling workload was set at 40–60% oxygen uptake (VO2) reserve, and LF-EMS at maximum tolerable intensity. The control group did not complete any intra-dialytic exercise. Feasibility of intra-dialytic LF-EMS and cycling was the primary outcome, assessed by monitoring recruitment, retention and tolerability. At baseline and 10 weeks, secondary outcomes including cardio-respiratory reserve, muscle strength, and cardio-arterial structure and function were assessed. Results Fifty-one (of 64 randomized) participants completed the study (LF-EMS = 17 [77%], cycling = 16 [80%], control = 18 [82%]). Intra-dialytic LF-EMS and cycling were feasible and well tolerated (9% and 5% intolerance respectively, P = 0.9). At 10-weeks, cardio-respiratory reserve (VO2 peak) (Difference vs. control: LF-EMS +2.0 [95% CI, 0.3 to 3.7] ml.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.02, and cycling +3.0 [95% CI, 1.2 to 4.7] ml.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.001) and leg strength (Difference vs. control: LF-EMS, +94 [95% CI, 35.6 to 152.3] N, P = 0.002 and cycling, +65.1 [95% CI, 6.4 to 123.8] N, P = 0.002) were improved. Arterial structure and function were unaffected. Conclusions Ten weeks of intra-dialytic LF-EMS or cycling improved cardio-respiratory reserve and muscular strength. For patients who are unable or unwilling to cycle during dialysis, LF-EMS is a feasible alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2871249511,"Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have previously reported that DNA from this virus enhances production of the pro-autoimmune interleukin 17A (IL-17A) in mice. In this study we assessed the effect of EBV DNA on regulatory T cell programming and examined whether it mediated its effects via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in mice; moreover, we evaluated whether EBV DNA in humans had similar effects to those seen in mice. For this purpose, we assessed the linearity of the correlation between EBV DNA and IL-17A levels in RA subjects and matched controls. A modulatory effect for the viral DNA was observed for regulatory T cell markers with an inhibitory effect observed for CTLA4 expression in the EBV DNA-treated mice. To examine whether TLR9 mediated the detection of EBV DNA and enhancement of IL-17A production, mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the DNA in the presence or absence of the TLR9 inhibitor ODN 2088. Subsequently, IL-17A production from these cells was assessed. Treatment with the TLR9 inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease in IL-17A production indicating that TLR9 is involved in this pathway. In human subjects, examining the linearity of the correlation between EBV DNA and IL-17A levels in RA subjects showed a propensity for linearity that was not observed in controls. Our data thus indicates that EBV DNA itself acts as a modulator of the Th17 compartment as well as that of regulatory T cell mechanisms. The involvement of TLR9 in the EBV DNA-triggered induction of IL-17A suggests therapeutic targeting of this endosomal receptor in EBV positive subjects with an autoimmune flare-up or possibly for prophylactic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2879458741,"Marijuana use is increasing worldwide, and it is ever more likely that patients presenting with acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) will be marijuana users. However, little is known about the impact of marijuana use on short-term outcomes following AMI. Accordingly, we compared in-hospital outcomes of AMI patients with reported marijuana use to those with no reported marijuana use. We hypothesized that marijuana use would be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in AMI patients. Hospital records from 8 states between 1994-2013 were screened for patients with a diagnosis of AMI. Clinical profiles and outcomes in patients with reported use of marijuana were compared to patients without reported marijuana use. Short-term outcomes were defined as adverse events that occurred during hospitalization for an admitting diagnosis of AMI. The composite primary outcome included death, intraaortic balloon pump placement, (IABP), mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, and shock. In total, 3,854 of 1,273,897 AMI patients reported use of marijuana. The marijuana cohort was younger than (47.2 vs. 57.2, respectively) and had less coronary artery disease than the non-marijuana cohort. In multivariable analysis including age, race and common cardiac risk factors, there was no association between marijuana use and the primary outcome (p = 0.53), but marijuana users were more likely to be placed on mechanical ventilation (OR (odds ratio) 1.19, p = 0.004). Interestingly, marijuana-using patients were significantly less likely to die (OR 0.79, p = 0.016), experience shock (OR 0.74, p = 0.001), or require an IABP (OR 0.80, p = 0.03) post AMI than patients with no reported marijuana use. These results suggest that, contrary to our hypothesis, marijuana use was not associated with increased risk of adverse short-term outcomes following AMI. Furthermore, marijuana use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality post-AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2824282603,"Assessing the predictive value of different social media platforms is important to understand the variation in how users reveal themselves across multiple platforms. Most social media platforms allow users to interact in multiple ways: by posting content to the platform, liking others’ posts, or building a user profile. While prior studies offer insights into how language use differs across platforms, differences in image usage is less well understood. In this study, we analyzed variation in image content with user personality across three interaction types (posts, likes and profile images) and two platforms, using a unique data set of users who are active on both Twitter and Flickr. Usage patterns on these two social media platforms revealed different aspects of users’ personality. Cross-platform data fusion is thus shown to improve personality prediction performance."
https://openalex.org/W2834221712,"Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been rapidly scaled up in Ethiopia since 2005, but factors influencing the outcome are poorly studied. We therefore analysed baseline predictors of first-line ART outcome after 6 and 12 months. Material and methods 874 HIV-infected patients, who started first-line ART, were enrolled in a countrywide prospective cohort. Two outcomes were defined: i) treatment failure: detectable viremia or lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) (confirmed death, moved from study sites or similar reasons); ii) LTFU only. Using stepwise logistic regression, four multivariable models identified baseline predictors for odds of treatment failure and LTFU. Results The treatment failure rates were 23.3% and 33.9% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Opportunistic infections (OI), tuberculosis (TB), CD4 cells <50/μl, and viral load >5 log10 copies/ml increased the odds of treatment failure both at 6 and 12 months. The odds of LTFU at month 6 increased with baseline functional disabilities, WHO stage III/IV, and CD4 cells <50/μl. TB also increased the odds at month 12. Importantly, ART outcome differed across hospitals. Compared to the national hospital in Addis Ababa, patients from most regional sites had higher odds of treatment failure and/or LTFU at month 6 and/or 12, with the exception of one clinic (Jimma), which had lower odds of failure at month 6. Conclusions In this first countrywide Ethiopian HIV cohort, a high ART failure rate was identified, to the largest extent due to LTFU, including death. The geographical region where the patients were treated was a strong baseline predictor of ART failure. The difference in ART outcome across hospitals calls the need for provision of more national support at regional level."
https://openalex.org/W2836171385,"Behavioural phenotyping of model organisms is widely used to investigate fundamental aspects of organism biology, from the functioning of the nervous system to the effects of genetic mutations, as well as for screening new drug compounds. However, our capacity to observe and quantify the full range and complexity of behavioural responses is limited by the inability of conventional microscopy techniques to capture volumetric image information at sufficient speed. In this article we describe how combining light field microscopy with computational depth estimation provides a new method for fast, quantitative assessment of 3D posture and movement of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We apply this technique to compare the behaviour of cuticle collagen mutants, finding significant differences in 3D posture and locomotion. We demonstrate the ability of quantitative light field microscopy to provide new fundamental insights into C. elegans locomotion by analysing the 3D postural modes of a freely swimming worm. Finally, we consider relative merits of the method and its broader application for phenotypic imaging of other organisms and for other volumetric bioimaging applications."

Allosteric regulators, such as the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as mutations in the EGF receptor itself, shift the conformational equilibrium among the active and inactive species, leading to changes in EGF receptor-binding affinity. Our studies also reveal unexpected positive cooperativity between EGF receptor subunits in dimers formed in the presence of type II inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2838986250,"At times when rhinoceros are fiercely poached, when some rhinoceros species are closer than ever to extinction, and when the scientific community is in debate over the use of advanced cell technologies as a remaining resort it is time to simplify and improve existing assisted reproduction techniques to enhance breeding and genetic diversity in the living populations under our care. Semen cryopreservation has been performed in all captive rhinoceros species with limited degree of success. Here we tested three freezing extenders, containing different cryoprotectants and various freezing rates for the cryopreservation of rhinoceros sperm from 14 bulls. In experiment I, semen from 9 bulls was used to determine the most suitable diluent, cryoprotectant and freezing rate for the successful cryopreservation of rhinoceros sperm. In experiment II, semen from 5 bulls was used to assess whether the removal of seminal plasma could further improve post thaw sperm quality following cryopreservation with conditions identified in Experiment I. Semen was diluted with Berliner Cryomedia, ButoCrio® or INRA Freeze®, packaged in 0.5 mL straws and frozen 3, 4, and 5 cm over liquid nitrogen (LN) vapour or directly in a dryshipper. It was found that semen extended with ButoCrio® (containing glycerol and methylformamide) and frozen 3cm over LN vapour provided the best protection to rhinoceros spermatozoa during cryopreservation. When pooled over treatments, total and progressive post thaw motility was 75.3 ± 4.2% and 68.5 ± 5.7%, respectively marking a new benchmark for the cryopreservation of rhinoceros sperm. Post thaw total and progressive motility, viability and acrosome integrity of semen diluted in ButoCrio® was significantly higher than semen extended in Berliner Cryomedia or INRA Freeze®. The removal of seminal plasma did not improve post thaw sperm survival (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the cryosurvival of rhinoceros spermatozoa was significantly improved when using a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide in combination with a fast freezing rate at 3 cm. These results describe a new protocol for the improved cryosurvival of rhinoceros spermatozoa and will enable a more successful preservation of genetic diversity between males, especially in donors whose spermatozoa may already be compromised prior to or during collection. The successful reduction of glycerol concentration in favour of methylformamide as a cryoprotectant could be a novel suggestion for the improvement of cryopreservation techniques in other wildlife species."
https://openalex.org/W2873018345,"The aim of the present study was to establish the influence of high-temperature heating on the composition and thermal behavior of coffee oils obtained from Arabica green and roasted coffee beans, respectively. Morphological studies performed using scanning electron microscopy revealed the oil bodies uniformly distributed within the cells in both types of coffee beans analyzed. The obtained oils have a fatty acid composition rich in linoleic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid and linolenic acid. The total content of saturated fatty acids of investigated oils was 49.38 and 46.55%, the others being unsaturated fatty acids. The thermal behavior and thermo-oxidative stability of coffee oils extracted from green coffee beans and roasted coffee beans, the coffee oil high-temperature heated up to 200 °C, were investigated using simultaneous thermal analysis TG/DTG/DTA, in an oxidizing atmosphere. The data obtained for the analyzed samples depend mainly on the nature and compositions of fatty acids, and to a lesser extent on the roasting process of the coffee beans and the high-temperature heating process of the extracted oil. The chromatographic and TG/DTG/DTA data suggest that Arabica coffee oil has great potential for use in technological processes which require high-temperature heating (e.g. food industry or pastries)."
https://openalex.org/W2812500545,"A recent study investigating the top 10 100-km ultra-marathoners by nationality showed that Japanese runners were the fastest worldwide. This selection to top athletes may lead to a selection bias and the aim of this study was to investigate from where the fastest 100-km ultra-marathoners originate by considering all finishers in 100-km ultra-marathons since 1959.We analysed data from 150,710 athletes who finished a 100-km ultra-marathon between 1959 and 2016. To get precise estimates and stable density plots we selected only those nationalities with 900 and more finishes resulting in 24 nationalities. Histograms and density plots were performed to study the distribution of race time. Crude mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range (IQR), mode, skewness and excess of time for each nationality were computed. A linear regression analysis adjusted by sex, age and year was performed to study the race time between the nationalities. Histograms, density and scatter plots showed that some races seemed to have a time limit of 14 hours. From the complete dataset the finishes with more than 14 hours were removed (truncated dataset) and the same descriptive plots and analysis as for the complete dataset were performed again. In addition to the linear regression a truncated regression was performed with the truncated dataset to allow conclusion for the whole sample. To study a potential difference between races at home and races abroad, an interaction term race site home/abroad with nationality was included in the model.Most of the finishes were achieved by runners from Japan, Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy and USA with more than 260'000 (85%) finishes. Runners from Russia and Hungary were the fastest and runners from Hong Kong and China were the slowest finishers.In contrast to existing findings investigating the top 10 by nationality, this analysis showed that ultra-marathoners from Russia, not Japan, were the fastest 100-km ultra-marathoners worldwide when considering all races held since 1959."
https://openalex.org/W2813743998,"In the tumor progression, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis as well as metastasis. It is known that high plasma level of TGFβ1 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is correlated with poor prognostics. In addition, the generation of cancer stem-like cells is associated with metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor recurrence, which also lead to poor outcomes in NSCLC patients. However, it remains unclear how TGFβ1 promotes NSCLC cells to acquire stem-like properties and accelerate tumor metastasis. In our study, we found that short term TGFβ1 treatment resulted in a significant epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) morphological change in TGFβ1–sensitive NSCLC cells but not in insensitive cells. Western blotting confirmed increased Vimentin and reduced E-Cadherin protein expression after TGFβ1 treatment in A549, NCI-H1993, and NCI-H358 cells. TGFβ1 incubation dramatically decreased in vitro cell proliferation and increased cell invasion in TGFβ1–sensitive NSCLC cells but not in NCI-H1975, NCI-H1650, and HCC827 cells. Moreover, TGFβ1 was able to enhance the mRNA expression of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 and drastically increased anchorage-independent colony formation in TGFβ1–sensitive NSCLC cells, suggesting the acquisition of cancer stem-like properties. Interestingly, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) mRNA expression was significantly elevated in TGFβ1–sensitive NSCLC cells compared to insensitive cells. And TGFβ1 was capable of inducing VEGF-C gene expression. Pharmacological blocking TGFβ type I receptor kinase (ALK5) significantly inhibited TGFβ1-induced VEGF-C expression. Silencing of ALK5 by siRNA also dramatically reduced TGFβ1-induced VEGF-C expression in TGFβ1–sensitive NSCLC cells. Therefore, TGFβ1 contributes for NSCLC metastasis through promoting EMT, generation of high invasive cancer cells with stem-like properties, and increasing VEGF-C expression. Blocking TGFβ pathway is a potential therapeutic target in human non-small cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2824436161,"Research suggests that cognitive conflict is accompanied by a negative signal. Building on the demonstrated role of negative affect in attitude formation and change, the present research investigated whether the experience of cognitive conflict negatively influences subsequent evaluations of neutral stimuli. Relying on the emergence of conflict in the Stroop task, participants were presented with compatible (non-conflict) and incompatible (conflict) Stroop color words that were each followed by a neutral visual stimulus. In general, participants liked stimuli following incompatible Stroop words less than stimuli following compatible Stroop words. The results revealed similar compatibility effects in tasks in which participants actively responded to the Stroop words and in tasks in which they passively observed them. Furthermore, these effects emerged in offline and online measures of evaluation. Interestingly, the results also suggest that the compatibility effect on liking observed in the present research was to some degree driven by the positivity associated with the compatible Stroop words, and not just by the negativity associated with the incompatible Stroop words. We discuss the present findings in the context of how and when conflicting responses to events (such as in the Stroop task) can influence evaluations of stimuli associated with the conflicting events."
https://openalex.org/W2861666812,"AIDS is a worrying public health issue in China and lacks timely and effective surveillance. With the diffusion and adoption of the Internet, the 'big data' aggregated from Internet search engines, which contain users' information on the concern or reality of their health status, provide a new opportunity for AIDS surveillance. This paper uses search engine data to monitor and forecast AIDS in China.A machine learning method, artificial neural networks (ANNs), is used to forecast AIDS incidences and deaths. Search trend data related to AIDS from the largest Chinese search engine, Baidu.com, are collected and selected as the input variables of ANNs, and officially reported actual AIDS incidences and deaths are used as the output variable. Three criteria, the mean absolute percentage error, the root mean squared percentage error, and the index of agreement, are used to test the forecasting performance of the ANN method.Based on the monthly time series data from January 2011 to June 2017, this article finds that, under the three criteria, the ANN method can lead to satisfactory forecasting of AIDS incidences and deaths, regardless of the change in the number of search queries.Despite the inability to self-detect HIV/AIDS through online searching, Internet-based data should be adopted as a timely, cost-effective complement to a traditional AIDS surveillance system."

However, its use in elite distance runners, and its potential effects on biomechanical aspects of running have not been properly investigated. This study aims to analyze the potential effects of 15 days of beetroot juice supplementation on physiological, psychological and biomechanical variables in elite runners.Twelve elite middle and long-distance runners (age = 26.3 ± 5.1yrs, VO2Max = 71.8±5.2 ml*kg-1*min-1) completed an incremental running test to exhaustion on a treadmill before and after a 15-days supplementation period, in which half of the group (EG) consumed a daily nitrate-rich beetroot juice and the other group (PG) consumed a placebo drink. Time to exhaustion (TEx), running economy, vastus lateralis oxygen saturation (SmO2), leg stiffness and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured at 15, 17.1 and 20 km/h during the incremental test.Likely to very likely improvements in EG were observed for the RPE (Standardized mean difference (SMD) = -2.17, 90%CI = -3.23, -1.1), SmO2 (SMD = 0.72, 90%CI = 0.03, 1.41) and TEx (SMD = 1.18, 90%CI = -0.14, 2.5) in comparison with PG.

https://openalex.org/W2868627764,"Reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) is a major feature of endothelial dysfunction characteristic of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases but the short half-life of NO precludes its easy quantification in circulating blood for early diagnosis. In erythrocytes, NO can react with hemoglobin to form an iron-nitrosyl complex (5-coordinate-α-HbNO) directly quantifiable by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy (EPR) in mouse, rat and human venous blood ex vivo. However, the sources of the nitrosylating species in vivo and optimal conditions of HbNO preservation for diagnostic use in human erythrocytes are unknown. Using EPR spectroscopy, we found that HbNO stability was significantly higher under hypoxia (equivalent to venous pO2; 12.0±0.2% degradation of HbNO at 30 minutes) than at room air (47.7±0.2% degradation) in intact erythrocytes; at 20°C (15.2±0.3% degradation after 30 min versus 29.6±0.1% at 37°C) and under acidic pH (31.7±0.8% versus 62.2±0.4% degradation after 30 min at physiological pH) at 50% of haematocrit. We next examined the relative contribution of NO synthase (NOS) from the vasculature or in erythrocytes themselves as a source of nitrosylating NO. We detected a NOS activity (and eNOS expression) in human red blood cells (RBC), and in RBCs from eNOS(+/+) (but not eNOS(-/-)) mice, as measured by HbNO formation and nitrite/nitrate accumulation. NO formation was increased after inhibition of arginase but abrogated upon NOS inhibition in human RBC and in RBCs from eNOS(+/+) (but not eNOS(-/-)) mice. However, the HbNO signal from freshly drawn venous RBCs was minimally sensitive to the inhibitors ex vivo, while it was enhanced upon caveolin-1 deletion in vivo, suggesting a minor contribution of erythrocyte NOS to HbNO complex formation compared with vascular endothelial NOS or other paracrine NO sources. We conclude that HbNO formation in rodent and human venous erythrocytes is mainly influenced by vascular NO sources despite the erythrocyte NOS activity, so that its measurement by EPR could serve as a surrogate for NO-dependent endothelial function."
https://openalex.org/W2835609732,"ATP is the native agonist for cell-surface ligand-gated P2X receptor (P2XR) cation channels. The seven mammalian subunits (P2X1-7) form homo- and heterotrimeric P2XRs having significant physiological and pathophysiological roles. Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS) is an effective antagonist at most mammalian P2XRs. Lys-249 in the extracellular domain of P2XR has previously been shown to contribute to PPADS action. To map this antagonist site, we generated human P2X1R cysteine substitutions within a circle centered at Lys-249 (with a radius of 13 Å equal to the length of PPADS). We hypothesized that cysteine substitutions of residues involved in PPADS binding would (i) reduce cysteine accessibility (measured by MTSEA-biotinylation), (ii) exhibit altered PPADS affinity, and (iii) quench the fluorescence of cysteine residues modified with MTS-TAMRA. Of the 26 residues tested, these criteria were met by only four (Lys-70, Asp-170, Lys-190, and Lys-249), defining the antagonist site, validating molecular docking results, and thereby providing the first experimentally supported model of PPADS binding. This binding site overlapped with the ATP-binding site, indicating that PPADS sterically blocks agonist access. Moreover, PPADS induced a conformational change at the cysteine-rich head (CRH) region adjacent to the orthosteric ATP-binding pocket. The importance of this movement was confirmed by demonstrating that substitution introducing positive charge present in the CRH of the hP2X1R causes PPADS sensitivity at the normally insensitive rat P2X4R. This study provides a template for developing P2XR subtype selectivity based on the differences among the mammalian subunits around the orthosteric P2XR-binding site and the CRH."
https://openalex.org/W2860921110,"Objective The purpose of our study was to assess computed tomographic (CT) findings of adnexal torsion through a matched case-control analysis. Materials and methods This retrospective, single-institution case-control study included 43 women with adnexal torsion and 43 age- and ovarian mass-matched control women. CT images were evaluated independently by two readers for the following: prominent peripheral follicles, uterine deviation, thickened pedicles, a whirl sign, and a navel sign. Comparisons of CT findings were performed using the Chi square test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained to assess the diagnostic performance. Differences between the areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were compared by using a Delong test. Results The CT findings significant for adnexal torsion were uterine deviation toward the side of the affected ovary (P = < .01 for reader 1 and P = .02 for reader 2) and thickened pedicles with ancillary findings including a whirl sign, a navel sign, and uterine deviation facing thickened pedicles (P < .01 for both readers). Thickened pedicles with ancillary findings had the highest diagnostic accuracy, as measured with ROC curves (AUC, 0.86 in reader 1 and 0.85 in reader 2). Combining uterine deviation toward the side of the affected ovary with thickened pedicles with ancillary findings did not increase the performance relative to that of thickened pedicles with ancillary findings alone. Conclusions Thickened pedicles with ancillary findings including a whirl sign, a navel sign, and uterine deviation facing thickened pedicles could be helpful for the diagnosis of adnexal torsion."
https://openalex.org/W2862552137,"Synapse associated protein of 97KDa (SAP97) belongs to a family of scaffolding proteins, the membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs), that are highly enriched in the postsynaptic density of synapses and play an important role in organizing protein complexes necessary for synaptic development and plasticity. The Dlg-MAGUK family of proteins are structurally very similar, and an effort has been made to parse apart the unique function of each Dlg-MAGUK protein by characterization of knockout mice. Knockout mice have been generated and characterized for PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP102, however SAP97 knockout mice have been impossible to study because the SAP97 null mice die soon after birth due to a craniofacial defect. We studied the transcriptomic and behavioral consequences of a brain-specific conditional knockout of SAP97 (SAP97-cKO). RNA sequencing from hippocampi from control and SAP97-cKO male animals identified 67 SAP97 regulated transcripts. As large-scale genetic studies have implicated MAGUKs in neuropsychiatric disorders such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (SCZ), we analyzed our differentially expressed gene (DEG) set for enrichment of disease risk-associated genes, and found our DEG set to be specifically enriched for SCZ-related genes. Subjecting SAP97-cKO mice to a battery of behavioral tests revealed a subtle male-specific cognitive deficit and female-specific motor deficit, while other behaviors were largely unaffected. These data suggest that loss of SAP97 may have a modest contribution to organismal behavior. The SAP97-cKO mouse serves as a stepping stone for understanding the unique role of SAP97 in biology."
https://openalex.org/W2869746051,"In agricultural landscapes, semi-natural habitats are scarce and remaining habitat patches are largely isolated. However, linear landscape elements might facilitate dispersal of plant species through the agricultural landscape matrix. We investigated the following research questions: 1. are open linear landscape elements (LLE) effective corridors for dispersal of vascular plant species? 2. Which plant species, with respect to phytosociological group and dispersal-distance class, do use LLE as corridors? 3. To which extent is floristic similarity of communities influenced by dispersal through corridors? Field work was carried out in agricultural landscapes of Northwest Germany. We sampled 50 vegetation relevés on open linear landscape elements i.e. field margins (incl. road verges) and ditches, in eight 1-km2 study areas. Then, we calculated Jaccard similarities of all plot pairs within study areas using either all species or only species of certain phytosociological groups or dispersal-distance classes. We assessed the isolation of the plots from each other using both Euclidean distance and resistance distance along LLE. Resistance distance reflected the degree of connectivity of the LLE network between the plots. A stronger effect on Jaccard similarity of resistance distance compared to Euclidean distance would indicate corridor dispersal of plants through LLE. Relationships between Jaccard similarity and the two isolation measures were analysed with Generalised Linear Mixed Models. Resistance distance of LLE had a stronger negative effect on Jaccard similarity than Euclidean distance in field margins, but not in ditches. This was found for species of 'meadows and pastures' and short to medium dispersal distance. In plot pairs that were highly connected by LLE, the models suggested that roughly 20% of all species occurred in both plots due to dispersal through LLE. Other species groups did not respond more strongly to resistance distance than to Euclidean distance. We conclude that linear landscape elements in agricultural landscapes are effective corridors for dispersal of plant species that are confined to semi-natural habitats, such as traditional grasslands, and lack mechanisms of long-distance dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2850741354,"The aim of this experiment was to study the growth-promoting and adverse impact of athlete leaders’ competence–supportive and–thwarting behavior on the motivation and performance of team members. Male soccer players (N = 144; MAge = 14.2) were allocated to ad-hoc teams of five soccer players. These teams participated in two sessions, being randomly exposed to an athlete leader who acted either competence-supportive, competence-thwarting, or neutral during the second session. When the athlete leader was competence-supportive (versus competence-thwarting), his teammates’ intrinsic motivation and performance increased (versus decreased) compared with the control condition. The leader’s impact on intrinsic motivation was fully accounted for by team members’ competence satisfaction. These findings recommend coaches to invest in the competence-supportive power of their athlete leaders to establish an optimally motivating and performance-enhancing team environment."
https://openalex.org/W2862634411,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depends on cellular proteins, so-called cofactors, to complete its replication cycle. In search for new therapeutic targets we identified the DNA and RNA binding protein Y-box-binding Protein 1 (YB-1) as a cofactor supporting early and late steps of HIV replication. YB-1 depletion resulted in a 10-fold decrease in HIV-1 replication in different cell lines. Dissection of the replication defects revealed that knockdown of YB-1 is associated with a 2- to 5-fold decrease in virion production due to interference with the viral RNA metabolism. Using single-round virus infection experiments we demonstrated that early HIV-1 replication also depends on the cellular YB-1 levels. More precisely, using quantitative PCR and an in vivo nuclear import assay with fluorescently labeled viral particles, we showed that YB-1 knockdown leads to a block between reverse transcription and nuclear import of HIV-1. Interaction studies revealed that YB-1 associates with integrase, although a direct interaction with HIV integrase could not be unambiguously proven. In conclusion, our results indicate that YB-1 affects multiple stages of HIV replication. Future research on the interaction between YB-1 and the virus will reveal whether this protein qualifies as a new antiviral target."
https://openalex.org/W2859778880,"Dirofilaria immitis and Acanthocheilonema reconditum are common parasites in dogs but have also been reported parasitizing humans. The differential diagnosis and epidemiological evaluation of these zoonoses are important to the development of efficient public health policies and control strategies. The purpose of this study was to carry out an epidemiological survey by using molecular methods for the specific identification of filarid parasites of domestic dogs in the Marajó mesoregion, State of Pará (PA), Brazil. A total of 418 canine blood samples from Marajó mesoregion (Northern Brazil) were collected, submitted to DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with “pan filarial” primer, subsequent sequencing and sequence analysis using BLASTn software comparison with previously deposited sequences in GenBank. After that, a phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Parsimony was performed to aid the specific diagnosis. The obtained sequences showed the occurrence of 9 (2.15%) dogs infected with D. immitis and 30 (7.18%) by A. reconditum, with a confidence interval of 95%, there were no cases of co-infection. We observed that male dogs were more likely to D. immits and A. reconditum infection. However, age was not significant to both infections. This study reports for the first time the occurrence of A. reconditum in the northern region of Brazil and confirmed the presence of D. immitis in the Marajó mesoregion."
https://openalex.org/W2821046059,"Cities are arguably both the cause, and answer, to societies’ current sustainability issues. Urbanization is the interplay between a city’s physical growth and its socio-economic development, both of which consume a substantial amount of energy and resources. Knowledge of the underlying driver(s) of urban expansion facilitates not only academic research but, more importantly, bridges the gap between science, policy drafting, and practical urban management. An increasing number of researchers are recognizing the benefits of innovative remotely sensed datasets, such as nighttime lights data (NTL), as a proxy to map urbanization and subsequently examine the driving socio-economic variables in cities. We further these approaches, by taking a trans-pacific view, and examine how an array of socio-economic ind0icators of 25 culturally and economically important urban hubs relate to long term patterns in NTL for the past 21 years. We undertake a classic econometric approach—panel causality tests which allow analysis of the causal relationships between NTL and socio-economic development across the region. The panel causality test results show a contrasting effect of population and gross domestic product (GDP) on NTL in fast, and slowly, changing cities. Information derived from this study quantitatively chronicles urban activities in the pan-Pacific region and potentially offers data for studies that spatially track local progress of sustainable urban development goals."
https://openalex.org/W2857104901,"For patients with chronic lower respiratory disease, hypobaric hypoxia at a high altitude is considered a risk factor for mortality. However, the effects of residing at moderately high altitudes remain unclear. We investigated the association between moderate altitude and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality. In particular, we examined the lower 48 United States counties for age-adjusted chronic lower respiratory disease mortality rates, altitude, and socioeconomic factors, including tobacco use, per capita income, population density, sex ratio, unemployment, poverty, and education between 1979 and 1998. The socioeconomic factors were incorporated into the correlation analysis as potential covariates. Considerable positive (R = 0.235; P <0.001) and partial (R = 0.260; P <0.001) correlations were observed between altitude and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality rate. In the subgroup with high COPD prevalence subgroup, even stronger positive (R = 0.346; P <0.001) and partial (R = 0.423, P <0.001) correlations were observed. Multivariate regression analysis of all available socioeconomic factors revealed that additional knowledge on altitude improved the adjusted R2 values from 0.128 to 0.186 for all counties and from 0.301 to 0.421 for counties with high COPD prevalence. We concluded that in the lower 48 United States counties, even a moderate altitude may pose considerable risks in patients with chronic lower respiratory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2827556686,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a group of rare cells that play an important role in the repair of injured vascular endothelial cells and assist in reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Decreased production and/or loss of function of EPCs are associated with diabetic vasculopathy. The molecular mechanisms by which diabetes impairs EPCs remain unclear. We conducted microarray experiments followed by integrative regulatory analysis on cells isolated from Akita diabetic mice (18-weeks after onset of diabetes) and age-matched non-diabetic controls. Two types of cells were isolated from mice bone marrow; Lin+ cells and Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs. RNA was hybridized to mouse WG-6 V2 beadchips followed by comprehensive gene network analysis and computational validation of the obtained results. In total, 80 genes were exclusively DE between non-diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs and diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs, of which the 3 genes Clcnka, Pik3c2a, and Ptf1a are known to be associated with diabetic complications. Further analysis led to the establishment of a TF-miRNA mediated regulatory network specific to diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs and to identify 11 central-hub TFs (Tbp, Ahr, Trp53, Gata1, Foxo1, Foxo4, Yy1, Max, Pparg, Myc, Cebpa), and 2 miRNAs (mir-139-5p, mir-709) that might act as putative genomic drivers of diabetic pathogenesis in Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs. Moreover, we identified multiple TF-miRNA co-regulatory network motifs for which we validated their contribution to diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs in terms of statistical significance and relevance to biological evidence. Our findings suggest that diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs have specifically altered signature genes and miRNAs that render their capacity to proliferate and differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W2813689736,"The first integrative approach using sequences of two genes (18S and 28S rRNA) plus morphological and life history traits, was explored in Pharyngodonidae nematodes parasitic in reptiles. Additionally, first genetic characterization of Parapharyngodon bainae and new data on its morphology are given. This approach evaluated the phylogenetic relationships among genera within Pharyngodonidae, as well as the importance of their diagnostic morphological features. Specimens of P. bainae were collected from faecal pellets of the lizard Tropidurus torquatus in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Nematodes were fixed for scanning electron microscopy and molecular procedures. Morphological observations revealed the accurate structures of cephalic end, of cloacal region in males, of vulva and eggs. Phylogenetic reconstructions were based upon four datasets: aligned sequences of the 18S, of the 28S, of both concatenated genes and of combined morphological and molecular datasets. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood were performed to infer the phylogenies of molecular datasets and maximum parsimony to infer that of all-combined data. Pharyngodonid parasites of reptiles seem to configure two general monophyletic lineages, as previously assertions. Results also showed the monophyly of Spauligodon, Skrjabinodon and Parapharyngodon, as well as the clear separation between the latter and Thelandros. Combination of datasets improved nodal supports. Analysis of the all-combined datasets revealed the importance of vulval position and egg morphology as phylogenetic informative traits. However, characters of male caudal morphology appear as are highly homoplastic, and seem to be product of convergent evolution or multiple losses of ancestral traits. The closely-related Thelandros and Parapharyngodon are kept valid and their diagnosis should be based upon the position of the operculum in eggs (terminal or subterminal, respectively). Some inconsistencies in the scarce molecular and morphological databases were noted. Thus, new genetic data is required for further conclusions and current database must be evaluated with attention."
https://openalex.org/W2832659251,"Living donor kidneys with two arteries can be revascularized using various techniques depending on anatomy. We hypothesized that the revascularization technique could impact long-term outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 1714 living donor renal transplants at our institution between 1999 and 2015. Three hundred and eleven kidneys had dual arteries, and these were categorized into 5 groups; end-to-side (n = 18), inferior epigastric artery (n = 21), direct anastomosis (n = 65), side-to-side (n = 126) and ligated (n = 81). We then compared the outcomes with that of a control group (single artery, n = 1403) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Cox regression was adjusted by age, sex and race/ethnicity of donor and recipient, side of kidney, transplant period and recipient surgeon. Compared to the control group, the end-to-side group had increased all-cause graft loss (10 years: 77.2% vs 24.5%, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–7.03, p = 0.010) and death-censored graft loss (10 years: 82.0% vs 55.9%, aHR 4.17, 95% CI 1.63–10.68, p = 0.003), whereas the other groups did not. Our study shows that 10-year overall survival and death-censored graft survival were significantly worse for end-to-side arterial reconstruction than for other techniques. Alternative techniques to the end-to-side method should be used for accessory arteries that require revascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2874957825,"Glycome modulations have been described in the onset and progression of many diseases. Thus, many studies have proposed glycans from blood glycoproteins as disease markers. Astonishingly, little effort has been given unraveling preanalytical conditions potentially influencing glycan analysis prior to blood biomarker studies. In this work, we evaluate for the first time the effect of hemolysis, storage and blood collection, but also influence of various times and temperatures between individual processing steps on the total N-glycome and on a glycan-biomarker score. Venous blood was collected from 10 healthy donors in 11 blood collection tubes with different additives, processed variously to obtain 16 preanalytical variables and N-glycans released from serum or plasma were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and capillary electrophoresis coupled with fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) for the first time. Long time storage of deep frozen samples at -20°C or -80°C exerted only a minor influence on the glycome as demonstrated by CE-LIF. The N-glycome was very stable evidenced by MALDI-TOF when stored at 4°C for at least 48 hours and blood collected in tubes devoid of additives. The glycome was stable upon storage after centrifugation and aliquoting, which is an important information considering future diagnostic applications. Hemolysis, however, negatively correlated with an established glycan score for ovarian cancer, when evaluated by MALDI-TOF-MS measurement by affecting relative intensities of certain glycans, which could lead to false negative / positive results in glycan biomarker studies."
https://openalex.org/W2828923178,"The current guideline recommends lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for the primary management of dyslipidemia in patients at high-risk of cardiovascular events. Patients who have achieved LDL-C levels below the recommended targets may still experience cardiovascular events, suggesting additional therapeutic targets beyond LDL-C. The aim of this study was to investigate whether high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels had an impact on plaque stabilization in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).This study consisted of 90 ACS patients with untreated dyslipidemia. In optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis, a plaque with fibrous cap thickness ≦160 μm was defined as a high-risk plaque. We registered one high-risk plaque per one patient by baseline OCT imaging, and then administrated high-intensity statin. Based on the follow-up OCT results, patients whose registered plaque was no longer high-risk plaque were classified into a responder group and the remains into a non-responder group.No differences were observed in the baseline LDL-C and HDL-C levels between the two groups. Reduction of LDL-C levels (δ LDL-C: -53 ± 21 mg/dL vs. -42 ± 29 mg/dL, p = 0.036) and increase of HDL-C levels (δ HDL-C: 2.5 ± 5.9 mg/dL vs. -0.3 ± 6.7 mg/dL, p = 0.039) were greater in the responder group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, δ LDL-C levels (OR: 0.956, 95% CI: 0.921-0.993; p = 0.020) and δ HDL-C levels (OR: 1.143; 95% CI: 1.005-1.300, p = 0.041) were independent contributors for plaque stabilization.Increase of HDL-C levels is associated with plaque stabilization in patients with ACS. HDL-C could be a therapeutic target for residual risk management."
https://openalex.org/W2829932762,"Learner-centered classrooms encourage critical thinking and communication among students and between students and their instructor, and engage students as active learners rather than passive participants. However, students, faculty, and experts often have distinct definitions of learner-centeredness, and the paucity of research comparing perspectives of these different groups must be resolved. In the current study, our central research question was how do student, faculty, and expert observer perceptions of learner-centeredness within biology classrooms compare to one another? We sampled 1114 students from fifteen sections of a general biology course for non-majors, and complete responses from 490 students were analyzed. Five valid and reliable tools (two faculty; two student; and one expert observer) evaluated the learner-centeredness of each participating section. Perceptions of learner-centered instructors often aligned with those of expert observers, while student perceptions tended not to align with either group. Interestingly, students perceived learner-centered instructors as less learner-centered if they taught at non-traditional times and/or in large-enrollment sections, despite their focus on student learning. Perceptions of learner-centeredness in the biology classroom are complex and may be best captured with more than one instrument. Our findings encourage instructors to be cognizant that the approaches they employ in the classroom may not be interpreted as learner-centered, in the same manner, by students and external observers, particularly when additional course factors such as enrollment and scheduling may encourage negative perceptions of learner-centered practices."
https://openalex.org/W2861344042,"In micropaleontological and paleoclimatological studies based on microfossil morphology and geochemistry, assessing the preservation state of fossils is of the highest importance, as diagenetic alteration invalidates textural features and compromises the correct interpretation of stable isotope and trace elemental analysis. In this paper, we present a novel non-invasive and label-free tomographic approach to reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of microfossils with submicron resolution based on stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). Furthermore, this technique allows deciphering the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the minerals within these fossils in a chemically sensitive manner. Our method, therefore, allows to identify microfossils, to chemically map their internal structure and eventually to determine their preservation state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by analyzing several benthic and planktonic foraminifera, obtaining full 3D distributions of carbonate, iron oxide and porosity for each specimen. Subsequently, the preservation state of each microfossil can be assessed using these 3D compositional maps. The technique is highly sensitive, non-destructive, time-efficient and avoids the need for sample pretreatment. Therefore, its predestined application is the final check of the state of microfossils before applying subsequent geochemical analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2831205735,"Although human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oral and oropharyngeal cancers have distinct epidemiologic and molecular characteristics compared to HPV-negative cancers, all patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancers received same standard regimen regardless of HPV status. For these reasons, specific regimens for patients with HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer are needed. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers were re-analyzed and categorized from public database. Then, druggable targets to HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer were identified and were validated with E6/E7, which is oncogene of HPV, transfected oral and oropharyngeal cancer cell lines and HPV infected cell lines. In DEG analysis, HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer showed distinct disease entity from HPV-negative cancers. Unlike HPV-negative oral and oropharyngeal cancer, thymidylate synthase (TS) and topoisomerase II (Topo II) were overexpressed in HPV-positive cancers. Transfection of Lenti-virus containing E6/ E7 to HPV-negative oral and oropharyngeal cancer cells induced upregulation of TS and Topo II in those cells. Although cisplatin, which is standard regimen in head and neck cancers, showed more effectiveness in HPV-negative cells, 5-FU and pemetrexed, which are TS inhibitors, or etoposide, which is Topo II inhibitors, worked more effectively in HPV-positive cells. In addition, cisplatin/etoposide and cisplatin/pemetrexed combination regimens showed synergic effects in HPV-positive cells. Pemetrexed or etoposide alone, or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, can be used as novel substitutes in a regimen of concurrent chemoradiotherapy or a palliative regimen for HPV-positive oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients. However, a well-designed clinical trial is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2869934428,"Background Caffeine is routinely given to preterm infants hours after birth to treat apnea of prematurity. In view of it’s success, earlier administration in the delivery room is being considered, but little is known about how caffeine may effect the cardiovascular changes during the fetal to neonatal transition. Our aim was to determine the effect of prenatal caffeine administration on haemodynamic parameters in ventilated preterm lambs immediately after birth. Methods Catheters (carotid artery and jugular vein) and ultrasonic flow probes (pulmonary artery and carotid artery) were implanted in preterm lambs (~126 ±2 days of gestation; term is 147 days), immediately before delivery by caesarean section. Before the cord was clamped, lambs were intubated and a caffeine (10mg/kg caffeine-base; n = 9) or saline (n = 5) infusion was given intravenously to the ewe and lamb over a 15-minute period. Two minutes after clamping the cord, ventilation commenced with a sustained inflation (35 cm H2O for 30 seconds) followed by ventilation for 30 minutes (target tidal volume of 6-8ml/kg). Results Blood gas parameters and rectal body temperature were not different between the two groups. Changes in pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and carotid blood flow (CBF) did not differ significantly between groups. PBF increased significantly after ventilation onset in both groups (caffeine p = 0.022, saline p <0.001) and remained elevated thereafter. CBF did not increase but decreased after SI in the caffeine group. Blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation did not differ between groups at any stage of the study. Conclusion Prenatal caffeine infusion had no significant effect on acute haemodynamic parameters in ventilated preterm lambs during the cardiorespiratory transition."
https://openalex.org/W2881486483,"Plant casein kinase II (CKII) plays an essential role in regulating plant growth and development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the CKII family genes in Musa spp. cv. 'Tianbaojiao' (AAA group) and the wild banana (Musa itinerans). The 13 cDNA sequences of the CKII family members were identified both in 'Tianbaojiao' and wild banana, respectively. The differences between CKII α and CKII β members are corroborated through the subcellular localizations, phosphorylation sites and gene structures. The cloning of CKII β-like-2 gDNA sequences in wild banana and 'Tianbaojiao' and the analysis of gene structures showed MiCKIIβ-like-2b and MaCKIIβ-like-2 are likely alternatively spliced transcripts, which were derived from the alternative splicing events that involved exon deletion. The qPCR validation showed differential expression CKII family members in response to cold stress and also in all tested tissues (leaf, pseudostem and root) of wild banana. In particular, the normal transcript MiCKIIβ-like-2a was highly expressed in response to cold stress in wild banana; oppositely, the alternatively spliced transcript MiCKIIβ-like-2b was quite lowly expressed. The complex origin and long-term evolution of Musa lineage might explain the alternative splicing events of CKII β-like-2."
https://openalex.org/W2846016843,"The adverse long-term consequences following traumatic brain injury are poorly understood, particularly on the cerebral microvasculature. Retinal vessels are a surrogate marker of cerebral vascular changes. We therefore aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between serious head injury or being knocked unconscious, and/or concussion and retinal microvascular signs, specifically, mean retinal arteriolar and venular calibre, in older adults after accounting for potential confounders. This cohort study involved 2,624 adults with mean age of 66.9 (±9.1) years who self-reported head injury and concussion parameters, and had gradable retinal photographs. Face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers allowed participants to report prior serious head injury or being knocked unconscious, and/or a previous diagnosis of concussion by a medical professional. Fundus photographs were taken and retinal vascular calibre measured using computer-assisted techniques and summarized. There were 25.9%, 15.3% and 10.1% who reported a prior serious head injury or being ""knocked unconscious"", concussion, and both, respectively. Participants in the first group compared to non-injured participants had significantly wider (~2 μm) mean retinal venular calibre (p = 0.02), after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, mean arterial blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and fellow vessel calibre. No significant associations were observed in people reporting medically diagnosed concussion or with mean retinal arteriolar calibre. Our exploratory study suggests that head injury is independently associated with wider retinal venular caliber. These findings warrant further investigation in longitudinal cohort studies."
https://openalex.org/W2876339530,"Nano scanning Auger microscopy (NanoSAM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) have been used in materials science research for some time, but NanoSAM, in particular, has only recently been applied to biological specimens. Here, the first concurrent utilization of NanoSAM, TOF-SIMS and microscopic techniques for the examination of a standard beverage fermentation strain of Saccharomyces pastorianus uncovered the presence of intracellular networks of CO2 in fermenting cells. Respiring cells produced few bubbles and instead had large internal vacuolar structures. Transmission electron microscopy analysis also showed osmiophilic layers at the cell exterior of fermenting cells that became more prevalent with fermentation duration, while osmiophilic layers were largely absent in respiring cells. TOF-SIMS analysis showed a compositional difference at the exterior and interior of SMA cells and between fermenting and respiring cells. Fermenting cells also appeared to have different 3-OH oxylipin profiles compared to respiring cells based upon examination with immunofluorescence microscopy. The results of this work and further study using these materials science techniques will substantially enhance our understanding of the chemical, ultrastructural and metabolic changes that occur in fermentation yeasts."
