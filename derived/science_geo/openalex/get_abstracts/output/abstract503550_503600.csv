Cancers are typically classified using pathologic criteria that rely heavily on the tissue site of origin. However, large-scale genomics projects are now producing detailed molecular characterizations of thousands of tumors, making a systematic molecular-based taxonomy of cancer possible. Indeed, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has reported integrated genome-wide studies of ten distinct malignancies: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways.Nature. 2008; 455: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (5792) Google Scholar), serous ovarian carcinoma (OV) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkIntegrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma.Nature. 2011; 474: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (5385) Google Scholar), colon (COAD) and rectal (READ) adenocarcinomas (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012bCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5900) Google Scholar), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012aCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive genomic characterization of squamous cell lung cancers.Nature. 2012; 489: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar), breast cancer (BRCA) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012cCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours.Nature. 2012; 490: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8299) Google Scholar), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013bCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkGenomic and epigenomic landscapes of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.N.

Those studies have shown that each single-tissue cancer type can be further divided into three to four molecular subtypes. The subclassification is based on recurrent genetic and epigenetic alterations that converge on common pathways (e.g., p53 and/or Rb checkpoint loss; RTK/RAS/MEK or RTK/PI3K/AKT activation). Meaningful differences in clinical behavior are often correlated with the single-tissue tumor types and, in a few cases, single-tissue subtype identification has led to therapies that target the driving subtype-specific molecular alteration(s). EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinomas and ERBB2-amplified breast cancer are two well-established examples. To move toward a molecular taxonomy, we investigated whether tissue-of-origin categories split into subtypes based upon multiplatform genomic analyses and also extend the analysis in the other direction to look for possible convergence. We looked to see what molecular alterations are shared across cancers arising from different tissues and if previously recognized disease subtypes in fact span multiple tissues of origin. With those questions in mind, we performed a multiplatform integrative analysis of thousands of cancers from 12 tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Using data from multiple assay platforms, we tested the hypothesis that molecular signatures provide a distinct taxonomy relative to the currently used tissue-of-origin-based classification. At the center of our results is the identification of 11 “integrated subtypes.” Consistent with the histological classification, tissue-of-origin features provided the dominant signal(s) for identification of most subtypes, irrespective of genomic analysis platform or combination thereof. However, approximately 10% of cases were reclassified by the molecular taxonomy, with the newly defined integrated subtypes providing a significant increase in the accuracy for the prediction of clinical outcomes. To identify a multitissue, molecular signature-based classification of cancer objectively, we first characterized each of the individual tumor types using six different “omic” platforms. The diverse tumor set called “Pan-Cancer-12,” is composed of 12 different malignancies. It comprises 3,527 cases assayed by at least four of the six possible data types routinely generated by TCGA: whole-exome DNA sequence (Illumina HiSeq and GAII), DNA copy-number variation (Affymetrix 6.0 microarrays), DNA methylation (Illumina 450,000-feature microarrays), genome-wide mRNA levels (Illumina mRNA-seq), microRNA levels (Illumina microRNA-seq), and protein levels for 131 proteins and/or phosphorylated proteins (Reverse Phase Protein Arrays; RPPA). The 12 tumor types include the ten TCGA Network published data sets listed above and two additional tumor types for which manuscripts have been submitted: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). This is the most comprehensive and diverse collection of tumors analyzed by systematic genomic methods to date. We performed sample-wise clustering to derive subtypes based on six different data types separately: DNA copy number, DNA methylation, mRNA expression, microRNA expression, protein expression, and somatic point mutation (see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 1). The classification results from each single-platform analysis produced sets of 8 to 20 groups of samples that each showed high correlation with tissue of origin (Figures S1A–S1F available online) and were highly comparable with each other (Figure S2A). For example, patterns of copy-number change varied across tissue types, and subtyping of the tumors based on copy-number alterations revealed a significant correlation with tissue (p < 6x10−6, Chi-square test).Figure S2Integrated Platform Analysis, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Clustering of pairwise concordance between single-platform subtypes.

To identify disease subtypes on a more comprehensive basis than could be done using any single type of data, we developed an integrated subtype classification for all of the tumor samples in the Pan-Cancer-12 collection based on five of the data types, excluding somatic mutations. To do so, the results of the single-platform analyses were provided as input to a second-level cluster analysis using a method we refer to as cluster-of-cluster assignments (COCA), which was originally developed to define subclasses in the TCGA breast cancer cohort (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012cCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours.Nature. 2012; 490: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8299) Google Scholar). The algorithm takes as input the binary vectors that represent each of the platform-specific cluster groups and reclusters the samples according to those vectors (see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 2). One advantage of the method is that data across platforms are combined without the need for normalization steps prior to clustering. In addition, each platform influences the final integrated result with weight proportional to the number of distinct subtypes reproducibly found by consensus clustering. Thus, “large” platforms (e.g., 450,000 DNA methylation probes) with orders of magnitude more features than “small” platforms (e.g., 131 RPPA antibodies) do not dominate the solution. In addition to the COCA classification, we used two additional, independent methods to derive Pan-Cancer-12 subtypes based on integrated data: (1) an algorithm called SuperCluster (Kandoth et al., 2013bKandoth C. Schultz N. Cherniack A.D. Akbani R. Liu Y. Shen H. Robertson A.G. Pashtan I. Shen R. Benz C.C. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkIntegrated genomic characterization of endometrial carcinoma.Nature. 2013; 497: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B) and (2) clustering based on inferred pathway activities from PARADIGM (Vaske et al., 2010Vaske C.J. Benz S.C. Sanborn J.Z. Earl D. Szeto C. Zhu J. Haussler D. Stuart J.M. Inference of patient-specific pathway activities from multi-dimensional cancer genomics data using PARADIGM.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: i237-i245Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), which integrates gene expression and DNA copy-number data with a set of predefined pathways to infer the degree of activity of 17,365 pathway features such as proteins, complexes, and cellular processes (Figure S2C). Both SuperCluster and PARADIGM produced classifications that were highly concordant with the COCA subtypes (Figure S2D). Given recent promising results that use gene networks (as opposed to the sparsely populated single-mutation space) to cluster samples based on somatic DNA variants (Hofree et al., 2013Hofree M. Shen J.P. Carter H. Gross A. Ideker T. Network-based stratification of tumor mutations.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), we calculated a mutation-based clustering after first associating genes with pathways and then identifying clusters based on mutated pathways (Figure S1F and Data S1). Including those clusters in the identification of COCA subtypes produced highly similar results to COCA subtypes that did not use the mutation-based clusters (Figure S2D). Thus, we focus here on the COCA results obtained without the mutations, as those five other platform-based classifications required no prior biological knowledge. The COCA algorithm identified thirteen clusters of samples, 11 of which included more than ten samples (Table S1). The two small clusters (n = 3 and 6) are noted (Table 1) but were excluded from further analyses. We refer to the remaining sample groups by cluster number and a short descriptive mnemonic (Table 1). Of the 11 COCA-integrated subtypes, five show simple, near one-to-one relationships with tissue site of origin: C5-KIRC, C6-UCEC, C9-OV, C10-GBM, and C13-LAML (Figure 1A). A sixth COCA type, C1-LUAD-enriched, is predominantly composed (258/306) of non-small cell lung (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma samples (LUAD). The second major constituent of the C1-LUAD-enriched group is a set of NSCLC squamous samples (28/306). Upon re-review of the frozen or formalin fixed sections, 11/28 lung squamous samples that cluster with the C1-LUAD-enriched group did not have squamous features and were reclassified as lung adenocarcinoma (Travis et al., 2011Travis W.D. Brambilla E. Noguchi M. Nicholson A.G. Geisinger K.R. Yatabe Y. Beer D.G. Powell C.A. Riely G.J.

Thorac. Oncol. 2011; 6: 244-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). NSCLCs are often difficult to classify based on histology alone (Grilley-Olson et al., 2013Grilley-Olson J.E. Hayes D.N. Moore D.T. Leslie K.O. Wilkerson M.D. Qaqish B.F. Hayward M.C. Cabanski C.R.

Pathol. Lab. Med. 2013; 137: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). That difficulty poses an important clinical challenge since histology is used to guide the selection of chemotherapy (Scagliotti et al., 2008Scagliotti G.V. Parikh P. von Pawel J. Biesma B. Vansteenkiste J. Manegold C. Serwatowski P. Gatzemeier U. Digumarti R. Zukin M. et al.Phase III study comparing cisplatin plus gemcitabine with cisplatin plus pemetrexed in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 3543-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar) and to select patients for further mutational analysis (e.g., EGFR mutation and ALK fusion testing in nonsquamous NSCLC). However, the challenge can be addressed by genomic analysis based on distinct differences in mutation spectrum (Table S2A) and distinct gene expression patterns (Figure S1A). Two clear subtypes of NSCLC (C1-LUAD-enriched and C2-squamous-like, see discussion below) are identified by COCA.Table 1The 12 Pathological Disease Types, Rows, and Their Relationship to the 13 Integrated Subtypes Defined by the Cluster-of-Cluster-Assignments MethodHandleC1-LUAD-EnrichedC2-Squamous-likeC3-BRCA/LuminalC4-BRCA/BasalC5-KIRCC6-UCECC7-COAD/READC8-BLCAC9-OVC10-GBMC11-Small-VariousC12-Small-VariousC13-AMLTotalBLCA1031001007401120120BRCA21688135500200001834COAD000000182000000182GBM300020000190000195HNSC130200000101000305KIRC100047000002020475LAML000000000000161161LUAD258601010101020270LUSC2820601000102000238OV100010003270000329READ0000007300000073UCEC200003401000200345Totals30654668813747934125679327197361623527The name of each COCA subtype (top row) includes a cluster number (1 to 13) and a text designation for mnemonic purposes. Two of the subtypes (numbers 11 and 12) were eliminated from further analysis because they included < 10 samples (3 and 6 samples, respectively). Hence, the text focuses on 11 subtypes, not 13.See also Table S1.

Two of the subtypes (numbers 11 and 12) were eliminated from further analysis because they included < 10 samples (3 and 6 samples, respectively). Hence, the text focuses on 11 subtypes, not 13. See also Table S1. For the other five tissue types, the patterns are more complex. Either a given tissue splits into multiple COCA groups (divergence) or multiple tissue types coalesce into a single COCA group (convergence). A simple example of convergence previously described for TCGA data are the merging of colon (COAD) and rectal (READ) tumors into a single COCA group (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012bCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5900) Google Scholar). The expression features shared by colon and rectal samples were noted in the TCGA Network paper on the two cancer types, but we extend those findings through use of the multiplatform clustering approach (Figure 1A and Table 1). Breast cancers (BRCA) exhibit a pattern of divergence in which two main groups of samples are distinctly identifiable. One group (C3-BRCA/Luminal) contains essentially all of the luminal (estrogen receptor-positive) (594/597) and HER2-positive tumors (66/66), whereas the other (C4-BRCA/basal) contains 131/139 of the breast basal-like tumors. Although it has previously been appreciated that basal-like breast cancers (the majority subset of triple-negative breast cancers) form a distinct subtype (Prat et al., 2013Prat A. Adamo B. Cheang M.C. Anders C.K. Carey L.A. Perou C.M. Molecular characterization of basal-like and non-basal-like triple-negative breast cancer.Oncologist. 2013; 18: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012cCancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours.Nature. 2012; 490: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8299) Google Scholar), the findings here provide a more refined, quantitative picture of the extent of difference from luminal and basal-like breast cancers. Whereas tissue of origin is the dominant signal for combined data on almost all of the other cancer types in the Pan-Cancer-12 collection, breast basal-like cancers are as different from luminal/ER+ breast cancers as they are from cancers of the lung (Figure 1A). The data from the present study strongly reinforce the idea that basal-like breast cancers constitute a unique disease entity. The remaining three tissue types (HNSC, LUSC, and BLCA) provide examples of both divergence and convergence in COCA subtyping (Figure 1A and Table 1). The strongest pattern of convergence is observed for the vast majority of HNSC (301/304), LUSC (206/238), and some of the BLCA (31/120) tumors; they cluster together in a large COCA group (C2-squamous-like), perhaps reflecting similar cell type of origin or smoking as an etiologic factor. BLCA tumors also exhibit a divergence pattern, distributing predominantly into three distinct groups: 31 BLCA in the C2-squamous-like group, 10 in the C1-LUAD-enriched group, and 74 in the bladder-only group, C8-BLCA. Five other BLCA samples cluster in four different COCA groups. To investigate the clinical relevance of the COCA subtypes, we performed Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis on the Pan-Cancer-12 data set. The results indicate that tissue-of-origin (Figure S3A) and COCA subtype (Figure 1D) are both prognostic, and each provides independent information (Figure 1E). Additionally, the two most commonly mutated genes in the overall data set, TP53 (41%) and PIK3CA (20%), are prognostic, even across different tumor types, as are previously defined genomic signatures of cell proliferation rate (Nielsen et al., 2010Nielsen T.O. Parker J.S. Leung S. Voduc D. Ebbert M. Vickery T. Davies S.R. Snider J. Stijleman I.J. Reed J. et al.A comparison of PAM50 intrinsic subtyping with immunohistochemistry and clinical prognostic factors in tamoxifen-treated estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 5222-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and mutated TP53 gene-expression-based signature (Troester et al., 2006Troester M.A. Herschkowitz J.I. Oh D.S. He X. Hoadley K.A. Barbier C.S. Perou C.M. Gene expression patterns associated with p53 status in breast cancer.BMC Cancer. 2006; 6: 276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Figures S3B–S3F). We next asked whether prognostic information is provided by the COCA subtypes after accounting for known clinical and tissue-of-origin features. We performed a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis to predict outcomes across the data set. The analysis was limited to the COCA subtypes that did not have a one-to-one relationship with tissue-of-origin tumor type (COCA1-LUAD enriched, COCA2-squamous, COCA3-Breast/luminal, COCA4-breast/basal, COCA7-COAD/READ, and COCA8-BLCA). In the model we included clinical features such as tumor size, node status, metastasis status, and age at diagnosis, as well as tissue of origin. We performed a likelihood ratio test conditioning first on the clinical variables; when either tissue-of-origin or COCA subtype was added to the model, a large increase in the predictive fit of the model was observed, beyond what one would get with the clinical information alone (Figure 1E). That observation supports the classical model in which tissues of origin provides strong predictions of outcome. Next, we asked whether the COCA subtypes add additional independent information for predicting survival beyond the combination of tissue-of-origin and clinical features. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in statistical likelihood when COCA is added to a multivariate model that already includes the clinical and tissue-based information (p < 0.0002; Chi-square test; Figure 1E). Thus, while the COCA classification differs from tissue-of-origin-based classification in only ∼10% of all samples, the difference does provide important molecular information that reflects tumor biology and is associated with clinical outcome. We next identified the major genomic determinants of the COCA subtypes, including somatic mutations and DNA copy-number changes (Figures 1B and 1C). For single-nucleotide variants, we analyzed a Pan-Cancer-12 list of 127 significantly mutated genes (SMGs) obtained by MuSiC analysis (Kandoth et al., 2013aKandoth C. McLellan M.D. Vandin F. Ye K. Niu B. Lu C. Xie M. Zhang Q. McMichael J.F. Wyczalkowski M.A. et al.Mutational landscape and significance across 12 major cancer types.Nature. 2013; 502: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Only three of the genes are mutated at a frequency ≥10% (TP53, PIK3CA and PTEN), and 11 additional are mutated at ≥5% frequency (Table S2A). We also include a list of 291 high-confidence cancer drivers (HCDs) from Pan-Cancer-12 analysis (Tamborero et al., 2013Tamborero D. Gonzalez-Perez A. Perez-Llamas C. Deu-Pons J. Kandoth C. Reimand J. Lawrence M.S. Getz G. Bader G.D. Ding L. Lopez-Bigas N. Comprehensive identification of mutational cancer driver genes across 12 tumor types.Sci Rep. 2013; 3: 2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and identified by a combination of five complementary methods to identify signals of positive selection in the mutational pattern of genes across tumors. A large number of correlations between COCA subtypes and somatic mutations were found (Figure 2A, Figure S4D, Data S2). Somatic mutations clearly distinguish the C1-LUAD-enriched group from the C2-squamous-like group. KEAP1 and STK11 are preferentially mutated in C1-LUAD-enriched tumors, whereas CDKN2A, NOTCH1, MLL2, and NFE2L2, among others, are preferentially mutated in C2-squamous-like (Figure 2A). A similarly distinct set of SMGs was seen for the C3-BRCA/luminal and C4-BRCA/basal groups; only two genes are shared (TP53 and PIK3CA), and they show different mutation frequencies (Table S2A). Since the somatic mutation results were not used in any way to determine the COCA subtypes, they provide independent evidence that distinctly different genetic events underlie the subtypes. A protein-protein interaction network analysis of mutations associated with the COCA subtypes obtained using a new version of the HotNet algorithm (Vandin et al., 2012Vandin, F., Clay, P., Upfal, E., and Raphael, B.J.

They find a missense variant in NUDT15 associated with substantially higher risk of developing this life-threatening complication to thiopurine therapy. Thiopurine therapy, commonly used in autoimmune conditions, can be complicated by life-threatening leukopenia. This leukopenia is associated with genetic variation in TPMT (encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase). Despite a lower frequency of TPMT mutations in Asians, the incidence of thiopurine-induced leukopenia is higher in Asians than in individuals of European descent. Here we performed an Immunochip-based 2-stage association study in 978 Korean subjects with Crohn's disease treated with thiopurines. We identified a nonsynonymous SNP in NUDT15 (encoding p.Arg139Cys) that was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (odds ratio (OR) = 35.6; Pcombined = 4.88 × 10−94). In Koreans, this variant demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 89.4% and 93.2%, respectively, for thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (in comparison to 12.1% and 97.6% for TPMT variants). Although rare, this SNP was also strongly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease of European descent (OR = 9.50; P = 4.64 × 10−4). Thus, NUDT15 is a pharmacogenetic determinant for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in diverse populations."

However, the function of HO-1 in the nucleus is not completely clear. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor and master regulator of numerous antioxidants and anti-apoptotic proteins, including HO-1, also accumulates in the nucleus with oxidative injury and in various types of cancer. Here we demonstrate that in oxidative stress, nuclear HO-1 interacts with Nrf2 and stabilizes it from glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-mediated phosphorylation coupled with ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, thereby prolonging its accumulation in the nucleus. This regulation of Nrf2 post-induction by nuclear HO-1 is important for the preferential transcription of phase II detoxification enzymes such as NQO1 as well as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), a regulator of the pentose phosphate pathway. Using Nrf2 knock-out cells, we further demonstrate that nuclear HO-1-associated cytoprotection against oxidative stress depends on an HO-1/Nrf2 interaction. Although it is well known that Nrf2 induces HO-1 leading to mitigation of oxidant stress, we propose a novel mechanism by which HO-1, by modulating the activation of Nrf2, sets an adaptive reprogramming that enhances antioxidant defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2018111368,"It has been suggested that working memory representations of visual features are encoded by neurons in the areas of the early visual cortex. In this study, the authors show that sustained spiking activity in the macaque during a delayed match-to-sample task is actually absent from the middle temporal area but is instead observed in the medial superior temporal region and the lateral prefrontal cortex. Sustained activity encoding visual working memory representations has been observed in several cortical areas of primates. Where along the visual pathways this activity emerges remains unknown. Here we show in macaques that sustained spiking activity encoding memorized visual motion directions is absent in direction-selective neurons in early visual area middle temporal (MT). However, it is robustly present immediately downstream, in multimodal association area medial superior temporal (MST), as well as and in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). This sharp emergence of sustained activity along the dorsal visual pathway suggests a functional boundary between early visual areas, which encode sensory inputs, and downstream association areas, which additionally encode mnemonic representations. Moreover, local field potential oscillations in MT encoded the memorized directions and, in the low frequencies, were phase-coherent with LPFC spikes. This suggests that LPFC sustained activity modulates synaptic activity in MT, a putative top-down mechanism by which memory signals influence stimulus processing in early visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2022089839,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory signaling in the nervous system. Despite the profound importance of iGluRs to neurotransmission, little is known about the structures and dynamics of intact receptors in distinct functional states. Here, we elucidate the structures of the intact GluA2 AMPA receptor in an apo resting/closed state, in an activated/pre-open state bound with partial agonists and a positive allosteric modulator, and in a desensitized/closed state in complex with fluorowilliardiine. To probe the conformational properties of these states, we carried out double electron-electron resonance experiments on cysteine mutants and cryoelectron microscopy studies. We show how agonist binding modulates the conformation of the ligand-binding domain ""layer"" of the intact receptors and how, upon desensitization, the receptor undergoes large conformational rearrangements of the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. We define mechanistic principles by which to understand antagonism, activation, and desensitization in AMPA iGluRs."
https://openalex.org/W1983578249,"Repeated cocaine exposure enhances excitatory connections onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The authors show that cocaine selectively increases basolateral amygdala inputs onto direct pathway MSNs in the NAc medial shell. Inhibiting amygdala activity prevents this plasticity and blocks the increase in spine density on these neurons. Repeated exposure to cocaine alters the structural and functional properties of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These changes suggest a rewiring of the NAc circuit, with an enhancement of excitatory synaptic connections onto MSNs. However, it is unknown how drug exposure alters the balance of long-range afferents onto different cell types in the NAc. Here we used whole-cell recordings, two-photon microscopy, optogenetics and pharmacogenetics to show how repeated cocaine exposure alters connectivity in the mouse NAc medial shell. Cocaine selectively enhanced amygdala innervation of MSNs expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs) relative to D2-MSNs. We also found that amygdala activity was required for cocaine-induced changes to behavior and connectivity. Finally, we established how heightened amygdala innervation can explain the structural and functional changes evoked by cocaine. Our findings reveal how exposure to drugs of abuse fundamentally reorganizes cell type– and input-specific connectivity in the NAc."
https://openalex.org/W2090739159,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results from a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (polyQ-AR). In this study, the authors show that autophagy is dysregulated in SBMA mice and in neural precursors obtained from iPSCs derived from human patients and that this results from an impaired interaction between AR and the transcription factor TFEB. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a key pathway in neurodegeneration. Despite protective actions, autophagy may contribute to neuron demise when dysregulated. Here we consider X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a repeat disorder caused by polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor (polyQ-AR). We found that polyQ-AR reduced long-term protein turnover and impaired autophagic flux in motor neuron–like cells. Ultrastructural analysis of SBMA mice revealed a block in autophagy pathway progression. We examined the transcriptional regulation of autophagy and observed a functionally significant physical interaction between transcription factor EB (TFEB) and AR. Normal AR promoted, but polyQ-AR interfered with, TFEB transactivation. To evaluate physiological relevance, we reprogrammed patient fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells and then to neuronal precursor cells (NPCs). We compared multiple SBMA NPC lines and documented the metabolic and autophagic flux defects that could be rescued by TFEB. Our results indicate that polyQ-AR diminishes TFEB function to impair autophagy and promote SBMA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2033118734,"A compound previously identified as a dopamine D2 receptor allosteric modulator was found to be a bitopic ligand that binds the orthosteric and allosteric sites to allow binding to one D2 protomer and allosteric modulation of the associated protomer. SB269652 is to our knowledge the first drug-like allosteric modulator of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), but it contains structural features associated with orthosteric D2R antagonists. Using a functional complementation system to control the identity of individual protomers within a dimeric D2R complex, we converted the pharmacology of the interaction between SB269652 and dopamine from allosteric to competitive by impairing ligand binding to one of the protomers, indicating that the allostery requires D2R dimers. Additional experiments identified a 'bitopic' pose for SB269652 extending from the orthosteric site into a secondary pocket at the extracellular end of the transmembrane (TM) domain, involving TM2 and TM7. Engagement of this secondary pocket was a requirement for the allosteric pharmacology of SB269652. This suggests a new mechanism whereby a bitopic ligand binds in an extended pose on one G protein–coupled receptor protomer to allosterically modulate the binding of a ligand to the orthosteric site of a second protomer."
https://openalex.org/W1987900180,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) bestows cancer cells with increased stem cell properties and metastatic potential. To date, multiple extracellular stimuli and transcription factors have been shown to regulate EMT. Many of them are not druggable and therefore it is necessary to identify targets, which can be inhibited using small molecules to prevent metastasis. Recently, we identified the ganglioside GD2 as a novel breast cancer stem cell marker. Moreover, we found that GD3 synthase (GD3S)--an enzyme involved in GD2 biosynthesis--is critical for GD2 production and could serve as a potential druggable target for inhibiting tumor initiation and metastasis. Indeed, there is a small molecule known as triptolide that has been shown to inhibit GD3S function. Accordingly, in this manuscript, we demonstrate that the inhibition of GD3S using small hairpin RNA or triptolide compromises the initiation and maintenance of EMT instigated by various signaling pathways, including Snail, Twist and transforming growth factor-β1 as well as the mesenchymal characteristics of claudin-low breast cancer cell lines (SUM159 and MDA-MB-231). Moreover, GD3S is necessary for wound healing, migration, invasion and stem cell properties in vitro. Most importantly, inhibition of GD3S in vivo prevents metastasis in experimental as well as in spontaneous syngeneic wild-type mouse models. We also demonstrate that the transcription factor FOXC2, a central downstream effector of several EMT pathways, directly regulates GD3S expression by binding to its promoter. In clinical specimens, the expression of GD3S correlates with poor prognosis in triple-negative human breast tumors. Moreover, GD3S expression correlates with activation of the c-Met signaling pathway leading to increased stem cell properties and metastatic competence. Collectively, these findings suggest that the GD3S-c-Met axis could serve as an effective target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1993165149,"Polycomb/Trithorax response elements (PRE/TREs) can switch their function reversibly between silencing and activation by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that a switch in forward and reverse noncoding transcription from the Drosophila melanogaster vestigial (vg) PRE/TRE switches the status of the element between silencing (induced by the forward strand) and activation (induced by the reverse strand). In vitro, both noncoding RNAs inhibit PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity, but, in vivo, only the reverse strand binds PRC2. Overexpression of the reverse strand evicts PRC2 from chromatin and inhibits its enzymatic activity. We propose that the interaction of RNAs with PRC2 is differentially regulated in vivo, allowing regulated inhibition of local PRC2 activity. Genome-wide analysis shows that strand switching of noncoding RNAs occurs at several hundred Polycomb-binding sites in fly and vertebrate genomes. This work identifies a previously unreported and potentially widespread class of PRE/TREs that switch function by switching the direction of noncoding RNA transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2090892239,"Protein geranylgeranylation (GGylation) is an important biochemical process for many cellular signaling molecules. Previous studies have shown that GGylation is essential for cell survival in many types of cancer. However, the molecular mechanism mediating the cell survival effect remains elusive. In this report, we show that the Hippo pathway mediates GGylation-dependent cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells. Blockade of GGylation enhanced phosphorylation of Mst1/2 and Lats1, and inhibited YAP and TAZ activity and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway-dependent transcription. The effect of GGylation blockade on inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and migration is dependent on the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling, in which YAP appears to regulate cell proliferation and TAZ to regulate cell migration. Furthermore, GGylation-dependent cell proliferation is correlated with the activity of YAP/TAZ in breast cancer cells. Finally, Gγ and RhoA are the GGylated proteins that may transduce GGylation signals to the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Taken together, our studies have demonstrated that the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway is essential for GGylation-dependent cancer cell proliferation and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2047149754,"Drug-induced taste disturbance is a common adverse drug reaction often triggered by drug secretion into saliva. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying salivary gland transport of xenobiotics, and most drugs are assumed to enter saliva by passive diffusion. In this study, we demonstrate that salivary glands selectively and highly express OCT3 (organic cation transporter-3), a polyspecific drug transporter in the solute carrier 22 family. OCT3 protein is localized at both basolateral (blood-facing) and apical (saliva-facing) membranes of salivary gland acinar cells, suggesting a dual role of this transporter in mediating both epithelial uptake and efflux of organic cations in the secretory cells of salivary glands. Metformin, a widely used anti-diabetic drug known to induce taste disturbance, is transported by OCT3/Oct3 in vitro. In vivo, metformin was actively transported with a high level of accumulation in the salivary glands of wild-type mice. In contrast, active uptake and accumulation of metformin in salivary glands were abolished in Oct3−/− mice. Oct3−/− mice also showed altered metformin pharmacokinetics and reduced drug exposure in the heart. These results demonstrate that OCT3 is responsible for metformin accumulation and secretion in salivary glands.

Our study uncovered a novel carrier-mediated pathway for drug entry into saliva and sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-induced taste disorders. Many medications, including antihypertensive, anti-diabetic, antimicrobial, and antidepressant drugs, have the potential to adversely influence a patient's sense of taste and smell (1.Ackerman B.H.

Drug-induced taste disorders.Drug Saf. 2008; 31: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In some cases, medications can produce prolonged taste disturbance that cannot be quickly reversed by drug cessation (1.Ackerman B.H. Kasbekar N. Disturbances of taste and smell induced by drugs.Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 482-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taste-related adverse effects can significantly impact a patient's quality of life, dietary choices, emotional state, and compliance with medication regimens, especially in pediatric and geriatric populations (1.Ackerman B.H.

As taste receptors are located in taste buds on the tongue, the physical presence of a drug substance in saliva is a prerequisite for taste disturbance caused by many medications. Drugs are known to be excreted into saliva; however, other than passive diffusion, the molecular mechanisms by which salivary gland epithelial cells secret xenobiotics are virtually unknown (4.Aps J.K.

Saliva versus plasma pharmacokinetics: theory and application of a salivary excretion classification system.Mol. Pharm. 2012; 9: 2358-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One drug known to be excreted into saliva and to cause taste disturbance is metformin, a first-line oral hypoglycemic agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Patients on metformin therapy frequently experience a lingering metallic taste in the mouth evidently due to a persistent presence of metformin in the saliva (6.Lee A.J. Metformin in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.Pharmacotherapy. 1996; 16: 327-351PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bristol-Myers Squibb Glucophage (metformin hydrochloride) package insert.

Pharmacokinetics of metformin after intravenous and oral administration to man.Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The concentration of metformin in saliva is lower than in blood, but declines much more slowly (8.Pentikäinen P.J. Neuvonen P.J. Penttilä A. Pharmacokinetics of metformin after intravenous and oral administration to man.Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). When administrated to mice, metformin was reported to accumulate in several tissues and organs, including salivary glands (9.Wilcock C. Bailey C.J. Accumulation of metformin by tissues of the normal and diabetic mouse.Xenobiotica. 1994; 24: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Metformin is a hydrophilic and positively charged molecule that relies on transporters to move across cell membranes (10.Gong L. Goswami S. Giacomini K.M. Altman R.B. Klein T.E.

In this study, we determined the expression and cellular localization of OCT3/Oct3 in the salivary glands of humans and mice. The in vivo significance of Oct3 in salivary gland drug transport was evaluated in mice with targeted deletion of the Oct3/Slc22a3 gene. The Oct3 (Slc22a3) null mice of the FVB inbred strain were originally developed by Dr. Denise Barlow (15.Zwart R. Verhaagh S. Buitelaar M. Popp-Snijders C. Barlow D.P.

For mRNA determination in various mouse tissues, 10–12-week-old Oct3+/+ and Oct3−/− mice were used (n = 4). Mouse liver, kidney, small intestine, heart, salivary gland, and skeletal muscle tissues were collected, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. For mRNA analysis in human salivary glands, total RNA (Clontech) pooled from 24 male and female Caucasians (16–60 years old) was used. For regional OCT3 mRNA and protein analysis in human parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands, post-mortem tissues from a single female donor (30 years old) with no disease history were provided by the National Disease Resource Interchange. Total RNA was extracted, and TaqMan real-time PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT fast real-time PCR system as described previously (18.Lee N. Hebert M.F. Prasad B. Easterling T.R.

The sections were then washed with PBS, and fluorescent tag-labeled secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution; Alexa 488 for OCT3 and Alexa 568 for Na+/K+-ATPase) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. For a nonspecific control, tissue sections of human submandibular gland were incubated with blank serum, followed by secondary antibody incubation under the same conditions. For Oct3 immunolocalization in mouse salivary glands, frozen tissue sections were prepared from Oct3+/+ and Oct3−/− mice and immunostained with rabbit anti-Oct3 polyclonal antibody (1:125 dilution), followed by incubation with Alexa 488-tagged secondary antibody (1:500 dilution).

Salivary gland sexual dimorphism: a brief review.Eur. J. Morphol. 1998; 36 (suppl.): 31-34PubMed Google Scholar), in vivo studies were performed in two separate cohorts of male and female mice. Male and female mice (10–12 weeks old) were fasted for ∼10 h. Age- and gender-matched Oct3+/+ and Oct3−/− mice were administered 15 mg/kg metformin containing 0.2 mCi/kg [14C]metformin by oral gavage. At various time points (0–480 min), mice (n = three to six mice at each time point) were killed by CO2 overdose, followed by cardiac puncture. Blood was collected using a heparin-coated syringe, and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 5000 × g. Tissues, including liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, salivary gland, and intestinal segments, were collected and processed at each time point using the method described by Wilcock and Bailey (9.Wilcock C. Bailey C.J. Accumulation of metformin by tissues of the normal and diabetic mouse.Xenobiotica. 1994; 24: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Plasma and tissue metformin concentrations were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Metformin concentration was expressed as nanograms/g for tissues and nanograms/ml for plasma. Metformin plasma concentration-time curves were plotted and analyzed. Because metformin concentrations in plasma and tissue were sampled in different animals at each time point (one-point sampling), a population-based bootstrap method (21.Efron B. Tibshirani R.J.

The 95% confidence intervals for pharmacokinetic parameters were generated using the bootstrap method with modification (21.Efron B. Tibshirani R.J. An Introduction to the Bootstrap.

Resampling methods in sparse sampling situations in preclinical pharmacokinetic studies.J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 372-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma or tissue concentrations were resampled with random replacement of the total number of mice using the R program. The resampling was repeated 10,000 times to create 10,000 pseudo concentration-time profiles. For each profile, the concentrations at each nominal time point were averaged, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Equations 1–4. The 95% confidence intervals for each parameter were calculated by taking the 2.5 and 97.5% quartiles (i.e. the 251th and 97,501th values of 10,000 bootstrap values). Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was estimated by visual inspection of the plasma concentration-time curve. Quantitative assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated at least two times. Data are presented as mean ± S.D., unless specified otherwise. For pharmacokinetic data (except Cmax), 95% confidence intervals around the estimate for each pharmacokinetic parameter were determined using the non-parametric bootstrap method (21.Efron B. Tibshirani R.J. An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability. Book 57, Chapman & Hall, London1994Crossref Google Scholar). Two-sided p values were calculated using permutation tests with 10,000 replications (23.Westfall P.H. Young S.S. Resampling-based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for p-Value Adjustment. Wiley, New York1993Google Scholar). For comparison of Cmax and non-pharmacokinetic parameters, statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Metformin is known to be an excellent substrate of human OCT3 (14.Chen L. Pawlikowski B. Schlessinger A. More S.S. Stryke D. Johns S.J.

To confirm that mOct3 also transports metformin, we examined metformin uptake by mOct3 using Flp-In HEK293 cells stably expressing mOct3. Metformin uptake was much higher in mOct3-expressing cells, and mOct3-mediated metformin uptake exhibited typical saturable kinetics (Fig. 1, A and B). The apparent affinity (Km) was 2.65 ± 0.23 mm, and the maximal transport rate (Vmax) was 45.1 ± 1.4 nmol/mg of protein/min. These data suggest that similar to human OCT3, mOct3 also efficiently transports metformin. Previous gene profiling studies reported a wide distribution of OCT3 mRNA in various human tissues, with major expression in skeletal muscle, cardiac myocytes, placenta, liver, adrenal gland, prostate, and salivary glands (14.Chen L.

As Oct3 expression was less studied in mice, we first quantified mRNA expression of Oct3 and other known metformin transporters, including Oct1, Oct2, Mate1, and Pmat, in various mouse tissues relevant to metformin disposition and response (Fig. 2). As expected, mouse liver predominantly expressed Oct1 and Mate1, and mouse kidney predominantly expressed Oct1, Oct2, and Mate1. In the small intestine, Oct1 and Mate1 prevailed in all segments, although Oct3 and Pmat were also significantly expressed in the ileum. Mouse heart and skeletal muscle had a very high expression of Mate1 together with a significant expression of Oct3. Among the mouse tissues analyzed, the highest expression of Oct3 mRNA was observed in the salivary glands (Fig. 3A), whereas the mRNA of other organic cation or biogenic amine transporters (Sert (serotonin transporter), Net (norepinephrine transporter), and Dat (dopamine transporter)) was minimally expressed (Fig. 3B). A similar predominant expression of OCT3 mRNA was observed in human salivary glands (Fig. 3C). Further analysis revealed that OCT3 mRNA was expressed in all three major types of human salivary glands, with the highest expression found in submandibular glands (Fig. 3D). Using a targeted quantitative proteomics method (18.Lee N. Hebert M.F. Prasad B. Easterling T.R. Kelly E.J. Unadkat J.D. Wang J.

Genomics. 2010; 20: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In human submandibular glands, robust immunoreactivity for OCT3 was observed on acini and associated ducts (Fig. 4A). There was essentially no staining when the primary anti-OCT3 antibody was substituted with blank serum (data not shown). In acinar cells (the secretory epithelial cells responsible for producing saliva), OCT3 immunostaining not only superimposed with the basolateral membrane marker Na+/K+-ATPase but also extended to the apical membranes lining the canaliculi (Fig. 4A). A similar pattern of both basolateral and apical immunostaining was observed in the salivary glands of Oct3+/+ mice (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no specific basolateral or apical staining was observed in the salivary glands of Oct3−/− mice (Fig. 4B). Together, these data revealed that the OCT3/Oct3 protein is present on both basolateral (blood-facing) and apical (saliva-facing) membranes of the secretory epithelial cells in human and mouse salivary glands, suggesting a multifaceted role of this transporter in mediating solute transport in salivary gland epithelial cells. Prior to in vivo studies, we confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR that there were no significant compensatory changes in the expression of other metformin transporters (Oct1, Oct2, Mate1, Pmat) in the tissues of interest in Oct3−/− mice (data not shown). The plasma concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of metformin in female and male Oct3+/+ and Oct3−/− mice are shown in Fig. 5 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2. Although the overall systemic exposure (AUC0–480 min) was comparable between Oct3+/+ and Oct3−/− mice (TABLE 1, TABLE 2), a clear difference was observed in metformin plasma concentrations in the first 60 min between the two genotypes (Fig. 5). In female Oct3−/− mice, the Cmax of metformin increased by 67%, and AUC0–60 min increased by 41% (Table 1). A similar change in the metformin pharmacokinetic profile was observed in male Oct3−/− mice (Table 2). These data suggest that Oct3 influences metformin pharmacokinetics and has a significant impact on metformin plasma levels in the early phase following drug administration.TABLE 1Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters in female Oct3+/+ and Oct3−/− miceParameterOct3+/+Oct3−/−Changep value%Cmax (µg/ml)2.70 ± 0.794.51 ± 0.86↑670.037AUC0–60 min (µg*min/ml)136 (119–155)191 (170–211)↑410.002AUC0–480 min (µg*min/ml)546 (475–599)553 (494–602)↑10.862CL/F (ml/min/kg)aCL/F values were calculated using dose/AUC0–480 min.27.5 (25.0–31.6)27.1 (24.9–30.4)↓10.863Terminal t½ (min)164 (126–284)113 (89.4–142)↓310.237V/F (liters/kg)6.51 (4.83–11.04)4.42 (3.45–5.94)↓320.230a CL/F values were calculated using dose/AUC0–480 min.

https://openalex.org/W2043207949,"Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the activities of many membrane proteins, including ion channels, through direct interactions. However, the affinity of PIP2 is so high for some channel proteins that its physiological role as a modulator has been questioned. Here we show that PIP2 is a key cofactor for activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SKs) by Ca(2+)-bound calmodulin (CaM). Removal of the endogenous PIP2 inhibits SKs. The PIP2-binding site resides at the interface of CaM and the SK C terminus. We further demonstrate that the affinity of PIP2 for its target proteins can be regulated by cellular signaling. Phosphorylation of CaM T79, located adjacent to the PIP2-binding site, by casein kinase 2 reduces the affinity of PIP2 for the CaM-SK channel complex by altering the dynamic interactions among amino acid residues surrounding the PIP2-binding site. This effect of CaM phosphorylation promotes greater channel inhibition by G protein-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2."

We previously reported that the lysine acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) is required for HIF-2α acetylation and efficient HIF-2-dependent EPO induction during hypoxia. We now show that these processes require acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). In human Hep3B hepatoma cells and in EPO-generating organs of hypoxic or acutely anemic mice, acetate levels rise and ACSS2 is required for HIF-2α acetylation, CBP-HIF-2α complex formation, CBP-HIF-2α recruitment to the EPO enhancer and efficient induction of EPO gene expression. In acutely anemic mice, acetate supplementation augments stress erythropoiesis in an ACSS2-dependent manner. Moreover, in acquired and inherited chronic anemia mouse models, acetate supplementation increases EPO expression and the resting hematocrit. Thus, a mammalian stress-responsive acetate switch controls HIF-2 signaling and EPO induction during pathophysiological states marked by tissue hypoxia."

A major class of proteins that are affected are small GTPases, including Rac1 and RhoA. It is not clear how protein prenylation of small GTPases relates to GTP hydrolysis activity and downstream signaling. Here, we investigated the contribution of RhoA prenylation to the biochemical pathways that underlie MKD-associated IL-1β hypersecretion using human cell cultures, Rac1 and RhoA protein variants, and pharmacological inhibitors. We found that when unprenylated, the GTP-bound levels of RhoA decrease, causing a reduction in GTPase activity and increased protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation. Cells expressing unprenylated RhoA produce increased levels of interleukin 1β mRNA. Of other phenotypic cellular changes seen in MKD, increased mitochondrial potential and mitochondrial elongation, only mitochondrial elongation was observed. Finally, we show that pharmacological inactivation of RhoA boosts Rac1 activity, a small GTPase whose activity was earlier implied in MKD pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2023732048,"Trawlers involved in the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery use different trawl designs, and very little is known about the size selectivity of the various gears. Size selectivity quantifies a given trawl's ability to catch different sizes of a harvested entity, and this information is crucial for the management of a sustainable fishery. We established a morphological description of krill and used it in a mathematical model (FISHSELECT) to predict the selective potential of diamond meshes measuring 5-40 mm with mesh opening angles (oa) ranging from 10 to 90°. We expected the majority of krill to encounter the trawl netting in random orientations due to high towing speeds and the assumed swimming capabilities of krill. However, our results indicated that size selectivity of krill is a well-defined process in which individuals encounter meshes at an optimal orientation for escapement. The simulation-based results were supported by data from experimental trawl hauls and underwater video images of the mesh geometry during fishing. Herein we present predictions for the size selectivity of a range of netting configurations relevant to the krill fishery. The methods developed and results described are important tools for selecting optimal trawl designs for krill fishing."

Cell polarity proteins control cellular and tissue organization and are emerging as important mediators of cancer progression. The Par3 polarity protein is a molecular scaffold that functions to recruit and spatially organize signaling factors, and was recently identified as a suppressor of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that loss of Par3 in mammary epithelial cells promotes apoptosis, and that oncogenic Notch overcomes the apoptotic signal to reveal an unexpected pro-proliferative role for loss of Par3 in mammary tumors. In this context, loss of Par3 deregulates Rac1 activity to activate Jun N-terminal Kinase-dependent proliferation and tumor growth. Thus, we demonstrate a mechanism by which loss of Par3 promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis, which supports a tumor-suppressive function for Par3 in the mammary epithelium."

How the small, excised, damage-containing DNA oligonucleotides (sedDNAs) are processed in cells following the dual incision event is not known. Here, we demonstrate that sedDNAs are localized to the nucleus in two biochemically distinct forms, which include chromatin-associated, transcription factor II H-bound complexes and more readily solubilized, RPA-bound complexes. Because the nuclear mobility and repair functions of transcription factor II H and RPA are influenced by post-incision gap-filling events, we examined how DNA repair synthesis and DNA ligation affect sedDNA processing. We found that although these gap filling activities are not essential for the dual incision/sedDNA generation event per se, the inhibition of DNA repair synthesis and ligation is associated with a decrease in UV photoproduct removal rate and an accumulation of RPA-sedDNA complexes in the cell. These findings indicate that sedDNA processing and association with repair proteins following the dual incisions may be tightly coordinated with gap filling during nucleotide excision repair in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2003110685,"Despite the life-long implications of social and communication dysfunction after pediatric traumatic brain injury, there is a poor understanding of these deficits in terms of their developmental trajectory and underlying mechanisms. In a well-characterized murine model of pediatric brain injury, we recently demonstrated that pronounced deficits in social interactions emerge across maturation to adulthood after injury at postnatal day (p) 21, approximating a toddler-aged child. Extending these findings, we here hypothesized that these social deficits are dependent upon brain maturation at the time of injury, and coincide with abnormal sociosexual behaviors and communication. Age-dependent vulnerability of the developing brain to social deficits was addressed by comparing behavioral and neuroanatomical outcomes in mice injured at either a pediatric age (p21) or during adolescence (p35). Sociosexual behaviors including social investigation and mounting were evaluated in a resident-intruder paradigm at adulthood. These outcomes were complemented by assays of urine scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations as indices of social communication. We provide evidence of sociosexual deficits after brain injury at p21, which manifest as reduced mounting behavior and scent marking towards an unfamiliar female at adulthood. In contrast, with the exception of the loss of social recognition in a three-chamber social approach task, mice that received TBI at adolescence were remarkably resilient to social deficits at adulthood. Increased emission of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as well as preferential emission of high frequency USVs after injury was dependent upon both the stimulus and prior social experience. Contrary to the hypothesis that changes in white matter volume may underlie social dysfunction, injury at both p21 and p35 resulted in a similar degree of atrophy of the corpus callosum by adulthood. However, loss of hippocampal tissue was greater after p21 compared to p35 injury, suggesting that a longer period of lesion progression or differences in the kinetics of secondary pathogenesis after p21 injury may contribute to observed behavioral differences. Together, these findings indicate vulnerability of the developing brain to social dysfunction, and suggest that a younger age-at-insult results in poorer social and sociosexual outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2025321654,"Colon cancer cells frequently carry mutations that activate the β-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Yet how oncogenic alterations interact to control cellular hierarchies during tumor initiation and progression is largely unknown. We found that oncogenic BRAF modulates gene expression associated with cell differentiation in colon cancer cells. We therefore engineered a mouse with an inducible oncogenic BRAF transgene, and analyzed BRAF effects on cellular hierarchies in the intestinal epithelium in vivo and in primary organotypic culture. We demonstrate that transgenic expression of oncogenic BRAF in the mouse strongly activated MAPK signal transduction, resulted in the rapid development of generalized serrated dysplasia, but unexpectedly also induced depletion of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) pool. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that ISCs collectively converted to short-lived progenitor cells after BRAF activation. As Wnt/β-catenin signals encourage ISC identity, we asked whether β-catenin activity could counteract oncogenic BRAF. Indeed, we found that intestinal organoids could be partially protected from deleterious oncogenic BRAF effects by Wnt3a or by small-molecule inhibition of GSK3β. Similarly, transgenic expression of stabilized β-catenin in addition to oncogenic BRAF partially prevented loss of stem cells in the mouse intestine. We also used BRAF(V637E) knock-in mice to follow changes in the stem cell pool during serrated tumor progression and found ISC marker expression reduced in serrated hyperplasia forming after BRAF activation, but intensified in progressive dysplastic foci characterized by additional mutations that activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our study suggests that oncogenic alterations activating the MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways must be consecutively and coordinately selected to assure stem cell maintenance during colon cancer initiation and progression. Notably, loss of stem cell identity upon induction of BRAF/MAPK activity may represent a novel fail-safe mechanism protecting intestinal tissue from oncogene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2020566232,"Benthic communities below the photic zone depend for food on allochthonous organic matter derived from seasonal phytoplankton blooms. In the Baltic Sea, the spring diatom bloom is considered the most important input of organic matter, whereas the contribution of the summer bloom dominated by diazotrophic cyanobacteria is less understood. The possible increase in cyanobacteria blooms as a consequence of eutrophication and climate change calls for evaluation of cyanobacteria effects on benthic community functioning and productivity. Here, we examine utilization of cyanobacterial nitrogen by deposit-feeding benthic macrofauna following a cyanobacteria bloom at three stations during two consecutive years and link these changes to isotopic niche and variations in body condition (assayed as C:N ratio) of the animals. Since nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have δ15N close to -2‰, we expected the δ15N in the deposit-feeders to decrease after the bloom if their assimilation of cyanobacteria-derived nitrogen was substantial. We also expected the settled cyanobacteria with their associated microheterotrophic community and relatively high nitrogen content to increase the isotopic niche area, trophic diversity and dietary divergence between individuals (estimated as the nearest neighbour distance) in the benthic fauna after the bloom. The three surface-feeding species (Monoporeia affinis, Macoma balthica and Marenzelleria arctia) showed significantly lower δ15N values after the bloom, while the sub-surface feeder Pontoporeia femorata did not. The effect of the bloom on isotopic niche varied greatly between stations; populations which increased niche area after the bloom had better body condition than populations with reduced niche, regardless of species. Thus, cyanobacterial nitrogen is efficiently integrated into the benthic food webs in the Baltic, with likely consequences for their functioning, secondary production, transfer efficiency, trophic interactions, and intra- and interspecific competition."

Both mutants had a tag in ssl1690 encoding NdhO. Deletion of ndhO increased the activity of NADPH dehydrogenase (NDH-1)-dependent cyclic electron transport around photosystem I (NDH-CET), while overexpression decreased the activity. Although deletion and overexpression of ndhO did not have significant effects on the amount of other subunits such as NdhH, NdhI, NdhK, and NdhM in the cells, the amount of these subunits in the medium size NDH-1 (NDH-1M) complex was higher in the ndhO-deletion mutant and much lower in the overexpression strain than in the WT. NdhO strongly interacts with NdhI and NdhK but not with other subunits. NdhI interacts with NdhK and the interaction was blocked by NdhO. The blocking may destabilize the NDH-1M complex and repress the NDH-CET activity. When cells were transferred from growth light to high light, the amounts of NdhI and NdhK increased without significant change in the amount of NdhO, thus decreasing the relative amount of NdhO. This might have decreased the blocking, thereby stabilizing the NDH-1M complex and increasing the NDH-CET activity under high light conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2059860699,"The protease caspase-9 is activated on the apoptosome, a multiprotein signal transduction platform that assembles in response to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis initiation. Despite extensive molecular research, the assembly of the holo-apoptosome and the process of caspase-9 activation remain incompletely understood. Here, we therefore integrated quantitative data on the molecular interactions and proteolytic processes during apoptosome formation and apoptosis execution and conducted mathematical simulations to investigate the resulting biochemical signaling, quantitatively and kinetically. Interestingly, when implementing the homodimerization of procaspase-9 as a prerequisite for activation, the calculated kinetics of apoptosis execution and the efficacy of caspase-3 activation failed to replicate experimental data. In contrast, assuming a scenario in which procaspase-9 is activated allosterically upon binding to the apoptosome backbone, the mathematical simulations quantitatively and kinetically reproduced all experimental data. These data included a XIAP threshold concentration at which apoptosis execution is suppressed in HeLa cervical cancer cells, half-times of procaspase-9 processing, as well as the molecular timer function of the apoptosome. Our study therefore provides novel mechanistic insight into apoptosome-dependent apoptosis execution and suggests that caspase-9 is activated allosterically by binding to the apoptosome backbone. Our findings challenge the currently prevailing dogma that all initiator procaspases require homodimerization for activation."
https://openalex.org/W1973743926,"Cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), an important source of edible vegetable oil, shows rapid onset of senescence, which limits production by reducing photosynthetic capacity under specific growing conditions. Carbon for grain filling depends strongly on light interception by green leaf area, which diminishes during grain filling due to leaf senescence. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the progression of leaf senescence in plants and have been well explored in model systems, but information for many agronomic crops remains limited. Here, we characterize the expression profiles of a set of putative senescence associated genes (SAGs) identified by a candidate gene approach and sunflower microarray expression studies. We examined a time course of sunflower leaves undergoing natural senescence and used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the expression of 11 candidate genes representing the NAC, WRKY, MYB and NF-Y TF families. In addition, we measured physiological parameters such as chlorophyll, total soluble sugars and nitrogen content. The expression of Ha-NAC01, Ha-NAC03, Ha-NAC04, Ha-NAC05 and Ha-MYB01 TFs increased before the remobilization rate increased and therefore, before the appearance of the first physiological symptoms of senescence, whereas Ha-NAC02 expression decreased. In addition, we also examined the trifurcate feed-forward pathway (involving ORE1, miR164, and ethylene insensitive 2) previously reported for Arabidopsis. We measured transcription of Ha-NAC01 (the sunflower homolog of ORE1) and Ha-EIN2, along with the levels of miR164, in two leaves from different stem positions, and identified differences in transcription between basal and upper leaves. Interestingly, Ha-NAC01 and Ha-EIN2 transcription profiles showed an earlier up-regulation in upper leaves of plants close to maturity, compared with basal leaves of plants at pre-anthesis stages. These results suggest that the H. annuus TFs characterized in this work could play important roles as potential triggers of leaf senescence and thus can be considered putative candidate genes for senescence in sunflower."
https://openalex.org/W2051241884,"Androgen receptor (AR) has a pivotal role in the growth and survival of prostate cancer (PCa). Arrestin2 (Arr2) is a ubiquitous scaffolding/adaptor protein first characterized as a regulator of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. In this study, we report that Arr2 additionally functions as a positive regulator of AR expression and function in PCa cells. Expression level of Arr2 correlates with that of AR, and knockdown of Arr2 inhibits the expression of AR and its effectors prostate-specific antigen, transmembrane protease serine 2, FK506-binding protein 51 and fatty acid synthase. Mechanistically, the knockdown of Arr2 attenuates the binding of AR to androgen response elements and consequently decreases transcription of AR-regulated genes. The inhibition of AR by Arr2 knockdown occurs in both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells, although the effect is more prominent in CRPC. Arr2 knockdown inhibits the in vitro CRPC cell proliferation, prostasphere growth and invasion, as well as the in vivo prostate tumor formation, local invasion and distant metastasis. These results illustrate a new role for Arr2 in the expression and activation of AR and its potential relevance as a target for therapeutic intervention and monitoring of disease progression."

In this study, we demonstrated that the pro-hormone progastrin (PG), over-expressed in CRC, recognized as a growth factor, is a potent pro-angiogenic factor. In transgenic mice and human colorectal HPs producing high levels of PG, we correlated PG overexpression with an increased vascularization. In vitro, exogenous PG and conditioned media (CM) from CRC cells producing PG increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration. We also showed that treatment with exogenous PG can increase the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures. Moreover, we demonstrated that PG enhanced endothelial permeability. The finding that PG stimulated the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, p125-FAK, paxillin and induced actin remodelling was consistent with a role of these components in PG-stimulated endothelial cell migration and permeability. The pro-angiogenic effects observed with CM were significantly inhibited when CRC cells expressed a PG shRNA. In vivo, we found an important decrease in tumor growth and neovascularization when the CRC cells expressing the PG shRNA were xenografted in mice or in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model. We also observed an increase in the coverage of blood vessels by pericytes and a decrease in endothelial permeability when PG expression was blocked. Our results demonstrate that PG is a new pro-angiogenic factor in CRC and an attractive therapeutic target."

Lysine 171 lies in a cationic pocket that interacts with a critical phosphorylated serine residue in the activation loop of IKKβ. Serine 181 in the activation loop of IKKβ is the crucial residue that needs to be phosphorylated by an upstream kinase for it to switch to its active conformation (13.Chapman M.A. Lawrence M.S.

Initial genome sequencing and analysis of multiple myeloma.Nature. 2011; 471: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). A phospho-mimetic mutation in serine 181 can lead to constitutive activation of IKKβ, and constitutively activated IKKβ can contribute to lymphoma generation in transgenic mice (14.Calado D.P.

Lysine 171, however, is situated parallel to serine 181 in the activation loop, and no structural models or experimental data exist to indicate whether the cancer-associated alterations found in this residue of IKKβ activate or inactivate this critically important kinase, or if these changes represent functionally irrelevant “passenger” mutations. Activating mutations in the NFκB pathway have been functionally identified in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (15.Ngo V.N. Young R.M. Schmitz R. Jhavar S. Xiao W. Lim K.H. Kohlhammer H. Xu W. Yang Y.

Oncogenic CARD11 mutations in human diffuse large B cell lymphoma.Science. 2008; 319: 1676-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Mutated genes include CARD11 (caspase recruitment domain 11), TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2) and Myd88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88). Inactivating mutations in A20 can also contribute to constitutive NFκB activation (18.Novak U. Rinaldi A. Kwee I. Nandula S.V. Rancoita P.M. Compagno M. Cerri M. Rossi D. Murty V.V. Zucca E.

All of these genes are also mutated in splenic marginal zone lymphoma, but IKKβ lysine 171 alterations have not been reported in diffuse large B cell lymphomas. Other mutations in IKKβ have been described in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database, many of these may well be “passengers,” and no direct evidence exists for any activating mutations in IKKβ in any human tumor. Next Generation Sequencing has revealed numerous mutations in tumors, including lymphomas. One of the most specific definitions of a “driver” mutation is one that “directly or indirectly confers a growth advantage to the cell in which it occurs” (19.Vogelstein B. Papadopoulos N. Velculescu V.E. Zhou S. Diaz Jr., L.A. Kinzler K.W. Cancer genome landscapes.Science. 2013; 339: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (5228) Google Scholar). Commonly used mutation predictive methods such as Polyphen 2 (20.Adzhubei I.A. Schmidt S. Peshkin L. Ramensky V.E. Gerasimova A. Bork P. Kondrashov A.S. Sunyaev S.R. A method and server for predicting damaging missense mutations.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9340) Google Scholar) or SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) (21.Kumar P. Henikoff S. Ng P.C. Predicting the effects of coding non-synonymous variants on protein function using the SIFT algorithm.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar), can suggest whether a mutation is “potentially damaging,” but this categorization cannot distinguish between activating and inactivating mutations. Most mutations in lymphomas have been functionally analyzed in overexpression studies and, short of generating knock-in mice, methods to readily interrogate mutations in a B lymphoid context to distinguish between potential passengers and drivers of lymphomagenesis have not been described. Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats) technology have been used to generate mutations in human-induced pluripotent cells (22.Ding Q.

We show here that the K171E and K171T IKKβ proteins result in the constitutive activation of NFκB in an activation loop phosphorylation-independent manner. Molecular modeling was used to predict the mechanism of constitutive activation by these two distinct mutations, and the predictions were confirmed biochemically in overexpression studies. Confirmation of the potential contribution of activating mutations to lymphomagenesis was obtained in a B lymphoid cell line and non-overexpression context by TALEN-based knock-in mutagenesis of the tumor-specific K171E IKKβ alteration in human BJAB B cells. Xpress-tagged pcDNA3.1/His C-IKKβ was kindly provided by S. Ghosh and used as a template to generate IKKβ mutants.

Mouse Anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. An anti-β-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Hela cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well culture plates and transiently transfected with WT-IKKβ, K171E-IKKβ, and K171T-IKKβ DNAs. Cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized for 5 min with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40. After washing three times with PBS containing 10 mm glycine, cell were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA for 30 min. Immunostaining was performed using antibodies as indicated in Fig. 1C, and images were acquired using a Olympus IX81 spinning disk confocal microscope. Immunofluorescent pictures were analyzed using ImageJ software (developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) as reported previously (25.Henderson B.R.

To more objectively quantify the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution, confocal images were acquired for at least 100 cells from untransfected cells and cells transfected with each construct, respectively. The representative confocal cross-sections (8-bit grayscale or 24- bit RGB) were converted to TIFF files and used to determine the ratio of fluorescence in the cytoplasm relative to the nucleus. Mean pixel density was assessed for manually cropped areas of uniform intensity in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and ratios were determined after subtraction from background fluorescence. According to the ratios, cells were categorized as follows: <0.75 (predominantly cytoplasmic), 0.75–1.25 (nuclear and cytoplasmic), and >1.25 (predominantly nuclear). Hela cells were transiently transfected with the pBII×Luc NFκB reporter construct containing firefly luciferase under the control of four NFκB binding sites. A Renilla luciferase reporter construct, pRL-TK (Promega) was used as an internal control to normalize for transfection. Cells were assessed after 48 h post-transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hela cells were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Xpress-tagged WT and mutated IKKβ proteins in HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibody, and then incubated in a 20-µl kinase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 10 µm ATP. After adding 1 mm GST-IκBα as a substrate and 0.2 mm ATP (10 mCi/ml), the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 20 µl 4× SDS-loading buffer and then subjected to Western blotting using anti-GST, anti-IκBα, anti- phospho-IκBα (Ser-32/36), and anti-Xpress antibodies. The structures of K171E and K171T IKKβ kinase domains were modeled based on the recently published structure of human IKKβ (27.Liu S. Misquitta Y.R. Olland A. Johnson M.A. Kelleher K.S. Kriz R.

The figures for the structural models were generated in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC). TALENs were designed using the ZiFiT Targeter web server, such that the nucleotide to be altered, to create the K171E and K171T changes, lay within the “spacer” region that is flanked by the two TALEN binding sites. The TALEN monomers were designed to bind to 18 base pair target sites that are 16 base pairs apart. This configuration was used because it has been shown to function robustly (29.Reyon D. Tsai S.Q.

These fragments were then cloned into expression vectors that provide the required Δ152 amino acid N terminus, the final 0.5 repeat domain, the +63 amino acid C terminus, and the fokI endonuclease domain. These constructs were then sequences verified as described (30.Reyon D. Maeder M.L. Khayter C. Tsai S.Q. Foley J.E. Sander J.D. Joung J.K.

The 1.5-kb DNA fragment the IKKβ K171E mutation was amplified out of genomic DNA by nested PCR (Table 3). 3′ Adenosine overhangs were added to nested PCR products by adding 1 µl of Taq polymerase and incubating at 72 °C for 9 min. PCR products were then cloned into TOPO TA vector according to the TOPO TA Cloning protocol from Invitrogen. Site-direct mutagenesis was performed as mentioned before on 1.5-kb genomic DNA inserts in TOPO-TA. Colonies with successful ligations were grown in large volumes, and donor template DNA was extracted using Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Prep Kit.TABLE 3Primers for TALEN donor template constructionPrimer namePrimer orientationSequenceK171E nested FPSenseTTGTTGCAGATTGAGGCAAGK171E nested RPAntisenseGCAGGTCTTCCTGTGTGTGAK171E 1.5 kb F BamH1SenseAAAAAGGATCCCGCCTCTGACTCTAAATGGK171E 1.5 kb R AgeIAntisenseAAAAAACCGGTGCCCTTTTCACCTCCTTACCK171E mut.

Nucleofection of cells was carried out using Program E-23, and cells were diluted into 2 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 48 h. FACS sorting was performed by gating on the red fluorescent protein-positive cell population. Cells were grown in 10 ml complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol until red fluorescence was lost, at which point they were diluted to 0.1 cell/well and 0.2 cell/well dilutions in 96-well plates. Single cell colonies were screened by sequencing, and gene modification of endogenous IKKβ was demonstrated using Mutation Surveyor DNA variant analysis software (Softgenetics). WT BJAB, K171E/WT BJAB, and K171E/K171E BJAB cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 per well and were either left untreated or treated with 1 µm staurosporine for 16 h. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in annexin V-binding buffer (Biolegend), and stained with pacific blue-conjugated annexin V (Biolegend) and propidium iodide (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 10 min and then sorted by flow cytometry using a MACSQuant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotech). Annexin V- positive, propidium iodide-negative cells are early apoptotic cells. Cells that were propidium iodide-positive as well as annexin V-positive are late apoptotic or dead cells. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), 1 µg RNA sample were reverse transcribed with Retro-Script MMLV reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA stock was diluted into 200 µl, and 2 µl was used for PCR using primers (Table 4) and SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI). β-Actin gene expression was determined for normalization. Real-time PCR was performed in duplicate using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) as follows: hold 50 °C for 1 min; hold 95 °C 15 min; 40 cycles (95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min). Results were collected with 7500 software (Applied Biosystems), and relative quantification was performed using the comparative threshold (CT) method. Transcript levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels (ΔCT), and the normalized data were used to determined changes in gene expression (2−ΔΔCT). To analyze the difference between WT and mutants, WT samples were set as a calibrator (control).TABLE 4Primers for quantitative real-time RT-PCR and ChIP quantitative real-time PCRPrimer namesPrimer orientationSequenceQuantitative real-time RT-PCRBCL2-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-TCCGCATCAGGAAGGCTAGA-3′BCL2-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-AGGACCAGGCCTCCAAGCT-3′BCL2L1-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-CCCAGGGACAGCATATCAGA-3′BCL2L1-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-CTCCTTGTCTACGCTTTCCAC-3′BCL2A1-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-AGGCTGGCTCAGGACTATCT-3′BCL2A1-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-TGTTCTGGCAGTGTCTACGG-3′CFLAR-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-TCAAGGAGCAGGGACAAGTTA-3′CFLAR-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-GACAATGGGCATAGGGTGTTATC-3′BIRC5-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-GCACCACTTCCAGGGTTTAT-3′BIRC5-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-GCCACTGTTACCAGCAGCAC-3′XIAP-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-CCTTGTGATCGTGCCTGGTC-3′XIAP-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-CCCTCCTCCACAGTGAAAGC-3′ACTIN-RT-PCR-FPSense5′-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3′ACTIN-RT-PCR-RPAntisense5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3′ChIP quantitative real-time PCRB-actin-ChIP-F"

Using a genome-wide approach, we have analyzed gene expression in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells treated with the novel mithramycin analogue DIG-MSK (demycarosyl-3D-β-D-digitoxosyl-mithramycin SK) that binds to C+G-rich DNA sequences. Nanomolar concentrations of DIG-MSK abrogated the expression of genes involved in a variety of cell processes including transcription regulation and tumor development, which resulted in cell death. Some of those genes have been associated with cell proliferation and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. Sp1 transcription factor regulated most of the genes that were down-regulated by the drug, as well as the up-regulation of other genes mainly involved in response to cell stress. The effect of DIG-MSK in the control of gene expression by other transcription factors was also explored. Some of them, such as CREB, E2F and EGR1, also recognize C/G-rich regions in gene promoters, which encompass potential DIG-MSK binding sites. DIG-MSK affected several biological processes and molecular functions related to transcription and its cellular regulation in A2780 cells, including transcription factor activity. This new compound might be a promising drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer."

Functionally, inhibition of either MRCK or LRAP25 resulted in a marked suppression of LIMK1 activity and down-regulation of cofilin phosphorylation in response to aluminum fluoride induction in B16-F1 cells, which eventually resulted in deregulation of lamellipodial F-actin and reorganization of cytoskeletal structures causing defects in cell polarization and motility. These biochemical and functional characterizations thus underline the functional relevance of the LRAP25-MRCK complex in LIMK1-cofilin signaling and the importance of LRAP adaptors as key determinants of MRCK cellular localization and downstream specificities.

https://openalex.org/W2116148807,"Virus particles (virions) often contain not only virus-encoded but also host-encoded proteins. Some of these host proteins are enclosed within the virion structure, while others, in the case of enveloped viruses, are embedded in the host-derived membrane. While many of these host protein incorporations are likely accidental, some may play a role in virus infectivity, replication and/or immunoreactivity in the next host. Host protein incorporations may be especially important in therapeutic applications where large numbers of virus particles are administered. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the prototypic rhabdovirus and a candidate vaccine, gene therapy and oncolytic vector. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined cell type dependent host protein content of VSV virions using intact (""whole"") virions purified from three cell lines originating from different species. Here we aimed to determine the localization of host proteins within the VSV virions by analyzing: i) whole VSV virions; and ii) whole VSV virions treated with Proteinase K to remove all proteins outside the viral envelope. A total of 257 proteins were identified, with 181 identified in whole virions and 183 identified in Proteinase K treated virions. Most of these proteins have not been previously shown to be associated with VSV. Functional enrichment analysis indicated the most overrepresented categories were proteins associated with vesicles, vesicle-mediated transport and protein localization. Using western blotting, the presence of several host proteins, including some not previously shown in association with VSV (such as Yes1, Prl1 and Ddx3y), was confirmed and their relative quantities in various virion fractions determined. Our study provides a valuable inventory of virion-associated host proteins for further investigation of their roles in the replication cycle, pathogenesis and immunoreactivity of VSV."

In MLII, the loss of this marker leads to deficiency of multiple enzymes and non-enzymatic proteins in the lysosome, leading to the storage of multiple substrates. Here we present a novel mouse model of MLII homozygous for a patient mutation in the GNPTAB gene. Whereas the current gene knock-out mouse model of MLII lacks some of the characteristic features of the human disease, our novel mouse model more fully recapitulates the human pathology, showing growth retardation, skeletal and facial abnormalities, increased circulating lysosomal enzymatic activities, intracellular lysosomal storage, and reduced life span. Importantly, MLII behavioral deficits are characterized for the first time, including impaired motor function and psychomotor retardation. Histological analysis of the brain revealed progressive neurodegeneration in the cerebellum with severe Purkinje cell loss as the underlying cause of the ataxic gait. In addition, based on the loss of Npc2 (Niemann-Pick type C 2) protein expression in the brain, the mice were treated with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, a drug previously reported to rescue Purkinje cell death in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C disease. No improvement in brain pathology was observed. This indicates that cerebellar degeneration is not primarily triggered by loss of Npc2 function.

Samples from 52 arthropod species/taxa belonging to 42 families in 10 orders were analysed for their Cry1Ac content using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 22 species/taxa for which three samples were analysed, toxin concentration was highest in the grasshopper Atractomorpha sinensis and represented about 50% of the concentration in soybean leaves. Other species/taxa did not contain detectable toxin or contained a concentration that was between 1 and 10% of that detected in leaves. These Cry1Ac-positive arthropods included a number of mesophyll-feeding Hemiptera, a cicadellid, a curculionid beetle and, among the predators, a thomisid spider and an unidentified predatory bug belonging to the Anthocoridae. Within an arthropod species/taxon, the Cry1Ac content sometimes varied between life stages (nymphs/larvae vs. adults) and sampling dates (before, during, and after flowering). Our study is the first to provide information on Cry1Ac-expression levels in soybean plants and Cry1Ac concentrations in non-target arthropods in Chinese soybean fields. The data will be useful for assessing the risk of non-target arthropod exposure to Cry1Ac in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2093071358,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) have been reported to have memory enhancement effects in humans. A neuro-stimulatory action and an anti-cortisol mechanism of action may contribute to that relation. In order to study DHEA, DHEAS and cortisol relations to working memory and distraction, we recorded the electroencephalogram of 23 young women performing a discrimination (no working memory load) or 1-back (working memory load) task in an audio-visual oddball paradigm. We measured salivary DHEA, DHEAS and cortisol both before each task and at 30 and 60 min. Under working memory load, a higher baseline cortisol/DHEA ratio was related to higher distraction as indexed by an enhanced novelty P3. This suggests that cortisol may lead to increased distraction whereas DHEA may hinder distraction by leading to less processing of the distractor. An increased DHEA production with consecutive cognitive tasks was found and higher DHEA responses attributed to working memory load were related to enhanced working memory processing as indexed by an enhanced visual P300. Overall, the results suggest that in women DHEA may oppose cortisol effects reducing distraction and that a higher DHEA response may enhance working memory at the electrophysiological level."
https://openalex.org/W1987122230,"Bacteriophage lambda is a classic system for the study of cellular decision making. Both experiments and mathematical models have demonstrated the importance of viral concentration in the lysis-lysogeny decision outcome in lambda phage. However, a recent experimental study using single cell and single phage resolution reported that cells with the same viral concentrations but different numbers of infecting phage (multiplicity of infection) can have markedly different rates of lysogeny. Thus the decision depends on not only viral concentration, but also directly on the number of infecting phage. Here, we attempt to provide a mechanistic explanation of these results using a simple stochastic model of the lambda phage genetic network. Several potential factors including intrinsic gene expression noise, spatial dynamics and cell-cycle effects are investigated. We find that interplay between the level of intrinsic noise and viral protein decision threshold is a major factor that produces dependence on multiplicity of infection. However, simulations suggest spatial segregation of phage particles does not play a significant role. Cellular image processing is used to re-analyse the original time-lapse movies from the recent study and it is found that higher numbers of infecting phage reduce the cell elongation rate. This could also contribute to the observed phenomena as cellular growth rate can affect transcription rates. Our model further predicts that rate of lysogeny is dependent on bacterial growth rate, which can be experimentally tested. Our study provides new insight on the mechanisms of individual phage decision making. More generally, our results are relevant for the understanding of gene-dosage compensation in cellular systems."
https://openalex.org/W1999441466,"TRIM11 has been reported to be able to restrict HIV-1 replication, but the detailed aspects of the interfering mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that TRIM11 mainly suppressed the early steps of HIV-1 transduction, resulting in decreased reverse transcripts. Additionally, we found that TRIM11 could inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity, which may be related to its inhibitory effects on NF-κB. Deletion mutant experiments showed that the RING domain of TRIM11 was indispensable in inhibiting the early steps of HIV-1 transduction but was dispensable in decreasing NF-κB and LTR activities. Moreover, we found that low levels of Vpr decreased TRIM11 protein levels, while high levels increased them, and these regulations were independent of the VprBP-associated proteasome machinery. These results suggest that the antiviral factor TRIM11 is indirectly regulated by HIV-1 Vpr through unknown mechanisms and that the concentration of Vpr is essential to these processes. Thus, our work confirms TRIM11 as a host cellular factor that interferes with the early steps of HIV-1 replication and provides a connection between viral protein and host antiviral factors."
https://openalex.org/W1983108788,"The role of HIV-1 minority variants on transmission, pathogenesis, and virologic failure to antiretroviral regimens has been explored; however, most studies of low-level HIV-1 drug-resistant variants have focused in single target regions. Here we used a novel HIV-1 genotypic assay based on deep sequencing, DEEPGEN (Gibson et al 2014 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 58∶2167) to simultaneously analyze the presence of minority variants carrying mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase strand transfer integrase inhibitors (INSTIs), as well as HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/INT and env/C2V3 PCR products were obtained from twelve heavily treatment-experienced patients experiencing virologic failure while participating in a 48-week dose-ranging study of elvitegravir (GS-US-183-0105). Deep sequencing results were compared with (i) virological response to treatment, (ii) genotyping based on population sequencing, (iii) phenotyping data using PhenoSense and VIRALARTS, and (iv) HIV-1 coreceptor tropism based on the phenotypic test VERITROP. Most patients failed the antiretroviral regimen with numerous pre-existing mutations in the PR and RT, and additionally newly acquired INSTI-resistance mutations as determined by population sequencing (mean 9.4, 5.3, and 1.4 PI- RTI-, and INSTI-resistance mutations, respectively). Interestingly, since DEEPGEN allows the accurate detection of amino acid substitutions at frequencies as low as 1% of the population, a series of additional drug resistance mutations were detected by deep sequencing (mean 2.5, 1.5, and 0.9, respectively). The presence of these low-abundance HIV-1 variants was associated with drug susceptibility, replicative fitness, and coreceptor tropism determined using sensitive phenotypic assays, enhancing the overall burden of resistance to all four antiretroviral drug classes. Further longitudinal studies based on deep sequencing tests will help to clarify (i) the potential impact of minority HIV-1 drug resistant variants in response to antiretroviral therapy and (ii) the importance of the detection of HIV minority variants in the clinical practice."

We searched the target genes of Runx2, which is an essential transcription factor for chondrocyte maturation, in chondrocytes and found that Galnt3 expression was up-regulated by Runx2 and severely reduced in Runx2(-/-) cartilaginous skeletons. To investigate the function of Galnt3 in chondrocytes, we generated Galnt3(-/-) mice and chondrocyte-specific Galnt3 transgenic mice under the control of the Col2a1 promoter-enhancer. Galnt3(-/-) mice showed a delay in endochondral ossification and shortened limbs at embryonic day 16.5, suggesting that Galnt3 is involved in chondrocyte maturation. Galnt3 transgenic mice presented dwarfism, the chondrocyte maturation was retarded, the cell cycle in chondrocytes was accelerated, premature chondrocyte apoptosis occurred, and the growth plates were disorganized. The binding of Vicia villosa agglutinin, which recognizes the Tn antigen (GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr), was drastically increased in chondrocytes, and aggrecan (Acan) was highly enriched with Tn antigen. However, safranin O staining, which recognizes glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and Acan were severely reduced. Chondroitin sulfate was reduced in amount, but the elongation of chondroitin sulfate chains had not been severely disturbed in the isolated GAGs. These findings indicate that overexpression of Galnt3 in chondrocytes caused dwarfism due to the increase of mucin-type O-glycans and the reduction of GAGs, probably through competition with xylosyltransferases, which initiate GAG chains by attaching O-linked xylose to serine residues, suggesting a negative effect of Galnt family proteins on Acan deposition in addition to the positive effect of Galnt3 on chondrocyte maturation."

The present study was carried out to analyze the association of Pfcrt-K76T and Pfmdr1-N86Y mutations with CQ resistance in Northeast Indian P. falciparum isolates. 115 P. falciparum isolates were subjected to in vitro CQ sensitivity testing and PCR-RFLP analysis for the Pfmdr1-N86Y and Pfcrt-K76T mutations. 100 isolates of P. falciparum were found to be resistant to CQ by the in vitro susceptibility test (geometric mean EC50 2.21 µM/L blood) while 15 were found to be CQ sensitive (geometric mean EC50 0.32 µM/L blood). All the CQ resistant isolates showed the presence of Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt mutations. CQ sensitive isolates were negative for these mutations. Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between the alleles at these two loci (Pfmdr1-N86Y and Pfcrt-K76T). The results indicate that Pfmdr1-N86Y and Pfcrt-K76T mutations can be used as molecular markers to identify CQ resistance in P. falciparum.

However, such models do not satisfy the need for health intervention in adolescents. The identification of key factors influencing adolescents' health literacy is essential in developing effective prevention and intervention measures. This study aimed to test a theoretical model of predictors on health skills and health behaviors in adolescents. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Guangdong using a multi-stage stratified cluster sample design. A representative random sample of 3821 students aged 13–25 years was selected using multi-stage stratified cluster sampling. The path analysis was used to test a hypothesized model of health literacy. Results The path analysis showed that knowledge of infectious disease (β = 0.26), health skills (β = 0.22), health concept (β = 0.20), general health knowledge (β = 0.15), gender (β = 0.12), and school performance (β = 0.06) had positive direct effect on health behaviors in adolescents. The explanatory variables accounted for 43% of the variance in explaining health behaviors. Knowledge of infectious disease (β = 0.30), health concept (β = 0.17), general health knowledge (β = 0.13), and school performance (β = 0.05) had positive indirect effect on health behaviors through the impacts on health skills. Conclusion This study identified several direct and indirect factors influencing health skills and health behaviors in adolescents.

https://openalex.org/W1978505760,"To understand the role of cytokine and growth factor receptor-mediated signaling in leukemia pathogenesis, we designed a functional RNA interference (RNAi) screen targeting 188 cytokine and growth factor receptors that we found highly expressed in primary leukemia specimens. Using this screen, we identified interleukin-2 gamma receptor (IL2Rγ) as a critical growth determinant for a JAK3(A572V) mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia cell line. We observed that knockdown of IL2Rγ abrogates phosphorylation of JAK3 and downstream signaling molecules, JAK1, STAT5, MAPK and pS6 ribosomal protein. Overexpression of IL2Rγ in murine cells increased the transforming potential of activating JAK3 mutations, whereas absence of IL2Rγ completely abrogated the clonogenic potential of JAK3(A572V), as well as the transforming potential of additional JAK3-activating mutations such as JAK3(M511I). In addition, mutation at the IL2Rγ interaction site in the FERM domain of JAK3 (Y100C) completely abrogated JAK3-mediated leukemic transformation. Mechanistically, we found IL2Rγ contributes to constitutive JAK3 mutant signaling by increasing JAK3 expression and phosphorylation. Conversely, we found that mutant, but not wild-type JAK3, increased the expression of IL2Rγ, indicating IL2Rγ and JAK3 contribute to constitutive JAK/STAT signaling through their reciprocal regulation. Overall, we demonstrate a novel role for IL2Rγ in potentiating oncogenesis in the setting of JAK3-mutation-positive leukemia. In addition, our study highlights an RNAi-based functional assay that can be used to facilitate the identification of non-kinase cytokine and growth factor receptor targets for inhibiting leukemic cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1987660718,"Background CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor that promotes hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) also stimulates the hypertrophic transition of chondrocytes. Furthermore, runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) was reported to regulate chondrocyte maturation during skeletal development and to directly regulate transcriptional activity of Ihh. In this study, we investigated whether the interaction of C/EBPβ and RUNX2 regulates the expression of Ihh during chondrocyte differentiation. Methodology/Results Immunohistochemistry of embryonic growth plate revealed that both C/EBPβ and Ihh were strongly expressed in pre-hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Overexpression of C/EBPβ by adenovirus vector in ATDC5 cells caused marked stimulation of Ihh and Runx2. Conversely, knockdown of C/EBPβ by lentivirus expressing shRNA significantly repressed Ihh and Runx2 in ATDC5 cells. A reporter assay revealed that C/EBPβ stimulated transcriptional activity of Ihh. Deletion and mutation analysis showed that the C/EBPβ responsive element was located between −214 and −210 bp in the Ihh promoter. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay also revealed the direct binding of C/EBPβ to this region. Moreover, reporter assays demonstrated that RUNX2 failed to stimulate the transcriptional activity of the Ihh promoter harboring a mutation at the C/EBPβ binding site. EMSA and ChIP assays showed that RUNX2 interacted to this element with C/EBPβ. Immunoprecipitation revealed that RUNX2 and C/EBPβ formed heterodimer complex with each other in the nuclei of chondrocytes. These data suggested that the C/EBPβ binding element is also important for RUNX2 to regulate the expression of Ihh. Ex vivo organ culture of mouse limbs transfected with C/EBPβ showed that the expression of Ihh and RUNX2 was increased upon ectopic C/EBPβ expression. Conclusions C/EBPβ and RUNX2 cooperatively stimulate expression of Ihh through direct interactions with a C/EBPβ binding element, which further promotes hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes during the chondrocyte differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W1995194873,"Integration, one of the hallmarks of retrovirus replication, is mediated by a nucleoprotein complex called the preintegration complex (PIC), in which viral DNA is associated with many protein components that are required for completion of the early phase of infection. A striking feature of the PIC is its powerful integration activity in vitro. The PICs from a freshly isolated cytoplasmic extract of infected cells are able to insert viral DNA into exogenously added target DNA in vitro. Therefore, a PIC-based in vitro assay is a reliable system for assessing protein factors influencing retroviral integration. In this study, we applied a microtiter plate-based in vitro assay to a screening study using a protein library that was produced by the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. Using a library of human E3 ubiquitin ligases, we identified RFPL3 as a potential stimulator of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) PIC integration activity in vitro. This enhancement of PIC activity by RFPL3 was likely to be attributed to its N-terminal RING domain. To further understand the functional role of RFPL3 in HIV infection, we created a human cell line overexpressing RFPL3. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that RFPL3 was associated with the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 PICs in infected cells. More importantly, single-round HIV-1 infection was enhanced significantly by RFPL3 expression. Our proteomic approach displays an advantage in the identification of new cellular proteins affecting the integration activity of the PIC and, therefore, contributes to the understanding of functional interaction between retroviral integration complexes and host factors."
https://openalex.org/W2066841492,"The precise molecular mechanisms enabling cancer cells to metastasize from the primary tumor to different tissue locations are still largely unknown. Secretion of some proteins by metastatic cells could facilitate metastasis formation. The comparison of secreted proteins from cancer cells with different metastatic capabilities in vivo might provide insight into proteins involved in the metastatic process. Comparison of the secreted proteins from the mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 and its highly metastatic 4T1.2 clone revealed a prominent differentially secreted protein which was identified as SLPI (secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor). Western blotting indicated higher levels of the protein in both conditioned media and whole cell lysates of 4T1.2 cells. Additionally higher levels of SLPI were also observed in 4T1.2 breast tumors in vivo following immunohistochemical staining. A comparison of SLPI mRNA levels by gene profiling using microarrays and RT-PCR did not detect major differences in SLPI gene expression between the 4T1 and 4T1.2 cells indicating that SLPI secretion is regulated at the protein level. Our results demonstrate that secretion of SLPI is drastically increased in highly metastatic cells, suggesting a possible role for SLPI in enhancing the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cell line 4T1."
