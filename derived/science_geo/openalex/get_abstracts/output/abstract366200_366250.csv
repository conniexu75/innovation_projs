https://openalex.org/W2160253662,"We have developed a protocol to assemble in one step and one tube at least nine separate DNA fragments together into an acceptor vector, with 90% of recombinant clones obtained containing the desired construct. This protocol is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes and is performed by simply subjecting a mix of 10 undigested input plasmids (nine insert plasmids and the acceptor vector) to a restriction-ligation and transforming the resulting mix in competent cells. The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity. This protocol, that we call ‘Golden Gate shuffling’, is robust, simple and efficient, can be performed with templates that have no homology, and can be combined with other shuffling protocols in order to introduce any variation in any part of a given gene."
https://openalex.org/W2021488944,"Following initiation of the heartbeat in vertebrate embryos, cells lining the aorta, the placental vessels and the umbilical and vitelline arteries begin to form haematopoietic cells. It has been suggested that biomechanical forces imposed on the vascular wall by the heartbeat, which sets up vascular flow and wall shear stress, could be the cue for the production of these early blood cells. Working with mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated in vitro and in mouse embryos, Adamo et al. show that exposure to fluid shear stress increases haematopoietic colony-forming potential and expression of haematopoietic markers both in vitro and in vivo. The confirmation of a link between the initiation of vascular flow and embryonic blood cell development provides new pointers for research on the production of haematopoietic progenitors for possible use in stem-cell-based therapies. Following initiation of the heartbeat in vertebrate embryos, cells lining the aorta, the placental vessels, and the umbilical and vitelline arteries begin to form haematopoietic cells. Here it is shown that biochemical forces imposed on the vascular wall at this developmental stage strongly influence development of early blood cells and that abrogation of nitric oxide—a mediator of shear-stress-induced signalling—compromises haematopoietic potential in vitro and in vivo. Biomechanical forces are emerging as critical regulators of embryogenesis, particularly in the developing cardiovascular system1,2. After initiation of the heartbeat in vertebrates, cells lining the ventral aspect of the dorsal aorta, the placental vessels, and the umbilical and vitelline arteries initiate expression of the transcription factor Runx1 (refs 3–5), a master regulator of haematopoiesis, and give rise to haematopoietic cells4. It remains unknown whether the biomechanical forces imposed on the vascular wall at this developmental stage act as a determinant of haematopoietic potential6. Here, using mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated in vitro, we show that fluid shear stress increases the expression of Runx1 in CD41+c-Kit+ haematopoietic progenitor cells7, concomitantly augmenting their haematopoietic colony-forming potential. Moreover, we find that shear stress increases haematopoietic colony-forming potential and expression of haematopoietic markers in the para-aortic splanchnopleura/aorta–gonads–mesonephros of mouse embryos and that abrogation of nitric oxide, a mediator of shear-stress-induced signalling8, compromises haematopoietic potential in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data reveal a critical role for biomechanical forces in haematopoietic development."

This prospective study aimed to identify modifiable risk factors for falling in older people with mild to moderate dementia.179 participants aged over 65 years were recruited from outpatient clinics in the UK (38 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 32 Vascular dementia (VAD), 30 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 40 Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), 39 healthy controls). A multifactorial assessment of baseline risk factors was performed and fall diaries were completed prospectively for 12 months. Dementia participants experienced nearly 8 times more incident falls (9118/1000 person-years) than controls (1023/1000 person-years; incidence density ratio: 7.58, 3.11-18.5). In dementia, significant univariate predictors of sustaining at least one fall included diagnosis of Lewy body disorder (proportional hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age and sex: 3.33, 2.11-5.26), and history of falls in the preceding 12 months (HR: 2.52, 1.52-4.17). In multivariate analyses, significant potentially modifiable predictors were symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (HR: 2.13, 1.19-3.80), autonomic symptom score (HR per point 0-36: 1.055, 1.012-1.099), and Cornell depression score (HR per point 0-40: 1.053, 1.01-1.099). Higher levels of physical activity were protective (HR per point 0-9: 0.827, 0.716-0.956).The management of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, autonomic symptoms and depression, and the encouragement of physical activity may provide the core elements for the most fruitful strategy to reduce falls in people with dementia. Randomised controlled trials to assess such a strategy are a priority."

https://openalex.org/W2087291014,"Background The mechanisms through which aberrant α-synuclein (ASYN) leads to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) are uncertain. In isolated liver lysosomes, mutant ASYNs impair Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA), a targeted lysosomal degradation pathway; however, whether this occurs in a cellular context, and whether it mediates ASYN toxicity, is unknown. We have investigated presently the effects of WT or mutant ASYN on the lysosomal pathways of CMA and macroautophagy in neuronal cells and assessed their impact on ASYN-mediated toxicity. Methods and Findings Novel inducible SH-SY5Y and PC12 cell lines expressing human WT and A53T ASYN, as well as two mutant forms that lack the CMA-targeting motif were generated. Such forms were also expressed in primary cortical neurons, using adenoviral transduction. In each case, effects on long-lived protein degradation, LC3 II levels (as a macroautophagy index), and cell death and survival were assessed. In both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cycling cells, induction of A53T ASYN evoked a significant decrease in lysosomal degradation, largely due to CMA impairment. In neuronally differentiated SH-SH5Y cells, both WT and A53T ASYN induction resulted in gradual toxicity, which was partly dependent on CMA impairment and compensatory macroautophagy induction. In primary neurons both WT and A53T ASYN were toxic, but only in the case of A53T ASYN did CMA dysfunction and compensatory macroautophagy induction occur and participate in death. Conclusions Expression of mutant A53T, and, in some cases, WT ASYN in neuronal cells leads to CMA dysfunction, and this in turn leads to compensatory induction of macroautophagy. Inhibition of these lysosomal effects mitigates ASYN toxicity. Therefore, CMA dysfunction mediates aberrant ASYN toxicity, and may be a target for therapeutic intervention in PD and related disorders. Furthermore, macroautophagy induction in the context of ASYN over-expression, in contrast to other settings, appears to be a detrimental response, leading to neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W1968369755,"In both natural and artificial environments, bacteria predominantly grow in biofilms, and bacteria often disperse from biofilms as freely suspended single-cells. In the present study, the formation and dispersal of planktonic cellular aggregates, or 'suspended biofilms', by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in liquid batch cultures were closely examined, and compared to biofilm formation on a matrix of polyester (PE) fibers as solid surface in batch cultures. Plankton samples were analyzed by laser-diffraction particle-size scanning (LDA) and microscopy of aggregates. Interestingly, LDA indicated that up to 90% of the total planktonic biomass consisted of cellular aggregates in the size range of 10-400 microm in diameter during the growth phase, as opposed to individual cells. In cultures with PE surfaces, P. aeruginosa preferred to grow in biofilms, as opposed to planktonicly. However, upon carbon, nitrogen or oxygen limitation, the planktonic aggregates and PE-attached biofilms dispersed into single cells, resulting in an increase in optical density (OD) independent of cellular growth. During growth, planktonic aggregates and PE-attached biofilms contained densely packed viable cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA), and starvation resulted in a loss of viable cells, and an increase in dead cells and eDNA. Furthermore, a release of metabolites and infective bacteriophage into the culture supernatant, and a marked decrease in intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP, was observed in dispersing cultures. Thus, what traditionally has been described as planktonic, individual cell cultures of P. aeruginosa, are in fact suspended biofilms, and such aggregates have behaviors and responses (e.g. dispersal) similar to surface associated biofilms. In addition, we suggest that this planktonic biofilm model system can provide the basis for a detailed analysis of the synchronized biofilm life cycle of P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W1990862009,"The extraordinary diversification of angiosperm plants in the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods has produced an estimated 250,000-300,000 living angiosperm species and has fundamentally altered terrestrial ecosystems. Interactions with animals as pollinators or seed dispersers have long been suspected as drivers of angiosperm diversification, yet empirical examples remain sparse or inconclusive. Seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) may drive diversification as it can reduce extinction by providing selective advantages to plants and can increase speciation by enhancing geographical isolation by extremely limited dispersal distances.Using the most comprehensive sister-group comparison to date, we tested the hypothesis that myrmecochory leads to higher diversification rates in angiosperm plants. As predicted, diversification rates were substantially higher in ant-dispersed plants than in their non-myrmecochorous relatives. Data from 101 angiosperm lineages in 241 genera from all continents except Antarctica revealed that ant-dispersed lineages contained on average more than twice as many species as did their non-myrmecochorous sister groups. Contrasts in species diversity between sister groups demonstrated that diversification rates did not depend on seed dispersal mode in the sister group and were higher in myrmecochorous lineages in most biogeographic regions.Myrmecochory, which has evolved independently at least 100 times in angiosperms and is estimated to be present in at least 77 families and 11 000 species, is a key evolutionary innovation and a globally important driver of plant diversity. Myrmecochory provides the best example to date for a consistent effect of any mutualism on large-scale diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2000833088,"Background Multiple studies have shown that plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in patients with important and prevalent adverse health conditions, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and frailty. Higher plasma levels of IL-6, in turn, increase the risk of many conditions associated with aging including age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms underlying this association between IL-6 and cognitive vulnerability remain unclear. Methods and Findings We investigated the role of IL-6 in brain aging in young (4 mo) and aged (24 mo) wild-type C57BL6 and genetically-matched IL-6−/− mice, and determined that IL-6 was necessary and sufficient for increased neuronal expression of the superoxide-producing immune enzyme, NADPH-oxidase, and this was mediated by non-canonical NFκB signaling. Furthermore, superoxide production by NADPH-oxidase was directly responsible for age-related loss of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, neurons essential for normal information processing, encoding, and retrieval in hippocampus and cortex. Targeted deletion of IL-6 or elimination of superoxide by chronic treatment with a superoxide-dismutase mimetic prevented age-related loss of PV-interneurons and reversed age-related cognitive deficits on three standard tests of spatial learning and recall. Conclusions Present results indicate that IL-6 mediates age-related loss of critical PV-expressing GABAergic interneurons through increased neuronal NADPH-oxidase-derived superoxide production, and that rescue of these interneurons preserves cognitive performance in aging mice, suggesting that elevated peripheral IL-6 levels may be directly and mechanistically linked to long-lasting cognitive deficits in even normal older individuals. Further, because PV-interneurons are also selectively affected by commonly used anesthetic agents and drugs, our findings imply that IL-6 levels may predict adverse CNS effects in older patients exposed to these compounds through specific derangements in inhibitory interneurons, and that therapies directed at lowering IL-6 may have cognitive benefits clinically."
https://openalex.org/W2134327816,"Background Mucosa-associated Escherichia coli are frequently found in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, but rarely in healthy controls. Chronic mucosal E. coli infection has therefore been linked to colonic tumourigenesis. E. coli strains carrying eae (encoding the bacterial adhesion protein intimin) attach intimately to the intestinal mucosa and are classed as attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC). Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are the most common form of AEEC identified in man. EPEC utilise a type III secretion system to translocate effector proteins into host cells and infection induces wide-ranging effects on the host cell proteome. We hypothesised that EPEC infection could influence molecular pathways involved in colorectal tumourigenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings When co-cultured with human colorectal cell lines, EPEC dramatically downregulated the expression of key DNA mismatch repair proteins MSH2 and MLH1 in an attachment specific manner. Cytochrome c staining and TUNEL analysis confirmed that this effect was not a consequence of apoptosis/necrosis. Ex vivo human colonic mucosa was co-cultured with EPEC and probed by immunofluorescence to locate adherent bacteria. EPEC entered 10% of colonic crypts and adhered to crypt epithelial cells, often in the proliferative compartment. Adenocarcinoma and normal colonic mucosa from colorectal cancer patients (n = 20) was probed by immunofluorescence and PCR for AEEC. Mucosa-associated E. coli were found on 10/20 (50%) adenocarcinomas and 3/20 (15%) normal mucosa samples (P<0.05). AEEC were detected on 5/20 (25%) adenocarcinomas, but not normal mucosa samples (P<0.05). Significance/Conclusions The ability of EPEC to downregulate DNA mismatch repair proteins represents a novel gene-environment interaction that could increase the susceptibility of colonic epithelial cells to mutations and therefore promote colonic tumourigenesis. The potential role of AEEC in colorectal tumourigenesis warrants further investigation."

We examined the association between hypertension and depression and anxiety in South Africa.Data come from a nationally-representative survey of adults (n = 4351). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to measure DSM-IV mental disorders during the previous 12-months. The relationships between self-reported hypertension and anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and comorbid anxiety-depression were assessed after adjustment for participant characteristics including experience of trauma and other chronic physical conditions.Overall 16.7% reported a previous medical diagnosis of hypertension, and 8.1% and 4.9% were found to have a 12-month anxiety or depressive disorder, respectively. In adjusted analyses, hypertension diagnosis was associated with 12-month anxiety disorders [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.55, 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.18] but not 12-month depressive disorders or 12-month comorbid anxiety-depression. Hypertension in the absence of other chronic physical conditions was not associated with any of the 12-month mental health outcomes (p-values all <0.05), while being diagnosed with both hypertension and another chronic physical condition were associated with 12-month anxiety disorders (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.46-3.45), but not 12-month depressive disorders or comorbid anxiety-depression.These are the first population-based estimates to demonstrate an association between hypertension and mental disorders in sub-Saharan Africa. Further investigation is needed into role of traumatic life events in the aetiology of hypertension as well as the temporality of the association between hypertension and mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1990692999,"Brucella ovis is a veterinary pathogen associated with epididymitis in sheep. Despite its genetic similarity to the zoonotic pathogens B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis, B. ovis does not cause zoonotic disease. Genomic analysis of the type strain ATCC25840 revealed a high percentage of pseudogenes and increased numbers of transposable elements compared to the zoonotic Brucella species, suggesting that genome degradation has occurred concomitant with narrowing of the host range of B. ovis. The absence of genomic island 2, encoding functions required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, as well as inactivation of genes encoding urease, nutrient uptake and utilization, and outer membrane proteins may be factors contributing to the avirulence of B. ovis for humans. A 26.5 kb region of B. ovis ATCC25840 Chromosome II was absent from all the sequenced human pathogenic Brucella genomes, but was present in all of 17 B. ovis isolates tested and in three B. ceti isolates, suggesting that this DNA region may be of use for differentiating B. ovis from other Brucella spp. This is the first genomic analysis of a non-zoonotic Brucella species. The results suggest that inactivation of genes involved in nutrient acquisition and utilization, cell envelope structure and urease may have played a role in narrowing of the tissue tropism and host range of B. ovis."
https://openalex.org/W2040640956,"Extracellular ATP controls key aspects of lung function via activation of epithelial cell purinergic receptors, but how ATP is released from cells remains poorly understood. To identify mechanistic components upstream of ATP release, we examined the effect of selected G protein coupled-receptor activation on ATP release from lung epithelial cells. The protease-activated receptor (PAR) agonist thrombin elicited a rapid Ca(2+)-dependent release of ATP from A549 cells. In contrast, the P2Y(2) receptor agonist UTP caused negligible ATP release, despite promoting a robust Ca(2+) response. Agonist-elicited ATP release was associated with Rho activation and was reduced in cells transfected with dominant negative mutants of p115-Rho GEF or RhoA, and by inhibitors of Rho kinase (ROCK). However, RhoA activation alone did not promote ATP release if temporally separated from Ca(2+) mobilization. PAR3 was the only PAR subtype detected in A549 cells by reverse transcription-PCR. Transfection of cells with human PAR3 cDNA increased thrombin-promoted ATP release, inositol phosphate formation, and RhoA activation. Conversely, small interference RNA against PAR3 diminished thrombin-evoked responses. Thrombin-elicited ATP release was accompanied by an enhanced cellular uptake of propidium iodide in a Ca(2+)- and ROCK-dependent manner and was inhibited by connexin/pannexin hemichannel blockers. Our data suggest that thrombin promotes ATP release from A549 cells via Rho- and Ca(2+)-dependent activation of connexin/pannexin hemichannels. The relevance of these findings is highlighted by the observation that exposure of primary cultures of well differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells to thrombin resulted in robust ATP release, which was inhibited by ROCK inhibitors and by connexin/pannexin hemichannel blockers."
https://openalex.org/W2104845020,"Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza viruses is recommended for certain individuals that have a high risk for complications resulting from infection with these viruses. Recently it was recommended in a number of countries including the USA to vaccinate all healthy children between 6 and 59 months of age as well. However, vaccination of immunologically naïve subjects against seasonal influenza may prevent the induction of heterosubtypic immunity against potentially pandemic strains of an alternative subtype, otherwise induced by infection with the seasonal strains. Here we show in a mouse model that the induction of protective heterosubtypic immunity by infection with a human A/H3N2 influenza virus is prevented by effective vaccination against the A/H3N2 strain. Consequently, vaccinated mice were no longer protected against a lethal infection with an avian A/H5N1 influenza virus. As a result H3N2-vaccinated mice continued to loose body weight after A/H5N1 infection, had 100-fold higher lung virus titers on day 7 post infection and more severe histopathological changes than mice that were not protected by vaccination against A/H3N2 influenza. The lack of protection correlated with reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses after A/H5N1 virus challenge infection. These findings may have implications for the general recommendation to vaccinate all healthy children against seasonal influenza in the light of the current pandemic threat caused by highly pathogenic avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2038219962,"Recently four new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E) were reported, and their effects on the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development were evaluated (Landstrom, A.

We performed actomyosin ATPase and spectroscopic solution studies to investigate the molecular properties of these mutations. Actomyosin ATPase activity was measured as a function of [Ca2+] utilizing reconstituted thin filaments (TFs) with 50% mutant and 50% wild type (WT) and 100% mutant cardiac troponin (cTn) complexes: A8V, C84Y, and D145E increased the Ca2+ sensitivity with only A8V demonstrating lowered Ca2+ sensitization at the 50% ratio when compared with 100%; E134D was the same as WT at both ratios. Of these four mutants, only D145E showed increased ATPase activation in the presence of Ca2+. None of the mutants affected ATPase inhibition or the binding of cTn to the TF measured by co-sedimentation. Only D145E increased the Ca2+ affinity of site II measured by 2-(4′-(2″-iodoacetamido)phenyl)aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid fluorescence in isolated cTnC or the cTn complex. In the presence of the TF, only A8V was further sensitized to Ca2+. Circular dichroism measurements in different metal-bound states of the isolated cTnCs showed changes in the secondary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E, whereas E134D was the same as WT. PyMol modeling of each cTnC mutant within the cTn complex revealed potential for local changes in the tertiary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E. Our results indicate that 1) three of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cTnC mutants increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilament; 2) the effects of the mutations on the Ca2+ affinity of isolated cTnC, cTn, and TF are not sufficient to explain the large Ca2+ sensitivity changes seen in reconstituted and fiber assays; and 3) changes in the secondary structure of the cTnC mutants may contribute to modified protein-protein interactions along the sarcomere lattice disrupting the coupling between the cross-bridge and Ca2+ binding to cTnC.

In cardiac muscle, the tropomyosin (Tm)·Tn complex, located in the thin filament, is responsible for muscle regulation (13.Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol.

Three Tn subunits are involved in this process: troponin T (TnT), which connects the Tn complex to the thin filament and is responsible for actomyosin ATPase activation in the presence of Ca2+ (8.Gomes A.V.

Potter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); and TnC, a subunit that plays a crucial function in muscle regulation triggering contraction upon binding Ca2+ and is also considered an important intracellular Ca2+ buffer (17.Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, London2001: 39-56Google Scholar, 18.Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+ binding to site II of cTnC, its N terminus is detached from the C terminus of cTnI, which under these conditions is bound to actin and inhibits muscle contraction. As Ca2+ binds to site II of cTnC, its N terminus binds to the C terminus of cTnI causing it to dissociate from actin. This is accompanied by the movement of cardiac Tm out of its inhibitory position on actin, thus relieving the inhibition of contraction (19.Gordon A.M. Regnier M. Homsher E. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 21.Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The dynamics of the interactions between Tn subunits and the thin filament that regulate contraction have been extensively studied (22.Lindhout D.A. Boyko R.F. Corson D.C. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14750-14759Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23.Hoffman R.M. Blumenschein T.M. Sykes B.D. J. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 352: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TnC consists of two globular regions that are connected by a long central helix (25.Herzberg O. James M.N. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). It is well known that cTnC has two EF-hands containing high affinity Ca2+ binding sites III and IV (∼107m−1) in the C terminus and only one functional low affinity Ca2+ binding site II (∼105m−1) in the N terminus (18.Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional feature of helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding proteins is the presence of short segments of antiparallel β-sheets between the Ca2+ binding loops of each domain (25.Herzberg O. James M.N. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 26.Moews P.C. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 201-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of cTnC can also bind Mg2+ competitively (∼103m−1) and is termed the structural domain because it is essential to keep it bound to the thin filament. The N terminus is considered the regulatory domain because Ca2+ binding to site II initiates muscle contraction. When TnC is in the Tn complex, the Ca2+ binding affinity at all sites is increased by ∼10-fold (18.Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Putkey J.A. Liu W. Lin X. Ahmed S. Zhang M. Potter J.D. Kerrick W.G.

Chem. 1980; 255: 9635-9640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that there is coupling between TnC and actomyosin ATPase. For example, bepridil and calmidazolium, two known Ca2+ sensitizers that bind to cTnC and enhance its Ca2+ binding affinity, also stimulate myofibrillar ATPase activity (29.Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar, 30.el-Saleh S.C. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the N-helix of the TnC N-domain diminishes activation of regulated actomyosin ATPase activity (31.Chandra M. da Silva E.F. Sorenson M.M. Ferro J.A. Pearlstone J.R. Nash B.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9857-9863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine the functional effects of the four newly discovered HCM cTnC mutations not previously addressed and to investigate possible changes in their structure and Ca2+ binding properties. To answer these questions we performed reconstituted ATPase activity, co-sedimentation, and spectroscopy assays. In the presence of 100% HCM mutant or wild type (WT) cTnC, the ATPase activity rate measured by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in an actomyosin·Tm·Tn reconstituted complex showed increases in Ca2+ sensitivity similar to those obtained previously with cardiac skinned fibers (9.Landstrom A.P. Parvatiyar M.S. Pinto J.R. Marquardt M.L. Bos J.M. Tester D.J. Ommen S.R. Potter J.D. Ackerman M.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 281-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At a ratio of 50% mutant to 50% WT, only A8V had a diminished Ca2+ sensitivity. We also evaluated the ability of the Tn HCM mutants to activate and inhibit the ATPase activity in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Only cTnC-D145E showed higher levels of ATPase activation. Co-sedimentation did not show changes in the ability of the Tn complex containing the cTnC mutants to bind to actin·Tm. The Ca2+ binding properties of the regulatory site II of cTnC as estimated from fluorescence and measured at cTnC and cTn levels did not match the apparent affinity of this site in the fiber and reconstituted filaments. However, D145E showed increased Ca2+ affinity in the isolated and cTn states that was minimally affected in the presence of the thin filament (TF). In the presence of the TF, A8V was the only mutant that showed an increase in Ca2+ affinity that more closely approached the Ca2+ sensitivity measured in the fiber. However, the circular dichroism (CD) measurements suggest that significant structural changes exist in the secondary structure of the cTnC mutants A8V, C84Y, and D145E compared with wild type. All of these results considered together with the PyMol illustrations suggest that structural changes are present in at least three TnC HCM mutants that are likely to be crucial for protein-protein interactions but unable to affect the Ca2+ binding properties of TnC at the different levels of TF complexity. Here we show for the first time that the thick filament is probably essential to completely recreate the increased Ca2+ sensitivity produced by HCM TnCs and observed in ATPase and skinned fiber assays. cDNAs cloned in our laboratory from human cardiac tissue were used for the expression and purification of cTnI (33.Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and cTnT (34.Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Human cTnC (HcTnC) was used as the template for PCR using primers designed to introduce the mutations of interest that result in the TnC HCM mutants (HcTnC-A8V, HcTnC-C84Y, HcTnC-E134D, HcTnC-D145E, HcTnC-C35S, HcTnC-A8V/C35S, HcTnC-E134D/C35S, and HcTnC-D145E/C35S). All subcloned DNA sequences were inserted into the pET3d expression plasmid and sequenced for verification prior to expression and purification. Standard methods previously used in this laboratory were utilized for expression and purification of the HcTnCs (35.Pinto J.R. Parvatiyar M.S. Jones M.A. Liang J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2156-2166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly the cTnC WT and cTnC HCM mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus bacterial cells (Stratagene). The bacterially expressed TnCs were passed over a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m KCl (4 °C) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The purest TnC fractions were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT; loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column after the addition of 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4; and eluted with Ca2+-free buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT at room temperature. Collected fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing the purest, most concentrated fractions were pooled yielding >97% pure protein, dialyzed exhaustively against 5 mm NH4HCO3, and then lyophilized. All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The individual purified troponin subunits were first dialyzed against 3 m urea, 1 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then twice against the same buffer excluding urea. The protein concentration of the individual subunits was determined using the Coomassie Plus kit (Pierce), and then the subunits were combined in a 1.3:1.3:1 TnT:TnI:TnC molar ratio. After 1 h, the complexes were successively dialyzed against decreasing concentrations of KCl (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 m). The excess precipitated TnT and TnI that formed during complex formation was removed by centrifugation. Proper stoichiometry was verified by SDS-PAGE before storage of troponin complexes at −80 °C. Porcine cardiac myosin, rabbit skeletal F-actin, and porcine cardiac Tm were prepared as described previously (36.Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations used for actomyosin ATPase assays were 0.6 μm porcine cardiac myosin, 3.5 μm rabbit skeletal F-actin, 1 μm porcine cardiac tropomyosin, and 0–2 μm preformed Tn complexes as described above. The buffer conditions for the proteins were as follows: myosin in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm DTT; actin in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 40 mm KCl; tropomyosin in 10 mm (pH 7.0), 300 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. The final ionic strength of the reactions was ∼75 mm when considering the ionic contributions from the various protein buffers. The ATPase inhibitory assay was performed in a 0.1-ml reaction mixture of 3.4 mm MgCl2, 0.13 μm CaCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 3.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 11.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. The ATPase activation assay was performed using the same 0.1-ml buffer mixture with 3.3 mm MgCl2 and 1.7 mm CaCl2. The ATPase reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP and quenched after 20 min using trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 35%. The precipitated assay proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the inorganic phosphate concentration in the supernatant that was released by ATP hydrolysis was determined according to the method of Fiske and Subbarow (37.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). pCa curves were performed using 1 μm preformed Tn complex with the same concentrations of myosin, actin, and tropomyosin as described above. For the experiments of 50% mutant and 50% WT the preformed Tn complexes were combined to a final concentration of 1 μm. The conditions of the assay (11.55 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NTA, 3.7 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0 at 25 °C)) changed slightly in varied pCa solutions: pCa 8.0 (0.113 mm CaCl2), pCa 7.0 (0.8997 mm CaCl2), pCa 6.5 (1.915 mm CaCl2), pCa 6.0 (2.982 mm CaCl2), pCa 5.5 (3.639 mm CaCl2), pCa 5.0 (3.971 mm CaCl2), pCa 4.5 (4.278 mm CaCl2), and pCa 4.0 (4.913 mm CaCl2) calculated according to methods established in our laboratory (38.Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The thin filament constituents, F-actin at a concentration of 20 μm, and Tn/Tm at a concentration of 2.86 μm were used to obtain a molar ratio of 7:1:1 and were co-sedimented using an air-driven ultracentrifuge (Beckman Airfuge; rotor A100) for 30 min at 28 p.s.i. (∼120,000 × g). The buffer conditions were 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For isolated cTnC and cTn measurements the cTnC WT and mutants were labeled with IAANS at Cys-35 and Cys-84 except for cTnC-C84Y, which was only labeled at Cys-35. C84S was used as a control for the C84Y mutant. For the thin filament measurements the cTnC WT and mutants A8V, E134D, and D145E had Cys-35 mutated to Ser and were labeled with IAANS only at Cys-84. IAANS was obtained from Molecular Probes, Plano, TX. Fluorescent labeling and purification of cTnC were performed according to established methods (27.Putkey J.A. Liu W. Lin X. Ahmed S. Zhang M. Potter J.D. Kerrick W.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28.Johnson J.D. Collins J.H. Robertson S.P. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9635-9640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated IAANS-labeled HcTnCs (HcTnC mutants and WT) were dialyzed into fluorescence buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 120 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl. Before each titration 1.25 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm freshly prepared DTT were added. cTn complexes were made as described above (“Formation of Troponin Complexes”); however, the complexes underwent final dialysis in the fluorescence buffer containing 1.25 mm MgCl2. Thin filaments were constructed using the protocol established in our laboratory (39.Dweck D. Hus N. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33119-33128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cTnCs used in the thin filaments were mutated at Cys-35 to Ser and were labeled with IAANS at Cys-84. For C84Y the label was placed at Cys-35; however, the thin filament did not show spectral changes from pCa 8 to 4. Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed in a Jasco 6500 spectrofluorometer where IAANS fluorescence was excited at 330 nm and emission was detected at 450 nm. The protein concentrations used for isolated cTnC, cTn, and thin filaments were 10 μm, 0.5 μm, and 0.05 mg/ml, respectively. Fluorescence spectral changes were recorded during the titration of microliter amounts of CaCl2. The concentration of free Ca2+ and amounts of titrated Ca2+ were calculated using the pCa calculator program developed by our laboratory (38.Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The program made corrections for dilution effects that occur during titration of Ca2+. The data were fitted to a version of the Hill equation that accounted for the spectral changes that occur at a low Ca2+ concentration and plotted using SigmaPlot 10.0. The apparent Ca2+ affinities are reported as pCa50 values ±S.E. Far-UV CD spectra were collected using a 1-mm-path quartz cell in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded at 195–250 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min at a resolution of 0.5 nm at room temperature (∼20 °C). Ten scans were averaged, and no numerical smoothing was applied. The optical activity of the buffer was subtracted from relevant protein spectra. Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE in degree·cm2/dmol) for the spectra were calculated utilizing the same Jasco system software using the following equation: [θ]MRE = [θ]/(10 × Cr × l) where [θ] is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and l is the path length in cm (40.Szczesna D.

Protein concentrations were determined by the biuret reaction using TnC as a standard that was calibrated by determining its protein nitrogen content. The CD experiments were performed using three different conditions: for apo, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.0); for Mg2+, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 2.075 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0) yielding a free [Mg2+] of 2 mm); and for Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 2.075 mm MgCl2, 1.096 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.0) yielding a free [Ca2+] of 10−4m and free [Mg2+] of 2 mm). The experimental protein concentration for the WT and each mutation was 0.2 mg/ml. PyMol is an open source molecular visualization program that allows the user to download Protein Data Bank files that contain molecular coordinates from x-ray crystallography- or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-solved structures that were deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The program allows the known structures to be manipulated for example mutagenesis of selected residues, details of potential side chain interactions, and potential for polar contacts such as hydrogen bonding due to the nature and proximity of the side chains. The experimental results are reported as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed for significance using Student's t test at p < 0.05 (paired or unpaired depending on the experimental design). To assess the Ca2+ sensitivity of the newly discovered HCM cTnC mutants at a 100 and 50% ratio in a reconstituted system, actomyosin ATPase assays were evaluated as a function of increasing Ca2+ concentration. This system is more sensitive than the skinned fiber assays because of the lack of organization between thin and thick filaments; however, the Ca2+ sensitivity measured from the actomyosin ATPase correlates to the changes found by isometric tension (41.Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6751-6756Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42.Güth K. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13627-13635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 100% mutant reconstitution, A8V and C84Y generated the largest increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the reconstituted myofilament with a leftward shift of +0.51 (pCa50 = 6.20 ± 0.03) and +0.56 (pCa50 = 6.25 ± 0.03) pCa units compared with the WT (pCa50 = 5.69 ± 0.05), respectively (Fig. 1A). D145E also generated a leftward shift with a ΔpCa50 of +0.25. At the 50% ratio only A8V showed a corresponding decrease in pCa50 compared with the amount of mutant protein present (Fig. 1B). In skinned fibers the leftward shift was ∼0.4 and ∼0.3 pCa units for A8V and C84Y, respectively (9.Landstrom A.P. Parvatiyar M.S. Pinto J.R. Marquardt M.L. Bos J.M. Tester D.J. Ommen S.R. Potter J.D.

The D145E mutant (pCa50 = 5.94 ± 0.03) showed an intermediate increase in Ca2+ sensitivity with a 0.25 pCa unit leftward shift compared with WT in both ATPase and force measurements. At both ratios, the E134D (pCa50 = 5.72 ± 0.03 at 100%) mutant showed no significant change"

Both NSAID-dependent cyclooxygenase inhibition and gastric mucosal apoptosis are involved in NSAID-produced gastric lesions, and this apoptosis is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and resulting activation of Bax. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been suggested to protect gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced lesions; here we have tested this idea genetically. The severity of gastric lesions produced by indomethacin was worse in mice lacking heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor for hsp genes, than in control mice. Indomethacin administration up-regulated the expression of gastric mucosal HSP70. Indomethacin-induced gastric lesions were ameliorated in transgenic mice expressing HSP70. After indomethacin administration, fewer apoptotic cells were observed in the gastric mucosa of transgenic mice expressing HSP70 than in wild-type mice, whereas the gastric levels of prostaglandin E2 for the two were indistinguishable. This suggests that expression of HSP70 ameliorates indomethacin-induced gastric lesions by affecting mucosal apoptosis. Suppression of HSP70 expression in vitro stimulated indomethacin-induced apoptosis and activation of Bax but not the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Geranylgeranylacetone induced HSP70 at gastric mucosa in an HSF1-dependent manner and suppressed the formation of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions in wild-type mice but not in HSF1-null mice. The results of this study provide direct genetic evidence that expression of HSP70 confers gastric protection against indomethacin-induced lesions by inhibiting the activation of Bax.

Although PGE2 has a strong protective effect on gastrointestinal mucosa, the inhibition of COX by NSAIDs is not the sole explanation for the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs (5.Lichtenberger L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in cultured gastric cells and at gastric mucosa in a manner independent of COX inhibition (6.Tanaka K. Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Ishihara T.

Permeabilization of cytoplasmic membranes by NSAIDs stimulates Ca2+ influx and increases intracellular Ca2+ levels, which in turn induces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (6.Tanaka K. Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Ishihara T. Namba T. Aburaya M. Katsu T. Suzuki K. Tsutsumi S. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31059-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11.Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T.

Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 860-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the ER stress response, an apoptosis-inducing transcription factor, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous transcription factor (CHOP), is induced, as we have previously shown, CHOP is essential for NSAID-induced apoptosis (7.Tsutsumi S. Gotoh T. Tomisato W. Mima S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mori M. Mizushima T. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CHOP induces expression of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and the resulting translocation and activation of Bax. We have already shown that both PUMA and Bax play an important role in NSAID-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of caspases and apoptosis (13.Ishihara T. Hoshino T. Namba T. Tanaka K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 356: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have suggested that both COX inhibition (measured as a decrease in the gastric PGE2 level) and gastric mucosal apoptosis are required for the formation of NSAID-induced gastric lesions in vivo (10.Aburaya M.

Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, maintenance of gastric PGE2 levels or protection against gastric mucosal apoptosis is important for protection of gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced lesions. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced by various stressors, including NSAIDs, and induction of HSPs, especially HSP70, provides cellular resistance to NSAIDs (15.Mathew A. Morimoto R.I. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16.Gehrmann M. Brunner M. Pfister K. Reichle A. Kremmer E. Multhoff G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a leading anti-ulcer drug on the Japanese market, has been reported to be a nontoxic HSP inducer (17.Hirakawa T. Rokutan K. Nikawa T. Kishi K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that treatment of cultured gastric mucosal cells with GGA protects cells from NSAID-induced cell death and is accompanied by induction of HSP70 (18.Tomisato W. Takahashi N. Komoto C. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2000; 45: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These previous results suggest that HSP70 protects gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced gastric lesions; however, no direct evidence exists. The results also suggest that the protective effect of GGA against NSAID-produced gastric lesions is due to its HSP inducing activity. However, because GGA mediates various other gastroprotective mechanisms, such as an increase in gastric mucosal blood flow, stimulation of surface mucus production, and direct protection of gastric mucosal cell membranes (19.Terano A. Hiraishi H. Ota S. Sugimoto T. Digestion. 1986; 33: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20.Kunisaki C. Sugiyama M.

Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether up-regulation of HSPs represents major mode of gastroprotective activity of GGA against NSAIDs. Up-regulation of HSP expression by stressors is achieved at the level of transcription through a consensus cis-element (heat shock element) and a transcription factor (heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)), which specifically binds to a heat shock element located upstream of the hsp genes (22.Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Disruption to the activity of HSF1 leads to the loss of stressor-induced HSP up-regulation (22.Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 23.McMillan D.R. Xiao X. Shao L. Graves K. Benjamin I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7523-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We recently used HSF1-null mice to obtain genetic evidence for a protective role for HSPs against production of gastric lesions (24.Tanaka K. Tsutsumi S. Arai Y. Hoshino T. Suzuki K. Takaki E. Ito T. Takeuchi K. Nakai A. Mizushima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, NSAID-produced gastric lesions, which involve not only irritant-induced mucosal damage but also a decrease in the PGE2 level, were not tested. Furthermore, although transgenic mice expressing HSP27 display a phenotype of resistance to irritant-induced gastric lesions (25.Ebert M.P. Schäfer C. Chen J. Hoffmann J. Gu P. Kubisch C. Carl-McGrath S. Treiber G. Malfertheiner P. Röcken C. J. Pathol. 2005; 207: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the effect of artificial up-regulation of HSP70 on the production of gastric lesions has not been tested. In this study, we used HSF1-null mice and transgenic mice expressing HSP70 to examine the role of HSP70 in the pathogenesis of NSAID-produced gastric lesions. The results suggest that HSP70 is protective against the production of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions. Furthermore, the results suggest that HSP70 achieves this protective effect through inhibiting mucosal apoptosis rather than affecting the gastric level of PGE2. RPMI 1640 was obtained from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Paraformaldehyde, fetal bovine serum, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide were obtained from Sigma. Indomethacin was obtained from Wako Co. (Osaka, Japan). A PGE2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Antibodies against HSP70 were purchased from StressGen (San Diego, CA), and actin and the N-terminal region of Bax (Bax N20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was obtained from TOYOBO (Osaka, Japan). Biotin 14-ATP, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mice) immunoglobulin G, and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from Invitrogen.

The RNeasy kit and HiPerFect were obtained from Qiagen, the first strand cDNA synthesis kit was from Takara (Kyoto, Japan), and SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix was from ABI (Foster City, CA). HSF1-null mice and their wild-type counterparts (ICR) (10–12 weeks of age and 30–35 g) or transgenic mice expressing HSP70 (gifts from Drs. Angelidis and Pagoulatos (University of Ioannina, Greece)) and their wild-type counterparts (C57/BL6) (6–8 weeks of age and 20–25 g) were prepared as described previously (27.Tanaka K. Namba T.

Homozygotic transgenic mice were used in experiments. The experiments and procedures described here were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kumamoto University. The gastric ulcerogenic response was examined as described previously (14.Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Mice fasted for 18 h were orally administered with indomethacin. Eight hours later, the animals were sacrificed, after which their stomachs were removed, and the areas of gastric mucosal lesions were measured by an observer unaware of the treatment they had received. Calculation of the scores involved measuring the area of all the lesions in square millimeters and summing the values to give an overall gastric lesion index. The gastric PGE2 level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were exposed to indomethacin by changing the medium. The cells were cultured for 24 h and then used in experiments. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method as previously described (28.Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T.

The measurement of caspase-3-like activity was as previously described (9.Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The transfection with pcDNA3.1 containing the hsp70 gene (29.Fujimoto M. Takaki E. Hayashi T. Kitaura Y. Tanaka Y. Inouye S. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34908-34916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was carried out using Lipofectamine (TM2000) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were used for experiments after a 20-h recovery period. We used siRNA, with the sequences 5′-ggagcugcaggugugudTdT-3′ and 5′-acacaccugcuccagcuccdTdT-3′, as annealed oligonucleotides for repressing HSP70 expression. AGS cells were transfected with siRNA using HiPerFect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nonsilencing siRNA (5′-uucuccgaacgugucacgudTdT-3′ and 5′-acgugacacguucggagaadTdT-3′) were used as a negative control. Apoptosis was monitored using PI analysis by FACS as described previously (11.Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were fixed with 70% ethanol and recentrifuged. The pellets were resuspended in phosphate-citrate buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 4 mm citric acid) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in DNA staining solution (50 mg/ml PI and 10 μg/ml RNase A) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were scanned with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) cell sorter. For measuring only PI-DNA mediated fluorescence specifically, we scanned cells without PI staining and only PI solution (without cells) to determine the signal threshold. For excluding debris and cell fragments, thresholds were set for eliminating the low channels (from 1 to 15), in other words, cells with low PI fluorescence (the G1 peak was set as channel 400 of total 1024 channels) or for eliminating small cells by adjusting FSC and SSC light scatter parameters (according to the manufacturer's protocols). Apoptotic cells appeared as a hypodiploid peak (sub-G1 peak) because of nuclear fragmentation and loss of DNA, and we calculated number of cells included this peak and determined the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells (10, 000). For statistical analysis, we measured three different samples in the same experiment. Total RNA was extracted from gastric tissues or AGS cells using the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples (2.5 μg of RNA) were reverse-transcribed using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized cDNA was used in real time RT-PCR (Bio-Rad Chromo 4 system) experiments using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and analyzed with Opticon Monitor software according to the manufacturer's instructions. The real time PCR cycle conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and at 60 °C for 60 s. Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products and by inclusion of template- or reverse transcriptase-free controls. To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or actin cDNA was used as an internal standard. The primers were designed using the Primer3 website (Table 1).TABLE 1Primers usedGeneForward primerReverse primerhsp255′-cctcttccctatcccctgag-3′5′-ttggctccagactgttcaga-3′hsp605′-cgttgccaataacacaaacg-3′5′-cttcaggggttgtcacaggt-3′hsp705′-tggtgctgacgaagatgaag-3′5′-aggtcgaagatgagcacgtt-3′hsp90a5′-aaaggcagaggctgacaaga-3′5′-aggggaggcatttcttcagt-3′hsp90b5′-gcggcaaagacaagaaaaag-3′5′-gaagtggtcctcccagtcat-3′atf45′-tcaaacctcatgggttctcc-3′5′-gtgtcatccaacgtggtcag-3′chop5′-tgcctttctcttcggacact-3′5′-tgtgacctctgctggttctg-3′puma5′-gacgacctcaacgcacagta-3′5′-ggagtcccatgatgagattgt-3′actin5′-tgcctttctcttcggacact-3′5′-tgtgacctctgctggttctg-3′gapdh5′-tgcctttctcttcggacact-3′5′-tgtgacctctgctggttctg-3′ Open table in a new tab Total protein was extracted as described previously (30.Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford method (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to 8% (HSP70) or 10% (actin, Bax, and cytochrome c) polyacrylamide SDS gels and subjected to electrophoresis, after which the proteins were immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Gastric tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin before being cut into 4-μm sections. For histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin staining), the sections were stained first with Mayer's hematoxylin and then with 1% eosin alcohol solution. The samples were mounted with Malinol and inspected with the aid of an Olympus BX51 microscope. For immunohistochemical analysis, the sections were blocked with 2.5% goat serum for 10 min, incubated for 12 h with antibody against HSP70 (1:250 dilution) in the presence of 2.5% bovine serum albumin and finally incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G in the presence of DAPI (5 μg/ml). The samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51). For TUNEL assay, the sections were incubated first with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, then with TdT and biotin 14-ATP for 1 h at 37 °C, and finally with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated with streptavidin for 1 h. The samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51). The cells were cultured on four-well Lab-Tek II glass slides (Nunc). After fixation with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Immunostaining to detect the active form of Bax was performed with a polyclonal antibody (Bax N20) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. The cells were simultaneously stained with DAPI (5 μg/ml). The cells were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51). All of the values are expressed as the means ± S.E. The Tukey test or the Student's t test for unpaired results was used to evaluate differences between more than three groups or between two groups, respectively. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. The development of gastric lesions following oral administration of indomethacin was compared between wild-type and HSF1-null mice. Administration of indomethacin produced gastric lesions in a dose-dependent manner, and this lesion production was significantly worse in HSF1-null mice relative to wild-type controls (Fig. 1A). This result shows that HSF1 plays an important role in protecting gastric mucosa from indomethacin-induced lesions. As mentioned above, both a decrease in PGE2 and mucosal apoptosis play important roles in NSAID-produced gastric lesions, and we have examined these processes in HSF1-null mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, there was no significant difference in the gastric level of PGE2 between the HSF1-null mice and wild-type mice in either the presence or absence of indomethacin treatment. The level of gastric mucosal apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay. An increase in the number of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells was observed after the indomethacin administration, and this increase was more apparent in HSF1-null mice than wild-type mice (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that HSF1 protects the gastric mucosa from lesion formation by inhibiting indomethacin-induced apoptosis rather than by affecting the gastric PGE2 level. We monitored the expression of hsp mRNAs in gastric tissues by real time RT-PCR. Indomethacin administration up-regulated the expression of hsp70 mRNA, with this expression significantly lower in indomethacin-treated HSF1-null mice than in the wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). Lack of the hsf1 gene did not affect the background level of expression of hsp70 mRNA (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the expression of hsp25, hsp60, hsp90α, and hsp90β mRNAs was not affected by either indomethacin administration or lack of the hsf1 gene (Fig. 2A). Based on these results, we subsequently focused on HSP70. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that indomethacin administration increased the level of HSP70 in gastric mucosa in wild-type mice but not in HSF1-null mice (Fig. 2, B–D). Based on the results in Fig. 2, we proposed that the inability of HSF1-null mice to induce expression of HSP70 is responsible for their phenotypic sensitivity to indomethacin-induced gastric lesions and mucosal apoptosis. To test the idea described above, the level of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions was compared between transgenic mice expressing HSP70 and wild-type mice. Relative to control mice, formation of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions was significantly suppressed in transgenic mice expressing HSP70 (Fig. 3A). By immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses, we confirmed that HSP70 expression was much higher in the gastric tissues of the transgenic mice than in those of the wild-type mice, regardless of whether or not they were treated with indomethacin (Fig. 3, B–D). These results suggest that HSP70 expression somehow suppresses the formation of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions. As shown in Fig. 3E, there was no significant difference in the gastric level of PGE2 between transgenic mice expressing HSP70 and wild-type mice. On the other hand, the level of indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal apoptosis was lower in transgenic mice expressing HSP70 than in wild-type mice (Fig. 3, F and G). To understand the molecular mechanism for HSP70-conferred protection against indomethacin-induced cell death in vitro, we first examined the effect of siRNA specific for HSP70 on indomethacin-induced cell death in AGS cells. Transfection of cells with siRNA for HSP70 inhibited the expression of HSP70 both in the presence and absence of indomethacin (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment of cells with indomethacin induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of cells with siRNA for HSP70 stimulated this cell death but did not affect cell viability in the absence of indomethacin (Fig. 4B). We also found that overexpression of HSP70 slightly inhibited indomethacin-induced cell death (Fig. 4, C and D). Based on results reported in one of our previous papers (8.Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W2073985941,"Creating focal lesions in primary visual cortex (V1) provides an opportunity to study the role of extra-geniculo-striate pathways for activating extrastriate visual cortex. Previous studies have shown that more than 95% of neurons in macaque area V2 and V3 stop firing after reversibly cooling V1 [1], [2], [3]. However, no studies on long term recovery in areas V2, V3 following permanent V1 lesions have been reported in the macaque. Here we use macaque fMRI to study area V2, V3 activity patterns from 1 to 22 months after lesioning area V1. We find that visually driven BOLD responses persist inside the V1-lesion projection zones (LPZ) of areas V2 and V3, but are reduced in strength by ∼70%, on average, compared to pre-lesion levels. Monitoring the LPZ activity over time starting one month following the V1 lesion did not reveal systematic changes in BOLD signal amplitude. Surprisingly, the retinotopic organization inside the LPZ of areas V2, V3 remained similar to that of the non-lesioned hemisphere, suggesting that LPZ activation in V2, V3 is not the result of input arising from nearby (non-lesioned) V1 cortex. Electrophysiology recordings of multi-unit activity corroborated the BOLD observations: visually driven multi-unit responses could be elicited inside the V2 LPZ, even when the visual stimulus was entirely contained within the scotoma induced by the V1 lesion. Restricting the stimulus to the intact visual hemi-field produced no significant BOLD modulation inside the V2, V3 LPZs. We conclude that the observed activity patterns are largely mediated by parallel, V1-bypassing, subcortical pathways that can activate areas V2 and V3 in the absence of V1 input. Such pathways may contribute to the behavioral phenomenon of blindsight."
https://openalex.org/W2156018224,"Rpb9 is a small non-essential subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II located on the surface on the enzyme. Deletion of the RPB9 gene shows synthetic lethality with the low fidelity rpb1-E1103G mutation localized in the trigger loop, a mobile element of the catalytic Rpb1 subunit, which has been shown to control transcription fidelity. Similar to the rpb1-E1103G mutation, the RPB9 deletion substantially enhances NTP misincorporation and increases the rate of mismatch extension with the next cognate NTP in vitro. Using pre-steady state kinetic analysis, we show that RPB9 deletion promotes sequestration of NTPs in the polymerase active center just prior to the phosphodiester bond formation. We propose a model in which the Rpb9 subunit controls transcription fidelity by delaying the closure of the trigger loop on the incoming NTP via interaction between the C-terminal domain of Rpb9 and the trigger loop.

The fidelity of transcription is essential for maintenance of genetic information content and for accurate gene expression. Given the structural and mechanistic similarities shared among all classes of multisubunit nucleic acid polymerases, the kinetic and mechanistic basis of fidelity is likely to be conserved in transcription. Nucleotide incorporation involves at least five steps: binding of NTP, isomerization into a catalytically competent complex, phosphoryl transfer, a second conformational change associated with release of pyrophosphate, and translocation (1.Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5126-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2.Burton Z.F. Feig M. Gong X.Q. Zhang C. Nedialkov Y.A. Xiong Y. Biochem.

Although any of these steps can serve as fidelity checkpoints, early pre-steady state analyses suggested that the fidelity of DNA polymerases might be controlled at the isomerization step following the dNTP binding (3.Patel S.S.

The prevailing hypothesis holds that isomerization corresponds to the open-to-closed conformation transition in the protein after the initial binding of dNTP (7.Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev.

Importantly, they demonstrated that a mutation G64S, located far from the catalytic center of 3Dpol, affects isomerization of the active site (11.Arnold J.J. Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Andino R.

Zhang J. Palangat M. Landick R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 406-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This hairpin is located beneath another long helix (the bridge helix), which is proposed to participate in the catalysis and pol II translocation (16.Brueckner F. Cramer P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The TL moves toward the active center upon binding of the complementary NTP. This transition involves a long range motion of the TL from the enzyme surface to the active center referred to as the open-to-closed TL transition (14.Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Previous studies provided evidence that the TL closing properly positions the NTP for catalysis and prevents spontaneous NTP release from the active center (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A.

The TL adopts an open configuration in pol II elongation complexes co-crystallized with a non-complementary substrate (14.Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 2008; 30: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recently, we have characterized a mutation in the distal part of the helical hairpin located at a significant distance from the active center, which rendered pol II error-prone (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A. Lubkowska L. Malagon F. Burton Z.F. Strathern J.N. Kashlev M. Mol.

This mutation, rpb1-E1103G, was proposed to destabilize the open conformation of the TL, causing overly efficient trapping of non-complementary NTPs and misincorporation (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A. Lubkowska L. Malagon F. Burton Z.F. Strathern J.N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 557-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dynamics of the active site isomerization mediated by the TL movement appear to control transcription fidelity.

RNA polymerase II exonuclease III trigger loop wild type nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid ternary elongation complex nucleotide(s) region G non-conserved domain. In addition to Rpb1, it has been suggested that Rpb9, a small subunit of pol II, plays a role in transcription fidelity (18.Nesser N.K. Peterson D.O. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3268-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rpb9 is a non-essential subunit located on the surface of the enzyme (19.Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 20.Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Rpb9 comprises two zinc ribbon domains joined by a conserved linker: an N-terminal domain (Zn1) forming a part of the primary DNA-binding channel of pol II and a C-terminal domain (Zn2) interacting with the secondary channel, a special pore connecting the active center with the surface of the enzyme (see Fig. 6). Based on pre-steady state kinetic analysis of bond formation by human pol II, it has been proposed that NTP substrates enter the enzyme through the primary DNA-binding channel (main channel) by prehybridization to the template DNA strand 2–3 nucleotides ahead of the active center (21.Zhang C. Burton Z.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Rpb9 constitutes a significant part of the primary channel, which suggests that Rpb9 deletion may affect fidelity by altering the structure of the putative NTP preloading site. Alternatively, the secondary channel has been proposed to serve for the NTP entry to the active center and release of pyrophosphate after bond formation (22.Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Cell. 2003; 114: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23.Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The secondary channel also provides access to the active center for transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (22.Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Cell. 2003; 114: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which is involved in proofreading transcription errors (24.Jeon C. Agarwal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13677-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and rescuing arrested complexes of pol II (25.Fish R.N. Kane C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of Rpb9 is structurally similar to the zinc ribbon domain of TFIIS (25.Fish R.N. Kane C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26.Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Rpb9 subunit is highly conserved among eukaryotes and shows significant sequence similarity with the C11 subunit in pol III and the A12.2 in pol I, both required for the intrinsic cleavage activity of their related polymerases (27.Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28.Kuhn C.D. Geiger S.R. Baumli S. Gartmann M. Gerber J. Jennebach S. Mielke T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Rpb9 has never been demonstrated to contribute to the intrinsic cleavage activity of pol II, it is nevertheless required for optimal function of transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (26.Hemming S.A.

Yeast cells harboring the RPB9 deletion confer a slow growth phenotype with disruption of DST1, the gene encoding elongation factor TFIIS in certain genetic backgrounds (31.Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B.

RPB9 deletion in yeast causes hypersensitivity to the nucleotide-depleting drug 6-azauracil (31.Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, Rpb9 has been implicated in maintenance of transcription fidelity in vivo based on the increased frequency of transcriptional frameshift and base substitution events in an RPB9 deletion strain (18.Nesser N.K.

Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fidelity checkpoint, affected by the RPB9 deletion, remains to be identified. The synergistic phenotype of RPB9 deletion with DST1 deletion (31.Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggest that Rpb9 could be involved in TFIIS-mediated error correction (24.Jeon C. Agarwal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13677-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33.Koyama H. Ito T. Nakanishi T. Sekimizu K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the reports regarding the effect of TFIIS on transcription fidelity in vivo remain controversial. Koyama et al. (34.Koyama H. Ito T. Nakanishi T. Kawamura N. Sekimizu K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that TFIIS contributes to maintenance of transcription fidelity and that Rpb9 also controls fidelity in a TFIIS-independent manner (33.Koyama H. Ito T. Nakanishi T. Sekimizu K. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rpb9 might also be involved in fidelity control at another step of the transcription elongation cycle, distinct from the TFIIS-dependent error correction step. In contrast, several other genetic tests failed to detect a significant effect of TFIIS in transcription fidelity in vivo (18.Nesser N.K. Peterson D.O. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3268-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35.Shaw R.J. Bonawitz N.D. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24420-24426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this work, we established a genetic interaction between the Rpb9 subunit and the TL by showing that deletion of the RPB9 gene is synthetic lethal with the rpb1-E1103G mutation. We also showed that Rpb9-deficient pol II confers a significant decrease in transcription fidelity in vitro. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis revealed that the absence of Rpb9 promoted NTP sequestration in the polymerase active center before catalysis, similar to that observed for the rpb1-E1103G mutation (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A. Lubkowska L. Malagon F. Burton Z.F. Strathern J.N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 557-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our findings support a crucial role for active site isomerization in transcription fidelity and establish a paradigm for catalytic control of pol II by cis-acting regulatory elements like Rpb9 and the TL or trans-acting elongation factors like TFIIS. Media, growth conditions, and yeast manipulations were as described previously (Malagon et al. (17.Malagon F. Kireeva M.L. Shafer B.K. Lubkowska L. Kashlev M. Strathern J.N. Genetics. 2006; 172: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)). Briefly, GRY3041 (MATα, can1, his-3Δ200, leu2-Δ1, trp1, ura3-52, pep4::HIS3, prb1-Δ1.6, RPB3::6xHisBio, rpb9::kanMX4, GAL+) was made by one step gene disruption of the RPB9 gene with the kanMX4 cassette (from the Open Biosystems deletion collection) and is related to BJ5464 (ATTC Yeast Genetic Stock Center). To determine whether rpb9::Nat and rpb1-E1103G show a synthetic interaction, the strains GRY3185 (MATα, his3-Δ1, lys2-Δ0, leu2-Δ0, met15-Δ0, trp-, URA3-CMV-tTA, KanMX-Ptet-RPB1, rpb9::Nat) and GRY3028 (MATa, his3-Δ1, leu2-Δ0, lys2-Δ0, met15-Δ0, trp1::hisG, URA3-CMV-tTA, rpb1-E1103G) were crossed and subjected to tetrad analysis. The KanMX-Ptet-RPB1 allele and the CMV-tTA transactivator were introduced by crosses with the strain YSC1180-7428981 (Open Biosystems (36.Mnaimneh S. Davierwala A.P. Haynes J. Moffat J. Peng W.T.

DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (supplemental Table 2) were purchased from IDT (San Diego, CA). NTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and dNTPs were from Invitrogen. The NTPs used for misincorporation assays were additionally purified as described previously (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A. Lubkowska L. Malagon F. Burton Z.F. Strathern J.N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 557-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Exonuclease III was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). WT pol II and pol IIΔ9 were purified as described previously (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A. Lubkowska L. Malagon F. Burton Z.F. Strathern J.N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 557-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Subunit composition of pol II and pol IIΔ9 was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel in denaturing conditions, and proteins were visualized by silver staining. Transcription elongation complexes were assembled on synthetic DNA and RNA oligonucleotides and immobilized on Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (37.Kireeva M.L. Lubkowska L. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 138-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38.Komissarova N. Kireeva M.L. Becker J. Sidorenkov I. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′ radioactively labeled RNA (RNA7, RNA7–20, or RNA9) and the template DNA oligonucleotide (TDS45G, TDS45C, TDS50, or TDS65) were incubated with the immobilized pol II followed by the subsequent addition of the non-template DNA oligonucleotide (NDS45G, NDS45C, NDS50, or NDS65). When indicated, the RNA was extended to different positions subsequent to incubation with NTP subsets (5 μm, final concentration). The TECs were eluted by 100 mm imidazole, filtered using Ultrafree-MC 0.45-μm centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and diluted with bovine serum albumin-containing transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol). The reactions with the correct NTP were performed on the model RFQ-3 and RFQ-4 chemical quench flow instruments (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). TECs were incubated with NTPs for 0.002–0.5 s at 25 °C followed by stopping the reaction by quenching with 0.5 m EDTA or 1 m HCl. The misincorporation reactions were stopped manually by quenching with the gel-loading buffer (5 m urea; 25 mm EDTA final concentrations). The RNA products were resolved in 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized with a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager, and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The analyses of the experimental data were performed using the OriginPro 7.5 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Elongation complexes were assembled with the wild-type enzyme and pol IIΔ9 with RNA9 on TDS65CCC with the fully complementary NDS65CCC (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A.

Both the transcript and the template DNA strand were 32P-labeled at the 5′ end using [γ32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The non-labeled DNA strand in the scaffold contained a Biotin linkage at the 3′ end position to inhibit cleavage of that strand by exonuclease III (Exo III). The TECs were eluted from the Ni2+-NTA agarose beads as described above. The footprinting reactions were initiated by mixing 15 μl of the TECs with 15 μl of transcription buffer containing 100 units of Exo III. To examine the effect of the incoming NTP on translocation, either the next complementary NTP (CTP) or a non-complementary NTP (UTP) was mixed with Exo III followed by adding TEC to the reaction. The NTP concentration was 1 mm final. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× gel loading buffer. Products of the reactions were resolved by 12% PAGE in the presence of 7 m urea. Identification and characterization of the rpb1-E1103G mutation (17.Malagon F. Kireeva M.L. Shafer B.K. Lubkowska L. Kashlev M. Strathern J.N. Genetics. 2006; 172: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that decreases transcription fidelity (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A.

In vivo, the rpb1-E1103G mutation results in a dependence on the transcription factor TFIIS consistent with the editing role of TFIIS in removing misincorporated bases. Because it has been reported that rpb9 mutants have elevated transcription errors (18.Nesser N.K. Peterson D.O. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3268-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we tested for a genetic interaction between rpb1-E1103G and an open reading frame deletion allele of rpb9. A strain (GRY3185) carrying a deletion allele of rpb9 marked with nourseothricin resistance (rpb9::nat) and an allele of RPB1 marked with G418 resistance (RPB1::kanMX) was crossed to a yeast strain (GRY3028) carrying rpb1-E1103G. Tetrads from this strain showed a clear synthetic lethal segregation pattern indicating that the double mutant rpb1-E1103G, rpb9::nat is inviable. Of the 290 meiotic segregants carrying the RPB1::kanMX allele, 56% carried the rpb9::nat allele, whereas none of the 162 rpb1-E1103G segregants that survived carried the rpb9::nat allele. The lethal phenotype of the double mutant could reflect a direct role in avoiding errors, which has a synergistic lethal consequence with rpb1-E1103G when Rpb9 is absent, or an essential role for Rpb9 in correcting errors elevated in rpb1-E1103G cells. We assessed the in vitro catalytic properties and pre-incorporation transcription fidelity of pol II lacking the Rpb9 subunit (pol IIΔ9). It was previously reported that the Rpb9 subunit is involved in the control of pol II elongation rate in vitro (26.Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30.Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

We utilized a previously published technique for assembly of the functional TECs of the yeast pol II in the absence of promoter sequence and initiation factors (38.Komissarova N. Kireeva M.L. Becker J. Sidorenkov I. Kashlev M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This method employs the core enzyme of pol II assembled on synthetic DNA and short RNA primers (7–9 nt). For the bulk transcription elongation assay, the TECs were assembled on the 50-nt template and non-template DNA oligonucleotides with 7-nt RNA (TEC7) primer and immobilized on Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Fig. 1A). TEC7 was extended to TEC9 with ATP and GTP, washed with transcription buffer, eluted from the beads (see “Experimental Procedures”), and chased with all four NTPs. Incubation with NTPs resulted in the accumulation of a 28-nt runoff product, which occurred 2–3 times faster with pol IIΔ9 than with the WT enzyme (Fig. 1B). This increased rate observed for pol IIΔ9 may predominantly derive from the decreased pausing at the intrinsic +11/+12 pause sites in the template (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with previously reported properties of yeast pol II lacking the Rpb9 subunit (26.Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30.Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Bulk assays do not measure the dynamics of elongation at a single nucleotide level but provide information solely on the average rate of elongation, mostly defined by rare pausing of pol II on a few DNA sequences. Therefore, we performed pre-steady state kinetic analysis of a single NTP addition at a non-pause site with TEC7–65 and TEC20–65 (Fig. 1A). These two TECs share the same sequences near the 3′ end of the RNA but carry transcripts of different lengths. Moreover, TEC20–65 contains a long 20-nt transcript and is capable of backtracking along DNA. Backtracking involves extrusion of the 3′ end of the nascent transcript to the secondary channel, placing it in close proximity to the C-terminal domain of the Rpb9 subunit (19.Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). For the pre-steady state kinetic analysis, both TECs were incubated with ATP and UTP for 5 s, allowing extension of TEC7 to TEC9 and TEC20 to TEC22, and chased with 1 mm CTP (TEC9) or with CTP and ATP (TEC22). The reactions were quenched after various times with 1 m HCl (Fig. 1C, right-hand panel), which stops the reaction instantly and provides information on the rate of the bond formation (21.Zhang C. Burton Z.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By fitting the time-dependent formation of C10 or C23 transcripts to a single exponential equation, we determined the pseudo-first-order rate constants of CTP incorporation for TECs formed with pol II and pol IIΔ9 (Fig. 1C). We found that deletion of the Rpb9 subunit either did not affect (Table 1) or moderately increased (Figs. 1C and 3A) the rate for the correct CTP incorporation depending on the local sequence context. This 1.3–1.5-fold rate increase was similar to that reported for the TL rpb1-E1103G mutation (13.Kireeva M.L. Nedialkov Y.A. Cremona G.H. Purtov Y.A. Lubkowska L. Malagon F. Burton Z.F.

These data indicate that the Rpb9 subunit is not involved in the bond synthesis per se, which is fully consistent with its location far from the catalytic site of pol II.TABLE 1Deletion of the Rpb9 subunit confers a 5-fold decr"
https://openalex.org/W1968720774,"Methamphetamine (METH) induces neurodegeneration through damage and apoptosis of dopaminergic nerve terminals and striatal cells, presumably via cross-talk between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-dependent death cascades. However, the effects of METH on neural progenitor cells (NPC), an important reservoir for replacing neurons and glia during development and injury, remain elusive. Using a rat hippocampal NPC (rhNPC) culture, we characterized the METH-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, apoptosis, and its related signaling mechanism through immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. We observed that METH induced rhNPC mitochondrial fragmentation, apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation. The mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but not calcium (Ca2+) influx, were involved in the regulation of METH-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, our results indicated that dysregulation of ROS contributed to the oligomerization and translocation of Drp1, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation in rhNPC. Taken together, our data demonstrate that METH-mediated ROS generation results in the dysregulation of Drp1, which leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent apoptosis in rhNPC. This provides a potential mechanism for METH-related neurodegenerative disorders, and also provides insight into therapeutic strategies for the neurodegenerative effects of METH."
https://openalex.org/W2043170694,"Since the 1970's, the diversity of Plasmodium parasites in African great apes has been neglected. Surprisingly, P. reichenowi, a chimpanzee parasite, is the only such parasite to have been molecularly characterized. This parasite is closely phylogenetically related to P. falciparum, the principal cause of the greatest malaria burden in humans. Studies of malaria parasites from anthropoid primates may provide relevant phylogenetic information, improving our understanding of the origin and evolutionary history of human malaria species. In this study, we screened 130 DNA samples from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) from Cameroon for Plasmodium infection, using cytochrome b molecular tools. Two chimpanzees from the subspecies Pan t. troglodytes presented single infections with Plasmodium strains molecularly related to the human malaria parasite P. ovale. These chimpanzee parasites and 13 human strains of P. ovale originated from a various sites in Africa and Asia were characterized using cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase 1 mitochondrial partial genes and nuclear ldh partial gene. Consistent with previous findings, two genetically distinct types of P. ovale, classical and variant, were observed in the human population from a variety of geographical locations. One chimpanzee Plasmodium strain was genetically identical, on all three markers tested, to variant P. ovale type. The other chimpanzee Plasmodium strain was different from P. ovale strains isolated from humans. This study provides the first evidence of possibility of natural cross-species exchange of P. ovale between humans and chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan t. troglodytes."
https://openalex.org/W2023066496,"Genetic studies (in particular linkage and association studies) identify chromosomal regions involved in a disease or phenotype of interest, but those regions often contain many candidate genes, only a few of which can be followed-up for biological validation. Recently, computational methods to identify (prioritize) the most promising candidates within a region have been proposed, but they are usually not applicable to cases where little is known about the phenotype (no or few confirmed disease genes, fragmentary understanding of the biological cascades involved). We seek to overcome this limitation by replacing knowledge about the biological process by experimental data on differential gene expression between affected and healthy individuals. Considering the problem from the perspective of a gene/protein network, we assess a candidate gene by considering the level of differential expression in its neighborhood under the assumption that strong candidates will tend to be surrounded by differentially expressed neighbors. We define a notion of soft neighborhood where each gene is given a contributing weight, which decreases with the distance from the candidate gene on the protein network. To account for multiple paths between genes, we define the distance using the Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel. We score candidates by aggregating the differential expression of neighbors weighted as a function of distance. Through a randomization procedure, we rank candidates by p-values. We illustrate our approach on four monogenic diseases and successfully prioritize the known disease causing genes."
https://openalex.org/W2161600907,"Two bovine species contribute to the Indonesian livestock, zebu (Bos indicus) and banteng (Bos javanicus), respectively. Although male hybrid offspring of these species is not fertile, Indonesian cattle breeds are supposed to be of mixed species origin. However, this has not been documented and is so far only supported by preliminary molecular analysis.Analysis of mitochondrial, Y-chromosomal and microsatellite DNA showed a banteng introgression of 10-16% in Indonesian zebu breeds. East-Javanese Madura and Galekan cattle have higher levels of autosomal banteng introgression (20-30%) and combine a zebu paternal lineage with a predominant (Madura) or even complete (Galekan) maternal banteng origin. Two Madura bulls carried taurine Y-chromosomal haplotypes, presumably of French Limousin origin. In contrast, we did not find evidence for zebu introgression in five populations of the Bali cattle, a domestic form of the banteng.Because of their unique species composition Indonesian cattle represent a valuable genetic resource, which potentially may also be exploited in other tropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2151640962,"Arginine is an essential amino acid for the human pathogen Leishmania but not to its host. Thus, the mechanism by which this protozoan parasite regulates cellular homeostasis of arginine is critical for its survival and virulence. In a previous study, we cloned and functionally characterized a high affinity arginine-specific transporter, LdAAP3, from Leishmania donovani. In this investigation, we have characterized the relationship between arginine transport via LdAAP3 and amino acid availability. Starving promastigotes for amino acids decreased the cellular level of most amino acids including arginine but also increased the abundance of both LdAAP3 mRNA and protein and up-regulated arginine transport activity. Genetic obliteration of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway for which arginine is the sole precursor caused a significant decrease in the rate of arginine transport. Cumulatively, we established that LdAAP3 expression and activity changed whenever the cellular level of arginine changed. Our findings have led to the hypothesis that L. donovani promastigotes have a signaling pathway that senses cellular concentrations of arginine and subsequently activates a mechanism that regulates LdAAP3 expression and activity. Interestingly, this response of LdAAP3 to amino acid availability in L. donovani is identical to that of the mammalian cation amino acid transporter 1.

Thus, we conjecture that Leishmania mimics the host response to amino acid availability to improve virulence. l-Arginine is a metabolically versatile cationic amino acid that provides a precursor function for the synthesis of a variety of bioactive molecules in all organisms. These molecules include nitric oxide, polyamines, phospho- and methylarginine, and proteins. Most of these molecules are essential for cell growth, and a few, like nitric oxide, are also used to protect hosts from pathogen invasion (1Bilzer M. Roggel F. Gerbes A.L. Liver Int. 2006; 26: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Oswald I.P. Wynn T.A. Sher A. James S.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1994; 108: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To enable simultaneous feeding of multiple and disparate biosynthetic pathways, cells must maintain ample cellular levels of arginine at all times. A variety of mechanisms for arginine homeostasis have been identified in mammals and fungi (3Hatzoglou M. Fernandez J. Yaman I. Closs E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, only very limited information on arginine homeostasis in protozoan parasites and its role in pathogenesis is available. Our laboratory aims to address these questions in the human pathogen Leishmania. Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of a wide spectrum of human and veterinary diseases. Infections with Leishmania vary in their clinical manifestations depending upon the species ranging from self-healing skin lesions to visceral pathogenesis, which is invariably fatal if untreated (5Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Leishmania species exhibit a digenetic life cycle that includes both extracellular promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms. The extracellular promastigotes develop in the alimentary tract of sand flies, whereas amastigotes reside within macrophage phagolysosomes (6Chang K.P. Dwyer D.M.

Trends Parasitol. 2007; 23: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and therefore its metabolism and homeostasis depends on supply from external pools. This amino acid has only two functions in the parasite serving as a monomeric precursor for polypeptide synthesis and to funnel carbon atoms into the polyamine biosynthetic pathway (9Roberts S.C. Tancer M.J. Polinsky M.R. Gibson K.M. Heby O. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23668-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned and functionally characterized a high affinity arginine transporter, LdAAP3, whose protein is localized to the plasma membrane of Leishmania donovani (10Shaked-Mishan P. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Yoel-Almagor T. Holland N. Zilberstein D. Rentsch D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). LdAAP3 belongs to the trypanosomatid-specific group of amino acid permeases, which forms a distinct clad within the amino acid auxin permease superfamily (10Shaked-Mishan P. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Yoel-Almagor T. Holland N. Zilberstein D. Rentsch D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Akerman M. Shaked-Mishan P. Mazareb S. Volpin H. Zilberstein D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The L. donovani genome contains two adjacent LdAAP3 genes in the complementary strand of chromosome 31 (LinJ31_V3.0900 and LinJ31_V3.0910). These genes contain identical 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) 3The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionORFopen reading frameODCornithine decarboxylaseSPDSYNspermidine synthaseCAT1cation amino acid transporter 1. and open reading frames (ORFs) but completely different 3′-UTRs. Northern analysis indicated that gene 1 produces a 10-kb transcript, whereas gene 2 produces a 5- and a 7-kb transcript. LdAAP3 is specific for arginine, whereas arginine and lysine are cotransported via the same permease in mammalian cells (3Hatzoglou M. Fernandez J. Yaman I. Closs E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). untranslated region open reading frame ornithine decarboxylase spermidine synthase cation amino acid transporter 1. Mammalian cells synthesize arginine from proline or glutamate via ornithine and citrulline. However, this endogenous synthesis of arginine is not sufficient to feed pathways that use it as a precursor molecule; therefore, mammalian cells must import extracellular arginine. Arginine, as well as lysine, is taken up via four cationic amino acid transporters (Cat1, -2a, -2b, and -3) that differ in their affinities for arginine and lysine (3Hatzoglou M. Fernandez J. Yaman I. Closs E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cat1 exhibits the highest affinity for arginine and is thought to play the major role in arginine homeostasis. Starvation of mammalian cells for amino acids augments Cat1 activity by increasing Cat1 mRNA stability and translation (3Hatzoglou M. Fernandez J. Yaman I. Closs E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Lopez A.B. Wang C. Huang C.C. Yaman I. Li Y. Chakravarty K. Johnson P.F. Chiang C.M. Snider M.D. Wek R.C. Hatzoglou M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), thereby increasing Cat1 abundance. Fungi respond to amino acids starvation by activating a general amino acid control mechanism that activates both amino acid metabolic and uptake pathways (13Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). These microbial organisms take up arginine via three biochemically and genetically distinct permeases; Can1, which transports arginine, Gap1, which transports all amino acids, and Alp1, which mediates arginine transport when overexpressed (14Regenberg B. Düring-Olsen L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Lyp1 has also been reported to transport arginine in addition to lysine; however, when overexpressed, only lysine transport increased (14Regenberg B. Düring-Olsen L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Gap1 and Can1 seem to play a major role in cellular arginine homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fact that fungi and mammals are sensitive to amino acid deprivation by employing mechanisms that regulate arginine transport emphasizes the significant role arginine permeases have in maintaining cellular arginine homeostasis in eukaryotes. In the present work, we have examined the relationships among LdAAP3-mediated arginine transport, amino acid starvation, and activity of metabolic pathways downstream of arginine. We discovered that starvation of L. donovani promastigotes for amino acids stimulated arginine transport by increasing LdAAP3 abundance. Mutations that prevent the use of arginine as a precursor for polyamine synthesis down-regulate arginine transport to reduce the cellular pool of this amino acid. The results of this work indicate that arginine transport in L. donovani is regulated by a mechanism that senses changes in the level of the intracellular pool of arginine. Two lines of L. donovani, MHOM/S.D./00/1S; 1SR (15Saar Y. Ransford A. Waldman E. Mazareb S. Amin-Spector S. Plumblee J. Turco S.J. Zilberstein D. Mol. Biochem.

The Δodc and Δspdsyn knockouts were routinely propagated in DME-l-CS medium (DME-l with 10% chicken instead of bovine serum) supplemented with either 200 μm putrescine or 200 μm spermidine, respectively (16Jiang Y.

Mid-exponential phase promastigotes (∼1 × 107 cells/ml) were washed twice in Earl's salt solution and then resuspended to a final density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in the same solution supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 1% dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Starvation was carried out at 26 °C for either 2 or 4 h and terminated by moving the cells to ice. The starved cells were used for transport assays and analyses of cellular amino acid content without any additional washes. Uptake of 20 μm [3H]arginine (600 mCi/mmol), 20 μm [3H]lysine (1.0 Ci/mmol), or 1.0 mm [3H]proline (8.0 mCi/mmol) into mid log phase parasites was determined by the rapid filtration technique of Mazareb et al. as reported (19Mazareb S. Fu Z.Y. Zilberstein D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine initial rates of transport, transport measurements were performed on 1 × 108 promastigotes exposed to radiolabel for up to 2 min. The amount of radiolabel associated with the cells was linear with time over the 2-min time course of the transport assay. A 16-mer peptide, 5′-DKHPSGEQGNHLHKNG-3′, synthesized to the hydrophilic NH2 terminus of LdAAP3 protein was conjugated at its COOH terminus to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected to rabbits with 5 mg/ml protein. Rabbits were boosted four times with 5 mg/ml of the conjugated peptide. Injections and bleedings were carried out as a contracted service by Sigma-Aldrich. Antiserum was used at 1:1000. Rabbit antiserum against L. donovani HSP83 (15Saar Y. Ransford A. Waldman E. Mazareb S. Amin-Spector S. Plumblee J. Turco S.J. Zilberstein D. Mol. Biochem.

Total RNA from L. donovani promastigotes was prepared and subjected to Northern blotting as described before (21Barak E. Amin-Spector S. Gerliak E. Goyard S. Holland N. Zilberstein D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 141: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized to the LdAAP3 ORF and the 3′-UTR of LdAAP3 gene copy 2 using probes that had been PCR-amplified from L. donovani genomic DNA as described previously (10Shaked-Mishan P. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Yoel-Almagor T. Holland N. Zilberstein D. Rentsch D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 1 × 109 promastigote cells in growth medium or after starvation were washed once with the same volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1,200 × g for 10 min) and then twice with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min each. The washed cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline plus 1 ml of 5 n perchloric acid, vortexed, and incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. Perchloric acid lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 232 μl of 5 n KOH was added to the supernatant to titrate the sample pH to 7.0. Additional centrifugation was performed under the aforementioned conditions, and 200-μl aliquots were analyzed for amino acid content by the method of Fekkes et al. (22Fekkes D. van Dalen A. Edelman M. Voskuilen A. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 669: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The analyses were carried out at the Medical Biochemistry Laboratory at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. Intracellular amino acid concentrations were calculated based on a previously determined promastigote cell volume of 4.2 μl per 108 cells (23Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 12: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The pSNBR-ODC plasmid harboring the ODC ORF (16Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M.

U.S.A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected in 100 μg/ml G418 in the absence of putrescine. When mid log phase L. donovani promastigotes were transferred from Earl's-based medium 199 to Earl's salt solution supplemented with only 5 mm glucose, the initial rate of arginine transport increased as a function of time of starvation (Fig. 1A). Arginine transport rates increased 2-fold after 2 h and 5-fold after 4 h of amino acid deprivation. Addition of all amino acids to the starvation medium at their medium 199 concentrations almost completely inhibited this up-regulation of arginine transport rates, indicating that the augmentation in arginine transport rates could be ascribed to decreased amino acid availability (Fig. 1B). Moreover, incubating promastigotes under amino acid starvation conditions in the presence of cycloheximide inhibited starvation-induced transport up-regulation, indicating that up-regulation require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1C). Starvation-induced arginine transport up-regulation is an energy-dependent process, because addition of glucose to the starvation solution was essential for observed up-regulation of arginine transport (Fig. 1D). The same effect on starvation-induced arginine transport was achieved when glucose was replaced by proline as the sole source of metabolic energy (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in arginine transport was due to a change in LdAAP3 abundance, polyclonal antibodies against a 16-residue peptide from the hydrophilic NH2-terminal region of LdAAP3 were raised (see “Experimental Procedures”). The polyclonal antisera specifically recognized a 46-kDa protein in a membrane-enriched fraction of promastigotes (Fig. 2A). This 46-kDa band is slightly smaller than the expected molecular mass of LdAAP3 (52 kDa), possibly due to the hydrophobic nature of LdAAP3. Immunoblot analysis revealed that LdAAP3 abundance increased as a function of the length of time of amino acid starvation (Fig. 2B) in proportion to the observed increase in LdAAP3-mediated transport activity (see Fig. 1A). Cycloheximide inhibited this starvation-induced increase in LdAAP3 protein (Fig. 2C), indicating that starvation-induced arginine transport up-regulation required de novo synthesis of LdAAP3. Using polyclonal antiserum against L. donovani HSP83 (15Saar Y. Ransford A. Waldman E. Mazareb S. Amin-Spector S. Plumblee J. Turco S.J. Zilberstein D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) we observed that this protein copurified with the enriched parasites membrane fraction, and its amount was proportional to the protein content of this fraction. Thus, HSP83 could be used as an additional loading control in the immunoblotting experiments with LdAAP3. The effect of amino acid starvation on LdAAP3 transcript abundance was also determined. A significant increase in LdAAP3 transcript abundance was observed in parasites incubated under amino acid starvation conditions as assessed by probing Northern blots with either the LdAAP3 ORF or 3′-UTR of LdAAP3 copy 2 (Fig. 3). Significant increases in the abundance of both the 5- and 7-kb transcripts were detected. Conversely, only a minor change in the abundance of the 10-kb transcript was observed, demonstrating that prolonged amino acid starvation did not greatly affect the expression of LdAAP3 gene copy 1. Thus, starvation appears to differentially activate only one of the two LdAAP3 gene copies. One possible explanation for the starvation-activated LdAAP3-mediated arginine transport augmentation is that starvation triggers a decrease in the cellular content of arginine, thereby activating a signaling pathway that stimulates LdAAP3 expression and activity. To evaluate this hypothesis, we determined the amino acid pool of L. donovani promastigotes before and after starvation (Table 1). Alanine is the most abundant amino acid (39% of the pool), followed by glutamate (18%), arginine (11%), glycine (9%), lysine (7%), and serine (5%) in exponentially growing L. donovani promastigotes that were not subjected to amino acid starvation (C0). This amino acid distribution resembles that of L. major promastigotes as reported by Vieira and Cabantchik (25Vieira L.L. Cabantchik Z.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Subjecting L. donovani promastigotes to 4-h starvation in the presence of glucose caused ≥40% reduction in the cellular concentration of most amino acids (Table 1, C4). Interestingly, the intracellular pools of both lysine and valine, two amino acids that are essential for Leishmania, remained largely unchanged during starvation (<20%), while the concentration of two nonessential amino acids, aspartate and glutamine (8Opperdoes F.R. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2007; 23: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), increased during the starvation period by 110 and 39%, respectively.TABLE 1Effect of starvation on the cellular amino acid pool in L.donovani promastigotesAmino acidC0C4ΔCmm%Asp0.35 ± 0.220.75 ± 0.44114Gln0.69 ± 0.410.96 ± 0.4639Val1.48 ± 0.461.79 ± 0.1521Lys3.79 ± 2.053.4 ± 2.63−10Asn0.40 ± 0.070.25 ± 0.11−38Glu9.75 ± 2.635.51 ± 2.02−43Arg5.98 ± 4.473.07 ± 3.45−49Ser2.60 ± 0.631.19 ± 0.22−54Ala21.34 ± 4.339.54 ± 1.30−55Gly5.11 ± 2.371.95 ± 0.35−62Ile0.48 ± 0.190.17 ± 0.03−65Met0.36 ± 0.150.1 ± 0.01−72Leu1.42 ± 0.810.38 ± 0.11−73Thr0.53 ± 0.210.12 ± 0.09−77Phe0.13 ± 0.060.03 ± 0.02−80Tyr0.12 ± 0.060.02 ± 0.01−83His0.22 ± 0.130.03 ± 0.01−86 Open table in a new tab The cellular concentration of arginine decreased after 4 h starvation by almost 50%, from 6 mm to 3.1 mm. Because arginine is essential for Leishmania and is the sole precursor for polyamine synthesis, it was not surprising that, to compensate for the loss of cellular arginine, arginine transport increased significantly (Figs. 1A and 4A). Conversely, transport of lysine whose cellular concentration remained unchanged increased only slightly during starvation (38%, Fig. 4B). Amino acid starvation also produced a minor effect on proline transport (increased by 29%, Fig. 4C). Proline pools were not evaluated in these analyses, because our analytical method cannot detect proline and therefore proline content is missing in Table 1. However, glutamate is the precursor of both proline and glutamine, and, because the cellular level of glutamine increased after starvation (Table 1), it is likely that proline pools were also enhanced and, therefore, there was no requirement for promastigotes to increase their proline transport capacity. To investigate whether the up-regulation of LdAAP3 protein in response to general amino acid starvation was amino acid-specific, L. donovani promastigotes were incubated in the starvation buffer to which specific amino acids were added. Addition of arginine to the starvation buffer inhibited LdAAP3 up-regulation (Fig. 5). Conversely, addition of other amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, or aspartate had no effect on LdAAP3 abundance up-regulation. These data suggest that the effect of starvation on LdAAP3 expression and activity is specific for arginine availability. Because the sole metabolic function of arginine, aside from serving as a building block for protein synthesis (9Roberts S.C. Tancer M.J. Polinsky M.R. Gibson K.M. Heby O. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23668-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is in the biosynthesis of polyamines, we conjectured that genetic ablation of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway would suppress arginine uptake to avoid overflow of intracellular arginine. To evaluate this supposition, arginine uptake rates were determined in Δodc and Δspdsyn L. donovani mutants (16Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3781-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Roberts S.C. Jiang Y. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Heby O. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Addition of either putrescine or spermidine to the growth medium of wild-type L. donovani promastigotes diminished arginine transport rates by 7 and 30%, respectively (Fig. 6A). Arginine transport in the Δodc and Δspdsyn strains was ∼50% of that of wild-type parasites (Fig. 6B). This decrease in arginine uptake capacity was independent of the external supply of polyamines, because incubating the two null lines for 4 days without polyamine supplementation did not affect their arginine transport capacity (Fig. 6B). Kinetic analysis of arginine transport in promastigotes of wild-type indicated Km and Vmax values of 10.4 μm and 310 pmole/min/108 cells, respectively (Table 2). Ablation of the spdsyn gene reduced the Vmax value of arginine transport by 42% but had no effect on the Km value in cells supplemented with spermidine in their growth medium. In Δodc mutants that were grown in the presence of putrescine, Vmax value decreased even more, by 68% and Km value by 40% (Table 2). These data indicate that ablation of either spdsyn or odc genes affected primarily the Vmax value of arginine transport by LdAAP3.TABLE 2Kinetics of arginine transport in Δodc and Δspdsyn L. donovani promastigotesStrainVmaxKmnmol[(min)(108 cells)]−1μmWild type0.31 ± 0.0210.44 ± 2.79ΔSpdSyn0.18 ± 0.0511.33 ± 2.11Δodc0.10 ± 0.026.24 ± 4.04 Open table in a new tab To examine the relationship between arginine transport capability and intracellular pools, arginine and ornithine levels were determined in wild type and appropriately supplemented mutant parasites (Δodc and Δspdsyn cells were supplemented with putrescine and spermidine, respectively). Growth of wild-type parasites in the presence of 0.2 mm putrescine increased the cellular concentration of arginine by ∼20% but did not affect the cellular ornithine content (Fig. 6C). Conversely, addition of 0.2 mm spermidine to the culture medium reduced both ornithine and arginine pool by 50% (Fig. 6C). This correlated with the decrease in arginine transport capacity in parasites growing with spermidine (Fig. 6A). The cellular arginine pool of Δodc mutants that grew in 200 μm putrescine was ∼50% that of wild-type parasites maintained in the same growth medium, but ornithine pools were equivalent (Fig. 6C), presumably because Δodc cells continue to synthesize ornithine from arginine. The low level of cellular arginine in the Δodc mutants correlated with the lower level of arginine transport in these cells (Fig. 6B). The Δspdsyn null mutant displayed profoundly reduced pools of both arginine and ornithine. Arginine and ornithine pools in the Δspdsyn parasites were 18 and 34%, respectively, of those of wild-type parasites grown in the same medium. This finding was unexpected, because the rate of arginine transport in these cells was similar to that of the Δodc parasites grown with putrescine (Fig. 6B). Even though genetic ablation of the polyamine pathway from arginine reduced arginine transport rates, it had no effect on the abundance of LdAAP3 protein (Fig. 7). In contrast, ectopic expression of the wild-type odc gene from an episome within the Δodc background increased both the cellular levels of LdAAP3 protein in enriched membranes and the rate of LdAAP3-mediated arginine transport by 2-fold (Fig. 7). Leishmania promastigotes maintain a large cellular pool of arginine, ∼6 mm, that funnels carbon skeletons into polyamines and polypeptides, the sole metabolic pathways in the parasite to which the amino acid is a precursor. Because arginine is an essential amino acid for Leishmania, we hypothesized that the homeostatic mechanisms that regulate arginine pools and flux depend largely upon arginine uptake. In these investigations, we determined the relationships between arginine transport via LdAAP3 and amino acid availability in L. donovani. Major observations were: (a) starving promastigotes for amino acids decreased the cellular level of most amino acids including arginine; (b) amino acid starvation up-regulated arginine uptake via LdAAP3; (c) amino acid starvation increased abundance of both LdAAP3 mRNA and protein; and (d) disconnecting the polyamine synthesis pathway from the pool of arginine significantly decreased arginine transport and its cellular pool, but not LdAAP3 protein abundance. In all experiments with wild-type L. donovani, LdAAP3 expression and activity increased whenever the cellular level of arginine decreased. However, when polyamine biosynthesis was genetically disrupted, as in the Δodc and Δspdsyn knockouts, the rate of transport decreased to a new steady state that reduces the cellular pool of arginine. Thus, we propose that promastigotes have a signaling pathway that senses cellular concentrations of arginine and subsequently activates a mechanism that regulates LdAAP3 expression. After amino acid starvation, two of the three LdAAP3 mRNAs, the 5- and 7-kb transcripts accumulated, indicating that only one of the two LdAAP3 copies was overexpressed. Because gene expression in Leishmania is regulated post-transcriptionally (27Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), it is likely that increased mRNA stability determined the level of abundance of the two LdAAP3 transcripts. It is interesting that overexpression of only the second LdAAP3 gene copy is observed upon amino acid starvation. This second gene copy expresses both the 5- and 7-kb transcripts, both of which are up-regulated by amino acid starvation, whereas the 10-kb transcript that is transcribed from LdAAP3 gene 1 does not appear to be significantly up-regulated. What regulates this selective up-regulation of LdAAP3 gene copy 2 awaits further analysis, but these data establish that this second gene copy encodes a functional LdAAP3 permease. Correlating with the increase in LdAAP3 mRNA, the abundance of LdAAP3 protein and arginine transport activity increased in parallel, intimating that the observed increase in transport activity was due to a change in the number of available permease molecules in the parasite membrane rather than an increase in the turnover rate of LdAAP3. Hence, the starvation-induced arginine transport up-regulation is controlled by mRNA abundance. Strikingly, this response of L. donovani LdAAP3 to amino acid availability is identical to that of the mammalian arginine/lysine cation amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1 (3Hatzoglou M. Fernandez J. Yaman I. Closs E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)). The CAT1 permease is the major supplier of extracellular arginine in mammalian cells and is expressed almost ubiquitously with adult liver being a prominent exception (3Hatzoglou M. Fernandez J. Yaman I. Closs E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 377-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Amino acid starvation increases the expression of CAT1 with the concomitant accumulation of two CAT1 transcripts of 7.4 and 3.4 kb. The two CAT1 mRNAs accumulate with different kinetics and stability with the 7.4-kb mRNA exhibiting considerably greater stability in amino acid-depleted than in amino acid-replete cells (28Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on and other experiments indicated that mRNA stability is the mechanism responsible for CAT1 transcript up-regulation (28Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following mRNA accumulation, starvation also induced an increase in CAT1 protein abundance, which resulted in a significant increase in arginine transport activity. These studies indicate that CAT1 mRNA stability is the mechanism responsible for CAT1 response to change in amino acid availability. The observation that LdAAP3 and CAT1 respond similarly to amino acid starvation further supports our notion that mRNA stability regulates starvation-induced LdAAP3 expression and activity. Mechanisms that sense changes in amino acid availability have been described in fungi, including Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and S. cerevisiae (13Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, amino acid starvation or imbalance activates a mechanism termed “general amino acid control” that regulates not only amino acid biosynthetic genes of distinct metabolic pathways, but also aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, pathway-specific activators, and amino acid transporters (13Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The response is mediated by derepressed translation of the protein kinase GCN4 that finally induces expression of target genes. Furthermore, several plasma membrane-localized sensors that monitor extracellular nutrient availability have been identified in yeast (29Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Extracellular amino acids are sensed by the amino acid sensor Ssy1, a protein highly homologous to functional amino acid transporters (29Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Didion T. Regenberg B. Jørgensen M.U. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Mol.

When extracellular amino acids bind Ssy1, a signal transduction pathway that activates the transcription factors Stp1 and Stp2 that subsequently activate expression of several amino acid transporter genes is induced (33Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Abdel-Sater F. El Bakkoury M. Urrestarazu A. Vissers S. André B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9771-9785Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is yet not clear whether an Ssy1-like sensing mechanism also exists in Leishmania. However, our observation indicated that induction of LdAAP3 transcript and protein abundance was due to a mechanism that is specific for arginine and senses intracellular, not extracellular, arginine. Furthermore, whereas in both fungi and yeast activation of gene expression by amino acid availability is accomplished at the transcription level, mammalian CAT1 and leishmanial LdAAP3 are activated primarily by posttranscriptional processes. Our finding that two distinct permeases, CAT1 and LdAAP3 (see Table 1 in Ref. 10Shaked-Mishan P. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Yoel-Almagor T. Holland N. Zilberstein D. Rentsch D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which belong to phylogenetically disparate organisms, are regulated by similar mechanisms is intriguing. We hypothesize that Leishmania are mimicking mammalian cells response to amino acid starvation as part of their mechanism of adaptation to their hosts. This further supports the hypothesis raised by Shaked-Mishan et al. (10Shaked-Mishan P. Suter-Grotemeyer M. Yoel-Almagor T. Holland N. Zilberstein D. Rentsch D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that LdAAP3 contributes to Leishmania virulence. L. donovani mutants that lack the genes that encode key enzymes in the polyamine synthetic pathway are auxotrophic for polyamines and can only be maintained via the exogenous provision of polyamines synthesized downstream of the mutations (16Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3781-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Roberts S.C. Jiang Y. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Heby O. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because wild-type promastigotes grow in polyamine-deficient medium, arginine is the sole source precursor for polyamine synthesis. Because arginine is no longer a polyamine precursor in the mutants transport diminished. Furthermore, ectopic expression of wild-type odc in the Δodc mutants restored the use of arginine as the sole source precursor for polyamine synthesis as well as arginine transport activity. Thus, it appears that LdAAP3 “senses” lack of precursor function in the mutants and accordingly sets the level of the cellular pool of arginine; high (∼6 mm) in wild-type and low (≤3 mm) in the null mutants. The fact that supplementing wild-type promastigotes with either putrescine or spermidine in the growth medium only slightly changed the rate of arginine transport indicates the prioritization that promastigotes assign to the polyamine precursor function of arginine. Interestingly, whereas addition of putrescine to the growth medium had no effect on arginine metabolism, spermidine significantly reduced their levels in both wild-type and mutants. This implies that spermidine biosynthesis is a regulation point for polyamines metabolism. How this regulates arginine metabolism and transport is an interesting question that needs to be addressed in the future. Whenever arginine transport activity increased, either due to amino acid starvation or ectopic expression of odc, it was due to an increase in LdAAP3 protein abundance. In contrast, when arginine transport was suppressed as in the polyamine biosynthesis null mutants, there was no change in the abundance of this protein. Thus, it is likely that up-regulation and down-regulation of LdAAP3 activities are regulated by different mechanisms; one requires net synthesis of LdAAP3, and the other may involve allosteric regulation of LdAAP3 activity. The abundance-independent suppression of arginine transport in L. donovani resembles the negative regulation of arginine transport via the arginine transporter CAN1 in S. cerevisiae (4Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Chattopadhyay S. Pearce D.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these cells, a small G protein, Rheb, negatively regulates arginine transport by directly interacting with Can1 via a farnesylated C terminus binding site. Interestingly, the L. infantum genome (closely related to L. donovani) contains three Rheb homologues (LinJ10_V3.0960, LinJ10_V3.1250, and LinJ27_V3.0620) that are 30–35% identical and 50% similar to S. cerevisiae Rheb. Furthermore, recent proteomic analysis done in our laboratory revealed that L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes express the protein products of all three genes (26Rosenzweig D. Smith D. Opperdoes F. Stern S. Olafson R.W. Zilberstein D. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 590-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, none of them contain the farnesyl binding site that is found in the S. cerevisiae Rheb. Thus, whether L. donovani Rhebs are involved in regulating LdAAP3 activity is an open question that is currently under investigation. In conclusion, this work reveals how Leishmania responds to arginine availability and highlights the importance of arginine transport. Because promastigotes represent the invasive stages, we propose that Leishmania mimic hosts' responses to amino acid availability to improve virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2167521387,"Environmental enrichment (EE) fosters attachment behavior through its effect on brain oxytocin levels in the hippocampus and other brain regions, which in turn modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Social isolation and other stressors negatively impact physical healing through their effect on the HPA. Therefore, we reasoned that: 1) provision of a rat EE (nest building with Nestlets) would improve wound healing in rats undergoing stress due to isolation rearing and 2) that oxytocin would have a similar beneficial effect on wound healing.In the first two experiments, we provided isolation reared rats with either EE or oxytocin and compared their wound healing to group reared rats and isolation reared rats that did not receive Nestlets or oxytocin. In the third experiment, we examined the effect of Nestlets on open field locomotion and immediate early gene (IEG) expression. We found that isolation reared rats treated with Nestlets a) healed significantly better than without Nestlets, 2) healed at a similar rate to rats treated with oxytocin, 3) had decreased hyperactivity in the open field test, and 4) had normalized IEG expression in brain hippocampus.This study shows that when an EE strategy or oxytocin is given to isolation reared rats, the peripheral stress response, as measured by burn injury healing, is decreased. The findings indicate an association between the effect of nest making on wound healing and administration of the pro-bonding hormone oxytocin. Further elucidation of this animal model should lead to improved understanding of how EE strategies can ameliorate poor wound healing and other symptoms that result from isolation stress."

We quantified such blood shifts in normal subjects by measuring trunk volume by optoelectronic plethysmography, simultaneously with changes in body volume by whole body plethysmography during contractions of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. Trunk volume changes with blood shifts, but body volume does not so that the blood volume shifted between trunk and extremities (Vbs) is the difference between changes in trunk and body volume. This is so because both trunk and body volume change identically with breathing and gas expansion or compression. During tidal breathing Vbs was 50-75 ml with an ejection fraction of 4-6% and an output of 750-1500 ml/min. Step increases in abdominal pressure resulted in rapid emptying presumably from the liver with a time constant of 0.61+/-0.1SE sec. followed by slower flow from non-hepatic viscera. The filling time constant was 0.57+/-0.09SE sec. Splanchnic emptying shifted up to 650 ml blood. With emptying, the increased hepatic vein flow increases the blood pressure at its entry into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and abolishes the pressure gradient producing flow between the femoral vein and the IVC inducing blood pooling in the legs. The findings are important for exercise because the larger the Vbs the greater the perfusion of locomotor muscles. During asystolic cardiac arrest we calculate that appropriate timing of abdominal compression could produce an output of 6 L/min. so that the abdominal circulatory pump might act as an auxiliary heart."

Replication fork is not only the site of DNA synthesis but also the center for coordinated execution of various chromosome transactions.

Replication fork machinery can cope with various stresses, including shortage of the cellular nucleotide pool and replication fork blockages that interfere with its progression. Stalled replication forks activate checkpoint pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, restart of DNA replication, or cell death in some cases (11Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W.

Mcm7, a component of the replicative DNA helicase in eukaryotes, was reported to associate with the checkpoint clamp loader Rad17 (24Tsao C.C. Geisen C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and to have a distinct function in checkpoint (24Tsao C.C. Geisen C. Abraham R.T.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Cdc7 kinase, known to be required for DNA replication initiation, plays a role in activation of DNA replication checkpoint possibly through regulating Claspin phosphorylation (26Kim J.M. Kakusho N. Yamada M. Kanoh Y. Takemoto N. Masai H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that DNA replication and checkpoint activation functionally and physically interact with each other. Another crucial cellular event for maintenance of genome stability is sister chromatid cohesion. The cohesin complex, a conserved apparatus required for sister chromatid cohesion, contains Smc1, Smc3, and Rad21/Scc1/Mcd1 proteins. The assembled cohesin complexes are loaded onto chromatin prior to DNA replication in G1 phase and link the sister chromosomes during S and G2 phase until mitosis when they separate (27Nasmyth K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 28Haering C.H. Löwe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The mitotic cohesion defects are not rescued by supplementing cohesin in G2 phase, and it has been suggested that establishment of sister chromatid cohesion is coupled with DNA replication (29Lengronne A.

Indeed, yeast mutants in some replisome components show defect in sister chromosome cohesion or undergo chromosome loss (31Xu H. Boone C. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell.

The budding yeast counterpart was identified as a replisome component described above (7Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. Nat.

CTF4 is nonessential for viability, but its interactions with primase, Rad2 (FEN1 family of nuclease), and Dna2 have implicated CTF4 in lagging strand synthesis and/or Okazaki fragment processing (36Formosa T.

Recently, it was reported that human AND-1 protein interacts with human primase-DNA polymerase α and Mcm10 and is required for DNA synthesis (43Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we confirm that human AND-1 protein is required for DNA replication and efficient progression of S phase, and we further show that it facilitates replication checkpoint. Depletion of AND-1 causes accumulation of DNA damage and cell cycle arrest at late S to G2 phase, ultimately leading to cell death. Furthermore, we also show that human AND-1 physically interacts with cohesin proteins Smc1, Smc3, Rad21/Scc1, suggesting a possibility that AND-1 may physically and functionally link replisome and cohesin complexes in vivo. Recent studies indicate that sister chromatid cohesion is required for recombinational DNA repair (44Sjögren C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 991-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 45Cortés-Ledesma F. Aguilera A.

Thus, we examined the requirement of AND-1 for repair of artificially induced double-stranded DNA breaks and showed that AND-1 depletion leads to significant reduction of the double strand break repair. Possible roles of AND-1 in coordination of various chromosome transactions at a replication fork and in maintenance of genome integrity during S phase will be discussed. HeLa, HeLa S3, and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For synchronization, cells were arrested twice at the G1/S boundary by incubation in the presence of 2.5 mm thymidine for 14–16 h with a 9-h interval of growth without the drug. Cells were released into the cell cycle and harvested at the indicated time intervals. Protein samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot. To detect the mobility shift of AND-1 in HeLa cells, proteins were separated on 7% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide = 89:1). Cell cycle was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter as described previously (48Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes was conducted by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) or X-tremeGENE (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagents as described previously (23Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2729-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sense strands of the four different siRNA for human AND-1 were as follows: AND-1 number 1, 5′-GAUGGUCAAGAAGGCAGCAdTdT-3′; AND-1 number 3, 5′-AGGAAAACAUGCCUGCCACdTdT-3′; AND-1 number 4; and 5′-GGUGUAGGUAACAGGACAUdAdT-3′; AND-1 number 5, 5′-CAGAGAUGACUUGUGUAUUGdTdA-3′. siRNA for TopBP1 was 5′-CAGUGGAGGUGGAGUUCGdTdT-3′. siRNAs for Tipin, Cdc7 (Cdc7-1 and Cdc7-D), and control siRNA were described previously (23Yoshizawa-Sugata N.

Anti-AND-1Npep antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with the N-terminal 20-amino acid residue polypeptide of human AND-1, and anti-AND-1C antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the glutathione S-transferase-tagged C-terminal domain (712–1129 amino acids) of the human AND-1. Both antibodies were affinity-purified using antigen-coupled protein A-Sepharose or HiTrap NHS-activated HP (GE Healthcare). Rabbit anti-γH2AX antibody was a gift from Katsuyuki Tamai (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). Anti-Mcm4 antibody was reported previously (3Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A. Tanaka T. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Ohtani K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39249-39261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Antibodies from commercial sources were as follows: Chk1, Chk2, PCNA, lamin B, and Mcm7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); α-tubulin and FLAG M2 (Sigma); Chk1 S317P, Chk1 S345P, Chk2 T68P, Smc1 S957P, and Cdc25C S216P (Cell Signaling); Claspin, Smc1, Smc3, Rad21, and TopBP1 (Bethyl Laboratories); Cdc7 (MBL); RPA p34 (NeoMarkers); HP1α (Upstate). Full-length human AND-1 cDNAs were subcloned into pME18S-FLAG vector. HeLa S3 cells were transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and were harvested at 48 h, followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Preparation of cells for immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (23Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H. J. Biol.

Briefly, for pre-extraction procedure, cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then fixed with methanol and immediately dried. For post-extraction procedure, PBS-washed cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed with PBS, and lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100. For immunostaining, the cells on coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with primary antibodies in AB buffer (0.1 m PIPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1.83% l-lysine, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% NaN3) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 μg per ml)) for 45 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed with PBS three times and mounted with PBS containing 90% glycerol, 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (Sigma). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed using in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as instructed by the provider (51Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell morphology was observed by phase-contrast microscopy (IX50, Olympus), and images were captured with a digital camera (Camedia, Olympus). For counting cell death or mitotic index, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342, and morphologies of nuclei and mitotic chromosome were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera. At least 1,000 cells in 3–5 fields were counted for each transfectant. In Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S2B, grayscale images were pseudocolored and merged using software Aquacosmos (Hamamatsu Photonics). Cells were fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions by the procedure described previously (48Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Fractionation of S phase cells into five fractions (Fig. 3C) was performed as follows: HeLa cells were extracted with CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, and separated into supernatants (S1) and pellets, which were further washed with CSK buffer without detergent (wash-out fraction). After digestion of the pellets with DNase I (1,000 units/ml) at 25 °C for 30 min, the soluble fraction was separated as chromatin fraction by centrifugation. Finally, pellets were extracted with CSK buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and fractionated into high salt-soluble nuclear fraction (S2) and nuclear scaffold fraction. Cells were extracted with lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC). After rotation for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. In Fig. 5A, nuclear extracts lysed with high salt buffer containing 0.35 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were used. Before immunoprecipitation, the extracts were precleared by incubation with protein A- and protein G-Sepharose and centrifugation for 3 min at 11,000 × g. The cleared extracts were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated. For phosphatase assay in vitro, 30 μg of HeLa cell extracts were incubated with λ phosphatase (400 units) with or without phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm Na3VO4 and 50 mm NaF) at 30 °C for 30 min. To dephosphorylate Chk1 S317P, the extracts were treated at 10 °C for 15 min. For treatment with kinase inhibitors in vivo, HeLa cells were synchronized by thymidine block and released for 2 h and then were treated with the following reagents or mock-treated: caffeine (5 mm, Wako), Gö6976 and SB218078 (1 and 5 μm, respectively, Calbiochem). After incubation for 1.5 h, cells were further incubated in the presence of 2 mm hydroxyurea (HU) for 1 h and harvested. RDS after UV irradiation was assayed as reported previously (23Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2729-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 52Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with some modification as shown in Fig. 4, A, C, and D and legend. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter as described previously (48Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The integral values of BrdUrd incorporation were determined from calculating the products of geometric means of BrdUrd incorporation and the numbers of BrdUrd-positive cells. The calculated values normalized by those of control siRNA-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S1G) or cells untreated (supplemental Fig. S3B) were set as 100. The homologous recombination frequency was determined as described previously (53Saleh-Gohari N. Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Parker K.M. Cassel T.N. Helleday T. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, the assay was conducted in SW480sn3 cells harboring a single integrated copy of a recombination substrate SCneo (55Mohindra A. Hays L.E. Phillips E.N. Preston B.D. Helleday T. Meuth M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2189-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 56Johnson R.D. Jasin M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 196-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection of cells with siRNAs (48 h), cells were further transfected with pCMV3nls-I-SceI or pME18S plasmid DNA. After 48 h, double strand break-introduced cells were either replated in selection media containing 1 mg of G418 per ml (2 × 105 cells per dish, triplicated) or nonselection media (500 cells per dish, triplicated; for control of colony-forming efficiency). After 2 weeks for selection, colonies were fixed and stained with Giemsa and counted. The recombination frequency was calculated as described previously (57Collis S.J. Barber L.J. Clark A.J. Martin J.S. Ward J.D. Boulton S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Budding yeast CTF4 protein, the presumed functional homolog of human AND-1, has been reported as a component of replisome progressing complex (7Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). We have generated two anti-human AND-1 antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”) and found that the expression of endogenous human AND-1 proteins was constant throughout the cell cycle (data not shown) as reported previously (43Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In immunoblot analysis, we found that a portion of AND-1 protein was recovered in chromatin-enriched fraction in early to mid-S phase (Fig. 1A, lanes 14, 15, and 22–24) in a manner similar to that of PCNA. We then analyzed the cellular localization of AND-1 by immunostaining. AND-1 protein was detected in nuclei throughout the interphase in formaldehyde-fixed cells (Fig. 1B) (58Köhler A. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Franke W.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1051-1062PubMed Google Scholar). The signal intensities and overall patterns of detergent-resistant AND-1 staining in nuclei (Fig. 1C, panel a) varied dramatically in different cells and were mostly correlated with those of RPA (Fig. 1C, panels b and c), suggesting that the AND-1 may be associated with the sites of DNA replication spatiotemporally. To explore the physiological functions of AND-1, it was depleted from cells by small interference RNA (siRNA). Four different siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes specific for human AND-1 were designed and introduced into U2OS or HeLa cells. Each transfected siRNA significantly reduced the level of AND-1 protein (Fig. 2A and data not shown). To examine the effects of knockdown of AND-1 on cell growth, cell numbers was monitored at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection of HeLa cells. Treatment with AND-1 siRNA retarded cell growth (Fig. 2B and phase contrast images in supplemental Fig. S1B). The cell cycle profile of AND-1-depleted cells resulted in slight reduction in G1 phase population and accumulation of late S and/or G2 phase population in both HeLa (supplemental Fig. S1A) and U2OS cells (data not shown). Thus, we examined the effects of AND-1 knockdown on S phase progression and DNA synthesis in more detail. In control cells synchronously released from the G1/S boundary after transfection of siRNA (Fig. 2C), S phase was completed by 9 h after release as presented in the histograms of DNA content analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W2041232743,"Understanding the factors, which control ErbB2 and EGF receptor (EGFR) status in cells is likely to inform future therapeutic approaches directed at these potent oncogenes. ErbB2 is resistant to stimulus-induced degradation and high levels of over-expression can inhibit EGF receptor down-regulation. We now show that for HeLa cells expressing similar numbers of EGFR and ErbB2, EGFR down-regulation is efficient and insensitive to reduction of ErbB2 levels. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) may extend protein half-lives by rescuing ubiquitinated substrates from proteasomal degradation or from ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal sorting. Using a siRNA library directed at the full complement of human DUBs, we identified POH1 (also known as Rpn11 or PSMD14), a component of the proteasome lid, as a critical DUB controlling the apparent ErbB2 levels. Moreover, the effects on ErbB2 levels can be reproduced by administration of proteasomal inhibitors such as epoxomicin used at maximally tolerated doses. However, the extent of this apparent loss and specificity for ErbB2 versus EGFR could not be accounted for by changes in transcription or degradation rate. Further investigation revealed that cell surface ErbB2 levels are only mildly affected by POH1 knock-down and that the apparent loss can at least partially be explained by the accumulation of higher molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of ErbB2 that are detectable with an extracellular but not intracellular domain directed antibody. We propose that POH1 may deubiquitinate ErbB2 and that this activity is not necessarily coupled to proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1964583664,"Background In early clinical studies, the live tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG exhibited 80% protective efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Although BCG still exhibits reliable protection against TB meningitis and miliary TB in early childhood it has become less reliable in protecting against pulmonary TB. During decades of in vitro cultivation BCG not only lost some genes due to deletions of regions of the chromosome but also underwent gene duplication and other mutations resulting in increased antioxidant production. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine whether microbial antioxidants influence vaccine immunogenicity, we eliminated duplicated alleles encoding the oxidative stress sigma factor SigH in BCG Tice and reduced the activity and secretion of iron co-factored superoxide dismutase. We then used assays of gene expression and flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining to compare BCG-specific immune responses in mice after vaccination with BCG Tice or the modified BCG vaccine. Compared to BCG, the modified vaccine induced greater IL-12p40, RANTES, and IL-21 mRNA in the spleens of mice at three days post-immunization, more cytokine-producing CD8+ lymphocytes at the peak of the primary immune response, and more IL-2-producing CD4+ lymphocytes during the memory phase. The modified vaccine also induced stronger secondary CD4+ lymphocyte responses and greater clearance of challenge bacilli. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that antioxidants produced by BCG suppress host immune responses. These findings challenge the hypothesis that the failure of extensively cultivated BCG vaccines to prevent pulmonary tuberculosis is due to over-attenuation and suggest instead a new model in which BCG evolved to produce more immunity-suppressing antioxidants. By targeting these antioxidants it may be possible to restore BCG's ability to protect against pulmonary TB."

In addition to the estrogen supply from the ovary, estrogen is produced locally from androgen by aromatase. However, the regulation of aromatase gene expression in breast cancer has not yet been fully clarified. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR) α plays an important role in the differentiation of many organs by regulating the transcription of target genes. Because aromatase and RORα are expressed in breast cancer, the effect of RORα on aromatase gene expression was studied. RORα significantly augmented the expression of aromatase mRNA, particularly those containing exon I.4, in MCF7 cells, and aromatase activities in T47D and MCF7 cells. RORα also stimulated the proliferation of these cells. Transient transfection-based reporter gene assays using the promoter at exon I.4 showed that RORα augmented the transcription. A series of truncated mutation studies revealed that RORα activated the transcription through −147 to +14 bp of the promoter I.4. Furthermore, RORα bound to the fragment containing −119 to −107 bp of the promoter in vitro, indicating that this region may contain a novel ROR response element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that RORα bound to the region containing this site of the promoter I.4 in MCF7 cells. Moreover, we examined clinical samples and found a correlation between RORα and aromatase expression.

The levels of intratumoral estradiol are not significantly different between premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer patients, but the intratumoral estradiol/estrone ratio is significantly higher in postmenopausal than in premenopausal breast cancer patients (15Miyoshi Y.

The human aromatase gene has a multiplex promoter, followed by untranslated exon I and nine common exons (II–X) (Fig. 1). Each exon I is spliced to exon II (Fig. 1, solid box). The 5′ region of exon II (Fig. 1, dotted box) is included in aromatase mRNA only when transcription starts with promoter II (PII).

However, the transcriptional control mechanism and/or the correlation between nuclear receptor expression and aromatase activity in breast cancer cells have remained largely unknown. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR) α is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily. RORα constitutively activates gene transcription by binding as a monomer to specific DNA sequences termed ROR response elements (ROREs), which are composed of a half-core PuGGTCA motif preceded by a 6-bp A/T-rich sequence (30Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 31Evans R.M.

By alternative splicing, the RORα gene gives rise to four isoforms, RORα1, 2, 3, and 4 (30Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 33Calberg C. Hooft van Huijsduijnenet R. Staple J.K. DeLamarter J.F. Becker-André M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 757-770PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct RORα isoforms share the common DNA-binding and putative ligand-binding domains but differ in the N-terminal domain, which confers the different DNA binding specificities and transcriptional activities among RORα isoforms. Until recently, RORα has been considered as a true orphan receptor that does not acquire ligands (34Lau P. Bailey P. Dowhan D.H. Muscat G.E.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Atkins G.B. Hu X. Guenther M.G. Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Lazar M.A. Mol.

However, a recent study has shown the possibility that cholesterol and its metabolite may be its ligand (37Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Delhon I. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14033-14038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because cholesterol and its metabolites are abundantly contained in cells, RORα binds to such compounds constitutively and activates transcription of the target genes. Dai et al. (38Dai J. Ram P.T. Yuan L. Spriggs L.L. Hill S.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 176: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) has reported that the RORα mRNA is expressed in MCF7 cells. However, the function of RORα in breast cancer cells has been entirely unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression of RORα isoforms in a series of human breast cancer cell lines. We then investigated the effect of RORα on the aromatase transcription, aromatase activity, and proliferation of breast cancer cells to study the role of RORα in the aromatase-mediated progression of breast cancer. Aromatase PI.4 −1004/+14-pGL3-Luc, which contains the −1004/+14 region of the aromatase PI.4 promoter inserted into reporter plasmid containing luciferase (pGL3-Basic) (Promega, Madison, WI), was kindly provided by Dr. M. Watanabe (39Watanabe M. Ohno S. Nakajin S. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 152: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PI.4 −458/+14, PI.4 −458/−126, PI.4 −147/+14, and PI.4 −106/+14 regions were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGL3-Basic. The human RORα1 expression vector was described previously (40Koibuchi N. Liu Y. Fukuda H. Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1356-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PI.4 −147/+14 ΔRORE was made using the KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with a sense primer (5′-gagctcgaggtcacagaaggcagaggcc-3′). FLAG-RORα1-pcDNA3 was constructed by inserting PCR fragment of human full-length RORα1 into EcoRI and ApaI sites of FLAG-inserted pcDNA3. [1β-3H]Androst-4-ene-3,17-dione was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Androstenedione was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF7, BT20, and MDA-MB-231) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were maintained in the medium recommended by American Type Culture Collection supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The serum was stripped of hormones by constant mixing with 5% (w/v) AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) and powdered charcoal before ultrafiltration. The cells were cultured without phenol red. The cells were seeded into six-well plates. After 24 h of transfection, RNA was carefully extracted using the RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the Superscript III cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7300 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA), using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer sequences for real time RT-PCR were designed as below. RORα-common (sense, 5′-aaacctgccaatacttgagagaa-3′; antisense, 5′-cacaattgccacatcacctc-3′); RORα1 (sense, 5′-ctccagcgatctctacattg-3′; antisense, 5′-cctgatgatttgtctccacag-3′); RORα2.3 (sense, 5′-caggaaaaggcatgaatgag-3′; antisense, 5′-cctgatgatttgtctccacag-3′); RORα4 (sense, 5′-tgtattttgtgatcgcagcg-3′; antisense, 5′-cctgatgatttgtctccacag-3′); Aromatase-common (sense, 5′-acattataacatcaccagcatcgt-3′; antisense, 5′-ccaattcccatgcagtagc-3′); Aromatase-PI.1 (sense, 5′-gtgctcgggatcttccag-3′; antisense, 5′-attcccatgcagtagccagg-3′); Aromatase-PI.3 (sense, 5′-ccttgttttgacttgtaacca-3′; antisense, 5′-ctccatatacccggttgtag-3′); Aromatase-PI.4 (sense,5′-actggtcagcccatcaaacc-3′; antisense, 5′-attcccatgcagtagccagg-3′); Aromatase-PI.7 (sense, 5′-ggctccatctacaaggatga-3′; antisense, 5′-attcccatgcagtagccagg-3′); Aromatase-PII (sense,5′-gaagcaacaggagctatagat-3′; antisense, 5′-ccaattcccatgcagtagc-3′); GR (sense, 5′-tcaggctggaatgaacctg-3′; antisense, 5′-tcagaggtttcttgtgagactcc-3′); and β-actin (sense, 5′-ggcggcaccaccatgtaccct-3′; antisense, 5′-aggggccggactcgtcatact-3′). The annealing and extension temperature was 60 °C for 1 min. Each measured value was calculated using each standard. A standard dilution series of control DNA was included in every experiment. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate, with independent RNA preparations. The results for each sample were normalized by β-actin mRNA level as an internal control. Breast cancer cells were seeded into plates and maintained in the stripped fetal bovine serum medium for 24 h. The cells were transiently transfected with each vector using Lipofectamine LTX or 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested and incubated in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (a phosphatase inhibitor) for 10 min on ice. Proteins (40 μg/sample) were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL; GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) and probed with anti-RORα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-aromatase (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibody. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL Advance system (GE Healthcare) and visualized with a Lumi-Imager imaging analyzer (Roche Applied Science). The siRNA for RORα (Hs_RORA_8; 5′-caggtcttgatatcaatggaa-3′) was purchased from Qiagen. The cells were transfected with siRNA using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The expression level of RORα was confirmed by quantitative real time RT-PCR. The cells were seeded into six-well plates. After 48 h from transfection, the endogenous aromatase activity was measured by the detection of 3HOH released during the aromatization of [1β-3H] androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, as previously described (41Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. MacDonald P.C. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). After dissolving the cells in lysis buffer, the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The 3HOH count was normalized using the amount of protein (dpm/h/mg of protein). All of the experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. The cells were seeded into 24-well plates (1 × 105/well). Sixteen hours after transfection, the culture medium was changed with that with or without 10−7m androstenedione (0 h). The cells were then cultured for 120 h. The cultured cells were counted using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate. The cells were seeded into 24-well plates. A pGL3-Luc reporter (0.2 μg) containing aromatase promoter fragments was cotransfected with the expression vector encoding RORα1 (0.05 μg) or the empty vector into T47D cells using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). The empty pGL3-Luc reporter was used as a negative control, and then luciferase activity was calculated as fold basal luciferase activity with the pGL3-Luc reporter alone (n = 3; means ± S.E.). Cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected as an internal control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cell extracts were analyzed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities to correct for transfection efficiency as described previously (42Miyazaki W. Iwasaki T. Takeshita A. Kuroda Y. Koibuchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18195-18202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing RORE of aromatase PI.4 promoter (sense, 5′-aggggaagattgaggtcacag-3′; antisense, 5′-agggctgtgacctcaatcttc-3′) and ΔRORE (sense, 5′-agggggagctcgaggtcacag-3′; antisense, 5′-agggctgtgacctcgagctcc-3′) were labeled using Klenow fragment with [α-32P]dCTP. In vitro translated RORα1 and 1 × 104 cpm of labeled templates were incubated in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 110 mm NaCl, 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 20% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min on ice. Different amounts of control reticulocyte lysate were added to some samples so that the total volume of the reticulocyte lysate was consistent. Anti-RORα antibody was used for the supershift experiment. After incubation, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. ChIP assays were performed using the EZ ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions with modification. Briefly, MCF7 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes, to 40–50% confluency, and FLAG-RORα1 was transfected. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde, and the cell lysates were precipitated using the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). An aliquot of the cell lysates was used to isolate total input DNA. Amplifications of the immunoprecipitated DNA were performed by PCR. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate. Primers for human CYP19/aromatase PI.4 sequences were: sense, 5′-atgaccaaccaagactaagag-3′ and antisense, 5′-cagttggtcacgttctacttgg-3′ Amplified bands were loaded on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Twenty fresh surgical specimens were obtained from female patients (mean age was 56.4 years) with invasive breast cancer. Total RNAs were prepared using the RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Following quantitative real time RT-PCR procedure was same as above. All of the procedures were approved by the ethics committee on human research of Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Treatment effects were analyzed by analysis of variance and by post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni's multiple range test. When p < 0.05, the effect was considered to be significant. To examine the expression of RORα in a series of clonal breast cancer cell lines, we performed quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2, A–D). MCF7 and T47D cells are ER-positive, whereas BT20 and MDA-MB-231 cells are ER-negative. We detected total RORα (Fig. 2A) and RORα isoform mRNA (Fig. 2, B–D). The expression levels of total RORα in MCF7 were 3-fold higher than those in T47D. The expression patterns of RORα isoforms are different among cell lines. Of note, the expression level of RORα1 in T47D was very low (Fig. 2B), and RORα4 in MDA-MB-231 was not detected (Fig. 2D). To examine the expression of aromatase in breast cancer cells, we performed Western blotting (data not shown) and quantitative real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2E) analysis. Aromatase was expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in all of the cell lines examined. We then examined the aromatase activity (Fig. 2F). The aromatase activity levels were correlated with the aromatase mRNA levels. This is consistent with previous studies showing that the cytochrome P-450 enzyme activities are induced largely by transcriptional activation (43Plant N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the expression patterns of aromatase in these four cell lines is compared with that of RORα (Fig. 2A), they are quite similar: MCF7 and BT20 cells express higher levels of aromatase and RORα than the other two cell lines. Thus, we predicted the possible interaction between aromatase expression and RORα. The function of RORα in breast cancer cells has been entirely unknown. However, the results shown in Fig. 2 indicate a possible interaction between aromatase expression and RORα. Thus, we examined the effect of RORα on the regulation of aromatase expression. After transient transfection of the expression vector encoding RORα1 into MCF7 cells, we carried out Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against aromatase. We also confirmed the protein levels of RORα before and after transfection (Fig. 3A). The expression levels of aromatase protein in MCF7 were augmented by overexpressed RORα1 (Fig. 3A). In addition, the expression levels of aromatase mRNA in MCF7 were also augmented by RORα1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the transcription of the aromatase gene may be regulated by RORα1. We examined the effect of RORα1 on the endogenous aromatase activity. Endogenous aromatase activity was measured by the detection of 3HOH released during aromatization of [1β-3H] androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, as previously described (41Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. MacDonald P.C. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The aromatase activities in MCF7 and T47D, both of which are ER-positive, were augmented by increasing the amount of RORα1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D). The aromatase activities in ER-negative BT20 and MDA-MB-231 cells were also augmented by RORα1 in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). We then examined the effect of RORα1 on the proliferation of breast cancer cells. In the presence of androstenedione, which is converted to estrone by aromatase, the cell proliferation was stimulated by the overexpressed RORα1 in ER-positive MCF7 and T47D cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Without androstenedione, the proliferation was not stimulated by RORα1. In ER-negative BT20 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the cell proliferation was not stimulated by RORα1 in the presence of androstenedione (data not shown). These results indicate that the expression of aromatase is augmented by RORα1, which may accelerate the conversion of androstenedione to estrone, leading the stimulation of the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells. The expression of the aromatase gene is regulated in a tissue-specific manner by the multiplex promoter (Fig. 1). In a series of breast cancer cell lines, exon I arising from PI.1, PI.3, PI.4, PI.7, and PII has been detected (9Utsumi T. Harada N. Maruta M. Takagi Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2344-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhou C. Zhou D. Esteban J. Murai J. Siiteri P.K. Wilczynski S. Chen S. J. Steroid Biochm. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Sasano H. Harada N. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 593-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of the regulation of aromatase transcription by RORα, we examined which promoter was activated by RORα. Using quantitative real time RT-PCR studies, we measured the levels of each nontranslated exon I of aromatase mRNA with or without transfection of RORα1 (Fig. 4, A–D). Only exon I.4 mRNA was up-regulated by RORα1. This up-regulation was observed 12–48 h after transfection. The mRNAs of exons I.1, I.3, and I.7 were detected in MCF7 cells, but a significant change was not observed. The 5′ portion of exon II arising from PII was not detected in MCF7. Previously, it was reported that the aromatase promoter I.4 contains the glucocorticoid response element and is regulated by glucocorticoid (27Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether RORα up-regulates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription, which then activates aromatase promoter I.4. However, no significant up-regulation of GR mRNA by RORα1 was observed (Fig. 4E). To confirm further the augmentation of aromatase expression by RORα, we performed siRNA study. The siRNA against RORα was transfected into MCF7 cells. After 120 h of incubation, we carried out quantitative real time RT-PCR using the pair of primers for RORα and exon I.4. The decrease of ∼60% in the expression level of RORα mRNA was confirmed by quantitative real time RT-PCR studies (data not shown). Repression of RORα resulted in the decrease in the expression level of exon I.4 mRNA (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that aromatase expression is regulated by RORα through promoter I.4. Thus, a novel RORE was presumed. To examine whether RORα regulates the aromatase transcription through PI.4, transient transfection-based reporter gene assays were carried out in T47D cells (Fig. 5). As predicted, RORα activated the transcription of aromatase PI.4 (−1004/+14) ∼10-fold compared with the basal level (second column). To evaluate the RORα target region, 5′-deletional and mutational constructs of the aromatase PI.4 fused to a luciferase expression reporter gene were transfected. Each construct was cotransfected with or without the RORα1 expression vector. The RORα activated the transcription through the regions containing −1004/+14, −458/+14, and −147/+14 (second, third, and fifth columns) but not −458/−126 and −106/+14 (fourth and sixth columns) in T47D cells. These results indicate that the sequence between −147 and −106 bp of PI.4 is required for the response of RORα1 in T47D cells. Data base analysis of the aromatase gene sequence revealed the existence of consensus RORE, a 6-bp A/T-rich region followed by the AGGTCA sequence, at the −119/−107-bp region of PI.4. To investigate the role of this sequence in directing the basal promoter activity by RORα, the A/T-rich sequence (aagattg) at −119/−113-bp, which is located at the 5′ region of the half-site core motif, was replaced with the G/C-rich sequence (gagctcg). This mutation abolished the promoter activity of the aromatase PI.4 by RORα1 in T47D cells (Fig. 6A). To confirm the interaction of RORα1 with the PI.4 −119/−107-bp region, DNA mobility shift and antibody supershift experiments were carried out using in vitro-synthesized RORα1 protein and double-strand oligonucleotide containing the −119/−107-bp region (Fig. 6B). The RORα1 bound to the −121/−104-bp probe (Fig. 6B, lane 2). The band was attenuated by the addition of cold probe (lane 3). The antibody supershift using the anti-RORα antibody was observed (lane 4). Moreover, the RORα1 did not bind to the mutated DNA probe (lane 6). Together with functional studies, these results indicate that the PI.4 −119/−107-bp of the aromatase gene functions as a novel ROR response element. To confirm the binding of RORα1 to the aromatase PI.4 in MCF7 cells, ChIP assays were carried out using FLAG-RORα1 and anti-FLAG antibody. Anti-RNA polymerase II antibody and normal mouse IgG were used as controls (Fig. 7). RORα1 accumulation at the promoter was observed accompanied by an equivalent increase of RNA polymerase II (fourth and sixth lanes), whereas in the absence of transfected RORα1, no amplification of DNA fragment was observed (fifth lane). On the other hand, no enrichment of DNA fragments was observed when the immunoprecipitations were carried out using mouse IgG (third lane). These results indicate that RORα1 binds to the aromatase PI.4 and a substantial increase in RNA polymerase II as well. These findings indicate that aromatase exon I.4 induction mediated by the RORα1 by binding to the aromatase PI.4 likely precedes changes in mRNA output. To investigate the relationship between the expression of RORα and aromatase, 20 breast cancer samples from female breast cancer patients were examined (Fig. 8). We carried out the quantitative real time RT-PCR studies. There is a correlation between RORα and aromatase mRNA expression levels (correlation coefficient: r = 0.512, p = 0.019). In the present study, we have shown the augmentation of aromatase activity in breast cancer cells by RORα, which results in cell proliferation. Then we confirmed further that RORα directly activates the transcription. We have identified a novel RORE in the promoter region of aromatase exon I.4, using the combination of site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro protein-DNA binding assays. We also confirmed the binding using ChIP assay. Finally, we showed that there is a correlation between RORα and aromatase expression in human breast cancer tissues. Initially, we found a possible correlation of expression pattern between aromatase and RORα mRNA in four breast cancer-derived cell lines (Fig. 2). MCF7 and BT20 cells expressed higher levels of both aromatase and RORα mRNA than the other two cells. These results have made us hypothesize a possible interaction between aromatase activity and RORα. Because RORα belongs to a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, a ligand-dependent transcription factor, it was likely that RORα regulates the transcription of the aromatase gene. The cytochrome P-450 enzyme activities including that of aromatase are induced largely by transcriptional activation (43Plant N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which is also confirmed in the present study (Fig. 2, E and F). To test the hypothesis that RORα is involved in the progression of breast cancer by activating aromatase activity, we further conducted a series of experiments. We then confirmed that the aromatase mRNA and protein levels were augmented by RORα1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Aromatase activities were also augmented with the increase in the dose of RORα1 in two ER-positive cell lines (Fig. 3, C and D). The proliferation of breast cancer cells that were transfected with RORα was greater than those without transfection (Fig. 3, E and F). Such cell proliferation was observed only in the presence of androstenedione, which is a major substrate of aromatase and is converted to estrone. These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis that RORα activates aromatase activity to increase the local concentration of estrogen to activate proliferation. Next, we investigated the mechanism of the augmentation of aromatase transcription by RORα. We sought the promoter responsible for the augmentation and identified that the exon I.4 mRNA level is increased by RORα (Fig. 4C). Because the expression of GR was not affected by ROR, the possibility that RORα induces GR, which then activates aromatase, is excluded (Fig. 4E). We also confirmed that the exon I.4 mRNA expression level was decreased markedly by suppressing RORα expression using siRNA (Fig. 4F). Thus, we hypothesized that RORα may act at PI.4 to regulate transcription. The deletion of the upstream region of PI.4 revealed that the region responsible for the RORα-mediated transcriptional regulation is located in −147/−106 bp from the transcriptional start site (Fig. 5). Data search of this region revealed a presumed RORE at −119/−107 bp. Mutation of this region abolished the effect of RORα in transient transfection-based reporter gene assay (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that RORα1 binds to the fragment containing −119/−107 bp, but not to the mutated RORE (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that −119/−107 bp is a novel RORE. Finally, we confirmed the binding of RORα1 to the intrinsic chromatin that contains the aromatase PI.4 using ChIP assay in MCF7 cells (Fig. 7). Thus, we concluded that RORα directly activated the aromatase expression through a novel RORE in promoter I.4. To confirm the relationship of RORα to aromatase expression in vivo, we carried out the quantitative real time RT-PCR studies using 20 surgically obtained samples from female breast cancer patients (Fig. 8). As stated above, there was a correlation between RORα and aromatase mRNA levels in clinical samples, which is also consistent with the hypothesis that RORα may regulate aromatase in breast cancer cells. The biology of breast cancer is very complex, but there is no doubt that estrogen plays a central role (44Keen J.C. Davidson N.E. Cancer. 2003; 97: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). About 70% of breast cancers are ERα-positive upon initial diagnosis, and in the majority of those cancers, the ERα status serves as a valuable predictive marker for probable response to anti-estrogen therapy (44Keen J.C. Davidson N.E. Cancer. 2003; 97: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 45Shao W. Brown M. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On the other hand, to date, the expression of RORα in breast cancer cells has not been considered as a critical factor for prognosis. However, as shown in the present study, RORα can stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Thus, during the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, in addition to the examination of ER and progesterone receptor, histochemical or quantitative examination of RORα could be useful to clarify the nature of breast cancers particularly in post-menopausal women. Trials to examine RORα expression in surgically removed breast tumor tissues are currently underway. In conclusion, we have shown that RORα activates the aromatase I.4 promoter through a novel RORE. Thus, RORα may be useful for the diagnostic classification or prognosis prediction of breast cancers. We thank Dr. Y. Kominato for technical support and Drs. A. N. Hollenberg and M. Watanabe for kindly providing the constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2037353591,"The hepatitis B-X (HBx) protein is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. It is implicated not to directly cause cancer but to play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma as a co-factor. The oncogenic potential of HBx primarily lies in its interaction with transcriptional regulators resulting in aberrant gene expression and deregulated cellular pathways. Utilizing ultraviolet irradiation to simulate a tumor-initiating event, we integrated chip-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) with expression microarray profiling and identified 184 gene targets directly deregulated by HBx. One-hundred forty-four transcription factors interacting with HBx were computationally inferred. We experimentally validated that HBx interacts with some of the predicted transcription factors (pTF) as well as the promoters of the deregulated target genes of these pTFs. Significantly, we demonstrated that the pTF interacts with the promoters of the deregulated HBx target genes and that deregulation by HBx of these HBx target genes carrying the pTF consensus sequences can be reversed using pTF small interfering RNAs. The roles of these deregulated direct HBx target genes and their relevance in cancer was inferred via querying against biogroup/cancer-related microarray databases using web-based NextBio(TM) software. Six pathways, including the Jak-STAT pathway, were predicted to be significantly deregulated when HBx binds indirectly to direct target gene promoters. In conclusion, this study represents the first ever demonstration of the utilization of ChIP-chip to identify deregulated direct gene targets from indirect protein-DNA binding as well as transcriptional factors directly interacting with HBx. Increased knowledge of the gene/transcriptional factor targets of HBx will enhance our understanding of the role of HBx in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and facilitate the design of better strategies in combating hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2078958177,"The MgtC is a virulence factor in Salmonella Typhimurium that is required for growth at low-Mg2+ concentrations and intramacrophage survival. This gene is codified in a conserved region of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 3 (SPI-3), and is also present in the chromosome of other Salmonella serovars. In this study we characterized the MgtC factor in S. Typhi, a human specific pathogen, by using mgtC and SPI-3 mutant strains. We found that MgtC is the most important factor codified in the SPI-3 of S. Typhi for growth in low-Mg2+ media and survival within human cells. In addition, by using reporter genes we determined that the low-Mg2+ concentration, acidic media and PhoP regulator induce mgtC expression in S. Typhi. We suggest that MgtC is the most important virulence factor codified in the SPI-3 of S. Typhi."
https://openalex.org/W1980167367,"Background Lethal mutagenesis, or virus extinction promoted by mutagen-induced elevation of mutation rates of viruses, may meet with the problem of selection of mutagen-resistant variants, as extensively documented for standard, non-mutagenic antiviral inhibitors. Previously, we characterized a mutant of foot-and-mouth disease virus that included in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase replacement M296I that decreased the sensitivity of the virus to the mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin. Methodology and Principal Findings Replacement M296I in the viral polymerase impedes the extinction of the mutant foot-and-mouth disease virus by elevated concentrations of ribavirin. In contrast, wild type virus was extinguished by the same ribavirin treatment and, interestingly, no mutants resistant to ribavirin were selected from the wild type populations. Decreases of infectivity and viral load of the ribavirin-resistant M296I mutant were attained with a combination of the mutagen 5-fluorouracil and the non-mutagenic inhibitor guanidine hydrocloride. However, extinction was achieved with a sequential treatment, first with ribavirin, and then with a minimal dose of 5-fluorouracil in combination with guanidine hydrochloride. Both, wild type and ribavirin-resistant mutant M296I exhibited equal sensitivity to this combination, indicating that replacement M296I in the polymerase did not confer a significant cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil. We discuss these results in relation to antiviral designs based on lethal mutagenesis. Conclusions (i) When dominant in the population, a mutation that confers partial resistance to a mutagenic agent can jeopardize virus extinction by elevated doses of the same mutagen. (ii) A wild type virus, subjected to identical high mutagenic treatment, need not select a mutagen-resistant variant, and the population can be extinguished. (iii) Extinction of the mutagen-resistant variant can be achieved by a sequential treatment of a high dose of the same mutagen, followed by a combination of another mutagen with an antiviral inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1991515548,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain composed of 13 subunits; three are mitochondria-encoded, and 10 are nucleus-inscribed on nine different chromosomes within the mammalian genome. The transcriptional regulation of such a multisubunit, multichromosomal, and bigenomic enzyme is mechanistically challenging. Transcription factories have been proposed as one mechanism by which genes from different genomic loci congregate to transcribe functionally related genes, and chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a means by which such interactions can be revealed. Thus far, however, only loci from the same chromosome or at most two chromosomes have been co-localized by 3C. The present study used 3C to test our hypothesis that not only the 10 genomic loci from nine chromosomes encoding the 10 nuclear subunits of COX, but also genes from three chromosomes encoding mitochondrial transcription factors A and B (Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m) critical for the transcription of the three mitochondria-encoded COX subunit genes all occupy common intranuclear sites in the murine neuronal nuclei. The pairing of various COX subunit genes and Tf genes indicates that interactions are present among all of them. On the other hand, genes for a non-mitochondrial protein (calreticulin) as well as a mitochondrial enzyme (citrate synthase) did not interact with COX genes. Furthermore, interactions between COX subunit and Tf genes were up-regulated by depolarizing stimulation and down-regulated by impulse blockade in primary neurons.

Brain Res. 2007; 1175: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of these 13 COX subunits has been credited to a small set of transcription factors and coactivators (21.Wong-Riley M.T. Liang H.L. Ongwijitwat S. Dudek S.M. Understanding Transcriptional Regulation by Neuronal Activity: To the Nucleus and Back. Springer Science, New York2008: 209-228Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains unknown if all 10 nuclear subunits and mitochondrial transcription factors from different chromosomes are transcribed simultaneously within the nucleus. Such a synchronous process would enhance the efficiency of coordination as well as ensure that the 1:1 stoichiometry of the 13 subunits in the holoenzyme is maintained. cytochrome c oxidase chromosome conformation capture tetrodotoxin. Transcription of nuclear genes is known to occur in discrete sites within the nucleus. Known as transcription factories, these sites of active transcription are thought to contain several RNA polymerase II molecules surrounded by transcription factors and loops of specific chromatin encoding actively expressing genes (23.Jackson D.A. Iborra F.J. Manders E.M. Cook P.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24.Osborne C.S. Chakalova L. Brown K.E. Carter D. Horton A. Debrand E. Goyenechea B.

Biol. 2006; 26: 5096-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loci on one or two different chromosomes seem to co-localize to the same transcription factory (26.Ling J.Q. Li T.

Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Such long range interactions among the genes can be studied using chromosome conformation capture (3C), a recently developed technique that can convert chromatin conformation and physical interactions in vivo into a specific ligation product demonstrable with PCR (29.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar, 30.Miele A. Dekker J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 464: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, only loci from the same chromosome or at most two chromosomes have thus far been co-localized by 3C. The present study employed 3C to test our hypothesis that all 10 nuclear subunits of COX encoded on nine different chromosomes as well as Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m genes, located on three chromosomes and vital for the transcription of the three mitochondria-encoded COX subunit genes, all reside in the same intranuclear locale in neuronal nuclei. Pairing of various COX subunit genes and mitochondrial transcription factor genes indicates physical interactions among all of them. Thus, our results are consistent with a viable mechanism by which multiple subunit-coding genes from different chromosomes as well as transcription factor genes are simultaneously recruited to a common transcription factory for the coordinated expression of a multisubunit, multichromosomal bigenomic enzyme in neurons. Genomic sequence of the 10 murine nucleus-encoded COX subunit genes, including chromosomal positions and surrounding non-coding sequences, were obtained from the mouse genome data base (3.Eppig J.T. Blake J.A. Bult C.J. Kadin J.A. Richardson J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D630-D637Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Each COX subunit gene was independently verified by comparing coding sequence with known COX cDNA sequence and confirming the presence of intron-exon structure. DNA sequence corresponding to each COX gene and its surrounding 10,000-bp region was analyzed for the presence of BglII restriction sites. Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells (ATCC, Manassaa, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged every 2–3 days and harvested at 80–90% confluence for 3C experiments. All experiments were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines (43.National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1996Google Scholar) and Medical College of Wisconsin regulations. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering. Primary visual cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (9.Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene. 2005; 360: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were anesthetized with CO2 and killed by decapitation. The brains were removed and cleansed of meninges and surface blood vessels, and the cortices were dissected, trypsinized, and triturated to dissociate individual neurons. Cells were plated onto a poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated 100-mm dish at a density of ∼5 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) for 3 h. The medium was changed to neurobasal/B27 supplement (Invitrogen), and cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was added on the second day of plating neurons to inhibit the replication of non-neuronal cells. Neuronal cultures were maintained by replacing half of the medium every 5 days. Cells were cultured for 7–15 days before exposure to 20 mm KCl for 5 h. TTX (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.4 μm was added to the culture medium from the 12th day after plating. Cultures were exposed to TTX for 3 days. All cells were harvested on the same day for each experiment, and 3C samples were prepared for each group. Control cultures were neither depolarized with KCl nor inactivated by TTX. Real time quantitative PCRs were carried out in a Cepheid Smart Cycler detection system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). SyBr Green (Biowhittaker Molecular Application, Rockland, ME) and EX Taq real time quantitative PCR hot start polymerase (Takara Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) were used following the manufacturer's protocols and as described previously (11.Dhar S.S. Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3120-3129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 3C experiments were performed as described previously (31.Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, N2a cells and primary neurons were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in fresh culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To cross-link chromatin, 1 × 107 N2a cells or 5 × 106 primary neurons in 10 ml of cell culture medium were treated with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by quenching with 0.125 m glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Nuclei were isolated by incubating cells in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) on ice with agitation for 30 min. Chromatin was subsequently released by treating isolated nuclei with 0.3% SDS and digested with 400 units of BglII (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) overnight. Afterward, restriction enzyme was heat-inactivated, and chromatin was diluted in T4 ligation buffer to achieve a low genomic DNA concentration of 2.5 ng/μl to facilitate intermolecular religation. Chromatin religation was performed by incubating diluted chromatin with 100 Weiss units of T4 ligase (Fermentas) for 4 h at 16 °C. Following RNase A (Roche Applied Science) digestion to remove RNA contaminant, the 3C chromatin was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. To generate individual PCR template controls for comparison with 3C product, all 10 COX subunit genes were paired, as were the pairing of other genes or gene loci, as shown in the control lanes (left columns) of FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3. For example, to generate the control template for COX4i1/COX5a, we used PCR to amplify the regions spanning a single BglII site of interest with 100–150 bp on either side for each subunit gene. Approximately 30 μg of each PCR product were digested with 300 units of BglII overnight at 37 °C. DNA was extracted using phenol chloroform and ethanol precipitation. Equimolar amounts of digested product (COX4i1 and COX5a) were ligated at a high concentration (∼10 ng/μl for each product) to ensure formation of intermolecular cross-linked product. One primer of a given restriction fragment (COX4i1) was combined with a primer of a second (COX5a) in all pairwise combinations of ligated orientations (e.g. forward primer of COX4i1 with forward primer of COX5a, reverse primer of COX4i1 with forward primer of COX5a, etc.). For all other pairing of COX genes, the same steps were used to generate a large number of pairings among subunits and were used as control templates for comparison with 3C samples. The final chosen control template for each pairing had the same orientation as the 3C-generated product. By comparing the signals obtained by quantitative PCR for the 3C cross-linked templates versus the control templates, we corrected for the differences in amplification efficiency between primer sets and also for differences in signal intensities due to the size of the PCR products (since all of the primers were designed to give PCR products of 150–300 bp) (supplemental Table 1). All primers were designed to have an annealing temperature of 58–60 °C, and they all yielded a product when used with the positive control templates. These control templates and 3C samples for each primer pair were performed during the same PCR run. A positive 3C control targeted an “internal” cross-linking product between two BglII sites located 1.6 kb apart within the coding region of the CalR (calreticulin) gene (+2.8 and +4.4 kb relative to the CalR transcriptional start point) (31.Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Five sets of 3C negative controls were employed: (a) possible cross-linking between the CalR 4.4-kb BglII site and another BglII site on COX6a1; (b) possible cross-linking between the BglII site of Cs (citrate synthase) and those of COX4i1, COX6a1, and COX8a, respectively; (c) no cross-linking agent (formaldehyde); (d) no ligase; and (e) possible cross-linking for regions far beyond the BglII sites for COX4i1 and COX8a (Fig. 1, A and B). The PCR conditions used were very stringent in order to detect only specific signals. PCR cycles used were as follows: initial denaturing step for 2 min at 94 °C followed by 36 repeats of a cycle with 30 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 59 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C, followed by a final step of 1 min at 72 °C. Thirty-six PCR cycles were sufficient to detect the specific PCR fragments generated after digestion and ligation that captured the rare molecular phenomenon occurring in the nucleus. Cross-linking among COX subunit gene loci in 3C samples was detected using semiquantitative PCR. Specifically, a pair of primers targeting two different COX subunit genes was used to amplify cross-linked DNA generated from 3C reactions. Each primer targeted a DNA region 100–150 bp from the BglII site and generated 200–300-bp amplicons. Primers were designed for all 10 nucleus-encoded COX genes, as shown in supplemental Table 1. The linear range of amplification was determined for 3C samples by serial dilution, as described previously (28.Lomvardas S. Barnea G. Pisapia D.J. Mendelsohn M. Kirkland J. Axel R. Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 30.Miele A. Dekker J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 464: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An appropriate amount (150 μg) of 3C DNA within the linear range was added to each PCR. PCR product was run on 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. A large number of possible interactive pairs among 10 COX subunits (4i1, 5a, 5b, 6a1, 6b, 6c, 7a2, 7b, 7c, and 8a) were tested by PCRs targeting their possible cross-linked products (Table 2). All PCRs were performed in triplicates. Chromosomal distributions of 10 nucleus-encoded COX subunit genes and mitochondrial transcription factors (Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m) in the mouse genome are summarized in Table 1. The ubiquitously expressed COX subunit genes (4i1, 5a, 5b, 6a1, 6b, 6c, 7a2, 7b, 7c, and 8a) are dispersed throughout the mouse genome on different chromosomes (chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 19, and X), with the exception of COX5a and COX7a2, both of which are on chromosome 9 but are 22.23 Mb apart and do not form a gene cluster. COX5a is located on the 9 B locus, whereas COX7a2 is on the 9 E1 locus. All COX heart/skeletal muscle-specific isoforms (COX6a2, -7a1, and -8b) are located on chromosome 7. The COX6b testes isoform is also on chromosome 7. COX4i2, the lung isoform of COX4, is on chromosome 2. The present study focused only on the ubiquitous isoforms present in neurons.TABLE 1Chromosomal location of murine nucleus-encoded COX subunit genes arranged by chromosomal numberChromosomeUbiquitous isoformsTissue-specific isoforms1COX5b, Tfb2m2COX4i2 (lung)5COX6a17COX8b (heart/muscle)7COX6a2 (heart/muscle)7COX6b17COX6b2 (testes)7COX7a1 (heart/muscle)8COX4i19COX5a9COX7a210Tfam13COX7c15COX6c17Tfb1m19COX8aXCOX7b Open table in a new tab To make certain our ability to identify interactions between two non-contiguous DNA regions, a positive control PCR was achieved using primers targeting an “internal” cross-linkable product between two BglII sites located 1.6 kb apart within the coding region of the CalR gene (Fig. 1A). CalR and COX6a1 are unrelated genes and would co-localize only at a background frequency. As Fig. 1A illustrates, the internal cross-linking within the CalR gene was detected by PCR of our 3C samples. In contrast, any chance cross-linking event between CalR and COX6a1 was not detected by our PCRs. PCRs were also performed to target for possible cross-linking product between the BglII site of another mitochondrial enzyme, Cs, and those of COX4i1, COX6a1, or COX8a, respectively. Again, no background cross-linking between citrate synthase and all three COX subunits was detectable in our PCR product (Fig. 1A). In the absence of a cross-linking agent (formaldehyde) or T4 ligase, PCR products were not detected among CalR, COX4i1, COX8a, and Tfam genes (Fig. 1B). Moreover, primers designed for regions beyond BglII sites for COX4i1 and COX8a did not yield any cross-linking interactions (Fig. 1B). A large number of possible interactive pairs among the 10 COX subunits were tested by PCR. Initially, COX4i1 and COX8a were individually documented to form a cross-linking pair with each of the remaining nine subunits of COX genes (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Each of the remaining eight COX subunit genes was then tested for, and their interactions were confirmed with a few other COX subunit genes (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Thus, all possible interactions that were tested were consistently detectable by 3C in our PCR product.TABLE 23C interactions among all 10 nucleus-encoded COX subunit genesGeneCOX4i1COX5aCOX5bCOX6a1COX6bCOX6cCOX7a2COX7bCOX7cCOX8aCOX4i1+++++++++COX5a+++++COX5b+++++COX6a1++++COX6b+++++COX6c++++++COX7a2++++++COX7b++++++COX7c++++++COX8a+++++++++ Open table in a new tab Possible interactions between mitochondrial transcription factors A and B (Tfam, Tfb1m, and Tfb2m) derived from three different chromosomes and COX subunit genes were tested using PCR primers for Tfam, Tfb1m, Tfb2m, COX4i1, COX6a1, and COX8a (supplemental Table 1). β-Actin (Actb) served as a negative control, and PCR was performed, targeting possible cross-linking product between β-actin BglII site and COX4i1, COX6a1, and COX8a BglII sites, respectively. Any chance background cross-linking between β-actin and all three COX subunits was not detectable in our PCR product (Fig. 3). On the other hand, cross-linked products between the three nucleus-encoded COX subunit genes and mitochondrial transcription factors were consistently detected in our 3C-reacted PCR samples (Fig. 3). To determine the effect of functional perturbations on COX gene interactions, primary neurons were subjected to depolarizing stimulation with 20 mm KCl for 5 h or impulse blockade with TTX for 3 days. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, KCl treatment induced a 219–259% increase (p < 0.05), whereas TTX resulted in a 55–65% decrease (p < 0.001) in the interactions between COX4i1 and Tfam or COX4i1 and COX8a, as monitored by real time quantitative PCR. KCl and TTX experiments were also performed on N2a cells, and comparable results were obtained (data not shown). The present study documents for the first time that a multisubunit, multichromosomal bigenomic enzyme can be precisely regulated at the transcriptional level by having all relevant nucleus-encoded subunit genes and mitochondrial transcription factors be simultaneously located at the same nuclear site, enabling them to be transcribed concurrently in the same presumed transcription factory in mammalian neurons (Fig. 5). Chromosome conformation capture was devised to capitalize on the assumption that genes that are actively co-expressed are physically localized in a “transcription factory” that contains copies of active RNA polymerases, transcription factors, and associated chromatin undergoing transcription (32.Xu M. Cook P.R. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Physical interactions between chromatin within such a factory can be immobilized, extracted, digested with a restriction enzyme for common restriction sites, religated at very low DNA concentrations, reverse cross-linked, and subjected to PCR to yield a hybrid product encompassing nucleotides from the two interacting chromatin or genomic loci. As shown in the present study, such interactions are not random but are highly specific. Genes that do not share common functions did not interact, and even if their gene products target the same organelle (such as citrate synthase and COX), there was no evidence that their chromatin interacted either (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The original 3C method was applied to the analysis of chromosomal conformation in yeast (29.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar), but the approach was found useful to reveal folding of complex gene loci and active chromatin hub in mammalian cells as well (23.Jackson D.A. Iborra F.J. Manders E.M. Cook P.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24.Osborne C.S. Chakalova L. Brown K.E. Carter D. Horton A. Debrand E. Goyenechea B.

Biol. 2006; 26: 5096-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus far, however, 3C has uncovered interactions only between genomic loci of the same chromosome or at most of two different chromosomes (26.Ling J.Q. Li T. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Chen H.L. Qiu X.W. Cherry A.M. Hoffman A.R. Science. 2006; 312: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 27.Spilianakis C.G. Lalioti M.D. Town T. Lee G.R. Flavell R.A.

Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), and no report has dealt with a multisubunit protein involving 11 chromosomes or 13 genomic loci, let alone a bigenomic enzyme. What are the advantages of such precise transcriptional regulation of all 13 subunits from the two genomes for COX? First and foremost, COX is a vital enzyme, without which oxidative metabolism cannot be carried to completion and mitochondrial ATP cannot be generated (33.Wong-Riley M.T. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 94-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 34.Wikström M. Krab K. Saraste M. Cytochrome Oxidase: A Synthesis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar). Dysfunction of this enzyme jeopardizes health, and absence of this enzyme is incompatible with life (35.Péquignot M.O. Dey R. Zeviani M. Tiranti V. Godinot C. Poyau A. Sue C. Di Mauro S. Abitbol M. Marsac C. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36.Servidei S. Zeviani M. Manfredi G. Ricci E. Silvestri G. Bertini E. Gellera C. Di Mauro S. Di Donato S. Tonali P. Neurology. 1991; 41: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COX is a housekeeping enzyme present in almost every eukaryotic cell (with a few exceptions, such as mature, short lived red blood cells lacking in both nuclei and mitochondria). In highly oxidative organs, such as the heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscles, and especially the brain, COX is a workhorse that is constitutively active and is exquisitely regulated by the functional demands of the organ, such as the brain (33.Wong-Riley M.T. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 94-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 34.Wikström M. Krab K. Saraste M. Cytochrome Oxidase: A Synthesis.

Plenum Press, New York1998: 1-53Google Scholar). Functional COX holoenzyme is composed of the 13 subunits in a 1:1 stoichiometry (1.Kadenbach B. Jarausch J. Hartmann R. Merle P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 38.Kadenbach B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), hence the need to coordinate the transcription of all subunits. In neurons, all 13 subunit mRNAs of COX have been found to be coordinately up-regulated by depolarizing activity in vitro. With reduced or blockage of neuronal activity in vivo or in vitro, all 13 subunit transcripts were significantly down-regulated (4.Liang H.L. Ongwijitwat S. Wong-Riley M.T. Neuroscience. 2006; 140: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39.Hevner R.F. Wong-Riley M.T.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1805-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study extends these findings with the 3C approach and documents that the occurrence of COX subunit genes in the same transcription factory is up-regulated by KCl stimulation and down-regulated by TTX. To coordinate the transcriptional regulation of all 13 subunits from the two genomes, transcription factor candidates are needed. Both nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2) proved to be viable candidates, since they each regulate the expressions of mitochondrial transcription factors A, B1, and B2 (15.Escrivá H. Rodríguez-Peña A. Vallejo C.G. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16.Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Wong-Riley M.T.T. Gene. 2005; 360: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10.Ongwijitwat S. Liang H.L. Graboyes E.M. Wong-Riley M.T.T.

An important coactivator of NRF-1 and NRF-2, known as PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α) (19.Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of COX in neurons (5.Liang H.L. Wong-Riley M.T. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22.Meng H. Liang H.L. Wong-Riley M. Brain Res. 2007; 1175: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, a transcription factory for COX gene expression is likely to include all of these factors, in addition to the necessary RNA polymerase II. Such a factory is expected to be in an active state most of the time for functionally active neurons. However, the relevant chromatin loops are likely to be migrating dynamically into and out of transcription factories throughout a 24-h period in response to the functional demands of the cells. As the present study documents, depolarizing stimulation or impulse blockade readily adjusts the frequency of such occurrence in the same transcription factory. With our recent findings that NRF-1 co-regulates COX and subunits of glutamatergic NMDA and AMPA receptors (41.Dhar S.S. Wong-Riley M.T.T. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42.Dhar S.S. Liang H.L. Wong-Riley M.T. J.

https://openalex.org/W2012418268,"The light-activated enzyme NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the trans addition of hydrogen across the C-17-C-18 double bond of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a key step in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Similar to other members of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family of enzymes, POR contains a conserved Tyr and Lys residue in the enzyme active site, which are implicated in a proposed reaction mechanism involving proton transfer from the Tyr hydoxyl group to Pchlide. We have analyzed a number of POR variant enzymes altered in these conserved residues using a combination of steady-state turnover, laser photoexcitation studies, and low temperature fluorescence spectroscopy. None of the mutations completely abolished catalytic activity. We demonstrate their importance to catalysis by defining multiple roles in the overall reaction pathway. Mutation of either residue impairs formation of the ground state ternary enzyme-substrate complex, pointing to a key role in substrate binding. By analyzing the most active variant (Y193F), we show that Tyr-193 participates in proton transfer to Pchlide and stabilizes the Pchlide excited state, enabling hydride transfer from NADPH to Pchilde. Thus, in addition to confirming the probable identity of the proton donor in Pchlide reduction, our work defines additional roles for these residues in facilitating hydride transfer through stabilization of the ground and excited states of the ternary enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W2031205775,"Skeletal myogenesis is potently regulated by the extracellular milieu of growth factors and cytokines. We observed that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation. The normal up-regulation of myogenic marker genes, myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), and myocyte enhancer factor 2s (MEF2s) were inhibited by CT-1 treatment. CT-1 also represses myogenin (MyoG) promoter activation. CT-1 activated two signaling pathways: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), a component of the extracellular signal-regulated MAPK (ERK) pathway. In view of the known connection between CT-1 and STAT3 activation, we surprisingly found that pharmacological blockade of STAT3 activity had no effect on the inhibition of myogenesis by CT-1 suggesting that STAT3 signaling is dispensable for myogenic repression. Conversely, MEK inhibition potently reversed the inhibition of myotube formation and attenuated the repression of MRF transcriptional activity mediated by CT-1. Taken together, these data indicate that CT-1 represses skeletal myogenesis through interference with MRF activity by activation of MEK/ERK signaling. In agreement with these in vitro observations, exogenous systemic expression of CT-1 mediated by adenoviral vector delivery increased the number of myonuclei in normal post-natal mouse skeletal muscle and also delayed skeletal muscle regeneration induced by cardiotoxin injection. The expression pattern of CT-1 in embryonic and post-natal skeletal muscle and in vivo effects of CT-1 on myogenesis implicate CT-1 in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in muscle progenitor cells.

The expression pattern of CT-1 in embryonic and post-natal skeletal muscle and in vivo effects of CT-1 on myogenesis implicate CT-1 in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in muscle progenitor cells. Terminal differentiation of skeletal myogenic cells, termed myogenesis, consists of a series of well characterized highly regulated steps that has become a paradigm for lineage acquisition and cellular differentiation. Initially, pluripotent mesodermal stem cells commit to become myogenic precursor cells. Commitment to the myogenic lineage then results in the binary state of either maintenance of proliferative potential and pluripotency, or, on appropriate cues, withdrawal from the cell cycle, activation of a battery of structural, contractile, and metabolic genes constituting the differentiation program and ultimately formation of multinucleated myotubes (1.Perry R.L. Rudnick M.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D750-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The field of myogenesis has benefited from the use of well established in vitro cell-culture systems, which faithfully recapitulate the in vivo differentiation program. During myogenesis, a group of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, myogenic differentiation-1 (MyoD), 2The abbreviations used are: MyoDmyogenic differentiation-1Myf5myogenic factor-5MyoGmyogeninMRFmyogenic regulatory factorMyHCmyosin heavy chainMEF2myocyte enhancer factor 2EGFepidermal growth factorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseCT-1cardiotrophin-1LIFleukemia inhibitory factorIL-6interleukin-6Gp130glycoprotein-130LIFRβleukemia inhibitory factor receptor-βJAKJanus kinaseSTAT3signal transducer and activator of transcription 3CMVcytomegalovirusGMgrowth mediumDMdifferentiation mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineCTRLLacZ-containing adenovirusSPRR1Asmall proline-rich repeat protein-1AP62-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-9-fluoro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz[h]-imidaz[4,5-f]isoquinolin-7-one, Pyridone 6TAtibialis anterior. myogenic factor-5 (Myf5), myogenin (MyoG), and myogenic regulatory factor-4, collectively termed the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), play essential roles in differentiation (2.Kassar-Duchossoy L.

Most promoter-enhancer regions of muscle-specific genes contain the cognate binding site, E-box (CANNTG), for the MRFs, and the E-box is often essential for the induction of these genes during differentiation (5.Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6.Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, early and late muscle-specific genes, MyoG, and muscle-specific myosin heavy chain (MyHC), respectively, are transcriptionally regulated by MyoD and other MRFs through E-boxes in their proximal promoter regions (4.Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R.

The molecular and genetic requirement for the MRFs during myogenesis has been confirmed in many studies both in vitro and in vivo (2.Kassar-Duchossoy L. Gayraud-Morel B. Gomès D. Rocancourt D.

The MRFs also cooperate with another class of myogenic transcription factors, comprising the myocyte enhancer factor two family (MEF2) (10.Naya F.J. Olson E.

As well as the detailed knowledge of core transcriptional regulatory circuits mediated by myogenic transcription factors and their accessory factors, much work has contributed to the identification of a number of growth factor and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways that positively and negatively impact myogenesis (16.Ridgeway A.G.

In some cases, these pathways regulate the decision to differentiate or not, a critical regulatory point, because differentiation in muscle is terminal and absolutely required for viability of all metazoan life. Moreover, negative regulation of differentiation is equally important, because it underpins the maintenance of the proliferative state and pluripotency. A number of growth factors and cytokines, such as insulin-like growth factors, insulin, transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, that influence myogenesis has been identified (17.Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 18.Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J.

Boxhorn L.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), however, a detailed understanding of their corresponding signal transduction pathways and transcriptional network targets is still rudimentary. One group of cellular signaling cascades that are known to affect myogenesis in a complex manner consists of the MAPK pathways. For example, p38 MAPK, a member of one of the MAPK pathways, directly phosphorylates and activates E47, which forms a productive dimer with MyoD (21.Lluís F. Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Muñoz-Cánoves P. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 22.Lluís F. Ballestar E. Suelves M. Esteller M. Muñoz-Cánoves P.

Conversely the ERK-MAPK cascade plays a bi-phasic role in myogenic cells, being inhibitory in the initial phases of the differentiation program while being required for later stage events, such as cell fusion (28.Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). CT-1 is a member of the IL-6 family, which is composed of IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oncostatin M. These cytokines are structurally related and form a variety of oligomeric ligand-receptor complexes. IL-6 and IL-11 form a complex with a homodimer of the glycoprotein-130 (Gp130) receptor or heterodimers of gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-β (LIFRβ). Gp130/LIFRβ also recognizes LIF, CT-1, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-like cytokine. Oncostatin M binds to the Gp130 and oncostatin M receptor. Upon formation of the requisite complex with the respective cytokine, the preponderant view is that the oligomeric receptor complex transduces its signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway (29.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). CT-1 was originally identified in conditioned medium from embryoid bodies (30.Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In developing embryos, CT-1 is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and dorsal root ganglia (31.Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development. 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adults, human CT-1 mRNA is detected in the heart, skeletal muscle, ovary, colon, prostate, and testis and in fetal kidney and lung (32.Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Shaw K.J. Kuang W.J. Gray C.L. Beatty B.G. Wood W.I. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The functions of CT-1 in the cardiovascular system have been extensively researched. Patients with ischemic and valvular heart disease have elevated levels of CT-1 in their sera (33.Freed D.H. Moon M.C. Borowiec A.M. Jones S.C. Zahradka P. Dixon I.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 254: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Further study of the role of CT-1 in the heart indicated that it has a cardioprotective role by reducing apoptosis (31.Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development. 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Brar B.K. Stephanou A. Pennica D. Latchman D.S. Cytokine. 2001; 16: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and may be involved in regeneration of cardiac muscle after infarction (35.Freed D.H. Cunnington R.H. Dangerfield A.L. Sutton J.S. Dixon I.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 782-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Exogenously administered CT-1 also induces cardiac hypertrophy in vitro (31.Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development. 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the modulation of cardiomyocyte phenotype by CT-1 has been well documented, the underlying signaling pathways are still unclear, and the role of CT-1 in skeletal muscle has not, thus far, been characterized. In this report, we demonstrate that CT-1 is a potent inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation. In C2C12 cells, CT-1 represses molecular markers of muscle differentiation and phenotypic myogenesis. Also, the transcriptional networks involved in the induction of key myogenic genes such as the MyoG and MCK genes are suppressed by CT-1 signaling. Surprisingly, small chemical inhibitors of MEK, PD98059 and U0126, reversed these repressive effects on skeletal myogenesis by CT-1, whereas inhibition of STAT3 activation was without effect. Collectively, these data show that CT-1 interferes with the transcriptional network required for muscle differentiation through the activation of the MEK-MAPK signaling module. Furthermore, in vivo, adenovirus-mediated expression of CT-1 increases satellite cell number and delays regeneration of damaged muscle by cardiotoxin injection. These observations indicate that CT-1 represses myogenesis and serves to maintain myogenic progenitors in their proliferative, multipotent state in vitro and in vivo. MRF expression plasmids were constructed in pEMSV as described elsewhere (36.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar).

The resultant 1152-bp fragment was inserted at the SacI/BglII sites of pGL4–10 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The dsRed2-N1 expression construct was purchased from Clontech Laboratories. The primary antibodies used in this study obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) were MyoD (C-20), Myf5 (C-20), actin (I-19), and ERK1 (C-16). MEF2D (610775) was from BD Biosciences. Stat3 (9132), phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705, 58E12, 9135), phospho-Stat3 (Ser-727, 6E4, 9136), MEK1/2 (9122), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221, 9121), and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204, E10, 9106) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Myogenin (F5D) and MyHC (MF20) were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. MyoD1 (clone 5.8A, M3512) was from DakoCytomation. Polyclonal antibody for MEF2A was prepared as described previously (23.Cox D.M. Du M. Marback M. Yang E.C. Chan J. Siu K.W. McDermott J.C. J. Biol.

C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CLR-1772) and cultured in growth medium (GM) consisting of 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Myotube formation was induced by replacing GM with differentiation medium (DM), which consisted of 2% horse serum (Atlanta Biologicals) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For CT-1 treatment, recombinant mouse CT-1 (R&D system, 438-CT) was resuspended with solvent (4 mm HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and supplemented into the media. For myotube formation assays, DM with CT-1 (10 ng/ml) was replenished every 2 days. Inhibitors (PD98059 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9900), U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9903), and P6 (2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-9-fluoro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz[h]-imidaz[4,5-f]isoquinolin-7-one, Pyridone 6, Calbiochem, 420097)) were resuspended with DMSO and added into the cell culture media for 30 min prior to adding CT-1. C2C12 cells were washed with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and fixed with 90% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. After fixation, the cells were incubated in 5% milk in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C for blocking. Cells were incubated at room temperature with MF-20 (primary antibody) diluted in blocking buffer (5% milk PBS) for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-mouse secondary antibody. The cells were again washed three times with PBS and incubated in developer (0.6 mg/ml DAB, 0.1% H2O2 in PBS) to detect MyHC by immunocytochemistry. The nuclei were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Images were recorded with a microscope (Axiovert 35; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) with either 4X NA 0.10 or 10X NA 0.25 Achrostigmat objective lenses with a digital camera (Canon, EOS D60). After 72 h in DM and in the presence of CT-1 (10 ng/ml) (or solvent), cells were incubated with 100 μm of bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with cold 1x PBS then fixed with 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with 1x PBS and incubated with 2N HCl for 1 h at 37 °C to denature the DNA. The cells were blocked in 10% goat serum (Sigma) diluted in 1x PBS for 2 h at room temperature with shaking and then incubated with bromodeoxyuridine primary antibody (G3G4: Developmental hybridoma bank, Iowa) diluted in 1.5% goat serum (Sigma) for 1.5 h at room temperature with shaking. Cells were washed with 1x PBS-T (0.5% Tween20) and incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to FITC (Sigma) diluted in 1.5% goat serum (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. Cells were washed with 1x PBS-T (0.5% Tween20). Fluorescence and phase contrast pictures were obtained using an epifluoresence microscope (Axiovert 35; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging), with appropriate phase and filter settings, and either 4X NA 0.10 or 10X NA 0.25 Achrostigmat objective lenses. Images were recorded with a digital camera (Canon, EOS D60). Total cellular protein extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P-8340)). Protein concentrations were determined by a standard Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE gels, followed by electrophoretic transfer to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) as directed by the manufacturer (Millipore). Blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibody in 5% milk in PBS or Tris buffered saline (TBS)-T (10 mm Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) or 5% Bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin) in TBS-T according to the manufacturer's protocol at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. After washing briefly, the blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in 5% milk in PBS or TBS-T at room temperature according to the manufacturer's protocols (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cell Signaling Technology). After washed three times with 1× PBS or 1× TBS (depending on the primary antibody) at room temperature, the blots were treated with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) to detect immunoreactive proteins. The blots were exposed to BioMax film (Kodak) for visual representation. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method with the indicated reporter gene and expression constructs and pCMV-β-galactosidase to monitor transfection efficiency. After transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and maintained in GM and then treated as indicated. Total cellular protein was extracted with luciferase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100). Luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity was quantified using a luminometer (Berthold Lumat, 9501) and standardized according to the β-galactosidase activity. Relative luciferase units normalized for the β-galactosidase activity (relative luciferase units) were determined and plotted as an average of triplicate determinations, and error bars represent the standard deviations of the triplicate values. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was generated from the isolated total RNA (1 μg) with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT16 primer (Sigma) by the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To amplify a target transcript, a pair of primers was designed that flanked an intron based on the mouse gene sequences. The target transcripts were amplified by Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with gene-specific primers. An amplified DNA was separated in an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide (Sigma) staining and UV exposure. Detailed information about the primers is in the supplemental material. An equal amount of total cellular protein (250 μg) was diluted with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibody and 25 μl of protein G-Plus Sepharose beads (50% slurry, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by incubation at 4 °C overnight on a rotating platform. The beads were washed with three changes of NETN wash buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. The CT-1 adenovirus was previously described (40.Bordet T. Schmalbruch H. Pettmann B. Hagege A. Castelnau-Ptakhine L. Kahn A. Haase G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length murine CT-1 cDNA was isolated by PCR and the CT-1 reading frame was fused with a 60-br pre-nerve growth factor leader sequence to promote secretion of the CT-1 protein. The CT-1 cDNA was cloned in-frame with the long terminal repeat of the Rous sarcoma virus (40.Bordet T. Schmalbruch H. Pettmann B. Hagege A. Castelnau-Ptakhine L. Kahn A. Haase G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A LacZ-containing adenovirus (CTRL) was used as a control for all injection experiments. This adenovirus was kindly provided by Dr. Robin Park at the Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada. To test CT-1 in vivo, B6C3F1 mice were subjected to systemic delivery of the CT-1 adenovirus. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with halothane. The injections were administered via intra-cardiac chamber delivery using a 29-gauge insulin needle (VWR) with 50 μl of Ad-CT-1 at a concentration of 3.0 × 108 plaque forming units/ml (n = 3). A control group of B6C3F1 mice were injected with 50 μl of Ad-CTRL at a similar concentration (n = 3). In a separate group of animals, cardiotoxin was used to induce muscle injury immediately prior to AdCT-1 and Ad-CTRL injection (n = 3 for each group). 25 μl of 10 μm cardiotoxin (Latoxan) was injected directly into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle using a 29G1/2 insulin syringe in halothane-anesthetized mice (41.Asakura A. Seale P. Girgis-Gabardo A. Rudnicki M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Post-recovery, mice were monitored closely for weight loss, dehydration, and cardiac distress. All injections were administered by a trained animal care technician according to the standards of the Animal Care Committee at the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada. At 7 days post-injection, skeletal muscle was excised and rinsed in cold 1× PBS. The muscle was fixed in 4% Pefabloc A in PBS for 2days then embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 10 μm, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize the nuclei and cytoplasm. Sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series ending in CitriSolv (Fisher Scientific). For immunohistology, sections were treated with antigen-unmasking solution (Vector Labs), blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody, then incubated in donkey-anti-goat CY3 antibody (Chemicon) and finally counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Five fields of view per section and five sections per TA muscle were analyzed. The micrographs presented are representative views. Side population (muscle progenitor cells) were collected as previously described (42.Hierlihy A.M. Seale P. Lobe C.G. Rudnicki M.A. Megeney L.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Contralateral TA muscle was collected from Ad-CT-1 and Ad-CTRL mice, and all visible connective tissue and blood vessels were removed by dissection. Muscle was digested in collagenase B (10 mg/ml, Roche Applied Science) plus dispase II (2 units/ml, Roche Applied Science) for and the resulting single ell suspensions were then stained with Hoechst dye 33342 (5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 90 min. As an SP control, the drug verapamil (50 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to an aliquot of cells simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33342. Cells were finally re-suspended in 500 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm Hepes. The cells were filtered through a 50 μm Cell Tric® (disposable filters made of monofil nylon material, Partec GmbH) and remained on ice until fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (42.Hierlihy A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2048582342,"Mounting evidence from clinical and basic research suggests that estrogen signaling may be altered in the brains of people with schizophrenia. Previously, we found that DNA sequence variation in the estrogen receptor (ER) alpha gene, lower ERalpha mRNA levels, and/or blunted ERalpha signaling is associated with schizophrenia. In this study, we asked whether the naturally occurring truncated ERalpha isoform, Delta7, which acts as a dominant negative, can attenuate gene expression induced by the wild-type (WT) receptor in an estrogen-dependent manner in neuronal (SHSY5Y) and non-neuronal (CHOK1 and HeLa) cells. In addition, we determined the extent to which ERalpha interacts with NRG1-ErbB4, a leading schizophrenia susceptibility pathway. Reductions in the transcriptionally active form of ErbB4 comprising the intracytoplasmic domain (ErbB4-ICD) have been found in schizophrenia, and we hypothesized that ERalpha and ErbB4 may converge to control gene expression. In the present study, we show that truncated Delta7-ERalpha attenuates WT-ERalpha-driven gene expression across a wide range of estrogen concentrations in cells that express functional ERalpha at base line or upon co-transfection of full-length ERalpha. Furthermore, we find that ErbB4-ICD can potentiate the transcriptional activity of WT-ERalpha at EREs in two cell lines and that this potentiation effect is abolished by the presence of Delta7-ERalpha. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed nuclear co-localization of WT-ERalpha, Delta7-ERalpha, and ErbB4-ICD, whereas immunoprecipitation assays showed direct interaction. Our findings demonstrate convergence between ERalpha and ErbB4-ICD in the transcriptional control of ERalpha-target gene expression and suggest that this may represent a convergent pathway that may be disrupted in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2087375627,"S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (AdoMet-MTs) constitute a large family of enzymes specifically transferring a methyl group to a range of biologically active molecules. Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces a set of paralogous AdoMet-MTs responsible for introducing key chemical modifications at defined positions of mycolic acids, which are essential and specific components of the mycobacterial cell envelope. We investigated the inhibition of these mycolic acid methyltransferases (MA-MTs) by structural analogs of the AdoMet cofactor. We found that S-adenosyl-N-decyl-aminoethyl, a molecule in which the amino acid moiety of AdoMet is substituted by a lipid chain, inhibited MA-MTs from Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis strains, both in vitro and in vivo, with IC50 values in the submicromolar range. By contrast, S-adenosylhomocysteine, the demethylated reaction product, and sinefungin, a general AdoMet-MT inhibitor, did not inhibit MA-MTs. The interaction between Hma (MmaA4), which is strictly required for the biosynthesis of oxygenated mycolic acids in M. tuberculosis, and the three cofactor analogs was investigated by x-ray crystallography. The high resolution crystal structures obtained illustrate the bisubstrate nature of S-adenosyl-N-decyl-aminoethyl and provide insight into its mode of action in the inhibition of MA-MTs.

This study has potential implications for the design of new drugs effective against multidrug-resistant and persistent tubercle bacilli. One-third of the world population is infected with the tubercle bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and tuberculosis kills one person every 20 s. The inhaled pathogenic bacilli are taken up by phagocytosis by pulmonary macrophages, which, together with lymphocytes and dendritic cells, form granulomas. The bacilli persist in the granuloma until their reactivation, dissemination into the lungs, and the triggering of disease. The natural resistance of persistent tubercle bacilli to drugs and the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains are two main concerns in the treatment of the disease. A survey carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization between 2000 and 2004 reported that 20% of 17,690 M. tuberculosis isolates from 49 countries were multidrug-resistant, and 2% were extensively drug-resistant (1.Center for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR Morb. Mortal Wkly Rep. 2006; 55: 301-305PubMed Google Scholar). The development of new drugs effective against persistent and drug-resistant bacilli has therefore become a priority. The thick lipid-rich envelope of the Mycobacterium genus is characterized by the presence of mycolic acids (MAs), 4The abbreviations used are: MAmycolic acidCFAScyclopropane fatty-acid synthaseCTABcetyltrimethylammonium bromideDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideMICminimum inhibitory concentrationMA-MTmycolic acid methyltransferaseSADAES-adenosyl-N-decyl-aminoethylAdoMetS-adenosyl-l-methionineAdoMet-MTS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferaseAdoHcyS-adenosyl-l-homocysteineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. very long chain (C60–C90) α-alkylated β-hydroxylated fatty acids (2.Marrakchi H. Bardou F. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Daffé M. Reyrat J.M. The Mycobacterial Cell Envelope. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2008: 41-62Google Scholar). MAs are the major components of the mycomembrane (3.Hoffmann C. Leis A. Niederweis M. Plitzko J.M. Engelhardt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 4.Zuber B. Chami M. Houssin C. Dubochet J. Griffiths G. Daffé M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5672-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) lipid bilayer, which plays a key role in both the architecture and permeability of the mycobacterial envelope. The MA biosynthetic pathway is essential for mycobacterial survival. MAs are generated by Claisen condensation between two fatty acyl chains as follows: the very long meromycoloyl chain (C40–C60) and a shorter saturated chain (C22–C26) (2.Marrakchi H. Bardou F. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Daffé M. Reyrat J.M. The Mycobacterial Cell Envelope. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2008: 41-62Google Scholar). The different types of MAs are defined by the presence of decorations introduced at proximal and distal positions of the meromycolic chain (Fig. 1A) by a family of paralogous S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (AdoMet-MTs), the mycolic acid methyltransferases (MA-MTs). These chemical modifications are known to be important for the pathogenicity, virulence, and persistence of M. tuberculosis. For example, the cis-cyclopropane introduced at the proximal position of α-MAs by PcaA has an impact on the persistence of the tubercle bacillus within infected organisms (5.Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the keto and methoxy groups, with a vicinal methyl ramification at the distal position of oxygenated MAs, play a role in M. tuberculosis virulence in the mouse model of infection (6.Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A. Smith I. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and have recently been reported to be involved in host-pathogen interplay. Indeed, oxygenated MAs have been shown to modulate IL-12p40 production by macrophages (7.Dao D.N. Sweeney K. Hsu T. Gurcha S.S. Nascimento I.P. Roshevsky D. Besra G.S. Chan J. Porcelli S.A.

Oxygenated MA biosynthesis requires the Hma (MmaA4) methyltransferase (Fig. 1B), as demonstrated by the absence of the oxygenated form in an M. tuberculosis hma knock-out mutant (6.Dubnau E. Chan J.

These results suggest that the enzymes responsible for adding the decorations to MAs, including oxygenated groups in particular, may be relevant pharmacological targets for the development of new antituberculous drugs (10.Barry 3rd, C.E.

Based on the essential role played by MA-MTs in the physiopathology of tuberculosis, several studies have investigated the possible inhibition of this family of enzymes. A recent study revealed that the antituberculous drug thiacetazone and its chemical analogs inhibited MA cyclopropanation at concentrations in the micromolar range (11.Alahari A. Trivelli X. Guérardel Y. Dover L.G. Besra G.S. Sacchettini J.C. Reynolds R.C. Coxon G.D. Kremer L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another study, based on mixtures of crude extracts of heat-inactivated mycobacteria and recombinant Escherichia coli overproducing MA-MTs, suggested that the incorporation of [3H]AdoMet into growing meromycolic chains is inhibited by a high concentration (1 mg/ml, i.e. 2.6 mm) of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) or sinefungin (12.Yuan Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21282-21290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the demethylated reaction product and a natural structural analog of AdoMet, respectively (Fig. 2). By contrast, AdoHcy and sinefungin are strong inhibitors of other AdoMet-MTs in vitro, including the cyclopropane fatty-acid synthase (CFAS) from E. coli (Ki of 30 and 0.22 μm, respectively) (13.Wang A.Y. Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11020-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14.Smith Jr., D.D. Norton S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 1458-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, they are active only against the isolated enzyme, whereas S-adenosyl-N-decyl-aminoethyl (SADAE), a molecule in which the amino acid moiety of AdoMet is substituted by a lipid chain (Fig. 2), is active against CFAS both in vitro (Ki,app = 6 μm) and in vivo (complete inhibition at 150 μm) (15.Guianvarc'h D. Guangqi E. Drujon T. Rey C. Wang Q. Ploux O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The broad screening of possible inhibitors of MA-MTs with an in vitro mini-assay poses a major challenge, as these enzymes most likely use very long meromycolic chains as substrates. In this context, the similarity between CFAS and Hma in terms of their sequences (31% sequence identity) and substrates may be useful, as it suggests that SADAE may inhibit MA-MTs (15.Guianvarc'h D. Guangqi E. Drujon T. Rey C. Wang Q. Ploux O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We report here our investigations of the interactions between Hma and SADAE, as compared with those between Hma and AdoHcy or sinefungin, and the potential impact of these interactions on the activities of Hma and other MA-MTs and mycobacterial growth. Our high resolution crystallographic characterization of the Hma-SADAE interaction illustrates the bisubstrate nature of the ligand, which is strongly correlated with its strong inhibitory properties. M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glycerol. Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155/pMV261 and M. smegmatis mc2155/pMV261∷hma (mmaA4, Rv0642c) strains were grown in the same medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml kanamycin and, in some cases, albumin/dextrose/catalase. These recombinant strains were prepared as described previously (16.Boissier F. Bardou F. Guillet V. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Daffé M. Quémard A. Mourey L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4434-4445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Freshly grown bacteria were washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, plus 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). Bacteria were lysed by cell disruption, by two passages through a One-shot Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems Ltd.) at 0.8 kbar. The crude extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 × g and at 4 °C. The very dense layer at the surface of the supernatant, consisting of cell wall and membrane fragments (17.Lacave C. Quémard A. Lanéelle G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was removed, resuspended in buffer A, and homogenized with a syringe (needle size 0.7 × 30 mm). The protein concentration of the extracts was determined with the DC method (Bio-Rad) for insoluble proteins, after denaturation of the proteins by boiling in 0.5 n NaOH at 100 °C for 10 min. MA biosynthesis was assayed in vitro in a reaction medium containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 7 mm KHCO3, 7 mm ATP, 0.7 mm CoASH, and 500 μg of cell wall extract proteins in a total volume of 750 μl. Mixtures were first incubated in the presence or absence of AdoMet analogs (i.e. SADAE (10 μm), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) such that the maximum final solvent concentration in the reaction medium was 5% (v/v); AdoHcy (1 mm) and sinefungin (3 mm), evaluated either with or without DMSO) for 15 min at 37 °C, and we then added 50 μm of either [1-14C]acetate for MA biosynthesis assays or [CH3-14C]AdoMet for MA-MT activity assays. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min; the reactions were stopped by saponification, and the MA profiles were analyzed by TLC (see below). The apparent IC50 value of SADAE was determined by measuring the rate of MA biosynthesis in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor (from 10 pm to 10 μm), using the same procedure as that described above, and calculated by fitting the data by nonlinear regression using the program GraphPad Prism 4.02. [1-14C]Acetate (specific activity, 56.60 mCi/mmol) and [CH3-14C]AdoMet (specific activity, 50.43 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sinefungin (Mr = 381.4 g/mol) and AdoHcy (Mr = 384.4 g/mol) were obtained from Sigma, and SADAE (Mr = 466.65 g/mol) was obtained from the Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (Gif sur Yvette, France). SADAE (50 and 90 μm) was added to broth cultures of M. smegmatis in the exponential growth phase. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min before the addition of 6.8 μm [1-14C]acetate. Cells were incubated for 3 or 6 h and then harvested. For M. tuberculosis cultures, also in the exponential growth phase, SADAE was added at concentrations of 25, 50, and 90 μm. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 7 h before the addition of [1-14C]acetate and then for a further 24 h before the harvesting of whole cells for MA content characterization. Reaction media containing cell wall extracts or harvested whole bacteria were saponified by incubation with a mixture of 40% KOH (w/v)/methoxyethanol (1:7) for 3 h at 110 °C in a screw-capped tube (18.Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Levy-Frebault V. David H. Ann. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar). The suspensions were acidified by adding an equal volume of 20% H2SO4, and fatty acids were extracted with diethyl ether. The neosynthesized and radiolabeled MAs were methylated and analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel 60 (Macherey-Nagel) run in dichloromethane for M. smegmatis strains and in petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1) (five runs) for M. tuberculosis (18.Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Levy-Frebault V. David H. Ann. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar), followed by phosphorimaging (Variable Mode Imager Typhoon TRIO, Amersham Biosciences). α-MAs were purified by preparative TLC on Silica Gel 60, and fractionated on AgNO3-impregnated silica gel TLC plates developed with dichloromethane (9.Dinadayala P.

The total labeled and unlabeled lipids in the extracts were visualized by spraying with molybdophosphoric acid (10% in ethanol) and charring. The radiolabeled spots were identified based on the Rf values of the fatty and mycolic acids visualized by the latter method and by comparison with previous data (16.Boissier F. Bardou F. Guillet V.

The susceptibility of M. smegmatis strains or of M. tuberculosis H37Rv to SADAE was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). We used a colorimetric microassay based on the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) to formazan by metabolically active cells (20.Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E.

Briefly, serial 2-fold dilutions of the inhibitor were prepared in 100 μl of Middlebrook 7H9 broth base (Difco) and dispensed into 96-well microtiter plates, and to each well we added 100 μl of M. tuberculosis or M. smegmatis suspension (diluted in 7H9 broth to an A600 of 0.02). Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added (50 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution). Plates were incubated for a further 24 h, and solubilization buffer (dimethylformamide/SDS 20% (w/v), 1:2) was added to each well. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of SADAE yielding 100% inhibition of bacterial growth (the absorbance value obtained for untreated bacilli was taken as a growth control). Ethambutol- and isoniazid-treated cultures were used as positive controls. Crystals of apo-Hma were obtained from the purified His6-tagged protein, as described previously (16.Boissier F. Bardou F.

Crystals of the complex with AdoHcy were prepared by cocrystallization in the presence of 2 mm cofactor product. The crystals were cryocooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K after immersion for 3 min in the crystallization solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol. For preparation of the complex with sinefungin, crystals of the apo-form were soaked in a solution containing both the cryoprotectant and 50 mm sinefungin for 2 min. The complex with SADAE was prepared by soaking crystals of the apo-form three times in freshly prepared drops of 5 mm SADAE in crystallization conditions and 5% (v/v) DMSO, for a total soaking time of 15 min. A fourth soaking was then carried out during 3 min in a drop containing the same solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. All diffraction data were collected at multistation beam-line ID14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The CCP4 suite (23.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

All structures were constructed manually in σA weighted electron density maps (27.Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar), using Coot (28.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Restrained refinements were obtained with the REFMAC5 program (29.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Solvent molecules were automatically added as neutral oxygen atoms with wARP (30.Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and Coot. Ligands were added at the end of refinement after water attribution. The coordinates of AdoHcy and sinefungin (adenosylornithine) were obtained from the Hetero-compound Information Center Uppsala (HIC-Up) (31.Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The energy-minimized coordinates and refinement library for SADAE were generated with the PRODRG server (32.Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Protein-ligand interactions were defined with HBPLUS (34.McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8–9 were produced using PyMOL (35.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). We first tested the effects of the three putative inhibitors on MA-MT activities in cell wall extracts of M. smegmatis/pMV261 and M. smegmatis/pMV261∷hma. With these bacterial extracts, the in vitro biosynthesis of MAs can be followed in the presence of a radiolabeled marker, [1-14C]acetate. The neosynthesized and radiolabeled MAs were extracted, methylated, and then analyzed by TLC and phosphorimaging. SADAE almost totally inhibited the biosynthesis of epoxy-MAs in M. smegmatis/pMV261 and that of epoxy-, keto-, and hydroxy-MAs in M. smegmatis/pMV261∷hma (Fig. 3A), at a concentration similar to the Ki of CFAS, 10 μm (15.Guianvarc'h D. Guangqi E. Drujon T. Rey C. Wang Q. Ploux O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By contrast, concentrations of the structural analogs AdoHcy and sinefungin 100–300 times higher than the effective concentration of SADAE had no significant impact on these metabolic pathways (Fig. 3A). A potentially specific effect of SADAE on the various species of α-MAs was investigated further after separation on AgNO3-impregnated TLC plates. Interestingly, in the treated cell wall extracts of both transformed and untransformed M. smegmatis strains, cis,cis-diethylenic α-MA (α5) labeling essentially persisted (Fig. 3B), whereas the labeling of cis,cis or cis,trans-dicyclopropanic (α1), cis-cyclopropanic,trans-ethylenic (α2), and cis,trans-diethylenic (α4) MAs was undetectable and that of the cis-cyclopropanic,cis-ethylenic MA (α3) was weaker (Fig. 3B and Fig. 1A). These data strongly suggest that SADAE interfered with the activity of MA-MTs. We tested this hypothesis by carrying out a similar experiment with [CH3-14C]AdoMet, which is specific for AdoMet-MT activity. In these conditions, only MAs bearing a cyclopropane (α-MA subpopulation in M. smegmatis (19.Laval F. Haites R. Movahedzadeh F. Lemassu A. Wong C.Y. Stoker N. Billman-Jacobe H. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) or a methyl branch (oxygenated MAs or α1- to α4-MAs) were radiolabeled in untreated cell wall extracts because they incorporated 14C-methyl groups (Fig. 3C). Radioactivity was also detected in methyl-branched fatty acids, corresponding to tuberculostearic acid (10-methylstearic acid) and its homolog 10-methylpalmitic acid (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 1). As expected, almost no labeling of MAs or fatty acids was observed in the presence of SADAE (Fig. 3C). The apparent IC50 value of SADAE was determined by measuring the rate of oxygenated MA biosynthesis over a large range of inhibitor concentrations. The IC50 values for keto-MA and for epoxy-MA synthesis were 0.065 ± 0.013 μm (0.031 ± 0.006 μg/ml) and 0.713 ± 0.036 μm (0.333 ± 0.017 μg/ml), respectively. The submicromolar IC50 values reflect the high potential of SADAE to inhibit MA-MTs. The failure of most antibiotics to permeate the exceptionally impermeable mycobacterial cell wall is a major cause of poor whole-cell potency and a lack of susceptibility to drugs in mycobacteria (36.Sacchettini J.C. Rubin E.J. Freundlich J.S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We also assessed the impact of SADAE on the growth of mycobacterial species by determining MICs for M. smegmatis/pMV261, M. smegmatis/ pMV261∷hma, and M. tuberculosis. The mycobacterial cells were grown in microplates, and serial 2-fold dilutions of SADAE were added during the exponential growth phase. The final counts of bacteria were determined by measuring the metabolism of a tetrazolium salt into a colored compound, formazan, detected at 570 nm. Curves showed growth inhibition at similar concentrations for both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, corresponding to MIC values of about 100 μm (47 μg/ml) (Fig. 4). Thus, SADAE is able to reach targets within the bacilli and to stop mycobacterial growth. We investigated whether MA-MTs were particularly accessible to SADAE and could be considered among its targets in vivo, by evaluating the effect of this compound on the biosynthesis of MAs in intact mycobacteria. We first treated M. smegmatis/pMV261 and M. smegmatis/pMV261∷hma cultures at (100 μm) or below (50 μm) the MIC, for 90 min, and then added [1-14C]acetate. Cultures were incubated for 3 or 6 h, and the lipids were then extracted. TLC analysis showed that SADAE almost totally inhibited the biosynthesis of epoxy-, keto-, and hydroxy-MAs at the MIC (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 2). We then carried out similar experiments on M. tuberculosis. Bacteria were treated with SADAE concentrations of 25–90 μm for 7 h, and were then labeled with [1-14C]acetate for 24 h (Fig. 5B). The biosynthesis of oxygenated MAs was strongly inhibited. Relative radiolabeling levels for these MAs were up to 86% lower than those in the absence of SADAE, whereas α-MA and regular size fatty acid levels remained stable (Fig. 5D). We investigated the effects of SADAE treatment on the structure of α-MAs in more detail by purifying these compounds and analyzing them by argentation TLC (Fig. 5C). Untreated M. tuberculosis produced dicyclopropanated MAs (α1′), but the profile of compounds produced was radically changed by SADAE treatment. SADAE strongly inhibited the synthesis of α1′-MAs (86% inhibition at 90 μm) and induced the accumulation of several new species with a much smaller Rf (Fig. 5E). The migration of these compounds corresponded to that of mono- and di-ethylenic α-MAs (α2′ and α3′, respectively) (9.Dinadayala P. Laval F. Raynaud C. Lemassu A. Laneelle M.A. Laneelle G. Daffe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7310-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19.Laval F. Haites R. Movahedzadeh F. Lemassu A. Wong C.Y. Stoker N. Billman-Jacobe H. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The appearance of unsaturated α-MAs probably results from the inhibition of PcaA and MmaA2, which introduce cis-cyclopropane rings into α1′-MAs, and the inhibition of Hma and MmaA2/CmaA2, which catalyze the biosynthesis of cis/trans-cyclopropanated oxygenated MAs (Fig. 1). These data collectively demonstrate that SADAE also inhibits MA-MTs with cyclopropane synthase activity. In conclusion,"
https://openalex.org/W1972749099,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is the principal clearance receptor for serpins and serpin-proteinase complexes. The ligand binding regions of LRP consist of clusters of cysteine-rich approximately 40-residue complement-like repeats (CR), with cluster II being the principal ligand-binding region. To better understand the specificity of binding at different sites within the cluster and the ability of LRP to discriminate in vivo between uncomplexed and proteinase-complexed serpins, we have systematically examined the affinities of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and proteinase nexin-1 (PN-1) in their native, cleaved, and proteinase-complexed states to (CR)(2) and (CR)(3) fragments of LRP cluster II. A consistent blue shift of the CR domain tryptophan fluorescence suggested a common mode of serpin binding, involving lysines on the serpin engaging the acidic region around the calcium binding site of the CR domain. High affinity binding of non-proteinase-complexed PAI-1 and PN-1 occurred to all fragments containing three CR domains (3-59 nm) and most that contain only two CR domains, although binding energies to different (CR)(3) fragments differed by up to 18% for PAI-1 and 9% for PN-1. No detectable difference in affinity was seen between native and cleaved serpin. However, the presence of proteinase in complex with the serpin enhanced affinity modestly and presumably nonspecifically. This may be sufficient to give preferential binding of such complexes in vivo at the relevant physiological concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2057009265,"Background Recent studies showed that progenitor cells could differentiate into mature vascular cells. The main physiological factors implicated in cell differentiation are specific growth factors. We hypothesized that simply by varying the oxygen content, progenitor cells can be differentiated either in mature endothelial cells (ECs) or contractile smooth muscle cells (SMCs) while keeping exactly the same culture medium. Methodology/Principal Findings Mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient were cultivated under hypoxic (5% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) environment. Differentiated cells characterization was performed by confocal microscopy examination and flow cytometry analyses. The phenotype stability over a longer time period was also performed. The morphological examination of the confluent obtained cells after several weeks (between 2 and 4 weeks) showed two distinct morphologies: cobblestone shape in normoxia and a spindle like shape in hypoxia. The cell characterization showed that cobblestone cells were positive to ECs markers while spindle like shape cells were positive to contractile SMCs markers. Moreover, after several further amplification (until 3rd passage) in hypoxic or normoxic conditions of the previously differentiated SMC, immunofluorescence studies showed that more than 80% cells continued to express SMCs markers whatever the cell environmental culture conditions with a higher contractile markers expression compared to control (aorta SMCs) signature of phenotype stability. Conclusion/Significance We demonstrate in this paper that in vitro culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with specific angiogenic growth factors under hypoxic conditions leads to SMCs differentiation into a contractile phenotype, signature of their physiological state. Moreover after amplification, the differentiated SMC did not reverse and keep their contractile phenotype after the 3rd passage performed under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. These aspects are of the highest importance for tissue engineering strategies. These results highlight also the determinant role of the tissue environment in the differentiation process of vascular progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092066507,"Coral-reef fishes experience a major challenge when facing settlement in a multi-threat environment, within which, using settlement cues, they need to select a suitable site. Studies in laboratories and artificial setups have shown that the presence of conspecific adults often serves as a positive settlement cue, whose value is explained by the increased survival of juveniles in an already proven fit environment. However, settlement in already inhabited corals may expose the recruits to adult aggression. Daily observations and manipulation experiments were used in the present study, which was conducted in the natural reef. We revealed differential strategies of settlers, which do not necessarily join conspecific adults. Dascyllus aruanus prefer to settle near (not with) their aggressive adults, and to join them only after gaining in size; whereas Dascyllus marginatus settlers in densely populated reefs settle independently of their adult distribution. Our results present different solutions to the challenges faced by fish recruits while selecting their microhabitat, and emphasize the complexity of habitat selection by the naïve settlers. Although laboratory experiments are important to the understanding of fish habitat selection, further studies in natural habitats are essential in order to elucidate the actual patterns of settlement and habitat selection, which are crucial for the survival of coral-reef fish populations."
https://openalex.org/W1967884655,"Bacterioferritin (BFR) is a bacterial member of the ferritin family that functions in iron metabolism and protects against oxidative stress. BFR differs from the mammalian protein in that it is comprised of 24 identical subunits and is able to bind 12 equivalents of heme at sites located between adjacent pairs of subunits. The mechanism by which iron enters the protein to form the dinuclear (ferroxidase) catalytic site present in every subunit and the mineralized iron core housed within the 24-mer is not well understood. To address this issue, the properties of a catalytically functional assembly variant (E128R/E135R) of Escherichia coli BFR are characterized by a combination of crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetics. The three-dimensional structure of the protein (1.8 A resolution) includes two ethylene glycol molecules located on either side of the dinuclear iron site. One of these ethylene glycol molecules is integrated into the surface of the protein that would normally be exposed to solvent, and the other is integrated into the surface of the protein that would normally face the iron core where it is surrounded by the anionic residues Glu(47), Asp(50), and Asp(126). We propose that the sites occupied by these ethylene glycol molecules define regions where iron interacts with the protein, and, in keeping with this proposal, ferroxidase activity decreases significantly when they are replaced with the corresponding amides."
https://openalex.org/W2171453426,"Microarray and RT-PCR based methods are important tools for analysis of gene expression; however, in tissues containing many different cells types, such as the testis, characterization of gene expression in specific cell types can be severely hampered by noise from other cells. The laser microdissection technology allows for enrichment of specific cell types. However, when the cells are not morphologically distinguishable, it is necessary to use a specific staining method for the target cells. In this study we have tested different fixatives, storage conditions for frozen sections and staining protocols, and present two staining protocols for frozen sections, one for fast and specific staining of fetal germ cells, testicular carcinoma in situ cells, and other cells with embryonic stem cell-like properties that express the alkaline phosphatase, and one for specific staining of lipid droplet-containing cells, which is useful for isolation of the androgen-producing Leydig cells. Both protocols retain a morphology that is compatible with laser microdissection and yield RNA of a quality suitable for PCR and microarray analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2001888785,"Molluscan smooth muscles exhibit a low energy cost contraction called catch. Catch is regulated by twitchin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Recently, we found that the D2 fragment of twitchin containing the D2 site (Ser-4316) and flanking immunoglobulin motifs (TWD2-S) formed a heterotrimeric complex with myosin and with actin in the region that interacts with myosin loop 2 (Funabara, D., Hamamoto, C., Yamamoto, K., Inoue, A., Ueda, M., Osawa, R., Kanoh, S., Hartshorne, D.

A synthesized peptide, CAQNKEAETTGTHKKRKSSA, based on the myosin loop 2 sequence (loop 2 peptide), competitively inhibited the formation of the trimeric complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that TWD2-S binds to the loop 2 peptide with a Ka of (2.44 ± 0.09) × 105m−1 with two binding sites. The twitchin-binding peptide of actin, AGFAGDDAP, which also inhibited formation of the trimeric complex, bound to TWD2-S with a Ka of (5.83 ± 0.05) × 104m−1 with two binding sites. The affinity of TWD2-S to actin and myosin was slightly decreased with an increase of pH, but this effect could not account for the marked pH dependence of catch in permeabilized fibers. The complex formation also showed a moderate Ca2+ sensitivity in that in the presence of Ca2+ complex formation was reduced.

Molluscan smooth muscles, such as mussel anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) 2The abbreviations used are: ABRManterior byssus retractor muscleITCisothermal titration calorimetryMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. and adductor muscle, exhibit a low energy cost phase of tension maintenance termed catch. Catch muscle develops active tension following an increase of the intracellular [Ca2+] induced by secretion of acetylcholine. Myosin is activated by direct binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory myosin light chain and initiates a relative sliding between thick and thin filaments (1.Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Chantler P.D. Mycology. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1994: 506-528Google Scholar). After a decrease of intracellular [Ca2+] to resting levels, the catch state is formed where tension is maintained over long periods of time with little energy consumption (2.Ishii N. Simpson A.W. Ashley C.C. Science. 1989; 243: 1367-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3.Twarog B.M. Physiol. Rev. 1976; 56: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Catch tension is abolished by secretion of serotonin and an increase of intracellular [cAMP] with the resulting activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylation of twitchin (4.Siegman M.J.

For this cycle to repeat, dephosphorylation of twitchin is necessary (6.Siegman M.J. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. J. Muscle Res.

Thus, in this scheme, twitchin is a major regulator of the catch state. anterior byssus retractor muscle isothermal titration calorimetry 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. Molluscan twitchin is known as a myosin-binding protein belonging to the titin/connectin superfamily. It is a single polypeptide of 530 kDa containing multiple repeats of immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type 3-like motifs in addition to a single kinase domain homologous to the catalytic domain of myosin light chain kinase of vertebrate smooth muscle (7.Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are several possible phosphorylation sites in molluscan twitchin recognized by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and two, D1 and D2, have been identified. The D1 phosphorylation site (Ser-1075) is in the linker region between the 7th and 8th Ig motifs (numbering from the N terminus). The D2 site (Ser-4316) is in the linker region between the 21st and 22nd Ig motifs. Additional sites are found close to D1, but are thought not to be vital for catch regulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying development and maintenance of the catch state have been controversial for several years. One theory proposes that catch reflected attached frozen or slowly cycling cross-bridges (8.Lowy J. Millman B.M. Hanson J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1964; 160: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9.Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1990; 96: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). What distinguished the attached cross-bridge from the detached relaxed state is not clear. Also it was suggested that interactions between thick filaments, other than cross-bridges, or between thin and thick filaments are responsible for the catch contraction (10.Takahashi I. Shimada M. Akimoto T. Kishi T. Sugi H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2003; 134: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In either of the latter cases, the cross-bridge (myosin head) was not involved. Recently we found that a twitchin fragment including the D2 phosphorylation site and its flanking Ig motifs (TWD2-S) interacted with myosin and actin in a phosphorylation-sensitive manner, and it was suggested that this trimeric complex contributed to tension maintenance in catch (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TWD2-S bound to a region of the actin molecule known also to interact with loop 2 of myosin that is involved in the ATP-driven movement of myosin with actin (12.Johara M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A.

In the present study, we show that the myosin loop 2 binds to TWD2-S using competitive cosedimentation assays and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). These techniques were applied to also study in more detail the interactions of the twitchin-binding peptide of actin (identified in the previous study (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A.

In addition, the effects of pH and Ca2+ on the binding of TWD2-S to myosin and actin were investigated. Live specimens of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were used. Mytilus ABRM was dissected from shells, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. ABRM myosin was purified as previously reported (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K.

F-actin was prepared from acetone powder of chicken fast skeletal muscle (13.Mommaerts W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 188: 559-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The myosin loop 2 peptide of ABRM myosin heavy chain (residues 390–408, CAQNKEAETTGTHKKRKSSA) was synthesized (AJ249991) (14.Yamada A. Yoshio M. Oiwa K. Nyitray L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with an additional Cys at the N terminus (Mr 2175). The actin subdomain I peptide, AGFAGDDAP, corresponding to residues 21–29 of chicken skeletal actin, was synthesized (Mr 819). TWD2-S (Mr∼26,000) was expressed in Escherichia coli as previously reported (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thiophosphorylation of TWD2-S (S-TWD2-S) was carried out as described previously (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TWD2-S contains residues Arg-4197 to Asp-4427 of ABRM twitchin (AB062881) with a His6 tag and a thrombin recognition site added to the N terminus (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLE). These peptides and twitchin fragments were used in competitive cosedimentation assays and isothermal titration calorimetry. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. A reaction mixture of 10 μl contained 20 μg/ml myosin (∼42 nm), 1 mg/ml actin (∼24 μm), and 20 μg/ml TWD2-S (∼9.2 μm) in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.4, 30 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA. The 10-μl reaction mixture also contained the actin or myosin loop 2 peptide to provide molar ratios (to TWD2-S) of 1:10, 1:5, 1:2, 1, and 5:1. The reaction mixture thus prepared was kept on ice for 15 min and subjected to low speed centrifugation (5,000 × g) to sediment filamentous myosin. The supernatant and pellet were applied to SDS-PAGE. The in vivo molar ratio of twitchin/myosin is 1:15 (6.Siegman M.J. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J.

The effects of Ca2+ on formation of the trimeric complex were monitored by carrying out the cosedimentation assays as above but with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 μg/ml TWD2-S. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. The concentration of protein in gels was determined by the computer software Image J. ITC was performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal LLC).

Titration was performed at 25 °C by injecting 10 μl of 400 μm synthetic peptide (actin subdomain I or myosin loop 2 peptide) into the ITC cell containing 1.5 ml of 10 μm TWD2-S or S-TWD2-S. All samples were dissolved in 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. No EGTA was added to the solution as it disturbed ITC measurements. The data thus obtained were corrected for the heat of dilution of the peptide and analyzed by MicroCal Origin 6.0 software. The pH dependence of binding of TWD2-S to native actin, myosin loop 2 peptide, and native myosin was determined with a solid phase binding assay (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the Protein Detector ELISA kit (KPL). Native actin and myosin used in the cosedimentation assay were utilized for the solid phase binding assay. Actin was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-maleate, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm KCl, and myosin in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.8 containing 0.6 m KCl and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Wells in a plastic immunoplate were coated with 50 μg/ml actin, 50 μg/ml myosin, or 50 μg/ml myosin loop 2 peptide and then bound with 30 μg/ml TWD2-S in 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, and 200 mm KCl adjusted to pH 6.7, 7.2, 7.4, and 7.7 after blocking with 1× bovine serum albumin diluent/blocking solution in the kit. The salt concentration of the TWD2-S solution was referred to by Höpflinger et al. (15.Höpflinger M.C. Andruchova O. Andruchov O. Grassberger H. Galler S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse anti-His tag antibody (GE Healthcare) and anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Absorbance at 630 nm was measured after maximum color development. Bovine serum albumin was used as a control in these experiments and also was used for standardization of data obtained with actin, myosin, and myosin loop 2. The effects of Ca2+ on binding of TWD2-S to the myosin loop 2 and actin peptides were examined by the solid phase binding assays. Wells in a plastic immunoplate were coated with 50 μg/ml myosin loop 2 peptide or 50 μg/ml actin peptide and then treated with 30 μg/ml TWD2-S in 1× coating solution in the ELISA kit. Binding/incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature, and color detection was performed as described above. Unphosphorylated TWD2-S was used because the phosphorylated TWD2-S does not form the trimeric complex (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the pellet of the control sample contained myosin, actin, and TWD2-S, i.e. the trimeric complex. In the presence of low levels of the loop 2 peptide, the complex is dissociated, and TWD2-S is found with both myosin (pellet) and actin (supernatant). At the 1:10 ratio (loop 2 peptide/TWD-2S), the concentration of the loop 2 peptide is about 10× greater than the concentration of myosin heads (∼84 nm). As the level of loop 2 peptide is increased, more TWD-2S is found in the supernatant, and at the 1:1 ratio is found only in the supernatant. Thus, at relatively low concentrations of loop 2 peptide (in the presence of ATP and absence of Ca2+), the trimeric complex is disrupted. The effects of the actin peptide on complex formation also were tested (Fig. 1B) using the same molar ratios of peptide to TWD2-S. The myosin pellet in each sample contained TWD2-S but decreasing amounts of actin as the ratio of the actin peptide was increased, in contrast to the loop 2 peptide. At a molar ratio of 5 (actin peptide/TWD2-S), actin was not present in the pellet. As expected, at the higher levels of the actin peptide, TWD2-S maintained its binding to myosin, but binding of TWD2-S to F-actin was decreased. It is considered that in the catch state the intracellular [Ca2+] is at resting level (2.Ishii N. Simpson A.W. Ashley C.C. Science. 1989; 243: 1367-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and under these conditions the complex of twitchin, myosin, and actin is thought to be formed. It was reported that unphosphorylated twitchin has decreasing effects on contractions induced at higher [Ca2+] (6.Siegman M.J. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the formation of the trimeric complex is Ca2+-dependent. To address this point, the cosedimentation assays also were carried out in the presence of both ATP and Ca2+. In the absence of ATP and the presence of Ca2+ (rigor conditions), actin was cosedimented with myosin without TWD2-S (data not shown). In the absence of Ca2+ and the presence of TWD2-S (molar ratio to myosin of 1) part of the actin was cosedimented with myosin (Fig. 2A). However, in the presence of Ca2+ the amount of actin in the pellet was decreased and was calculated to be 46 ± 12% of that cosedimented in the absence of Ca2+ (n = 3) (p < 0.05). The binding of TWD2-S to the actin and loop 2 peptides in the presence of Ca2+ slightly decreased as revealed by the solid phase binding assay, supporting the data of the cosedimentation assay (Fig. 2B). Thus, the presence of Ca2+ partly inhibited the formation of the complex. Part of this effect could be due to a reduced affinity of TWD2-S to myosin and actin in the presence of Ca2+ and a resultant decrease in formation of the trimeric complex (TWD2-S was detected in the supernatant fraction in the presence of Ca2+; see arrow-head in Fig. 2A). TWD2-S was titrated by ITC with the loop 2 peptide as shown in Fig. 3A, providing the stoichiometry (N), binding constant (Ka), binding enthalpy (ΔH), and binding entropy (ΔS) in the endothermic reaction. The N value of 1.90 ± 0.02 obtained in a solution containing TWD2-S and the loop 2 peptide indicated that the TWD2-S fragment contained two binding sites for the loop 2 peptide with Ka = (2.44 ± 0.09) × 105m−1. On the other hand, no signal was detected in the reaction mixture containing S-TWD2-S and the loop 2 peptide, indicating that interaction between TWD2-S and the loop 2 peptide is lost on phosphorylation of the D2 site in the twitchin molecule. The same experiment was performed using the actin peptide, which was shown previously to bind to TWD2-S (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The thermogram and binding isotherm in the titration of the actin peptide with TWD2-S are shown in Fig. 3B. The N and Ka values for the binding of the actin peptide to TWD2-S were 1.83 ± 0.10 and (5.83 ± 0.05) × 104m−1, respectively, again indicating that TWD2-S contained two binding sites for the actin peptide. Thiophosphorylation of TWD2-S diminished the binding of S-TWD2-S to the actin peptide as in the case with S-TWD2-S and the myosin loop 2 peptide (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels). Data from ITC together with the above competitive cosedimentation assay clearly demonstrate that both myosin loop 2 and the actin subdomain I regions are involved in the formation of the trimeric complex of myosin, actin, and twitchin. It was reported that a change of pH affects catch contraction, and higher pH (in the range of 7.2–7.7 in various studies) (see Ref. 15.Höpflinger M.C. Andruchova O. Andruchov O. Grassberger H. Galler S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in skinned muscle fibers caused relaxation of muscle from catch. Using the solid phase binding assay, it was investigated whether a pH dependence in various interactions could be demonstrated. Myosin, the loop 2 peptide, and actin immobilized in the wells of a microplate were subjected to binding/incubation with TWD2-S at pH 6.7, 7.2, 7.4, and 7.7. TWD2-S interacted with all of the three preparations at each pH value (Fig. 4). The binding of TWD2-S to myosin was maximum at pH 6.7 and decreased to 62, 59, and 59% (p < 0.01) at pH 7.2, 7.4, and 7.7, respectively (relative to the pH 6.7 value). Similarly, the affinity of TWD2-S to actin was reduced significantly to 76% at pH 7.2, compared with pH 6.7 (p < 0.05). No significant changes were detected in the binding of TWD2-S to the loop 2 peptide. These results indicate that although alkalization influences some of the binding parameters, it is not a dominant factor, as expected from the fiber studies. In the present study, it is shown that the myosin loop 2 region is involved in the formation of the trimeric complex of myosin, actin, and twitchin. The twitchin-binding region of actin, located in subdomain I, also is known as the myosin loop 2-binding region. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the formation of the trimeric complex involves interactions of twitchin with actin subdomain I and with the myosin head loop 2 region. The colocalization of twitchin in the region of the D2 site with myosin and actin is supported by previous electron microscope observations of isolated thick filaments (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The electrostatic interaction of myosin loop 2 with actin is implicated in the first step of the ATP-driven movement (16.Van Dijk J. Fernandez C. Chaussepied P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8385-8394Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An increase in [Ca2+]i initiates the active state by Ca2+ binding to myosin and also leads to dephosphorylation of twitchin by calcineurin (17.Castellani L. Cohen C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As suggested previously (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the formation of the high force state is thought to displace the twitchin interactions with myosin and actin and thus prevent formation of catch. This is consistent with observations made with reconstituted fibers (18.Yamada A. Yoshio M. Nakamura A. Kohama K. Oiwa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40762-40768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, during an active contraction, the competition between the actin-myosin interaction sites and the sites on actin subdomain I and on myosin loop 2 for twitchin would be lessened by formation of the high force state. From the present study, it can be added that Ca2+ also decreased the binding of actin to myosin in the presence of TWD2-S, probably reflecting a reduction in binding of the twitchin peptide to myosin and actin, as shown. This would reduce the possibility for formation of catch in the presence of Ca2+, facilitating the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. It is interesting that ITC experiments indicated two binding sites on the twitchin fragment for both the actin peptide and the loop 2 peptide. How these four sites are regulated by phosphorylation of the D2 site is not known, and the relationship, if any, between the loop 2 sites for actin and twitchin and the actin sites for loop 2 and for twitchin requires clarification. The data from the cosedimentation studies suggest that the link between twitchin (TWD2-S) and myosin is more sensitive to competition by the loop 2 peptide. At 1:10 loop 2 peptide/TWD2-S, the interaction between actin and myosin is lost. Under these conditions, the concentration of loop 2 peptide is about 10-fold higher than the myosin head concentration. These findings indicate that there is no direct interaction between myosin and actin when the two proteins form the trimeric complex with twitchin. Under catch condition, myosin is inactivated and does not bind to actin (Fig. 2A), indicating that the loop 2 region does not bind to actin. In the cosedimentation assay, loop 2 peptide would have competed with the loop 2 region in myosin for binding to TWD2-S. It is noted that the cosedimentation assay was performed at cold temperature to avoid any possible denaturation of myosin and actin, whereas the ITC experiments were carried out at 25 °C to facilitate the quick reaction required for the experiments between the peptides. However, proteins or peptides are well known to change their structures dramatically depending on environmental temperatures. Therefore, such possible structural differences must be carefully considered to interpret the data obtained in the two series of the experiments in the present study. Galler and co-workers (15.Höpflinger M.C. Andruchova O. Andruchov O. Grassberger H. Galler S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported that structures within the myofilament that are sensitive to pH changes are responsible for catch. Our study on the pH dependence of the interactions of TWD2-S showed that its binding to myosin and actin was reduced on increasing pH, but its interaction with the loop 2 peptide was not affected. With the fiber studies, the pH was critical for formation of catch, and catch was not observed at pH values around 7.4 (15.Höpflinger M.C. Andruchova O. Andruchov O. Grassberger H. Galler S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The binding of TWD2-S although slightly reduced at these pH values still occurred. Thus, the marked pH dependence seen with fibers cannot be attributed entirely to a pH dependence of the interactions involved in formation of the trimeric complex. These results are consistent with previous observations (11.Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) where the trimeric complex was formed at pH 7.4. However, the salt concentration adopted in the present study was 200 mm KCl, which is somewhat higher than those used elsewhere for fibers. Therefore, experiments in different salt concentrations are required for a more correct interpretation of the results obtained in the present study. A controversial and long standing issue is the identity of the physical interaction(s) responsible for maintaining tension in catch with low energy consumption. Recent studies have proposed that the myosin cross-bridge-actin interaction is not involved (10.Takahashi I. Shimada M. Akimoto T. Kishi T. Sugi H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2003; 134: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19.Andruchova O. Höpflinger M.C. Andruchov O. Galler S. Pflüger Arch. 2005; 450: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20.Shelud'ko N.S. Matusovsky O.S. Permyakova T.V. Matusovskaya G.G. Arch. Biochem.

J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this idea, and we propose that interaction between thick and thin filaments is due to the formation of a complex between actin and myosin that is cross-linked by twitchin, specifically in the region around the D2 site. The myosin site for interaction with twitchin is in the myosin head (the loop 2 region) but distinct from the cross-bridge. The trimeric complex, however, may be sensitive to cycling cross-bridge-actin interactions because it is proposed that the complex is not formed or is displaced in the high force state. Further studies are necessary to define and localize the various sites involved in formation of the trimeric complex. It is also important to determine whether or not the trimeric complex is formed by the reaction of twitchin with myosin and actin, cooperatively.

https://openalex.org/W2031163000,"Stress-activated protein kinases regulate multiple cellular responses to a wide variety of intracellular and extracellular conditions. The conserved, multifunctional, ATF/CREB protein Atf1 (Mts1, Gad7) of fission yeast binds to CRE-like (M26) DNA sites. Atf1 is phosphorylated by the conserved, p38-family kinase Spc1 (Sty1, Phh1) and is required for many Spc1-dependent stress responses, efficient sexual differentiation, and activation of Rec12 (Spo11)-dependent meiotic recombination hotspots like ade6-M26.We sought to define mechanisms by which Spc1 regulates Atf1 function at the ade6-M26 hotspot. The Spc1 kinase was essential for hotspot activity, but dispensable for basal recombination. Unexpectedly, a protein lacking all eleven MAPK phospho-acceptor sites and detectable phosphorylation (Atf1-11M) was fully proficient for hotspot recombination. Furthermore, tethering of Atf1 to ade6 in the chromosome by a heterologous DNA binding domain bypassed the requirement for Spc1 in promoting recombination.The Spc1 protein kinase regulates the pathway of Atf1-promoted recombination at or before the point where Atf1 binds to chromosomes, and this pathway regulation is independent of the phosphorylation status of Atf1. Since basal recombination is Spc1-independent, the principal function of the Spc1 kinase in meiotic recombination is to correctly position Atf1-promoted recombination at hotspots along chromosomes. We also propose new hypotheses on regulatory mechanisms for shared (e.g., DNA binding) and distinct (e.g., osmoregulatory vs. recombinogenic) activities of multifunctional, stress-activated protein Atf1."
https://openalex.org/W2115111279,"Background In mammals the interplay between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and adipose tissue is widely unexplored. We have employed mice, which develop an adult onset of obesity due to the lack the neuronal specific transcription factor Nscl-2 to investigate the interplay between the nervous system and white adipose tissue (WAT). Methodology Changes in the architecture and innervation of WAT were compared between wildtype, Nscl2−/−, ob/ob and Nscl2−/−//ob/ob mice using morphological methods, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Metabolic alterations in mutant mice and in isolated cells were investigated under basal and stimulated conditions. Principal Findings We found that Nscl-2 mutant mice show a massive reduction of innervation of white epididymal and paired subcutaneous inguinal fat tissue including sensory and autonomic nerves as demonstrated by peripherin and neurofilament staining. Reduction of innervation went along with defects in the formation of the microvasculature, accumulation of cells of the macrophage/preadipocyte lineage, a bimodal distribution of the size of fat cells, and metabolic defects of isolated adipocytes. Despite a relative insulin resistance of white adipose tissue and isolated Nscl-2 mutant adipocytes the serum level of insulin in Nscl-2 mutant mice was only slightly increased. Conclusions We conclude that the reduction of the innervation and vascularization of WAT in Nscl-2 mutant mice leads to the increase of preadipocyte/macrophage-like cells, a bimodal distribution of the size of adipocytes in WAT and an altered metabolic activity of adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2054525599,"Metabolites of neural cells, is known to have a significant effect on the normal physiology and function of neurons in brain. However, whether they play a role in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is unknown. Here, we show that metabolites of neurons play essential role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Firstly, in vivo and in vitro metabolites of cerebellar neurons both significantly induced the expression of Aβ-degrading enzymes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and promoted Aβ clearance. Moreover, metabolites of cerebellar neurons significantly reduced brain Aβ levels and reversed cognitive impairments and other AD-like phenotypes of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, in both early and late stages of AD pathology. On the other hand, metabolites of hippocampal neurons reduced the expression of Aβ-degrading enzymes in the cerebellum and caused cerebellar neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Thus, we report, for the first time, that metabolites of neurons not only are required for maintaining the normal physiology of neurons but also play essential role in the pathogenesis of AD and may be responsible for the regional-specificity of Aβ deposition and AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2160534465,"Background There has been little consensus as to whether age-related visuomotor adaptation effects are readily observable. Some studies have found slower adaptation, and/or reduced overall levels. In contrast, other methodologically similar studies have found no such evidence of aging effects on visuomotor adaptation. A crucial early step in successful adaptation is the ability to perform the necessary transformation to complete the task at hand. The present study describes the use of a viewing window paradigm to examine the effects of aging in a visuomotor transformation task. Methods Two groups of participants, a young adult control group (age range 18–33 years old, mean age = 22) and an older adult group (age range 62–74, mean age = 68) completed a viewing window task that was controlled by the user via a computer touchscreen. Four visuomotor “flip” conditions were created by varying the relationship between the participant's movement, and the resultant on-screen movement of the viewing window: 1) No flip 2) X-Axis and Y-axis body movements resulted in the opposite direction of movement of the viewing window. In each of the 3) Flip-X and 4) Flip-Y conditions, the solitary X- or Y-axes were reversed. Response times and movement of the window were recorded. Conclusions Older participants demonstrated impairments in performing a required visuomotor transformation, as evidenced by more complex scanning patterns and longer scanning times when compared to younger control participants. These results provide additional evidence that the mechanisms involved in visuomotor transformation are negatively affected by age."
https://openalex.org/W1993431561,"DRIL1 is an ARID family transcription factor that can immortalize primary mouse fibroblasts, bypass RASV12-induced cellular senescence and collaborate with RASV12 or MYC in mediating oncogenic transformation. It also activates immunoglobulin heavy chain transcription and engages in heterodimer formation with E2F to stimulate E2F-dependent transcription. Little, however, is known about the regulation of DRIL1 activity. Recently, DRIL1 was found to interact with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, but the functional relevance of this association has not been assessed. Here, we show that DRIL1 is sumoylated both in vitro and in vivo at lysine 398. Moreover, we provide evidence that PIASy functions as a specific SUMO E3-ligase for DRIL1 and promotes its sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, consistent with the subnuclear localization of PIASy in the Matrix-Associated Region (MAR), SUMO-modified DRIL1 species are found exclusively in the MAR fraction. This post-translational modification interferes neither with the subcellular localization nor the DNA-binding activity of the protein. In contrast, DRIL1 sumoylation impairs its interaction with E2F1 in vitro and modifies its transcriptional activity in vivo, driving transcription of subset of genes regulating leukocyte fate. Taken together, these results identify sumoylation as a novel post-translational modification of DRIL1 that represents an important mechanism for targeting and modulating DRIL1 transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1981099076,"Background Structural changes in molecules are frequently observed during biological processes like replication, transcription and translation. These structural changes can usually be traced to specific distortions in the backbones of the macromolecules involved. Quantitative energetic characterization of such distortions can greatly advance the atomic-level understanding of the dynamic character of these biological processes. Methodology/Principal Findings Molecular dynamics simulations combined with a variation of the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method for potential of mean force determination are applied to characterize localized structural changes for the test case of cytosine (underlined) base flipping in a GTCAGCGCATGG DNA duplex. Free energy landscapes for backbone torsion and sugar pucker degrees of freedom in the DNA are used to understand their behavior in response to the base flipping perturbation. By simplifying the base flipping structural change into a two-state model, a free energy difference of upto 14 kcal/mol can be attributed to the flipped state relative to the stacked Watson-Crick base paired state. This two-state classification allows precise evaluation of the effect of base flipping on local backbone degrees of freedom. Conclusions/Significance The calculated free energy landscapes of individual backbone and sugar degrees of freedom expectedly show the greatest change in the vicinity of the flipping base itself, but specific delocalized effects can be discerned upto four nucleotide positions away in both 5′ and 3′ directions. Free energy landscape analysis thus provides a quantitative method to pinpoint the determinants of structural change on the atomic scale and also delineate the extent of propagation of the perturbation along the molecule. In addition to nucleic acids, this methodology is anticipated to be useful for studying conformational changes in all macromolecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1999536344,"London's cavernous Royal Albert Hall is more often host to world-famous opera singers than to schoolchildren, but for one day in April it welcomed almost 500 students from six schools across Britain for a debate on the following motion: “This House believes it is right to use up to 14-day-old embryos created in laboratory test tubes as a source of stem cells for research into disease.” The ethical questions surrounding stem cell research are frequently left to newspaper columnists or government committees, so the event, called “Arena of Debate: Nobody Lives Forever,” was an unusual opportunity for young people to share their views. With funding from two private donors, the debate was jointly organized by the Royal Albert Hall's Learning and Participation department and by Y Touring, the theater company of the London-based Central YMCA. Together, they created a visual spectacle for the audience: giant cell-like discs hung from the blood-red ceiling of the 138-year-old arena, above huddles of 15- and 16-year-olds. Meanwhile, three television screens circled a central stage, upon which a panel of scientists and ethicists presented different sides of the issue. It wasn't a music concert, but it had the drama of one. “I can't really see what the problem is. The embryo is not a human being and we should take cells from it,” proclaimed Lewis Wolpert, Emeritus Professor of Biology as Applied to Medicine at the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at University College, London. Josephine Quintavalle from the public-interest group Comment on Reproductive Ethics responded equally as passionately: “Hands up anyone here today that wasn't once an embryo,” she asked. “I was once an embryo and so were you. Would you rather have been a stem cell?” Peppering this heated discussion were short, amateur films created by each of the schools. Similarly varied in tone to the rest of the debate, they ranged from the scientific (a film by Quintin Kynaston School in central London explained that a third of fertilized eggs die naturally anyway), to those that shamelessly provoked a “yuck” factor (students from Brentside High School in west London asked whether one would trade the life of a two-year-old toddler to treat wrinkles). Efforts to connect to young people through debates like this have intensified over the last decade. University of Edinburgh researchers created an interactive road show in 2008 to educate local schoolchildren about stem cell biology. The UK's Festival of Science, which attracts thousands of students annually, last year also organized workshops on the same theme. And in the United States, President Obama's support for stem cell research came with parallel boosts to education funding, part of which will be used to improve school laboratories and science teaching. One effect is that future generations are likely to be better informed about the choices made by policymakers on the stem cell front. At the Royal Albert Hall debate, most students had arrived having already had lessons about the underlying scientific concepts behind stem cells. All had also seen a play, performed by the Y Touring Theatre Company, illustrating the personal dilemmas faced by those who are desperate for treatments that such research may one day provide. In the storyline, a mother with Huntington's disease discovers that her adult son has inherited her incurable condition. When the son and his partner seek IVF treatment in order to select a child free of the disease, they eventually choose to donate the spare embryos for medical research, despite some ethical reservations. “We create scripts that engage young people, so they empathize with the issues the characters face,” explained Y Touring's executive director, Nigel Townsend. While many students believed that the couple in the play had made the right choice, a minority disagreed, proving that education doesn't always bring the expected results. “Many scientists believe that, if only you inform people, they will make the decision you want them to make. That's not always true,” he said. One student accused a panelist, Sophie Petit-Zeman from the Association of Medical Research Charities, of arrogance for casually describing an embryo as a “bundle of cells.” Another argued that what begins as medical research could one day end in designer babies or cloning. “I think in a way it's really immoral,” she argued. At times, the debate became more uncomfortable. “For me, life is precious. Your life is precious,” Calum MacKellar, director of the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics, told the crowd. “There were laws in the past that said black people were not persons . . . Where do you draw the line? If we start drawing lines, where do we stop?” Comments like this only served to annoy some of the scientists on the panel, who felt that many of the arguments against stem cell research were based on little more than religious objections. Lewis Wolpert, in particular, found himself vehemently repeating his belief that an embryo is not equivalent to a human life. There was, however, some consensus, even among those arguing against creating purpose-made embryos for stem cell research, that scientists should be able to use embryos left over from IVF treatments because these would ultimately be destroyed anyway. But for Josephine Quintavalle, even this went too far: “Stop creating the excess,” she complained, calling for IVF practitioners to limit the need for as many fertilized eggs. Mark Lythgoe, a science communicator and director of the Centre of Advanced Biomedical Imaging at University College London, who chaired the debate, ended by asking the audience whether they would support stem cell research if a close family member were dying of a disease that could one day be helped by it. Most hands were raised. Finally came the crucial question, displayed on the screens above the hall: should 14-day-old embryos created in laboratory test tubes be used as a source of stem cells for research into disease? The crowd was abuzz as last-minute decisions were made: 163 agreed and 112 disagreed, with a remaining 33 “don't knows.” The result surprised Lythgoe, who expected more children to come out in favor of the research. “We're not designed to easily change, especially religious beliefs,” he explained backstage. On the plus side, he added, there were fewer undecided people than there had been at the start of the day. “It's very easy to get complacent as scientists. There is not much value placed on public engagement in the university system. In fact you are discouraged from it because you are expected to spend your time getting papers published. When you get the chance to ask the public, then you see that people do have concerns, which makes events like this incredibly important.” The fact that much stem cell research is publicly funded means that there is greater onus on scientists to explain their work. In 2008 a UK academic funding agency, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), collated data on public attitudes. It found that 79% of a representative sample was either not at all or not very familiar with stem sell research. After the group attended a workshop about the science and ethics, 88% agreed that surplus embryonic stem cells from IVF treatment should be used for research. According to Patrick Middleton, head of public engagement at the BBSRC, this proves that dialogue between scientists and the public pays off. “The vast majority of the work that we've done around this has found that the public backs stem cell research. If they think that scientists are sincere and that their work is addressing serious problems, there is overwhelming support,” he explained. “Better science education and engagement with the public around science is so important,” added Shirley Malcolm, head of the Education and Human Resources directorate at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “An individual may still not agree with the idea of stem cell research on moral or ethical grounds, but at least they do so with a better understanding both of what it is and what it is not.” Indeed, the perceived need for greater public engagement is spreading across the world. In December 2008, science communicators from 15 countries gathered in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to present examples of best practice. Among the most successful projects discussed at the conference was the Café Scientifique (of which there are already 250 in 40 countries across the world), where scientists can informally explain their work, especially on controversial issues such as stem cells. This model is now being expanded to Malawi, Ghana, and Uganda. In London's Royal Albert hall, students taking part in the debate were certainly grateful for their opportunity to meet the experts. “Scientists don't talk to us enough. They seem to be frustrated at the public,” explained 15-year-old Raeesa Dar from Brentside High School, who ended up voting for the motion. “Things like this are great because we finally have a chance to talk to them and voice our opinions.”Lewis Wolpert addresses the audience, with Josephine Quintavalle and Calum MacKellar watching in the background.
