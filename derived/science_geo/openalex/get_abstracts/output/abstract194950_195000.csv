https://openalex.org/W2020444744,"PARTITION chromatography in the vapour phase has been developed as a valuable technique for analysis of mixtures of hydrocarbons or other volatile materials1,2. Two detectors have been proposed for use with mixtures of chemically inactive substances, namely, the vapour-density bridge1 and the thermal conductivity cell2. The application of an infra-red carbon dioxide detector to this problem has also been demonstrated recently. The vapour-density bridge has excellent sensitivity, but is difficult to manufacture, whereas the thermal conductivity cell is relatively simple in construction but is somewhat less sensitive. A detector has now been developed that has a high sensitivity and is readily made in any workshop. It also has other advantages over the other types of detector in use."

However, recent work in this laboratory has shown that there occur also trace amounts (up to 1.0 per cent) of saturated fatty acids in the form of odd-numbered iso-acids and ante-iso-acids1, even-numbered iso-acids2, polybranched acids3 and odd-numbered straight-chain acids4. Odd-numbered straight-chain unsaturated acids, however, have not hitherto been found in natural fats."

https://openalex.org/W2057505619,"WE have observed that carbon tetrachloride produces striking effects on Allium cepa, Allium sativum and Zaphranthus sp. root tips. Root tips were treated for five minutes to a half-hour in carbon tetrachloride and later transferred to normal nutrient medium and fixed at various intervals from half an hour to six hours. Among the prominent changes taking place in the resting nucleus is a dissolution of the nuclear membrane and an outflow of its contents. Similar observations have been made in root tips of Allium cepa treated with chloroform1 and potassium cyanide2. It would appear that the lipoid layer of the nuclear membrane is either dissolved or rendered weak by the chemicals, in consequence of which the nuclear contents flow out. After treatment for 15 min. with carbon tetrachloride, resting and premitotic nuclei break up. A number of chemicals are known to produce this effect, for example, urethane3 and nitrogen mustard4. Perhaps the most characteristic changes brought about by carbon tetrachloride are dissolution of chromatin in the resting nucleus and disorganization of the chromosome arms in the premitotic stages, resulting in their progressively negative reaction to the Feulgen reagent."

The determination of œstrogen activity in the excreta is limited by the fact that these hormones are eliminated from the body in biologically active and inactive forms, thus necessitating chemical methods of measurement. The present work, consisting of two experiments, was carried out to ascertain the level and the rate at which urinary œstrogens are excreted in the buffalo and their chemical form."
