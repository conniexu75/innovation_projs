https://openalex.org/W4280598116,"Molecular characterization of cell types using single-cell transcriptome sequencing is revolutionizing cell biology and enabling new insights into the physiology of human organs. We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Using multiple tissues from a single donor enabled identification of the clonal distribution of T cells between tissues, identification of the tissue-specific mutation rate in B cells, and analysis of the cell cycle state and proliferative potential of shared cell types across tissues. Cell type–specific RNA splicing was discovered and analyzed across tissues within an individual."
https://openalex.org/W4280596398,"Despite their crucial role in health and disease, our knowledge of immune cells within human tissues remains limited. We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of ~360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W4280633014,"Understanding gene function and regulation in homeostasis and disease requires knowledge of the cellular and tissue contexts in which genes are expressed. Here, we applied four single-nucleus RNA sequencing methods to eight diverse, archived, frozen tissue types from 16 donors and 25 samples, generating a cross-tissue atlas of 209,126 nuclei profiles, which we integrated across tissues, donors, and laboratory methods with a conditional variational autoencoder. Using the resulting cross-tissue atlas, we highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident cell populations; identify cell types that might contribute to neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of monogenic diseases and the biological processes involved in their pathology; and determine cell types and gene modules that might underlie disease mechanisms for complex traits analyzed by genome-wide association studies."
https://openalex.org/W4280510206,"The 15 January 2022 climactic eruption of Hunga volcano, Tonga, produced an explosion in the atmosphere of a size that has not been documented in the modern geophysical record. The event generated a broad range of atmospheric waves observed globally by various ground-based and spaceborne instrumentation networks. Most prominent was the surface-guided Lamb wave (≲0.01 hertz), which we observed propagating for four (plus three antipodal) passages around Earth over 6 days. As measured by the Lamb wave amplitudes, the climactic Hunga explosion was comparable in size to that of the 1883 Krakatau eruption. The Hunga eruption produced remarkable globally detected infrasound (0.01 to 20 hertz), long-range (~10,000 kilometers) audible sound, and ionospheric perturbations. Seismometers worldwide recorded pure seismic and air-to-ground coupled waves. Air-to-sea coupling likely contributed to fast-arriving tsunamis. Here, we highlight exceptional observations of the atmospheric waves."
https://openalex.org/W4280578638,"Single-cell genomics studies have decoded the immune cell composition of several human prenatal organs but were limited in describing the developing immune system as a distributed network across tissues. We profiled nine prenatal tissues combining single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen-receptor sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics to reconstruct the developing human immune system. This revealed the late acquisition of immune-effector functions by myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets and the maturation of monocytes and T cells before peripheral tissue seeding. Moreover, we uncovered system-wide blood and immune cell development beyond primary hematopoietic organs, characterized human prenatal B1 cells, and shed light on the origin of unconventional T cells. Our atlas provides both valuable data resources and biological insights that will facilitate cell engineering, regenerative medicine, and disease understanding."
https://openalex.org/W4280592757,"Tidal wetlands are expected to respond dynamically to global environmental change, but the extent to which wetland losses have been offset by gains remains poorly understood. We developed a global analysis of satellite data to simultaneously monitor change in three highly interconnected intertidal ecosystem types-tidal flats, tidal marshes, and mangroves-from 1999 to 2019. Globally, 13,700 square kilometers of tidal wetlands have been lost, but these have been substantially offset by gains of 9700 km2, leading to a net change of -4000 km2 over two decades. We found that 27% of these losses and gains were associated with direct human activities such as conversion to agriculture and restoration of lost wetlands. All other changes were attributed to indirect drivers, including the effects of coastal processes and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4280493460,"Challenges in fabricating all-perovskite tandem solar cells as modules rather than as single-junction configurations include growing high-quality wide-bandgap perovskites and mitigating irreversible degradation caused by halide and metal interdiffusion at the interconnecting contacts. We demonstrate efficient all-perovskite tandem solar modules using scalable fabrication techniques. By systematically tuning the cesium ratio of a methylammonium-free 1.8-electron volt mixed-halide perovskite, we improve the homogeneity of crystallization for blade-coated films over large areas. An electrically conductive conformal ""diffusion barrier"" is introduced between interconnecting subcells to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of all-perovskite tandem solar modules. Our tandem modules achieve a certified PCE of 21.7% with an aperture area of 20 square centimeters and retain 75% of their initial efficiency after 500 hours of continuous operation under simulated 1-sun illumination."
https://openalex.org/W4280577455,"On 15 January 2022, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted, producing tsunamis worldwide including first waves which arrived more than 2 hours earlier than what is expected for conventional tsunamis. We investigated the generation and propagation mechanisms of the tsunami ""forerunner,"" and our simulation found that fast-moving atmospheric Lamb waves drove the leading sea height rise whereas the scattering of the leading waves related to bathymetric variations in the Pacific Ocean produced subsequent long-lasting tsunamis. Tsunamis arriving later than the conventionally expected travel time are composed of various waves generated from both moving and static sources, which makes the tsunami, due to this eruption, much more complex and longer-lasting than ordinary earthquake-induced tsunamis."
https://openalex.org/W4280585773,"Uncertainties surrounding tree carbon allocation to growth are a major limitation to projections of forest carbon sequestration and response to climate change. The prevalence and extent to which carbon assimilation (source) or cambial activity (sink) mediate wood production are fundamentally important and remain elusive. We quantified source-sink relations across biomes by combining eddy-covariance gross primary production with extensive on-site and regional tree ring observations. We found widespread temporal decoupling between carbon assimilation and tree growth, underpinned by contrasting climatic sensitivities of these two processes. Substantial differences in assimilation-growth decoupling between angiosperms and gymnosperms were determined, as well as stronger decoupling with canopy closure, aridity, and decreasing temperatures. Our results reveal pervasive sink control over tree growth that is likely to be increasingly prominent under global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4280589720,"Ultrafast water permeation in aquaporins is promoted by their hydrophobic interior surface. Polytetrafluoroethylene has a dense fluorine surface, leading to its strong water repellence. We report a series of fluorous oligoamide nanorings with interior diameters ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 nanometers. These nanorings undergo supramolecular polymerization in phospholipid bilayer membranes to form fluorous nanochannels, the interior walls of which are densely covered with fluorine atoms. The nanochannel with the smallest diameter exhibits a water permeation flux that is two orders of magnitude greater than those of aquaporins and carbon nanotubes. The proposed nanochannel exhibits negligible chloride ion (Cl-) permeability caused by a powerful electrostatic barrier provided by the electrostatically negative fluorous interior surface. Thus, this nanochannel is expected to show nearly perfect salt reflectance for desalination."
https://openalex.org/W3175979234,"The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class describes the coarse-grained behavior of a wealth of classical stochastic models. Surprisingly, KPZ universality was recently conjectured to also describe spin transport in the one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We tested this conjecture by experimentally probing transport in a cold-atom quantum simulator via the relaxation of domain walls in spin chains of up to 50 spins. We found that domain-wall relaxation is indeed governed by the KPZ dynamical exponent z = 3/2 and that the occurrence of KPZ scaling requires both integrability and a nonabelian SU(2) symmetry. Finally, we leveraged the single-spin-sensitive detection enabled by the quantum gas microscope to measure an observable based on spin-transport statistics. Our results yield a clear signature of the nonlinearity that is a hallmark of KPZ universality."
https://openalex.org/W3173517617,"Identifying universal properties of nonequilibrium quantum states is a major challenge in modern physics. A fascinating prediction is that classical hydrodynamics emerges universally in the evolution of any interacting quantum system. We experimentally probed the quantum dynamics of 51 individually controlled ions, realizing a long-range interacting spin chain. By measuring space-time-resolved correlation functions in an infinite temperature state, we observed a whole family of hydrodynamic universality classes, ranging from normal diffusion to anomalous superdiffusion, that are described by Lévy flights. We extracted the transport coefficients of the hydrodynamic theory, reflecting the microscopic properties of the system. Our observations demonstrate the potential for engineered quantum systems to provide key insights into universal properties of nonequilibrium states of quantum matter."
https://openalex.org/W4280603872,"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with the consolidation of emotional memories. Yet, the underlying neocortical circuits and synaptic mechanisms remain unclear. We found that REM sleep is associated with a somatodendritic decoupling in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex. This decoupling reflects a shift of inhibitory balance between parvalbumin neuron-mediated somatic inhibition and vasoactive intestinal peptide-mediated dendritic disinhibition, mostly driven by neurons from the central medial thalamus. REM-specific optogenetic suppression of dendritic activity led to a loss of danger-versus-safety discrimination during associative learning and a lack of synaptic plasticity, whereas optogenetic release of somatic inhibition resulted in enhanced discrimination and synaptic potentiation. Somatodendritic decoupling during REM sleep promotes opposite synaptic plasticity mechanisms that optimize emotional responses to future behavioral stressors."
https://openalex.org/W4280523393,"Continuous advancement in nonvolatile and morphotropic beyond-Moore electronic devices requires integration of ferroelectric and semiconductor materials. The emergence of hafnium oxide (HfO2)-based ferroelectrics that are compatible with atomic-layer deposition has opened interesting and promising avenues of research. However, the origins of ferroelectricity and pathways to controlling it in HfO2 are still mysterious. We demonstrate that local helium (He) implantation can activate ferroelectricity in these materials. The possible competing mechanisms, including He ion-induced molar volume changes, vacancy redistribution, vacancy generation, and activation of vacancy mobility, are analyzed. These findings both reveal the origins of ferroelectricity in this system and open pathways for nanoengineered binary ferroelectrics."
https://openalex.org/W4280495200,"Topological insulators constitute a newly characterized state of matter that contains scatter-free edge states surrounding an insulating bulk. Conventional wisdom regards the insulating bulk as essential, because the invariants that describe the topological properties of the system are defined therein. Here, we study fractal topological insulators based on exact fractals composed exclusively of edge sites. We present experimental proof that, despite the lack of bulk bands, photonic lattices of helical waveguides support topologically protected chiral edge states. We show that light transport in our topological fractal system features increased velocities compared with the corresponding honeycomb lattice. By going beyond the confines of the bulk-boundary correspondence, our findings pave the way toward an expanded perception of topological insulators and open a new chapter of topological fractals."
https://openalex.org/W4280534378,"Transcriptional recording by CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA endows engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic memory, which through Record-seq reveals transcriptome-scale records. Microbial sentinels that traverse the gastrointestinal tract capture a wide range of genes and pathways that describe interactions with the host, including quantitative shifts in the molecular environment that result from alterations in the host diet, induced inflammation, and microbiome complexity. We demonstrate multiplexed recording using barcoded CRISPR arrays, enabling the reconstruction of transcriptional histories of isogenic bacterial strains in vivo. Record-seq therefore provides a scalable, noninvasive platform for interrogating intestinal and microbial physiology throughout the length of the intestine without manipulations to host physiology and can determine how single microbial genetic differences alter the way in which the microbe adapts to the host intestinal environment."
https://openalex.org/W4280558062,"Aging is associated with increased prevalence of axonal injuries characterized by poor regeneration and disability. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In our experiments, RNA sequencing of sciatic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) revealed significant aging-dependent enrichment in T cell signaling both before and after sciatic nerve injury (SNI) in mice. Lymphotoxin activated the transcription factor NF-κB, which induced expression of the chemokine CXCL13 by neurons. This in turn recruited CXCR5+CD8+ T cells to injured DRG neurons overexpressing major histocompatibility complex class I. CD8+ T cells repressed the axonal regeneration of DRG neurons via caspase 3 activation. CXCL13 neutralization prevented CXCR5+CD8+ T cell recruitment to the DRG and reversed aging-dependent regenerative decline, thereby promoting neurological recovery after SNI. Thus, axonal regeneration can be facilitated by antagonizing cross-talk between immune cells and neurons."
https://openalex.org/W4225426824,"Bright quasars, powered by accretion onto billion-solar-mass black holes, already existed at the epoch of reionization, when the Universe was 0.5-1 billion years old1. How these black holes formed in such a short time is the subject of debate, particularly as they lie above the correlation between black-hole mass and galaxy dynamical mass2,3 in the local Universe. What slowed down black-hole growth, leading towards the symbiotic growth observed in the local Universe, and when this process started, has hitherto not been known, although black-hole feedback is a likely driver4. Here we report optical and near-infrared observations of a sample of quasars at redshifts 5.8 ≲ z ≲ 6.6. About half of the quasar spectra reveal broad, blueshifted absorption line troughs, tracing black-hole-driven winds with extreme outflow velocities, up to 17% of the speed of light. The fraction of quasars with such outflow winds at z ≳ 5.8 is ≈2.4 times higher than at z ≈ 2-4. We infer that outflows at z ≳ 5.8 inject large amounts of energy into the interstellar medium and suppress nuclear gas accretion, slowing down black-hole growth. The outflow phase may then mark the beginning of substantial black-hole feedback. The red optical colours of outflow quasars at z ≳ 5.8 indeed suggest that these systems are dusty and may be caught during an initial quenching phase of obscured accretion5."
https://openalex.org/W4280506327,"WNT signalling has multiple roles. It maintains pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, assigns posterior identity in the epiblast and induces mesodermal tissue. Here we provide evidence that these distinct functions are conducted by the transcription factor SOX2, which adopts different modes of chromatin interaction and regulatory element selection depending on its level of expression. At high levels, SOX2 displaces nucleosomes from regulatory elements with high-affinity SOX2 binding sites, recruiting the WNT effector TCF/β-catenin and maintaining pluripotent gene expression. Reducing SOX2 levels destabilizes pluripotency and reconfigures SOX2/TCF/β-catenin occupancy to caudal epiblast expressed genes. These contain low-affinity SOX2 sites and are co-occupied by T/Bra and CDX. The loss of SOX2 allows WNT-induced mesodermal differentiation. These findings define a role for Sox2 levels in dictating the chromatin occupancy of TCF/β-catenin and reveal how context-specific responses to a signal are configured by the level of a transcription factor."

https://openalex.org/W4280495321,"Colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis. Colorectal CSCs reside within specialized niches and harbor self-renewal and differentiation capacities. However, the niche regulations of CSCs remain unclear. Here, we show that intestinal nerve cells are required for CSC self-renewal and colorectal tumorigenesis. Enteric serotonergic neurons produce 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) to function as a modulator of CSC self-renewal. 5-HT receptors HTR1B/1D/1F are highly expressed in colorectal CSCs and engage with 5-HT to initiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, colorectal cancer (CRC)-enriched microbiota metabolite isovalerate suppresses the enrichment of the NuRD complex onto Tph2 promoter to initiate Tph2 expression, leading to 5-HT production. 5-HT signaling is correlated with CRC severity. Blocking 5-HT signaling in mice not only inhibits the self-renewal of colorectal CSCs but also displays therapeutic efficacy against CRC tumors. Our findings reveal a cross talk between intestinal neurons and tumor cells that serves as an additional layer for CSC regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4280624259,"Substituted six-membered cyclic hydrocarbons are common constituents of biologically active compounds. Although methods for the synthesis of thermodynamically favored, disubstituted cyclohexanes are well established, a reliable and modular protocol for the synthesis of their stereoisomers is still elusive. Herein, we report a general strategy for the modular synthesis of disubstituted cyclohexanes with excellent kinetic stereocontrol from readily accessible substituted methylenecyclohexanes by the implementation of chain-walking catalysis. Mechanistically, the initial introduction of a sterically demanding boron ester group adjacent to the cyclohexane is key to guiding the stereochemical outcome. The synthetic potential of this methodology has been highlighted in late-stage modification of complex bioactive molecules and in comparison with current cross-coupling techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4280594082,"Abstract Heart regeneration is an unmet clinical need, hampered by limited renewal of adult cardiomyocytes and fibrotic scarring. Pluripotent stem cell-based strategies are emerging, but unravelling cellular dynamics of host–graft crosstalk remains elusive. Here, by combining lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics in injured non-human primate heart biomimics, we uncover the coordinated action modes of human progenitor-mediated muscle repair. Chemoattraction via CXCL12/CXCR4 directs cellular migration to injury sites. Activated fibroblast repulsion targets fibrosis by SLIT2/ROBO1 guidance in organizing cytoskeletal dynamics. Ultimately, differentiation and electromechanical integration lead to functional restoration of damaged heart muscle. In vivo transplantation into acutely and chronically injured porcine hearts illustrated CXCR4-dependent homing, de novo formation of heart muscle, scar-volume reduction and prevention of heart failure progression. Concurrent endothelial differentiation contributed to graft neovascularization. Our study demonstrates that inherent developmental programmes within cardiac progenitors are sequentially activated in disease, enabling the cells to sense and counteract acute and chronic injury."
https://openalex.org/W4280493598,"COVID-19 vaccination rates are lower among historically marginalized populations, including Black/African American and Latinx populations, threatening to contribute to already high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality disparities for these groups. We conducted a community-based participatory research study using qualitative methods to explore knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccination among Black/African American, Latinx, and Chinese American residents of the San Francisco Bay Area and assess their views on vaccination outreach and delivery strategies.Data were collected from January 14, 2021, to February 24, 2021, with adult residents (N = 109 [Female: N = 76; 70%]) in San Francisco. Focus groups (N = 10) and in-depth interviews (N = 25) were conducted among Black/African Americans (N = 35), Latinx (N = 40), and Chinese Americans (n = 34) in English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. Themes were identified using grounded field theory, and included misinformation, mistrust of government and health institutions, and linguistic and other barriers to vaccine access. All three racial/ethnic groups had experiences with vaccine misinformation and information overload. Many African American and Latinx participants cited structural and interpersonal racism, and anti-immigrant discrimination, as factors reducing their trust in government and public health disseminated information and their willingness to be vaccinated. Participants expressed trust in community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations and community-run clinics. Participants often experienced barriers to vaccine access, such as transportation to drive-in sites, with Latinx and Chinese American groups also frequently citing language barriers.Vaccine outreach strategies must acknowledge how longstanding systemic, institutional, and structural racism contributes to mistrust in government and health institutions and engage with and support trusted messengers from the community to eliminate cultural, linguistic, and other barriers to vaccine access."
https://openalex.org/W4280527604,"A hallmark of meiosis is chromosomal pairing, which requires telomere tethering and rotation on the nuclear envelope through microtubules, driving chromosome homology searches. Telomere pulling toward the centrosome forms the ""zygotene chromosomal bouquet."" Here, we identified the ""zygotene cilium"" in oocytes. This cilium provides a cable system for the bouquet machinery and extends throughout the germline cyst. Using zebrafish mutants and live manipulations, we demonstrate that the cilium anchors the centrosome to counterbalance telomere pulling. The cilium is essential for bouquet and synaptonemal complex formation, oogenesis, ovarian development, and fertility. Thus, a cilium represents a conserved player in zebrafish and mouse meiosis, which sheds light on reproductive aspects in ciliopathies and suggests that cilia can control chromosomal dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4280553498,"The diversification of cell adhesion molecules by alternative splicing is proposed to underlie molecular codes for neuronal wiring. Transcriptomic approaches mapped detailed cell-type-specific mRNA splicing programs. However, it has been hard to probe the synapse-specific localization and function of the resulting protein splice isoforms, or ""proteoforms,"" in vivo. We here apply a proteoform-centric workflow in mice to test the synapse-specific functions of the splice isoforms of the synaptic adhesion molecule Neurexin-3 (NRXN3). We uncover a major proteoform, NRXN3 AS5, that is highly expressed in GABAergic interneurons and at dendrite-targeting GABAergic terminals. NRXN3 AS5 abundance significantly diverges from Nrxn3 mRNA distribution and is gated by translation-repressive elements. Nrxn3 AS5 isoform deletion results in a selective impairment of dendrite-targeting interneuron synapses in the dentate gyrus without affecting somatic inhibition or glutamatergic perforant-path synapses. This work establishes cell- and synapse-specific functions of a specific neurexin proteoform and highlights the importance of alternative splicing regulation for synapse specification."
https://openalex.org/W4280603249,"The contribution of the epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart, to cardiac regeneration has remained controversial due to a lack of suitable analytical tools. By combining genetic marker-independent lineage-tracing strategies with transcriptional profiling and loss-of-function methods, we report here that the epicardium of the highly regenerative salamander species Pleurodeles waltl has an intrinsic capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Following cryoinjury, CLDN6+ epicardium-derived cells appear at the lesion site, organize into honeycomb-like structures connected via focal tight junctions and undergo transcriptional reprogramming that results in concomitant differentiation into de novo cardiomyocytes. Ablation of CLDN6+ differentiation intermediates as well as disruption of their tight junctions impairs cardiac regeneration. Salamanders constitute the evolutionarily closest species to mammals with an extensive ability to regenerate heart muscle and our results highlight the epicardium and tight junctions as key targets in efforts to promote cardiac regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4280533999,"Proteoglycans are heterogeneous macromolecular glycoconjugates that orchestrate many important cellular processes. While much attention has focused on the poly-sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains that decorate proteoglycans, other important elements of their architecture, such as core proteins and membrane localization, have garnered less emphasis. Hence, comprehensive structure-function relationships that consider the replete proteoglycan architecture as glycoconjugates are limited. Here we present an extensive approach to study proteoglycan structure and biology by fabricating defined semisynthetic modular proteoglycans that can be tailored for cell surface display. The expression of proteoglycan core proteins with unnatural amino acids permits bioorthogonal click chemistry with functionalized glycosaminoglycans for methodical dissection of the parameters required for optimal binding and function of various proteoglycan-binding proteins. We demonstrate that these sophisticated materials can recapitulate the functions of native proteoglycan ectodomains in mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and cancer cell spreading while permitting the analysis of the contributing architectural elements toward function."
https://openalex.org/W4280581276,"Given the increasing prevalence of lung cancer worldwide, an auxiliary diagnostic method is needed alongside the microscopic examination of biopsy samples, which is dependent on the skills and experience of pathologists. Thus, this study aimed to advance lung cancer diagnosis by developing five (5) artificial neural network (NN) models that can discriminate malignant from benign samples based on infrared spectral data of lung tumors ( n = 122; 56 malignant, 66 benign). NNs were benchmarked with classical machine learning (CML) models. Stratified 10-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate the NN models, and the performance metrics—area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC) positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), specificity rate (SR), and recall rate (RR)—were averaged for comparison. All NNs were able to outperform the CML models, however, support vector machine is relatively comparable to NNs. Among the NNs, CNN performed best with an AUC of 92.28% ± 7.36%, ACC of 98.45% ± 1.72%, PPV of 96.62% ± 2.30%, NPV of 90.50% ± 11.92%, SR of 96.01% ± 3.09%, and RR of 89.21% ± 12.93%. In conclusion, NNs can be potentially used as a computational tool in lung cancer diagnosis based on infrared spectroscopy of lung tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4280620074,"Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are the leading causes of death among adults worldwide. It is projected that half of the NCDs could be avoided by preventing measures. Under the prospective epidemiological research studies in Iran (PERSIAN), we established a prospective population-based cohort study in southern Iran. The present study was designed to observe changing pattern of lifestyle transition over time and investigate the incidence and prevalence of regional modifiable risk factors as well as their associations with major NCDs. At baseline, 4063 participants aged 35-70 years were recruited on Oct, 2016and planned to get re-evaluated every 5 years along with annual follow-up. Data using validated electronic questionnaire comprising 55 questions and 482 items including general, medical and nutrition queries was collected. Blood, hair, nails, urine specimens and anthropometric measurements were taken. The response rate was 99%. In the results; male and female participants were 42.5% and 57.5%, respectively. Of note, 30.4% of women and 16.1% of men were obese. The prevalence of hypertension in men and women was 14.6% and 21%; however, diabetic men and women were 17.4% and 12.4%, respectively. Living in rural areas increased the odds of having hypertension by 1.33 (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI:1-09, 1.61). Noteworthy, logistic regression displayed that aging could predispose individuals to be more overweight, hypertensive and diabetic. The prevalence of multimorbidity of 3 or more NCDs were 8% (No. 326) and 6% (No.240), respectively. Intake of fruits, vegetables and dairy was less than two servings per day in 9.2%, 13% and 58.3% of the participants. Lower cardiovascular diseases and serum level of FBS and higher HDL level in sailors/fishermen compared to other job groups were significant (p-value <0.001). The second annual follow-up was completed and now at the end of the third wave. Findings of the present study signified the high prevalence of behavioral risk factors and their associations with respective NCDs. Subsequently, it is essential to keep track lifestyle variations, the modifiable risk factors and NCDs trends by prospective population-based cohort studies."
https://openalex.org/W4280644441,"Personal protective measures such use of face masks, hand washing and physical distancing have proven to be effective in controlling the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, adherence to these measures may have been relaxed over time. The objective of this work is to assess the change in adherence to these measures and to find factors that explain the change For this purpose, we conducted a survey in the Metropolitan Region of Chile in which we asked the adherence to these measures in August-September 2021 and retrospectively for 2020. With the answers obtained we fit a logistic regression model in which the response variable is the relaxation of each of the self-care preventive actions. The explanatory variables used are socio-demographic characteristics such as the age, sex, income, and vaccination status of the respondents. The results obtained show that there has been a significant decrease in adherence to the three personal protection measures in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. In addition, it was observed that younger people are more likely to relax these measures. The results show the importance of generating new incentives for maintaining adherence to personal protection measures."
https://openalex.org/W4280504870,"Background Globally, intimate partner violence (IPV) epitomizes a greater proportion of the violence experienced by women, with more than a third of women (41.3%) in sub-Saharan Africa reporting IPV during their lifetime. This study examined the association between exposure to IPV and the nutritional status of women and their children in Nigeria. Methods The study analyzed secondary data obtained from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. Data on women’s lifetime experience of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV, as well as demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, were collected. We used regression models to determine the association between exposure to IPV and women and child nutrition indicators. A weighted sample of 4,391 women aged 15–49 years and 2,145 children 6–59 months were analyzed. Results The lifetime experience of IPV in the study was 35.31% (95% CI: 33.35, 37.33), 30.43% (95% CI: 28.54, 32.38) experienced psychological IPV, 19.43% (95% CI: 17.79, 21.19) experienced physical IPV, and 6.03% (95% CI: 5.12, 7.09) experienced sexual IPV. After adjusting for a range of characteristics, maternal lifetime exposure to IPV was associated with underweight (ARRR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.91) and overweight/obesity (ARRR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.58). We also found that, children whose mothers experienced IPV were less likely to be underweight compared to their counterparts (ARRR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.96). Conclusions Overall, IPV against women, particularly psychological, physical, and sexual IPV, is common in Nigeria and has an association with the nutritional status of affected women and their children. According to the study, women with a lifetime experience of IPV were more likely to be overweight. On the other hand, affected women’s children were less likely to be underweight. A far-reaching effort is required to curb IPV against women, particularly policies, programs, and laws are needed to protect women and children from the unfavourable effects of IPV to reduce the prevalence and impact of such violence."
https://openalex.org/W4280543101,"We determined the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Jakarta and neighboring areas, Indonesia from March 2020 to February 2021, based on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens that were tested at the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jakarta. NP/OP swab specimens were collected from COVID-19 suspects or individuals in contact tracing programs from primary healthcare centers (PHC) and hospitals. The specimens were screened for the SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. Demography data and clinical symptoms were collected using national standardized laboratory form. Of 64,364 specimens, 10,130 (15.7%) were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, with the peak prevalence of infection in March 2020 (26.3%) follow by in January 2021 (23.9%) and February 2021 (21.8%). We found that the positivity rate of the specimens from Jakarta, West Java, and Banten was 16.3%, 13.3%, and 16.8%, respectively. Positivity rate was higher in specimens from hospitals (16.9%) than PHC (9.4%). Of the positive specimens, 29.6% were from individuals aged >60 years old, followed by individuals aged 41-60 years old (24.2%). Among symptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and a combination of both cough & fever. In conclusion, this study illustrates the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics from one COVID-19 diagnostic center in Jakarta and neighbouring areas in Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W4280559854,"Insects have evolved sophisticated reflexes to right themselves in mid-air. Their recovery mechanisms involve complex interactions among the physical senses, muscles, body, and wings, and they must obey the laws of flight. We sought to understand the key mechanisms involved in dragonfly righting reflexes and to develop physics-based models for understanding the control strategies of flight maneuvers. Using kinematic analyses, physical modeling, and three-dimensional flight simulations, we found that a dragonfly uses left-right wing pitch asymmetry to roll its body 180 degrees to recover from falling upside down in ~200 milliseconds. Experiments of dragonflies with blocked vision further revealed that this rolling maneuver is initiated by their ocelli and compound eyes. These results suggest a pathway from the dragonfly's visual system to the muscles regulating wing pitch that underly the recovery. The methods developed here offer quantitative tools for inferring insects' internal actions from their acrobatics, and are applicable to a broad class of natural and robotic flying systems."
https://openalex.org/W4280628299,"A brushless double-fed induction generator (BDFIG) has shown tremendous success in wind turbines due to its robust brushless design, smooth operation, and variable speed characteristics. However, the research regarding controlling of machine during low voltage ride through (LVRT) need greater attention as it may cause total disconnection of machine. In addition, the BDFIG based wind turbines must be capable of providing controlled amount of reactive power to the grid as per modern grid code requirements. Also, a suitable dynamic response of machine during both normal and fault conditions needs to be ensured. This paper, as such, attempts to provide reactive power to the grid by analytically calculating the decaying flux and developing a rotor side converter control scheme accordingly. Furthermore, the dynamic response and LVRT capability of the BDFIG is enhanced by using one of the very intelligent optimization algorithms called the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). To prove the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, its performance is compared with that of the particle swan optimization (PSO) based controller in terms of limiting the fault current, regulating active and reactive power, and maintaining the stable operation of the power system under identical operating conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme significantly improves the dynamic response and LVRT capability of the developed BDFIG based wind energy conversion system; thus proves its essence and efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4280631750,"Background The flow of physiologic fluids through organs and organs systems is an integral component of their function. The complex fluid dynamics in many organ systems are still not completely understood, and in-vivo measurements of flow rates and pressure provide a testament to the complexity of each flow system. Variability in in-vivo measurements and the lack of control over flow characteristics leave a lot to be desired for testing and evaluation of current modes of treatments as well as future innovations. In-vitro models are particularly ideal for studying neurological conditions such as hydrocephalus due to their complex pathophysiology and interactions with therapeutic measures. The following aims to present the reciprocating positive displacement pump, capable of inducing pulsating flow of a defined volume at a controlled beat rate and amplitude. While the other fluidic applications of the pump are currently under investigation, this study was focused on simulating the pulsating cerebrospinal fluid production across profiles with varying parameters. Methods Pumps were manufactured using 3D printed and injection molded parts. The pumps were powered by an Arduino-based board and proprietary software that controls the linear motion of the pumps to achieve the specified output rate at the desired pulsation rate and amplitude. A range of 0.01 <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math> to 0.7 <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math> was tested to evaluate the versatility of the pumps. The accuracy and precision of the pumps’ output were evaluated by obtaining a total of 150 one-minute weight measurements of degassed deionized water per output rate across 15 pump channels. In addition, nine experiments were performed to evaluate the pumps’ control over pulsation rate and amplitude. Results Volumetric analysis of a total of 1200 readings determined that the pumps achieved the target output volume rate with a mean absolute error of -0.001034283 <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M3""><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math> across the specified domain. It was also determined that the pumps can maintain pulsatile flow at a user-specified beat rate and amplitude. Conclusion The validation of this reciprocating positive displacement pump system allows for the future validation of novel designs to components used to treat hydrocephalus and other physiologic models involving pulsatile flow. Based on the promising results of these experiments at simulating pulsatile CSF flow, a benchtop model of human CSF production and distribution could be achieved through the incorporation of a chamber system and a compliance component."
https://openalex.org/W4280530203,"Oil palm plantations are expanding in Latin America due to the global demand for food and biofuels, and much of this expansion has occurred at expense of important tropical ecosystems. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about effects on aquatic ecosystems near to oil palm-dominated landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI imagery and high-resolution images in Google Earth to map the current extent of oil palm plantations and determined prior land use land cover (LULC) in the Usumacinta River Basin as a case-study site. In addition, we assess the proximity of the crop with aquatic ecosystems distributed in the Usumacinta floodplains and their potential effects. Based on our findings, the most significant change was characterized by the expansion of oil palm crop areas mainly at expenses of regional rainforest and previously intervened lands (e.g. secondary vegetation and agriculture). Although aquatic ecosystem class (e.g. rivers, lagoons and channels) decreased in surface around 3% during the study period (2001-2017), the change was not due to the expansion of oil palm lands. However, we find that more than 50% of oil palm cultivations are near (between 500 and 3000 m) to aquatic ecosystems and this could have significant environmental impacts on sediment and water quality. Oil palm crops tend to spatially concentrate in the Upper Usumacinta ecoregion (Guatemala), which is recognized as an area of important fish endemism. We argue that the basic information generated in this study is essential to have better land use decision-making in a region that is relative newcomer to oil palm boom."
https://openalex.org/W4280495680,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, which harbors various accumulated genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. Histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is a pivotal epigenetic regulator whose focal amplification and upregulation are commonly detected in NSCLC. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-oncogenic function of SETDB1 remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that SETDB1 augments the migration and invasion capabilities of NSCLC cells by reinforcing invadopodia formation and mediated ECM degradation. At the molecular level, SETDB1 suppresses the expression of FOXA2, a crucial tumor and metastasis suppressor via coordinated epigenetic mechanisms - SETDB1 not only catalyzes histone H3K9 methylation on FOXA2 genomic locus, but also recruits DNMT3A to regulate DNA methylation on CpG island. Consequently, depletion of Setdb1 in murine lung adenocarcinoma cells completely abolished their full and spontaneous metastatic capabilities in mouse xenograft models. These findings together establish the pro-metastasis activity of SETDB1 in NSCLC and elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4280521256,"Pseudomonas syringae is a widely spread plant pathogen known to have ice-nucleating proteins that serve as crystallization sites promoting ice growth at near-zero temperatures. Three temperatures that characterize water freezing and ice melting are (i) the freezing point of water, (ii) the temperature of coexistence of ice and water, and (iii) the melting point of ice. Here we show the influence of different concentrations of P . syringae on these three parameters. P . syringae appears to affect both the freezing point of water and the temperature of the coexistence of ice and water. Additionally, we propose a research technique for studying the freezing/melting process that is simple and requires no complex equipment."
https://openalex.org/W4280521841,"Immunometabolism, which concerns the interplay between metabolism and the immune system, is increasingly recognized as a potential source of novel drug targets and biomarkers. In this context, the use of metabolomics to identify metabolic characteristics associated with specific functional immune response processes is of value. Currently, there is a lack of tools to determine known associations between metabolites and immune processes. Consequently, interpretation of metabolites in metabolomics studies in terms of their role in the immune system, or selection of the most relevant metabolite classes to include in metabolomics studies, is challenging. Here, we describe the Immunometabolic Atlas (IMA), a public web application and library of R functions to infer immune processes associated with specific metabolites and vice versa. The IMA derives metabolite-immune process associations utilizing a protein-metabolite network analysis algorithm that associates immune system-associated annotated proteins in Gene Ontology to metabolites. We evaluated IMA inferred metabolite-immune system associations using a text mining strategy, identifying substantial overlap, but also demonstrating a significant chemical space of immune system-associated metabolites that should be confirmed experimentally. Overall, the IMA facilitates the interpretation and design of immunometabolomics studies by the association of metabolites to specific immune processes."
https://openalex.org/W4280538155,"System biology relies on holistic biomolecule measurements, and untangling biochemical networks requires time-series metabolomics profiling. With current metabolomic approaches, time-series measurements can be taken for hundreds of metabolic features, which decode underlying metabolic regulation. Such a metabolomic dataset is untargeted with most features unannotated and inaccessible to statistical analysis and computational modeling. The high dimensionality of the metabolic space also causes mechanistic modeling to be rather cumbersome computationally. We implemented a faster exploratory workflow to visualize and extract chemical and biochemical dependencies. Time-series metabolic features (about 300 for each dataset) were extracted by Ridge Tracking-based Extract (RTExtract) on measurements from continuous in vivo monitoring of metabolism by NMR (CIVM-NMR) in Neurospora crassa under different conditions. The metabolic profiles were then smoothed and projected into lower dimensions, enabling a comparison of metabolic trends in the cultures. Next, we expanded incomplete metabolite annotation using a correlation network. Lastly, we uncovered meaningful metabolic clusters by estimating dependencies between smoothed metabolic profiles. We thus sidestepped the processes of time-consuming mechanistic modeling, difficult global optimization, and labor-intensive annotation. Multiple clusters guided insights into central energy metabolism and membrane synthesis. Dense connections with glucose 1-phosphate indicated its central position in metabolism in N. crassa. Our approach was benchmarked on simulated random network dynamics and provides a novel exploratory approach to analyzing high-dimensional metabolic dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4280540918,"1,8-Cineole is a naturally occurring compound found in essential oils of different plants and has well-known anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. In the present work, we aimed to investigate its potential antimalarial effect, using the following experimental models: (1) the erythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum ; (2) an adhesion assay using brain microvascular endothelial cells; and (3) an experimental cerebral malaria animal model induced by Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in susceptible mice. Using the erythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum , we characterized the schizonticidal effect of 1,8-cineole. This compound decreased parasitemia in a dose-dependent manner with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 1045.53 ± 63.30 μM. The inhibitory effect of 972 μM 1,8-cineole was irreversible and independent of parasitemia. Moreover, 1,8-cineole reduced the progression of intracellular development of the parasite over 2 cycles, inducing important morphological changes. Ultrastructure analysis revealed a massive loss of integrity of endomembranes and hemozoin crystals in infected erythrocytes treated with 1,8-cineole. The monoterpene reduced the adhesion index of infected erythrocytes to brain microvascular endothelial cells by 60%. Using the experimental cerebral malaria model, treatment of infected mice for 6 consecutive days with 100 mg/kg/day 1,8-cineole reduced cerebral edema with a 50% reduction in parasitemia. Our data suggest a potential antimalarial effect of 1,8-cineole with an impact on the parasite erythrocytic cycle and severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280544401,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been testing countries’ capacities and scientific preparedness to actively respond and collaborate on a common global threat. It has also heightened awareness of the urgent need to empirically describe and analyze health inequalities to be able to act effectively. In turn, this raises several important questions that need answering: What is known about the rapidly emerging COVID-19 inequalities research field? Which countries and world regions have been able to rapidly produce research on this topic? What research patterns and trends have emerged, and how to these compared to the (pre-COVID-19) global health inequalities research field? Which countries have been scientifically collaborating on this important topic? Where are the scientific knowledge gaps, and indirectly where might research capacities need to be strengthened? In order to answer these queries, we analyzed the global scientific production (2020–2021) on COVID-19 associated inequalities by conducting bibliometric and network analyses using the Scopus database. Specifically, we analyzed the volume of scientific production per country (via author affiliations), its distribution by country income groups and world regions, as well as the inter-country collaborations within this production. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 inequalities research field has been highly collaborative; however, a number of significant inequitable research practices exist. When compared to the (pre-COVID-19) global health inequalities research field, similar inequalities were identified, however, several new dynamics and partnerships have also emerged that warrant further in-depth exploration. To ensure preparedness for future crises, and effective strategies to tackle growing social inequalities in health, investment in global health inequalities research capacities must be a priority for all."
https://openalex.org/W4280547058,"Dynamic physical examination data can provide both cross-sectional and time-series characteristics of cardiovascular health. However, most physical examination databases containing health and disease information have not been fully utilized in China. Hence, this study aimed to analyze dynamic physical examination indicators for cardiovascular health to provide evidence for precise prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases in the primary prevention domain among healthy population with different demographic characteristics in Shanghai. Three-year continuous data were collected from the physical examination center of a hospital in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020, which included a total of 14,044 participants with an average age of 46.51±15.57 years. The cardiovascular status of overall healthy individuals may have a decreasing trend, which is manifested as a significant year-on-year decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; a significant year-on-year increase in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood glucose levels; and a possible increasing trend of diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and triglycerides. Healthy population with different sex and age groups have various sensitives to cardiovascular physical examination indicators. To conduct more accurate cardiovascular health management and health promotion for key populations in primary prevention, focusing on the dynamic trends of blood pressure, blood lipids, blood glucose, and body mass index in men and changes in total cholesterol in women over time is especially important. The age group of 50-69 years is key for better prevention and control of cardiovascular health."

https://openalex.org/W4280550243,"Introduction Beyond the provision of services, quality of care and patient safety measures such as optimal clinical handover at shift changes determine maternity outcomes. We aimed to establish the proportion of women handed over and the content of clinical handovers and communication between shifts within 3 diverse obstetrics units in Kerala, India, and to describe the handover environment. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted for six weeks during February and March 2015at three hospitals in Kerala, India, during nurses obstetric handover in one tertiary private, one tertiary government and one secondary government hospital. Nursing handovers in obstetric post-operative, in-patient and labour wards were sampled. An SBAR-based (situation, background, assessment and recommendation) data schedule was completed whilst observing handover at nursing shift changes. Since obstetricians had no scheduled handover, qualitative interviews were conducted with obstetricians in two hospitals to establish how they acquire information when beginning a shift. Results Data was obtained on 258 patients handed over, within 67 shift changes. The median percentage of women handed over was 100% in two of the hospitals and 27.6% in the other. The median number of information items included out of a possible 25 was 11, 5 and 4,and did not change significantly for women with high-risk status. Important items regarding assessment and recommendation for care were often missed, including high-risk status. The median number of environment items achieved was good at 7 out of 10 in all hospitals. Obstetricians sought information in various ways when required. All supported the development of structured tools, face-to-face and team handovers. Conclusions Maternity unit handovers for doctors and nurses were inadequate. Ensuring handover of all women and including critical information, between shifts as well as between doctors, needs to be improved to increase patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W4280554458,"From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for diagnostic and screening tests has exceeded supply. Although the proportion of vaccinated people has increased in wealthier countries, breakthrough infections have occurred amid the emergence of new variants. Pooled-sample COVID-19 testing using saliva has been proposed as an efficient, inexpensive, and non-invasive method to allow larger-scale testing, especially in a screening setting. In this study, we aimed to evaluate pooled RT-qPCR saliva testing and to compare the results with individual tests. Employees of Philips Japan, Ltd. were recruited to participate in COVID-19 screening from October to December 2020. Asymptomatic individuals (n = 824) submitted self-collected saliva samples. Samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in both 10-sample pools and individual tests. We also surveyed participants regarding their thoughts and behaviors after the PCR screening project. Two of the 824 individuals were positive by RT-qPCR. In the pooled testing, one of these two had no measurable Ct value, but showed an amplification trend at the end of the PCR cycle. Both positive individuals developed cold-like symptoms, but neither required hospitalization. Of the 824 participants, 471 responded to our online questionnaire. Overall, while respondents agreed that PCR screening should be performed regularly, the majority were willing to undergo PCR testing only when it was provided for free or at low cost. In conclusion, pooled testing of saliva samples can support frequent large-scale screening that is rapid, efficient, and inexpensive."
