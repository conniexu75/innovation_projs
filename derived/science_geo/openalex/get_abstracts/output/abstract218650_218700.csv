All animals that demonstrated stimulus-bound feeding behavior also showed high self-stimulation rates. As it was impossible to produce the feeding response without simultaneously producing the rewarding effect of hypothalamic stimulation, it was concluded that the feeding system of the lateral hypothalamus is one among a larger group of places where stimulation causes primary rewarding effects. With electrodes in these same areas, food deprivation often caused a major increment in the self-stimulation rate."

https://openalex.org/W2086426769,"Auditory potentials were recorded from bipolar electrodes chronically implanted in the cochlear nuclei of four cats. In a training box modified to reduce echoes these animals were exposed to clicks and tone pulses presented from an overhead speaker. Slight changes in the position of the animal in the resulting sound field produced marked changes in the potentials evoked from the cochlear nucleus. These phenomena were observed in the unanesthetized, unrestrained subjects as well as in those under Nembutal anesthesia. It is suggested that these acoustic effects complicate the analysis and interpretation of potentials evoked from the cochlear nucleus under conditions of habituation, shifts in attention, and learning."

https://openalex.org/W2049363959,"A slender refrigeration probe for the production of reversible discrete lesions within the central nervous system of man and experimental animals is described. Cooling, in the region of the third nerve nucleus in cats, produced pupillary dilatation which was quickly reversed when the temperature around the third nerve nucleus returned to normal."

https://openalex.org/W2055166243,"A statistical method was devised to test whether prezygotic selection was operating in ABO blood groups, and it was demonstrated, with data from Japanese families, that heterozygous AO and BO fathers transmitted more than 50 percent O-bearing sperm (approximately 55 percent) to their children. Neither sperm incompatibility nor reproductive compensation could account for the results."

https://openalex.org/W2011205321,Single doses of pairs of viruses and organic carcinogens (in amounts too small in themselves to induce tumors) were administered to male Swiss mice free of polyoma virus. Malignant tumors developed in groups of mice injected with five of the carcinogen-virus pairs. Prior immunization against the virus of a pair prevented tumor formation by that pair. Carcinogen binding by poliovirus 2 was demonstrated in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2060932599,"This report analyzes some experiments in visual flicker recently described by Forsyth and Brown. The assumption that only the first Fourier component of their stimuli is at the flicker threshold, the other components being below threshold, provides a model that accurately predicts their data. Hence, contrary to the conclusions drawn by Forsyth and Brown, no new nonlinear property of the visual system has been demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W2045279259,"Pure bovine thrombin was separated from autoprothrombin C, and the lethal intravenous dose for mice weighing 25 g was 0.4 ml of a solution containing 50 units of thrombin per milliliter. Autoprothrombin C was not toxic alone, but with crude cephalin it was fatal. The clotting time of human plasma was only slightly accelerated by autoprothrombin C alone; the clotting time was as short as 5 seconds with a combination of autoprothrombin C and cephalin."

https://openalex.org/W1550133442,"A theory of thinking is presented which attributes the human brain's outstanding efficiency and versatility in problem solving and learning to two memory functions. The brain's efficiency is considered to be largely a function of the capacity to remember previous operations involved in finding answers to questions. Man's outstanding versatility in problem solving is basically attributed to memory which can activate, maintain, and terminate activities independent of, or only indirectly related to, environmental or physiologic regulatory factors. Within-brain activity patterns which have unidirectionally alterable probabilities of appearance allow for adaptation (learning). The fact that the probability of appearance of nervous system activity can be altered to approach zero or unity allows nervous system units to act as their own timing controls during answer finding; the fact that units are combined into pathways allows for propagation of addressed messages at rates of the same order of magnitude as those of the timing controls."
