https://openalex.org/W2042409437,"We report here the identification of a novel protein, Smac, which promotes caspase activation in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway. Smac promotes caspase-9 activation by binding to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs, and removing their inhibitory activity. Smac is normally a mitochondrial protein but is released into the cytosol when cells undergo apoptosis. Mitochondrial import and cleavage of its signal peptide are required for Smac to gain its apoptotic activity. Overexpression of Smac increases cells' sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Smac is the second mitochondrial protein, along with cytochrome c, that promotes apoptosis by activating caspases."
https://openalex.org/W2146264532,"Ascertaining the impact of uncharacterized perturbations on the cell is a fundamental problem in biology. Here, we describe how a single assay can be used to monitor hundreds of different cellular functions simultaneously. We constructed a reference database or ""compendium"" of expression profiles corresponding to 300 diverse mutations and chemical treatments in S. cerevisiae, and we show that the cellular pathways affected can be determined by pattern matching, even among very subtle profiles. The utility of this approach is validated by examining profiles caused by deletions of uncharacterized genes: we identify and experimentally confirm that eight uncharacterized open reading frames encode proteins required for sterol metabolism, cell wall function, mitochondrial respiration, or protein synthesis. We also show that the compendium can be used to characterize pharmacological perturbations by identifying a novel target of the commonly used drug dyclonine."
https://openalex.org/W2162653594,"To identify proteins that bind mammalian IAP homolog A (MIHA, also known as XIAP), we used coimmunoprecipitation and 2D immobilized pH gradient/SDS PAGE, followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. DIABLO (direct IAP binding protein with low pI) is a novel protein that can bind MIHA and can also interact with MIHB and MIHC and the baculoviral IAP, OpIAP. The N-terminally processed, IAP-interacting form of DIABLO is concentrated in membrane fractions in healthy cells but released into the MIHA-containing cytosolic fractions upon UV irradiation. As transfection of cells with DIABLO was able to counter the protection afforded by MIHA against UV irradiation, DIABLO may promote apoptosis by binding to IAPs and preventing them from inhibiting caspases."
https://openalex.org/W2006623752,"Voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) containing a pore-forming α1D subunit (D-LTCCs) are expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Their relative contribution to total L-type Ca2+ currents and their physiological role and significance as a drug target remain unknown. Therefore, we generated D-LTCC deficient mice (α1D−/−) that were viable with no major disturbances of glucose metabolism. α1D−/− mice were deaf due to the complete absence of L-type currents in cochlear inner hair cells and degeneration of outer and inner hair cells. In wild-type controls, D-LTCC-mediated currents showed low activation thresholds and slow inactivation kinetics. Electrocardiogram recordings revealed sinoatrial node dysfunction (bradycardia and arrhythmia) in α1D−/− mice. We conclude that α1D can form LTCCs with negative activation thresholds essential for normal auditory function and control of cardiac pacemaker activity."
https://openalex.org/W1996381709,"We describe the crystal structure of a complex between importin-beta residues 1-442 (Ib442) and five FxFG nucleoporin repeats from Nsp1p. Nucleoporin FxFG cores bind on the convex face of Ib442 to a primary site between the A helices of HEAT repeats 5 and 6, and to a secondary site between HEAT repeats 6 and 7. Mutations at importin-beta Ile178 in the primary FxFG binding site reduce both binding and nuclear protein import, providing direct evidence for the functional significance of the importin-beta-FxFG interaction. The FxFG binding sites on importin-beta do not overlap with the RanGTP binding site. Instead, RanGTP may release importin-beta from FxFG nucleoporins by generating a conformational change that alters the structure of the FxFG binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2059193889,"Ubiquitin is ligated to L28, a component of the large ribosomal subunit, to form the most abundant ubiquitin-protein conjugate in S. cerevisiae. The human ortholog of L28 is also ubiquitinated, indicating that this modification is highly conserved in evolution. During S phase of the yeast cell cycle, L28 is strongly ubiquitinated, while reduced levels of L28 ubiquitination are observed in G1 cells. L28 ubiquitination is inhibited by a Lys63 to Arg substitution in ubiquitin, indicating that L28 is modified by a variant, Lys63-linked multiubiquitin chain. The K63R mutant of ubiquitin displays defects in ribosomal function in vivo and in vitro, including a dramatic sensitivity to translational inhibitors. L28, like other ribosomal proteins, is metabolically stable. Therefore, these data suggest a regulatory role for multiubiquitin chains that is reversible and does not function to target the acceptor protein for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2124818074,"DNA damage causes stabilization of p53, leading to G1 arrest through induction of p21cip1. As this process requires transcription, several hours are needed to exert this response. We show that DNA damage causes an immediate and p53-independent G1 arrest, caused by rapid proteolysis of cyclin D1. Degradation is mediated through a previously unrecognized destruction box in cyclin D1 and leads to a release of p21cip1 from CDK4 to inhibit CDK2. Interference with cyclin D1 degradation prevents initiation of G1 arrest and renders cells more susceptible to DNA damage, indicating that cyclin D1 degradation is an essential component of the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Thus, induction of G1 arrest in response to DNA damage is minimally a two step process: a fast p53-independent initiation of G1 arrest mediated by cyclin D1 proteolysis and a slower maintenance of arrest resulting from increased p53 stability."
https://openalex.org/W2121952955,"Topographic maps are a fundamental feature of sensory representations in nervous systems. The formation of one such map, defined by the connection of ganglion cells in the retina to their targets in the superior colliculus of the midbrain, is thought to depend upon an interaction between complementary gradients of retinal EphA receptors and collicular ephrin-A ligands. We have tested this hypothesis by using gene targeting to elevate EphA receptor expression in a subset of mouse ganglion cells, thereby producing two intermingled ganglion cell populations that express distinct EphA receptor gradients. We find that these two populations form separate maps in the colliculus, which can be predicted as a function of the net EphA receptor level that a given ganglion cell expresses relative to its neighbors."
https://openalex.org/W2029268814,"Exit from mitosis must not occur prior to partitioning of chromosomes between daughter cells. We find that the GTP binding protein Tem1, a regulator of mitotic exit, is present on the spindle pole body that migrates into the bud during S phase and mitosis. Tem1's exchange factor, Lte1, localizes to the bud. Thus, Tem1 and Lte1 are present in the same cellular compartment (the bud) only after the nucleus enters the bud during nuclear division. We also find that the presence of Tem1 and Lte1 in the bud is required for mitotic exit. Our results suggest that the spatial segregation of Tem1 and Lte1 ensures that exit from mitosis only occurs after the genetic material is partitioned between mother and daughter cell."

Here we investigate the regulation of constitutive COX-2 expression and prostaglandin production in human colorectal carcinoma cells. Both COX-2 mRNA and protein were expressed in well differentiated HCA-7, Moser, LS-174, and HT-29 cells, albeit at different levels. COX-2 expression was not detected in several poorly differentiated colon cancer cell lines including DLD-1. Transcriptional regulation played a key role for the expression of COX-2 in human colon carcinoma cells, and both the nuclear factor for interleukin-6 regulatory element and the cAMP-response element were responsible for regulation ofCOX-2 transcription. COX-2 mRNA was more stable in HCA-7 cells than in the other cell lines tested. Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 involved the MAP kinase pathway. Modulation of the Akt/protein kinase B or Rho B signaling pathways altered the levels of COX-2 expression. Furthermore, COX-2 protein is degraded through ubiquitin proteolysis, and its half-life was ∼3.5–8 h. HCA-7 cells produced significant quantities of prostaglandin E2 and other prostaglandins.

These observations suggest that COX-2 may play a critical role in colorectal carcinogenesis and represent an important target for prevention of colorectal cancer in humans. Although increased expression of COX-2 in human and rodent intestinal tumors has been widely observed, the mechanisms that regulate the expression of COX-2 in colonic tumors are not completely understood. Transcriptional regulation of COX-2 has been evaluated in multiple cell lines (19Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). A number of studies have indicated that COX-2 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to growth factors (20Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and by signaling via oncogenic pathways in a variety of cells (21Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y.

Recent reports indicate that COX-2 is not only regulated at the level of transcription but also via post-transcriptional mechanisms. Interleukin-1α prolonged the half-life of the COX-2 mRNA, and dexamethasone treatment decreased COX-2 mRNA levels by post-transcriptional mechanisms (25Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We have reported that the induction of COX-2 in conditionally Ha-Ras Val-12-transformed Rat-1 cells occurs via a modest increase in COX-2 transcription with a significant increase in the stability of COX-2 mRNA (27Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Induction of oncogenic Ras stabilizes the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of COX-2 mRNA in intestinal epithelial cells. A conserved AU-rich region (AU-rich element (ARE)) is responsible for the rapid turnover of COX-2 mRNA (28Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and for the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA byRas (29Sheng H. Shao J. Dixon D.A. Williams C.S.

To further evaluate the molecular mechanisms that control the constitutive expression of COX-2 in human colon carcinoma cells, we sought to investigate the regulation of COX-2 at the level of transcription, post-transcription, and protein turnover. Our results demonstrate that expression of COX-2 is regulated at multiple levels, and this regulation involves a number of different signaling pathways. HCA-7 cells were a gift of Dr. Susan Kirkland (University of London). Moser, LS-174, HT-29, and DLD-1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. PD 98059 and LY 294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. The extraction of total cellular RNA was carried out as described previously (30Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After hybridization and washes, the blots were subjected to autoradiography. 28 S rRNA signals were used as controls to determine the integrity of RNA and equality of loading in each lane. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (30Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed for 30 min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate). Clarified cell lysates were denatured and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The filters were then incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Band density was quantitated by densitometry scanning. The anti-COX-2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described previously (27Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from HCA-7, LS-174, and DLD-1 cells. In vitro run-on transcription was carried out by using 1 × 107 nuclei and 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP/assay at 30 °C for 45 min. Labeled transcripts were purified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. A total of 1 × 107 cpm of elongated nascent RNA per assay were hybridized for 48 h at 43 °C to filter-immobilized plasmid DNAs. The filters were washed with 2× SSC at 43 °C for 1 h and incubated with RNase A (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and then for 1 h in 2× SSC. The autoradiographs were subjected to densitometric analysis, and all data were normalized to the internal control. The assays to determine the activity of the COX-2 promoter and stability of COX-2 3′-UTR were described previously (29Sheng H. Shao J. Dixon D.A. Williams C.S. Prescott S.M. DuBois R.N.

For transient transfections, cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of one of the COX-2 firefly luciferase plasmid constructs and 0.01 μg of the pRL-CMV plasmid, containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega, Madison WI), using the Lipofectin procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h and lysed. 20 μl of lysate was used for both the firefly and Renilla luciferase readings. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a model TD-20/20 Luminometer. Firefly luciferase values were standardized to Renilla values. The expression vectors containing the myristoylated form of Akt (Akt-myr) or dominant negative Akt-K179M cDNA were provided by Dr. Philip Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The expression vectors containing wild type Rho B, active Rho B (Rho B V14), and dominant negative Rho B (Rho B N19) were provided by Dr. George Prendergast (The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). For these experiments, subconfluent cultures were established. Cells were incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h and then washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine was added to the culture medium. Cell lysates were collected in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer at the indicated time points. An equal amount of protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-COX-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. For these experiments, subconfluent cell cultures were established. Fresh medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was replaced 24 h prior to harvesting the conditioned media. After collecting the culture media, serum-free medium supplemented with arachidonic acid (15 μm) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was added to the cells. The conditioned medium was harvested after a 1-h incubation. prostaglandin E2(PGE2) levels in both serum-containing and serum-free media were quantified by utilizing stable isotope dilution techniques employing gas chromatography negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (31DuBois R.N. Awad J. Morrow J. Roberts L.J. Bishop P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as nanograms of PGE2 per 105 cells. All statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test. The limit of significance for all tests was p < 0.05. Although COX-2 is expressed in 80–90% of human colon carcinoma specimens, constitutive expression of COX-2 was only detected in a relatively small number of established colorectal carcinoma cell lines. We screened a number of available colon carcinoma cell lines and found that COX-2 was not detected in most of the poorly differentiated cell lines, including HCT 116, HCT 15, SW 480, SW 620, RKO, and DLD-1 cells but was expressed in many well differentiated cell lines (data not shown and Fig.1). Both COX-2 mRNA and protein were expressed in HCA-7, Moser, LS-174, and HT-29 cells. In contrast, no COX-2 expression was detected in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 1, A andB). The level of COX-2 mRNA in HCA-7 cells was 1.7-fold of that seen in Moser cells and about 10-fold the level seen in LS-174 or HT-29 cells. The highest level of COX-2 protein was observed in HCA-7 cells followed by the Moser and LS-174 cells. HT-29 cells expressed the lowest level of COX-2 protein among the COX-2-expressing cell lines. COX-2 transcription is regulated in response to a variety of growth factors and following activation of oncogenes such as ras and src. In order to determine the mechanisms by which COX-2 expression is regulated in colon carcinoma cells, we compared the transcriptional activity of COX-2 in HCA-7, LS-174, and DLD-1 cells using nuclear run-on assays. The transcriptional activity of the COX-2 gene in HCA-7 cells was 3-fold higher than that seen in LS-174 cells, and almost noCOX-2 transcription was detected in DLD-1 cells (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the transcriptional activity of a cell cycle protein, cyclin D1, was higher in the LS-174 cells. To determine the cis-acting elements that are responsible for the COX-2 transcription, a series of humanCOX-2 promoter deletion constructs were transfected in to HCA-7 and LS-174 cells. The highest transcriptional activity was achieved when the −220/+59 promoter construct was used. Removal of the NF-IL6 site (−124/+59) reduced the transcriptional activity by 68 and 45% in HCA-7 and LS-174 cells, respectively. Deletion of both the NF-IL6 and CRE (−52/+59) elements resulted in a >90% decrease in transcriptional activity of COX-2 (Fig. 2 B). Mutating the CRE or NF-IL6 site in the COX-2 promoter region (−327/+59) reduced the transcriptional activity by 50–70%, and the promoter containing both mutated CRE and NF-IL6 element exhibited extremely low activity, similar to that seen with the −52/+59 construct. Post-transcriptional regulation via stabilization of COX-2 mRNA plays an important role in the regulation of COX-2 in a variety of cultured cells. The stability of COX-2 mRNA was estimated by the steady-state levels of COX-2 mRNA after transcription was blocked by the treatment with DRB (dichlorobenzimidazole riboside). Thet 1,2 of COX-2 mRNA was ∼80 min in LS-174 cells and >120 min in HCA-7 cells (Fig.3 A). Transient expression of the CMV promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene linked with 1.4 kilobase pairs of COX-2 3′-UTR (pLuc + 3′-UTR) revealed that the COX-2 3′-UTR was more stable in HCA-7 cells than in LS-174 cells (Fig.3 B). Using the luciferase reporter vector containing the conserved AREs of the COX-2 3′-UTR demonstrated that the AREs found in the COX-2 3′-UTR were responsible for the difference in the stability of COX-2 mRNA between HCA-7 and LS-174 cells (Fig.3 C). The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is important in both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 expression. Inhibition of the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by the treatment with a specific MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase) inhibitor, PD 98059 (50 μm), reduced the COX-2 promoter activity by ∼35% in HCA-7 and LS-174 cells (Fig.4, A and B). PD 98059 treatment also reduced the stability of COX-2 3′-UTR by ∼55% in these cells. Akt/PKB can be modulated by multiple signaling pathways and acts as a transducer of many signals initiated by growth factor receptors that activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (32Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Cumulative evidence indicates that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt/PKB pathway is oncogenic and involved in the neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether Akt activity regulates the expression of COX-2. Co-transfection of aCOX-2 promoter construct (phPES2−1432/+59) with a dominant negative Akt expression vector (Akt-K179M) slightly reduced theCOX-2 promoter activity in LS-174 cells (Fig.5 A). However, co-transfection of COX-2 3′-UTR construct (pLuc + 3′-UTR) with a constitutively active Akt-expression vector (Akt-myr) resulted in 47 and 31% increase in the stability of COX-2 3′-UTR in HCA-7 and LS-174 cells (Fig.5 B). In contrast, expression of dominant negative Akt-K179M reduced the stability of COX-2 3′-UTR by 30% in HCA-7 cells. The Rho family of proteins are key components in cellular processes that regulate gene expression, proliferation, motility, and invasion and are critical components in oncogenic Ras transformation (33Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether Rho activity was involved in the regulation of COX-2, we co-transfected the Rho B expression vectors along with the constructs containing the COX-2 promoter or COX-2 3′-UTR. Transient expression of dominant negative Rho B N19 inhibited the activity of the COX-2 promoter by 42% in HCA-7 cells and by 37% in LS-174 cells (Fig. 5 C), while expression of active Rho B V14 resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of COX-2 in HCA-7 and a 2.3-fold increase in LS-174 cells. In contrast, the Rho B signaling pathway exerted less effect on the stability of COX-2 mRNA. Transiently expressing dominant negative Rho B N19 or active Rho B V14 resulted in less than 27% change of COX-2 3′-UTR stability in LS-174 cells and had almost no effect in HCA-7 cells (Fig. 5 D). To confirm the findings from the transient transfection experiments, HCA-7 and LS-174 cells were stably transfected with Akt and Rho B expression constructs. The levels of COX-2 protein were determined by Western analysis, and the results are shown in Fig.6, A and B. Ectopic expression of Akt-K179M reduced COX-2 expression in both HCA-7 and LS-174 cells, while expression of active Akt-myr increased the levels of COX-2. Stable transfection with Rho B N19 decreased the levels of COX-2 in both HCA-7 and LS-174 cells, and expression of active Rho B V14 elevated the COX-2 expression. Therefore, regulation of COX-2 via modulation of Akt/PKB and Rho signaling can occur in colorectal carcinoma cells. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the degradation of many important cellular proteins. In order to determine whether ubiquitin proteolysis is involved in the degradation of COX-2 protein, we treated colon carcinoma cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, and measured the change in COX-2 protein levels. Western analysis revealed that treatment with MG-132 (10 μm) resulted in a rapid increase in the levels of COX-2 protein in HCA-7, Moser, LS-174, and HT-29 cells (Fig.7 A), indicating that COX-2 protein was degraded via the proteasome pathway in all of these cell lines. In response to MG-132 treatment, COX-2 protein levels were affected most in Moser and HT-29 cells and less in HCA-7 and LS-174 cells, suggesting that the activity of ubiquitin proteolysis may vary from cell line to cell line. To determine the stability of COX-2 protein, metabolic labeling experiments were performed in HCA-7, LS-174, Moser, and HT-29 cells. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the t12 of COX-2 protein ranged from ∼3.5 h in Moser cells to ∼8 h in LS-174 cells. The stability of COX-2 protein varied from cell line to cell line. Although COX-2 protein was expressed in all four cell lines, COX-2 enzyme activity was variable. To estimate the activity of COX-2, we first determined the profile of prostaglandins produced in HCA-7, Moser, LS-174, and HT-29 cells. We found that PGE2 is the predominant eicosanoid product in HCA-7, Moser, and LS-174 cells. Prostaglandin F2α, prostaglandin D2, and thromboxane B2 are also present in the cell culture media at lower levels. HT-29 cells, in contrast, do not produce prostaglandins despite the presence of low levels of COX-2 protein. Next, we measured PGE2 levels in the presence and absence of exogenous substrate (arachidonic acid, 15 μm). As demonstrated in Fig.8, PGE2 was produced at very high levels in HCA-7 cells with or without the addition of arachidonic acid. Relatively high levels of PGE2 were detected in the cell culture medium plus or minus the addition of arachidonic acid in Moser cells, and a low level of PGE2 was detected in LS-174 cells only in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid. The addition of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib (3 μm), almost completely abolished the production of PGE2 in both HCA-7 and Moser cells. Prostaglandins derived from COX-2 are thought to play an important role in intestinal carcinogenesis, although the precise mechanism(s) by which they act is not yet understood. Understanding the pathways that control the expression of COX-2 and exploring the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression may lead to a better understanding of its dysregulation in colorectal carcinomas. A number of studies have shown that COX-2 is expressed constitutively in the majority of colorectal carcinomas (7Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N.

Evans J. Mancini J. Jothy S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2556-2559PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the minority of established colon carcinoma cell lines. We demonstrate that four human colon cancer cell lines express both COX-2 mRNA and protein, including the HCA-7, Moser, LS-174, and HT-29 cells. All of these cell lines were derived from well differentiated adenocarcinomas. These results are in agreement with the observation made in human carcinoma tissue (34Masferrer J.L. Leahy K.M. Koki A.T. Zweifel B.S. Settle S.S. Woerner B.M. Edwards D.A. Flickinger A.G. Moore R.J. Seibert K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1306-1311PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of COX-2 mRNA has been reported in some undifferentiated colon carcinoma cell lines, including the HCT 116 cells (19Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, COX-2 mRNA is expressed at extremely low levels in HCT 116 cells, and COX-2 protein could not be detected (15Sheng H. Shao J. Kirkland S.C. Isakson P. Coffey R.J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of constitutive COX-2 expression and prostaglandin synthesis in these well differentiated cell lines is not completely understood. There is mounting evidence that COX-2 expression in colorectal carcinoma cells provides a growth and survival advantage (35Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar) and increases tumor cell invasiveness (36Tsujii M. Sunao K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also found that the stability of COX-2 mRNA, in part, accounts for the steady-state levels of COX-2 mRNA in colon carcinoma cells that constitutively express COX-2. COX-2 mRNA stability appears to be regulated mainly via the conserved 116-nucleotide ARE. COX-2 expression is not only regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels but may also be regulated by the rate of protein synthesis and/or degradation. Dixon et al. (28Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) recently reported that the conserved 116-nucleotide ARE suppresses the translation of COX-2 mRNA into protein. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the principle mechanism responsible for the turnover of short lived proteins in eukaryotic cells and is a fundamental mechanism for cellular control (reviewed in Ref. 40Haas A.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1053-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A number of cellular regulatory proteins, including many cell cycle proteins, transcription factors, and growth factor receptors, are degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis (reviewed in Ref. 41Rolfe M. Chiu M.I. Pagano M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). COX-2 is the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase and is not normally expressed under basal conditions but can be rapidly induced by growth factors, cytokines, and tumor promoters (20Xie W.

Our results show that COX-2 protein is degraded via the proteasome pathway and that the stability of COX-2 protein varies from cell line to cell line. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of COX-2 expression. Activation of protein kinase C is responsible for the induction of COX-2 transcription by dihydroxy bile acids (42Zhang F. Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Induction of COX-2 by the oncogene v-src (22Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) requires activation of both Ras/Rac1/MEKK1/Jun N-terminal kinase and Ras/Raf-1/ERK signal transduction pathways. ERK, Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 are required for the ceramide-induced expression of COX-2 (43Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway induces the expression of COX-2 and increases prostaglandin biosynthesis (44Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Pentland A.P. Templeton D.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The p38 pathway has also been implicated in the control of COX-2 mRNA stability (45Matsuura H. Sakaue M. Subbaramaiah K. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Dannenberg A.J. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Arata J. Jetten A.M.

We found that inhibition of MEK/ERK activity completely abolishes Ras-induced stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (27Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate the importance of the MEK/ERK pathway for the constitutive expression of COX-2 in colorectal carcinoma cells. We also show that the Akt/PKB pathway and the Rho B pathway can modulateCOX-2 transcription and COX-2 mRNA stability. Interestingly, Rho B activity predominantly regulates COX-2 expression at transcriptional level, and the Akt pathway predominantly modulates the stability of COX-2 mRNA. Akt/PKB regulates gene transcription by direct phosphorylation of transcription factors such as FKHR, FKHRL, and AFX (46Davis R.J. Bennicelli J.L. Macina R.A. Nycum L.M. Biegel J.A. Barr F.G. Hum.

Evidence suggests that the Akt/PKB pathway promotes growth factor-mediated cell survival and inhibits apoptosis (53Yao R. Cooper G.M.

Members of the Rho family are key regulators of many cellular processes, such as the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, activation of kinase cascades, and regulation of gene expression, and they have been implicated as critical mediators for the transforming potential of diverse oncogene pathways (reviewed in Ref. 33Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that COX-2 is a target gene of the Akt/PKB and Rho B pathways and suggest that COX-2 may represent a downstream mediator of these oncogenic pathways. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 that is subsequently converted to a variety of eicosanoids including PGE2, prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin F2α, prostaglandin I2, and thromboxane A2 (reviewed in Ref. 56DuBois R.N.

Although the COX-2 enzyme is constitutively expressed in HCA-7, Moser, LS-174, and HT-29 cells, PGE2 was only detected in the HCA-7, Moser, and LS-174 cells. Treatment with celecoxib (3 μm) completely inhibited PGE2 production in HCA-7 and Moser cells. These results suggest that selective COX-2 inhibitors might suppress the growth of HCA-7 (15Sheng H.

Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) through a COX-2-prostaglandin-dependent mechanism. Selective COX-2 inhibitors can also inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma cells in a COX-2-prostaglandin-independent manner (reviewed in Ref. 57Shiff S.J. Rigas B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) when present in concentrations higher than those required to inhibit COX-2 enzyme activity. In summary, our data indicate that constitutive expression of COX-2 in human colorectal carcinoma cells is regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and protein levels. Prostaglandin formation correlates, to a significant extent, with COX-2 expression. A number of signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression in colorectal carcinoma cells, and we find that the regulation of COX-2 expression is linked to key oncogenic signaling pathways such as Akt/PKB and Rho B."

Thus, given the complex nature of the cell cycle machinery, it is likely that additional p53 target genes may exist for execution of the full p53 responses.We have been investigating the interaction of p53 with another transcription factor, IRF-1,1which was originally discovered as a regulator of the interferon response.

More recently, it has been shown that the loss of IRF-1 alleles dramatically exacerbates previous tumor predispositions caused by nullizygosity for p53 in the mouse (18Nozawa H. Oda E. Nakao K.

Our results collectively suggest that Reprimo may be a new member of the p53-induced proteins involved in the G2arrest of the cell cycle. Tumor suppressor genes function by affecting a variety of cellular mechanisms underlying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and many of these genes encode transcription factors that exert tumor suppressive effects by inducing their specific target genes (1Hanahan D.

To define the mechanisms of action of MED1, we implemented a sensitive glycosylase assay amenable to kinetic analysis. We show that MED1 functions as a mismatch-specific DNA N-glycosylase active on thymine, uracil, and 5-fluorouracil when these bases are opposite to guanine. MED1 lacks uracil glycosylase activity on single-strand DNA and abasic site lyase activity. The glycosylase activity of MED1 prefers substrates containing a G:T mismatch within methylated or unmethylated CpG sites; since G:T mismatches can originate via deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine, MED1 may act as a caretaker of genomic fidelity at CpG sites. A kinetic analysis revealed that MED1 displays a fast first cleavage reaction followed by slower subsequent reactions, resulting in biphasic time course; this is due to the tight binding of MED1 to the abasic site reaction product rather than a consequence of enzyme inactivation. Comparison of kinetic profiles revealed that the MED1 5-methylcytosine binding domain and methylation of the mismatched CpG site are not required for efficient catalysis.

Cellular DNA transactions occur in aqueous solution containing reactive oxygen species, and, as such, DNA is prone to both hydrolytic and oxidative damage. Hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond yields apurinic and, less frequently, apyrimidinic sites that are highly mutagenic. Hydrolytic deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine (M)1generates G:U and G:T mismatches, respectively. Oxidative lesions include 8-oxoguanine, thymine glycol, and formamidopyrimidine derivatives of adenine and guanine (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 2Hickson I.D. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience (Springer-Verlag), Austin, TX1997: 1-5Google Scholar). In addition to endogenous damaging processes, DNA is exposed to the attack of exogenous reactive species, including alkylating agents and the carcinogens vinyl chloride and ethyl carbamate. Alkylating agents primarily alkylate the N3 position of purines and the N7 and O6 positions of guanine (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 2Hickson I.D. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience (Springer-Verlag), Austin, TX1997: 1-5Google Scholar), whereas metabolites of vinyl chloride and ethyl carbamate generate cyclic (etheno) DNA adducts, such as 3,N 4-ethenocytosine, 1,N 6-ethenoadenine, 1,N 2-ethenoguanine andN 2,3-ethenoguanine (4Bolt H.M.

Efficient correction of these DNA lesions relies on the action of several enzymes belonging to the base excision repair system (2Hickson I.D. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience (Springer-Verlag), Austin, TX1997: 1-5Google Scholar, 6Wallace S.S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Krokan H.E. Standal R.

Struct. 1999; 28: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Unlike nucleotide excision repair or long-patch mismatch repair (MMR), base excision repair enzymes usually act in a lesion-specific fashion on a single damaged or mismatched nucleotide. Given the mutagenic potential of DNA lesions, continuing elucidation of the biochemical activities, damage spectrum and specificity of base excision repair enzymes has direct implications on cancer and aging (2Hickson I.D. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience (Springer-Verlag), Austin, TX1997: 1-5Google Scholar). In an effort to isolate new human proteins involved in DNA repair, we recently conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening with the MMR protein MLH1 as a bait and identified a novel human DNA repair protein, named MED1 (methyl-CpG-binding endonuclease 1) (10Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The 580-amino acid MED1 protein, also known as MBD4 (11Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), has a tripartite structure with an N-terminal 5-methylcytosine binding domain (MBD), a central region with five putative nuclear localization signals, and a C-terminal catalytic domain with homology to bacterial DNA damage-specific glycosylases/lyases, such as Escherichia coli endonuclease III and MutY, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicumMig.Mth, and Micrococcus luteus UV repair endonuclease (10Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We previously showed that MED1 co-immunoprecipitates with MLH1 in human cells, binds to oligonucleotides containing 5-methylcytosine on one or both strands (hemimethylated or fully methylated DNA), and has endonuclease activity on a supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate. Based on the domain structure and biochemical properties of MED1, we proposed that cytosine methylation may play a role in MED1 repair mechanism (10Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As to the function of MED1 in DNA repair, we had previously suggested three possibilities. (i) MED1 may function in long-patch MMR; this would explain the interaction with MLH1 and, possibly, the binding to hemi- and fully methylated DNA, in analogy to the E. coliMutSLH system. (ii) MED1 may work in a short-patch MMR pathway, similar to the E. coli Vsr endonuclease; this would also explain the interaction with MLH1. (iii) MED1 may act as a glycosylase/lyase in a pathway of base excision repair (10Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we show that MED1 acts as a mismatch-specific glycosylase active on thymine, uracil, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) paired with guanine. Due to its high affinity for the abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) (AP) site reaction product, MED1 displays biphasic kinetics with a rapid initial burst of product formation followed by much slower reactions. We and others have previously shown that the MED1(MBD4) gene is mutated in human colorectal, endometrial, and pancreatic carcinomas exhibiting a defect in the MMR genesMLH1 and MSH2 (12Riccio A. Aaltonen L.A. Godwin A.K. Loukola A. Percesepe A. Salovaara R. Masciullo V. Genuardi M. Paravatou-Petsotas M. Bassi D.E. Ruggeri B.A. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Testa J.R. Neri G. Bellacosa A. Nat.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8044-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The mutations target polyadenine microsatellites in the central region and cause frameshifts; this predicts the synthesis of truncated proteins lacking the C-terminal catalytic domain (12Riccio A. Aaltonen L.A. Godwin A.K. Loukola A. Percesepe A. Salovaara R. Masciullo V. Genuardi M. Paravatou-Petsotas M. Bassi D.E. Ruggeri B.A. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Testa J.R. Neri G. Bellacosa A. Nat.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8044-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, the present findings suggest that a fraction of human carcinomas are defective not only in long-patch MMR but also in MED1 thymine, uracil, and 5-FU glycosylase activity. The defect in MED1 activity may facilitate accumulation of DNA damage, thereby contributing to tumor development, and, in addition, may have implications in cancer treatments based on chemotherapy with 5-FU. Expression constructs of wild type MED1 protein and deletion mutants were prepared in the vector pET28(b) (Novagen), which provides a 6-histidine tag, and were propagated in E. colistrain XL-1 Blue, as described previously (10Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3)(pLysS) cells transformed with the expression vectors were grown toA 600 = 0.4 and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells collected by centrifugation were lysed in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and “Complete” protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). After clarification by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the soluble protein fraction was diluted to 150 mm NaCl. β-Mercaptoethanol (7 mm) was added, and the sample was applied to a 5-ml Q Sepharose anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in series to a 5-ml SP Sepharose cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After disconnecting the Q Sepharose column, the SP Sepharose column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. Elution was performed with 10 ml of Buffer B supplemented with 1.5 m NaCl. The SP Sepharose eluate, supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, was applied to a 1.5-ml nickel-chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nickel affinity column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Recombinant MED1 proteins were eluted with 5 ml of Buffer C, supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. Proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), pumped at a rate of 40 μl/min using a SMART chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UV absorbance was monitored at 214, 256, and 280 nm, and 40-μl fractions were collected every 1 min. Throughout the purification, fractions were followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and assayed for glycosylase activity (see below). The final MED1 preparation was estimated to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Upon the addition of 10% glycerol, purified MED1 fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. A slow decay of glycosylase activity was observed upon prolonged storage at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine γ globulin as a standard. Oligonucleotides (37- and 64-mers) were synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) and purified by denaturing 8.3 m urea, 15–20% PAGE. Oligonucleotide bands were visualized by UV shadowing and excised. DNA was electroeluted from gel slices using an Amicon 57005 electroeluter, as described previously (14Oleykowski C.A. Bronson Mullins C.R. Godwin A.K. Yeung A.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4597-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing 5-FU were purchased from Genset (Paris, France) and gel-purified as above. The AP site-containing oligonucleotide was prepared by incubating an oligonucleotide containing uracil with E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (Udg) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The AP site reaction product was purified by ion exchange chromatography at pH 12. Double-strand oligonucleotide substrates were prepared by annealing complementary, gel-purified single-strand oligonucleotides, as summarized in Table I. Duplex substrates were labeled at the 3′ end of the bottom strand by a fill-in reaction with exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Prime-It, Stratagene) and [α-32P]dGTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unincorporated label was removed with G25 spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Table ISummary of the duplex oligonucleotides used in this study64-mer substrate (diverse mismatches) 5′-CCGTCATGCTACTTCACTTTATGCTTCCGGCTCXCGTCATGTGTGGAATTGTGATTAAAATCG-3′ 3′- GCAGTACGATCAAGTGAAATACGAAGGCCGAGYGCAGTACACACCTTAACACTAATTTTAGCG-5′X = A, G, C, T Y = A, G, C, T, U, 5-FU64-mer substrate (insertion/deletion) K 5′-CCGTCATGCTAGTTCACTTTATGCTTCCGGCTCG^CGTCATGTGTGGAATTGTGATTAAAATCG-3′ 3′- GCAGTACGATCAAGTGAAATACGAAGGCCGAGC.GCAGTACACACCTTAACACTAATTTTAGCG-5′K = ins A, G, C, T, GT, GTA, GTAC, GTACT, GGGGG; del C64-mer substrate (effect of the base 5′ to mismatched G) 5′-CCGTCATGCTAGTTCACTTTATGCTTCCGGCTZGCGTCATGTGTGGAATTGTGATTAAAATCG-3′ 3′- GCAGTACGATCAAGTGAAATACGAAGGCCGAWTGCAGTACACACCTTAACACTAATTTTAGCG-5′ Z:W = A:T, G:C, C:G, M:G, T:A37-mer substrate for MALDI-TOF and kinetic studies 5′-CAATCCTAGCTGACAZGATGTGGCCAATGGCATGACT-3′ 3′- TTAGGATCGACTGTGYTACACCGGTTACCGTACTGAG-5′ Z = C, M Y = C, M, T, U, 5-FU, AP site Open table in a new tab Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions of the substrate oligonucleotides were conducted as described previously (15Yeung A.T. Dinehart W.J. Jones B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4539-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with the exception that the DNA was labeled at the 3′ end. Substrate DNA, typically 5 nm, was preincubated at 37 °C in Buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reaction was started by the addition of an equimolar amount, typically 5 nm, of purified MED1. At different time points (ranging from 15 s to 10 h), 15-μl aliquots of the reaction were taken, quenched with 3.8 μl of 500 mm NaOH, and immediately transferred to 90 °C for 30 min. An equal volume (18.8 μl) of denaturing loading dye (95% formamide, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol, 20 mm EDTA) was added, and 7.5 μl of the heat-denatured samples were separated by 8.3 murea, 15% PAGE. Gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager (Fuji) screen for 1 h, which yielded exposure within the dynamic range of the instrument. The substrate and product bands were quantified to evaluate the percentage of substrate converted into product. Reaction time courses were then analyzed using the kinetic simulation program KINSIM (16Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 17Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A.

KINSIM uses numerical integration to predict the time dependence of a reaction from a given mechanism and initial concentrations without relying upon the assumptions of steady state kinetic analysis. When the incubation with alkali was omitted, the AP site was stabilized by reduction with sodium borohydride, as described previously (19Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, the glycosylase reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 70 μl of a freshly prepared solution of 0.1 mBisTris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 7 μl of a freshly prepared solution of 5M NaBH4, leaving the tube open. After the addition of 100 μl of 1 m NH4Cl and 2 μl of 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma), the sample was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. Protection of the AP site was necessary to prevent its degradation upon heat denaturation prior to electrophoresis in the experiments for ruling out AP lyase activity, and for processing for mass spectrometry. In the latter case, yeast tRNA was omitted. All solutions for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were prepared in HPLC grade water (Aldrich), freshly treated with ammonium-charged Dowex beads (AG 50W-X8, 200–400-mesh). The matrix was composed of 0.2m 3-hydroxypicolinic acid, 0.02 m N-3-indolacetoaminoleucine, and 30% acetonitrile (v/v) (all chemicals were from Aldrich). The glycosylase reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 1 h with 250 pmol of MED1 and unlabeled 37-mer duplex DNA containing a G:T mismatch. The resulting AP site was stabilized by reduction with NaBH4. In a parallel reaction, MED1 was omitted. Oligonucleotides were then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, dried in a Speed Vac (Savant), and resuspended in bead-treated water. The MALDI target (Scout 384, Bruker Daltonics) was prepared by cleaning with methanol, and then flushed with 1.0 m diammonium citrate, Dowex bead-treated HPLC grade water, and ammonia. The MALDI target was first loaded with 0.5 μl of the matrix solution. The matrix was allowed to crystallize, and 0.5 μl of the analyte solution was added directly over the dried matrix. The resulting semi-crystalline matrix was analyzed in a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in negative, linear mode at 17 kV total extraction voltage, with a delayed extraction at 20 ns. The sum of the signals obtained in 1,000–2,000 laser shots of approximately 60–70 mJ/shot constituted one spectrum and was analyzed. The unreacted oligonucleotides served as internal standards for mass calibration. The catalytic domain of MED1 bears distant homology to several bacterial DNA repair glycosylases/lyases (10Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A.

Whereas endonuclease III and the closely related UV endonuclease have both N-glycosylase and AP lyase activity, and are active on thymine residues damaged by ring saturation, fragmentation, or contraction (23Piersen C.E.

MutY is an adenine glycosylase active on A:C and A:G mismatches as well as on adenine paired with 8-oxoguanine (20Michaels M.L. Pham L. Nghiem Y. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,26Au K.G. Clark S. Miller J.H. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mig.Mth from the thermophilic archaeon M. thermoautotrophicum is a thymine glycosylase active on G:T mismatches; the enzyme is equally active on G:U and to a less degree on G:G, A:G, T:C, and U:C mismatches (22Horst J.P. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5459-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the homologies with these enzymes, MED1 was assayed for glycosylase activity on mismatched bases. Purified recombinant MED1 protein was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrates carrying all the eight possible mismatches of the normal DNA bases. The products of the reaction were treated with strong alkali to cleave at AP sites and then were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig.1 A, a cleavage product was detected only on the 32P-labeled, thymine-containing strand of a G:T substrate. A sequencing ladder indicated that the migration of the cleavage product corresponds to the site of the mismatched thymine (Fig. 1 B). In addition, no cleavage product was detected on C:T or T:T mismatches (Fig. 1 A), or when MED1 was incubated with matched unmethylated, hemimethylated, or fully methylated oligonucleotide substrates, or with substrates containing 1–5 extrahelical bases (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). These results suggest that MED1 has thymine glycosylase activity specific for G:T mismatches. We next conducted a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the MED1 glycosylase reaction with a G:T substrate. As shown in Fig. 1 C, in addition to the peaks corresponding to the parental mismatched top (G) and bottom (T) single-strand oligonucleotides, a third peak is detected upon MED1 incubation, with a mass/charge ratio consistent with that of the reaction product,i.e. the bottom oligonucleotide lacking thymine. This experiment provides conclusive evidence on the thymine glycosylase activity of MED1. In addition to their glycosylase activity, endonuclease III and UV endonuclease perform a β-elimination reaction at the AP site with their associated AP lyase activity (bifunctional glycosylases/lyases). In order to determine whether MED1 has AP lyase activity, fractions from the last step of purification of recombinant MED1 (gel filtration) were incubated with the 32P-labeled G:T substrate. Following incubation with MED1, an aliquot of the reaction was processed with NaOH before electrophoresis, whereas the remaining directly underwent electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.2 A, no cleavage was detected when the incubation of the MED1 reaction products with alkali was omitted. Similarly, MED1 did not further process an AP site generated by incubation of a G:U oligonucleotide substrate with the uracil glycosylase Udg (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that MED1 is a monofunctional glycosylase that lacks a detectable lyase activity. In its G:T mismatch-specific glycosylase activity, MED1 is similar to the above mentioned Mig.Mth (22Horst J.P. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5459-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the human mismatch-specific thymine glycosylase TDG (29Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol.

Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5459-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Since in mammalian cells genome-wide cytosine methylation occurs exclusively at CpG sites, we investigated whether a cytosine or 5-methylcytosine preceding the mismatched guanine is preferred for MED1 thymine glycosylase activity. MED1 was incubated with oligonucleotide substrates in which the mismatched G is immediately 3′ to A, C, G, T, or M. As shown in Fig.3, thymine glycosylase activity was high with CpG/TpG and MpG/TpG substrates and low with ApG/TpT, GpG/TpC, and TpG/TpA substrates. Thus, the fact that CpG/TpG and MpG/TpG are the optimal substrates for MED1 thymine glycosylase activity confirms that MED1 may preferentially counteract mutagenic consequences of deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine at CpG sites. Both Mig.Mth and TDG have a mismatch-specific uracil glycosylase activity (22Horst J.P. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5459-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on the similarities with these enzymes, we tested the uracil glycosylase activity of MED1 on oligonucleotide substrates in which uracil was paired with A, C, G, or T. As expected, MED1 uracil glycosylase activity is specific for G:U mismatches (Fig. 4 A). MED1 did not exhibit uracil glycosylase activity on single-stranded DNA (Fig.4 B). MED1 efficiently removed the uracil analog 5-FU opposite a guanine (Fig. 4 C). A kinetic analysis was performed on MED1 glycosylase reaction in order to elucidate the mechanism of this important DNA repair enzyme. Kinetic studies were preceded by experiments in which we assayed the glycosylase activity of MED1 under various reaction conditions. The results indicated that MED1 is active over a wide range of temperature and pH, whereas it has a more restricted optimum of ionic strength (48Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Genuardi M. Karbowski M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All the kinetic studies were then conducted at the following optimal conditions: temperature = 37 °C, pH = 7.5, and [NaCl] = 0 mm, in Buffer E (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the kinetic experiments, the 32P-labeled G:T oligonucleotide substrate was incubated with MED1 and aliquots of the reaction were removed at time points ranging from 15 s to 10 h. Reactions were stopped by incubation with NaOH at high temperature, which also cleaves at the AP site. Reactions were run in denaturing gels to separate the substrate (38-mer) from the product (16-mer), and the intensities of the substrate and product bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager. The reaction curve is biphasic with an initial burst followed by a slower phase (Fig. 5,A and B). Near-maximum product generation takes place after approximately 2 h; for the subsequent 8 h, there is almost no additional formation of product and the reaction proceeds at a very slow rate (Fig. 5, A and B). This and subsequent experiments were conducted at equimolar or near-equimolar concentrations of substrate and enzyme (as determined by protein assay with the Bradford method, under “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions, 30–50% of the substrate was typically converted into product in 10 h. When the assay was performed with different enzyme concentrations, all lower than substrate concentration, an estim"

The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Smf transporters and their homologs in other organisms have a central role in the accumulation of metal ions and their distribution in different tissues and cellular organelles. In this work we generated null mutations in each individual SMF gene in yeast as well as in all combinations of the genes. Each null mutation exhibited sensitivity to metal ion chelators at different concentrations. The combination of null mutants ΔSMF1 + ΔSMF2and the triple null mutant Δ3SMF failed to grow on medium buffered at pH 8 and 7.5, respectively. Addition of 5 μmcopper or 25 μm manganese alleviated the growth arrest at the high pH or in the presence of the chelating agent. The transport of manganese was analyzed in the triple null mutant and in this mutant expressing each Smf protein. Although overexpression of Smf1p and Smf2p resulted in uptake that was higher than wild type cells, the expression of Smf3p gave no significant uptake above that of the triple mutant Δ3SMF. Western analysis with antibody against Smf3p indicated that this transporter does not reach the plasma membrane and may function at the Golgi or post-Golgi complexes. The iron uptake resulting from expression of Smf1p and Smf2p was analyzed in a mutant in which its iron transporters FET3and FET4 were inactivated. Overexpression of Smf1p gave rise to a significant iron uptake that was sensitive to the sodium concentrations in the medium. We conclude that the Smf proteins play a major role in copper and manganese homeostasis and, under certain circumstances, Smf1p may function in iron transport into the cells.

Metal ion transporters play a major role in maintaining the correct concentrations of the various metal ions in the different cellular compartments. Recent studies of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants revealed key elements in metal ion homeostasis, including novel transport systems. Several of the proteins discovered in yeast are highly conserved, and defects in some of the yeast mutants could be complemented by their human homologs (1Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Later it was shown that the growth arrest at 37 °C could be relieved by supplementing the media with Mn2+ or overexpressingSMF1 that transports Mn2+ from the medium and elevates its concentration in the cytoplasm (8Supek F.

The temperature-sensitive mif1-1 mutant may have resulted from reduced stability of the processing peptidase under limited manganese concentrations in the medium (8Supek F. Supekova L. Nerlson H.

Further studies indicated theSMF1 is a general metal ion transporter and can transport not only Mn2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ (8Supek F. Supekova L. Nerlson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yeast cells contain additional two genes of this family, SMF2 and SMF3, and indirect evidence indicates that they are also broad range metal ion transporters but exhibit different specificity from SMF1(10Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific function for each of them. Expression of Smf1p in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that this protein mediates H+-dependent divalent metal ion transport (14Chen X.-Z. Peng J.-B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, a large Na+ leak through Smf1p was observed, and sodium competed with the activity of metal ion uptake. Because the Smf family of proteins transports a wide range of divalent metal ions and specific and highly regulated transport systems exist in yeast for several of those metals (5Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Andrews N.C. Levy J.E. Blood. 1998; 92: 1845-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Radisky D.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Our approach, since the discovery of these family members as metal ion transporters (8Supek F. Supekova L. Nerlson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was to identify conditions and yeast mutants that will help to elucidate specific functions of the various genes. Here we report on the properties of deletion mutants in each of the genes encoding SMF1, SMF2, and SMF3, as well as the combination of multiple deletions, including a triple mutant lacking the three genes. Our study revealed that the Smf proteins take part in the transport of Cu2+ and Mn2+ into yeast cells, and in their absence a growth arrest occurs due to a shortage in these metal ions. The “wild-type” that was used is S. cerevisiae W303 (MATa/α trp1 ade2 his3 leu2 ura3). The other strains used in this work are: ΔSMF1(MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 SMF1::URA3); ΔSMF2(MATα ade2 his3 trp1 leu2 SMF2::URA3); ΔSMF3(MATα ade2 his3 trp1 leu2 SMF3::URA3); ΔSMF1+2(MATα ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 SMF1::URA3/FOA SMF2::URA3); ΔSMF1+3(MATα ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 SMF1::URA3/FOA SMF3::URA3); ΔSMF2+3(MATα ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 SMF2::URA3/FOA SMF3:: URA3);ΔSMF1+2+3 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 SMF1::URA3/FOA SMF2::URA3/FOA SMF3::URA3). The yeast strain in which FET3 and FET4 genes were inactivated (Δ2FET) was the DEY 1453 (15Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Agar plates were prepared by the addition of 2% agar to the YPD buffer medium at the given pH. Yeast transformation was performed as described previously (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transformed cells were grown on minimal plates containing a 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, 2% agar, and the appropriate nutritional requirements. The gene knockout of the new strains was performed as follows: All or part of the target gene was replaced by the selectable marker URA3, leaving flanking DNA sequences of about 0.3 kb. When PCR was used for the construct, the DNA fragments were cloned into the TA plasmid or pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Transformed colonies that grew on the selective medium were selected, checked by PCR for homologous recombination, and analyzed for their phenotype. The genes containing approximately 0.3-kb flanking sequences were cloned by PCR into YEP24 or YPN2 or BFG plasmids (17Noumi T. Beltrán C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Sequential gene disruption was obtained by inactivation of the URA3 gene and selection on minimal plates containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluorouracil. The colonies that grew under this condition were analyzed for lack of growth on minimal plates without uracil. These yeast strains were used for subsequent gene disruption with a URA3-selectable marker. The various null mutants were analyzed for the disruption of each gene by PCR using one primer from the URA3 gene and one primer flanking the interrupted gene. The interruption of SMF1 was performed as described previously (8Supek F. Supekova L. Nerlson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). SMF2 was interrupted by the PCR-only (HANNAH) method (19Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the gene, as well as the selectable marker, were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides that are partially complementary to yield, in a second PCR, a DNA fragment composed of 5′-SMF2 URA3 3′-SMF2. Most of the reading frame of the gene was deleted leaving DNA fragments encoding 14 and 18 amino acids at the N and C termini of the transporter, respectively. SMF3 was interrupted by introducing the URA3 gene in the StyI site ofSMF3. The same constructs were used for sequential interruption of more than one SMF gene. Yeast transformation was performed either by the method of Ito et al. (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by a bench-top method according to Elble (20Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight in 5 ml of YPD medium (pH 5.5) to stationary phase. The cells were centrifuged for 10 s in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm. 10 μl of salmon sperm (10 mg/ml) was added to the pellet as a DNA carrier. Then about 1 μg of plasmid or DNA construct was added. Finally, the pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of medium containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 40% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m lithium acetate. The suspension was incubated overnight at room temperature and plated on the appropriate plates (17Noumi T. Beltrán C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in 5 ml of selective or YPD medium to stationary phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 2 min at 2500 rpm. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of STET solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm EDTA, 5% Triton X-100, and 8% sucrose. Glass beads (about 0.2 g) were added, and the suspension was vortexed for 20 min. Then, an additional 100 μl of STET solution was added, and the mixture was boiled for 3 min, cooled for 1 min on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g. 100 μl was removed from the supernatant and 50 μl of 7.5 m ammonium acetate was added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at −20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g. 100 μl of supernatant was removed to a fresh tube, 200 μl of cold ethanol was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 ×g. The pellet, containing the DNA, was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8). Polyclonal antibody against Smf3p was obtained by injecting rabbits with a chimeric protein containing the maltose-binding protein and the hydrophilic sequence of amino acids 382–469 of the Smf3p. The DNA fragment encoding these amino acids was amplified by PCR with introduced EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned in-frame to the maltose binding protein in the plasmid PMAL-C (New England BioLabs). Following sequence verification, 500 ml of bacterial culture was grown to OD 0.5 at 600 nm, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g. The cells were disrupted by French press, and the protein was purified by using a column containing maltose agarose. The fractions containing the chimeric protein were dissociated by SDS, loaded on preparative gel, and electrophoresed. The gel was briefly stained by Coomassie Blue, the identified protein band was cut out, and the fusion protein was electroeluted. About 0.25 mg of fusion protein was injected into rabbits as described previously (21Nelson N. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 510-523Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Antibody to Pma1p was raised in rabbits using the purified protein that was electroeluted from polyacrylamide gels as described previously (21Nelson N.

Antibody against Sed5p was a generous gift from Dr. Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley, CA). The antibody detection system (ECL) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Western blots were performed according to the protocol of the ECL antibody detection system from the manufacturer. Samples were denatured by SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide Mini gels (Bio-Rad) as described previously (24Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electrotransfer at 0.5 A for 15 min, the nitrocellulose filters were blocked for 1 h in a solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dried milk. Antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature at a dilution of 1:1000 in a similar solution containing 2% dried milk. Following five washes in the same solution, peroxidase-conjugated second antibody or protein A was added to the filters. After incubation for 30 min and five washes with the same solution, the nitrocellulose filters were subjected to the ECL amplification procedure. The filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 5–60 s. Yeast cells were grown in 500 ml of YPD medium (pH 5.5) to OD 1 at 600 nm. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed with 200 ml of water and then washed again with 1 msorbitol. The cell wall was digested by 2.5 units of zymolyase in 10 ml of solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1m sorbitol. After 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the suspension was centrifuged in 15-ml Corex tubes at 3000 ×g for 5 min. 1 ml of glass beads was added to the pellet as well as 1 ml of solution containing 30 mm MOPS (pH 7), 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. The suspension was vortexed five times for 30 s with incubation on ice for 30 s between each vortexing step. The solution was removed from the glass beads and placed in a new Corex tube. An additional 2 ml of the above solution was added to the tube with the glass beads, and the tube was vortexed briefly. The suspension was added to the previous one and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min to give a pellet containing the cell debris and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 0.3–0.5 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 0.5 msorbitol and stored as the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 115,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was suspended in 0.3–0.5 ml of a solution containing 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol and stored as the membrane fraction at −80 °C. Sucrose gradients were also used to estimate the relative density of various membrane fractions. The gradients were made as described in Lupashin et al. (25Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2659-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except that gradients of 20–60% sucrose were used and the centrifugation was done for 14 h. SMF1 encodes a hydrophobic protein of 63,258 Da with potentially eight to ten transmembrane domains. A search in the yeast genome data base with the Smf1p sequence revealed two homologous genes that were namedSMF2 and SMF3. These genes encode proteins of 59,758 Da and 51,778 Da, respectively, and contain a similar number of transmembrane domains. Fig. 1 shows the multiple alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of the three members of the yeast SMF gene family. The three proteins exhibit about 50% identity to each other, and the main difference between them was found at their N terminus. At this end, Smf3p is shorter then Smf1p by 70 amino acids and by 51 amino acids from Smf2p. These extra pieces are highly populated by charged amino acids. Up to 12 transmembrane segments have been proposed to constitute DCT1, the mammalian homolog of Smf1p (26Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar). We assume that the number of transmembrane segments will be similar in all the family members and 10 or 12 transmembrane segments are likely to exist in these transporters. Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of family members from bacteria, yeast, plants, insects, and mammals suggests that several conserved charged amino acids are present inside the membrane. Among them (using Smf1p amino acid sequence) are Asp-92 in TM1; Glu-160, Asp-167, and Glu-170 in TM3; and His-278 in TM6. The three negatively charged amino acids in TM3 face the same side of an α helix, suggesting a role in translocation of positively charged ions across the membrane. Obviously, the above structural and functional assumptions have to be examined by multiple experimental approaches.Figure 2Effect of EGTA on growth of the various combinations of SMF disruptant mutants. The buffered YPD plates (pH 6) were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The indicated concentrations of filter-sterile sodium-EGTA were added right before the pouring of the warm medium. Cultures of the various yeast strains were washed by sterile distilled water and 5 ml of the cell suspension, adjusted to 0.001 OD, were placed in the indicated positions. The plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of the SMF family members. The amino acid sequences of Smf1p through Smf3p were obtained from GenBank™ as the following reading frames: Smf1p,YOL122c; Smf2p, YHR050w; and Smf3p, YLR034c. The multiple alignment was done using the program Pileup. The Boxshade program was used for visualizing the results (gcg software package).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The main feature of the SMF1 null mutant was its sensitivity to EGTA concentrations, toward which the parental wild-type strain was insensitive (8Supek F. Supekova L. Nerlson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The growth inhibition of ΔSMF1in the presence of EGTA could be alleviated by low concentrations of manganese or copper but not by any other metal ion. Deletion of the genes encoding SMF1 and SMF2 resulted in a double null mutant that was not able to grow at pH 8 but exhibited normal growth in YPD medium buffered at lower pH (27Pinner E. Gruenheid S. Raymond M. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28933-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We generated null mutations in each individual SMF gene as well as combinations of null mutations in these genes. The triple null mutant in the three SMF genes (Δ3SMF) was highly sensitive to EGTA and was not able to grow on YPD medium buffered at pH 7.5. Table Isummarizes the sensitivity and resistance of the various null mutants to the chelator EGTA, pH, various metal ions, high osmolarity, and oxidative stress (obtained by the addition of H2O2 to the medium). All the nullSMF mutants exhibited some sensitivity to EGTA. AlthoughΔSMF1 and ΔSMF2 were quite sensitive to EGTA, ΔSMF3 showed only marginal sensitivity to the chelating agent. The mutant strainsΔSMF1, ΔSMF3, andΔSMF1+3 exhibited resistance to relatively high Co2+ and Mn2+ concentrations in the medium.ΔSMF2 showed resistance to osmotic stress induced by 0.9 m NaCl or 1.6 m glycerol or 1.5 or 1.7 m sorbitol, as well as relative resistance to Mn2+, but only at pH 7.5. The resistance for certain metal ions can be explained in terms of reduced transport activity of these ions in the absence of one or more of the Smf metal ion transporters. It is more difficult to account for the sensitivity to metal ions in the various null mutants. Thus ΔSMF2 mutant was sensitive to Zn2+ and Ni2+;ΔSMF1+2 was sensitive to Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+; andΔSMF1+3 was sensitive to Zn2+. Apparently, disturbances in metal ion homeostasis may elicit pleiotropic effects through alteration and different distribution of the other metal ion transporters and/or signal transduction mediators (7Radisky D.C.

One of the key questions to be answered is how do seemingly unrelated metal ions elicit similar effect in mutants lacking one or more of theSMF genes? Inactivation of the Drosophila homolog of the SMF1 gene resulted in a loss of taste behavior (32Rodrigues V. Cheah P.Y. Ray K. Chia W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3007-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Addition of manganese or iron to the food of these mutants corrected the defect in their taste behavior (33Orgad S. Nelson H. Segal D. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, addition of micromolar concentrations of Cu2+ or Mn2+relieved the growth arrest of the yeast mutant in which theSMF1 gene was interrupted (8Supek F. Supekova L. Nerlson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To gain further information on the phenotype of the various SMF null mutants, we tested their growth under different EGTA concentrations. Fig.2 shows a sensitivity order toward EGTA of ΔSMF1 >ΔSMF2 > ΔSMF3 for the respective null mutants. The parental wild-type strain grew quite well at EGTA concentrations of up to 3 mm. Reduced growth was already detected at 0.5 mm EGTA for the mutantsΔSMF1 and ΔSMF2, and a complete growth arrest of these mutants was obtained at 2 mm EGTA. The mutant ΔSMF3 grew well on plates containing 1 mm EGTA and a complete growth arrest of this mutant was obtained only at 3 mm EGTA. The triple mutant ΔSMF1+2+3 was highly sensitive to the chelating agent and also exhibited pH sensitivity. It grew normally at pH 5.5, grew poorly at pH 6.5, and exhibited a complete growth arrest at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4). 2A. Cohen"
https://openalex.org/W2059906457,"The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a central role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation. Results of treating prostate cancer by androgen ablation indicate that signals mediated through AR are critical for the growth of these tumors. Like other nuclear receptors, AR exerts its transcriptional function by binding tocis-elements upstream of promoters and interacting with other transcriptional factors (e.g. activators, repressors and modulators). To determine the mechanism of AR-regulated transcription, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify AR-associated proteins. One of the proteins we identified is identical to the human origin recognition complex-interacting protein termed HBO1. A ligand-enhanced interaction between AR and HBO1 was further confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that HBO1 is a nuclear protein, and Northern blot analysis revealed that it is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels present in human testis. HBO1 belongs to the MYST family, which is characterized by a highly conserved C2HC zinc finger and a putative histone acetyltransferase domain. Surprisingly, two yeast members of the MYST family, SAS2 and SAS3, have been shown to function as transcription silencers, despite the presence of the histone acetyltransferase domain. Using a GAL4 DNA-binding domain assay, we mapped a transcriptional repression domain within the N-terminal region of HBO1. Transient transfection experiments revealed that HBO1 specifically repressed AR-mediated transcription in both CV-1 and PC-3 cells. These results indicate that HBO1 is a new AR-interacting protein capable of modulating AR activity.

A novel RING finger protein and a testis-specific nuclear protein were also found to interact with AR and/or other nuclear receptors (32Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli M. Janne O.A.

MYST subfamily members include the yeast proteins SAS2 and SAS3 (something aboutsilencing) (36Takechi S. Nakayama T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 266: 405-410Google Scholar, 37Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E.

The MYST proteins are characterized by a highly conserved C2HC zinc finger and a putative histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain (42Wang L. Mizzen C. Ying C. Candau R. Barlev N. Brownell J.

To date there is no evidence to show that MYST proteins can actually acetylate the nucleosomal histones that are directly involved in transcriptional activation. Of interest, full-length HBO1 protein failed to show intrinsic HAT activity (35Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Finally, the yeast SAS2 and SAS3 proteins have been shown to function as transcription silencers (37Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Rivier D.H. Rine J. Genetics. 1997; 145: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Reifsnyder C. Lowell J. Clarke A. Pillus L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that HBO1, a MYST subfamily protein (35Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), can specifically interact with AR in the yeast two-hybrid system. A ligand-enhanced interaction between AR and HBO1 was further confirmedin vivo and in vitro. Several lines of experimentation demonstrated that HBO1 repressed AR-mediated transcription, and the domain responsible was localized to the N-terminal region. These results indicate that HBO1 is a new AR-interacting protein capable of modulating AR activity. The C-terminal region of human AR (amino acids 505–919), spanning both the DBD and LBD, was fused to the GAL4 DBD in the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The construct was transformed into a modified yeast strain PJ69–4A (45James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA library from human prostate tissues with the GAL4 transactivation domain was used in this screening (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Transformants were selected on Sabouraud Dextrose medium lacking adenine, leucine, and tryptophan in the presence of 100 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Positive clones were subjected to the β-galactosidase assay using the colony lift filter method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specificity of interaction was further confirmed by liquid β-galactosidase (β-gal) assay. The N-terminal HBO1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction with two specific oligonucleotide primers. The forward primer is identical to published sequence right before the ATG translation start site (5′-GCCGCTAGCCCGAATCGGAACCGTCGGG-3′), and the reverse primer spans between amino acid residues 245 and 252 (5′-GTGCCTGGTTGCATGCCTGTTGTTG-3′). The full-length HBO1 cDNA was created by ligating the N-terminal polymerase chain reaction fragment and the C-terminal fragment originally isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screening into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in-frame with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG epitope tag. The constructs were sequenced to confirm open reading frames and to verify that no mutations were introduced during polymerase chain reaction. The human AR cDNA, cloned into an SV40 promoter-driven expression vector, pSV-ARo, was kindly provided by Dr. Albert Brinkmann (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The reporter plasmid MMTVpA3-Luc containing the luciferase gene under the control of androgen-responsive elements in the MMTV long terminal repeat was provided by Dr. Richard Pestell (Albert Einstein Medical College, New York, NY) (46Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). An SV40-driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pSV-β-GAL) (Promega, Madison, WI) was used in this study as an internal control. A human ER expression construct (pcDNA3-ER) and a luciferase reporter plasmid with three estrogen responsive elements were kindly provided by Dr. Myles Brown (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). A human thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) expression vector driven by the SV40 promoter and a luciferase reporter controlled by two thyroid hormone-responsive elements were kindly provided by Dr. Anthony Hollenberg (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) (47Heidenberg H.B.

Human HBO1 N-terminal (encoding 1–360 amino acids) and C-terminal (encoding 230–611 amino acids) fragments were cloned downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pSP271 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Donald Ayer, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT) and a modified pCDNA3 vector with a nuclear targeting sequence. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the chicken myelomonocytic growth factor gene minimal promoter (−41 to +61) with or without four GAL4 binding sites were also provided by Dr. Donald Ayer. Both deletion mutants of HBO1 and AR were cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for making GST fusion proteins as described previously (31Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Blots with RNA from multiple human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH Inc. The Poly(A) RNA was prepared from prostate cancer cell lines, including LNCaP, MDA PCa2a and 2b (49Navone N.M. Olive M. Ozen M. Davis R. Troncoso P. Tu S.M. Johnston D. Pollack A. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Logothetis C.J. Clin Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2493-2500PubMed Google Scholar), PC-3, and TSU-pr1 (50Isaacs J.T. Kyprianou N. Urol. Res. 1987; 15: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), by using an Oligotex kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For Northern blotting, 2 μg of poly(A) RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting in 20× SSC and hybridized with a DNA fragment (1–234 amino acids) derived from human HBO1. β-Actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to normalize loadings. CV-1 or PC-3 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated (2%) coverslips the day before transfection. An HA-tagged HBO1 cDNA in pcDNA3 vector was transiently transfected into cells. After 24 h, cells were fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and washed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with either anti-HA-monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, catalog number sc-7392) or anti-HA polyclonal antibody (catalog number sc-805) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (catalog number sc2010) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. For staining of actin-cytoskeleton, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated Phalloidin (Sigma). Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (31Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The full-length human HBO1 and AR proteins were generated and labeledin vitro by the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Equal amounts of GST-AR or -HBO1 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with radiolabeled HBO1 or AR proteins at 4 °C for 2 h in the modified NETN buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 μm ZnCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Beads were carefully washed four times in NETN buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The human AR expression vector pARo, alone or with a FLAG-tagged pCDNA3/HBO1 expression plasmid, was transfected into CV-1 cells. Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 10 nm R1881 for 48 h and then harvested in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5% glycerol). Whole cell lysates were incubated with mouse normal IgG or FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Pre-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose beads were then added and, after an hour of incubation, collected by centrifugation and gently washed three times with the same buffer as described above. Specific protein complexes were eluted by 100 ng/ml of FLAG peptide in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The eluted samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with 1:200 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of AR (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA; catalog number sc-816). Proteins were detected using ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both a monkey kidney cell line, CV-1, and a human prostate cell line, PC-3, were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Denver, CO). Transient transfections were carried out by using a LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 3 × 104 cells were plated in a 24-well plate 16 h before transfection. About 400 ng of total plasmid DNA/well were used in the transfection. The total amount of plasmid per dish was kept constant by adding pcDNA3 empty vector. Approximately 16 h after transfection the cells were washed and fed medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped (steroid hormone free) fetal calf serum (HyClone, Denver, CO) in the presence or absence of steroid hormones. Cells were incubated for another 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured as relative light units as described previously (51Sun Z. Pan J. Hope W.X. Cohen S.N. Balk S.P. Cancer. 1999; 86: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The relative light units from individual transfections were normalized by β-galactosidase activity in the same samples. Individual transfection experiments were done in triplicate, and the results are reported as the mean relative light units/β-galactosidase (± S.D.) from representative experiments. To identify AR interacting proteins, we screened a human prostate library with a GAL4 DBD fusion encoding the DBD and LBD of AR. Of 2 × 106transformants, 75 positive clones were identified by both adenine and β-galactosidase production in the presence of DHT. Sequence analysis revealed that one of these clones (PG159) is identical to the C terminus of a recently identified novel protein (GenBankTMaccession number AF074606), named HBO1 (histone acetyltransferase binding to the origin recognition complex 1) (35Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction, we transformed the PG159 clone with various constructs containing either GAL4DBD alone or fusion proteins with different fragments derived from AR (Fig. 1 A). On the adenine minus plate, yeast colonies were only observed in the samples transformed with PG159 and GAL4DBD-AR fusion construct containing both the DBD and LBD in the presence of androgen (data not shown). There were no colonies observed in the transformants with other AR fusions. Liquid β-gal assay was performed to quantify the interactions. Constructs containing the GAL4 activation domain and either the C-terminal HBO1 or ARA70 (23Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), an AR coactivator, showed a strong induction with the AR-DBD-LBD in the presence of DHT. An AR-LBD construct also showed an increase in β-gal in the presence of DHT (Fig. 1 B). These results imply that HBO1 protein interacts with AR LBD in the presence of DHT and that the interaction is more pronounced in the presence of the DBD. HBO1 is a new member of the MYST superfamily. It contains a unique N-terminal serine-rich region and the conserved C-terminal region with a C2HC zinc finger and putative acetyltransferase domain (Fig.2). To generate the full-length HBO1 cDNA, primers were designed to amplify the N-terminal fragment of HBO1. A 0.7-kilobase fragment was generated from the Marathon Ready cDNA libraries derived from human prostate tissues that perfectly matched the published sequence of HBO1 (35Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Comparison of the C termini of Tip60 and HBO1 revealed significant sequence identity (Fig. 2). To verify the interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, GST pull-down experiments were carried out with a series of GST-AR fusion proteins (31Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled full-length HBO1 protein bound to GST-AR fusion proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. As seen in Fig.3 A, a strong retention of HBO1 protein was specifically observed for the samples with GST-AR containing both the DBD and LBD (505–919 amino acids) in the presence of DHT. A weak interaction was also observed for the full LBD (676–919 amino acids) but not with AR-activation domain (1–563 amino acids), DBD (505–676 amino acids), and GST or beads alone. Using two additional GST-AR fusion proteins consisting of the partial LBD (676–844 amino acids) and AF2 truncated mutants (875–919 amino acids), we further determined that the full-length LBD is required for the interaction (Fig. 3 A, right panel). In these experiments, the interactions were not significantly affected by adding DHT (data not shown). These results are consistent with those of the yeast two-hybrid experiments and suggest that both the DBD and LBD of AR are required for the interaction with HBO1. To map the interaction region of HBO1 protein, GST pull-down experiments were repeated with GST-HBO1 fusion proteins containing the N-terminal (1–360 amino acids) or C-terminal domains (230–611 amino acids). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the C terminus of HBO1 strongly precipitated in vitro-translated AR protein. A recent report has shown that the C-terminal region of Tip60, another member of the MYST subfamily, interacts with AR (52Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This observation further suggests the possibility that both the C2HC zinc finger and acetyltransferase domain may contribute to the binding with AR (Fig.2). To determine whether an interaction between HBO1 and AR occurs in vivo, we tagged HBO1 at its N terminus with a FLAG epitope and expressed this tagged HBO1 protein together with AR protein in CV-1 cells. Both AR and FLAG-HBO1 proteins were detected in the transfected cells (Fig. 3 C, top and middle panels). Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG or an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. To increase the specificity of protein complexes precipitated by FLAG antibody, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with antigenic FLAG peptide. Eluted protein complexes were then analyzed by Western blot using AR N-terminal antibody. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig.3 C, AR protein was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with AR and FLAG-HBO1 (lane 4) but not in those from cells transfected with AR alone (lane 2) or when normal mouse IgG was used (lanes 1 and3). These results demonstrated that interaction between the full-length AR and HBO1 proteins also occurs in vivo. Northern blot analysis was carried out to detect the expression of HBO1 in human tissues with a specific probe covering the first 234 amino acid residues of HBO1 protein. A 3.6-kilobase transcript of HBO1 was detected ubiquitously in various tissues but most abundantly in testis (Fig.4 A). In contrast, Iizuka and Stillman (35Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) recently reported that HBO1 was highly expressed in ovarian tissue. To address this issue, the Northern blot analysis was repeated following the conditions described in the previous report. Again, we found that HBO1 is highly expressed in human testis (data not shown). We also performed Northern blot analysis on RNA samples isolated from several prostate cancer cell lines, including AR-positive cells (LNCaP, MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b) and AR-negative cells (PC-3 and TSU) (Fig.4 B). Using the same DNA probe as above, a 3.6-kilobase transcript of HBO1 was consistently detected in all cell lines tested (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the AR-HBO1 interaction takes place upon AR translocation into the nucleus, immunofluorescence assays were performed to examine the subcellular localization of HB"

Purified recombinant AtRrp41p displays a processive phosphorolytic exonuclease activity and requires a single-stranded poly(A) tail on a substrate RNA as a “loading pad.” The expression of the Arabidopsis RRP41 cDNA in yeast rescues the 5.8 S rRNA processing and 3′→5′ mRNA degradation defects of the yeastski6–100 mutant.

In yeast, a large, ∼300–400 kDa complex, the exosome, mediates many of these reactions (2, 21; for review, see Ref. 26van Hoof A. Parker R. Cell. 1999; 99: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Two major forms of the exosome, nuclear and cytoplasmic, have been identified, each containing at least 10 common “core” components, Rrp4p, Rrp40p-Rrp46p, Mtr3p, and Csl4p proteins. In addition, Rrp6p appears to be associated only with the nuclear form of the exosome. Furthermore, RNA helicases Dob1p and Ski2p are required for at least some activities of the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of the exosome, respectively, although their physical associations with it have not been documented. Interestingly, all but one of the core exosome subunits either have been shown to be 3′→5′ exonucleases in vitro or were predicted to have such activity, based on sequence similarity to known exonucleases. Six of the exosome components (Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, Rrp45p, Rrp46p, and Mtr3p) are homologous to the Escherichia coli RNase PH, and the recombinant yeast Rrp41p has a phosphorolytic, processive 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (21Mitchell P.

Rrp4p and Rrp40p are homologous to each other and, along with Csl4p, contain a predicted S1 RNA binding motif. Recombinant Rrp4p is a hydrolytic, distributive 3′→5′ exonuclease. Rrp44p is homologous to the E. coli RNase R, of the RNase II family, and exhibits a hydrolytic, processive mode of RNA degradation. Finally, Rrp6p is a member of the RNase D family, and the recombinant Rrp6p has a hydrolytic 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (9Burkard K. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The immunopurified exosome exhibits an activity that is most similar to that of the Rrp4p subunit, but it is not known how the multiple catalytic activities in the exosome are coordinated in vivo. All 10 core exosome subunits are essential for viability. This finding is most consistent with the view that an intact complex is required for the proper exosome function, and the loss of any one of the core subunits leads to a failure to assemble the complex properly. In addition, there does not appear to be a sizable pool of the uncomplexed subunits in the cell. Furthermore, many of the partial loss of function exosome mutants show very similar molecular phenotypes, for example in the case of the 5.8 S rRNA processing (1Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5399-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 16Jacobs Anderson J.S. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 21Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, certain exosome mutants, particularly those affecting the Rrp6p subunit, show very distinct RNA processing defects, suggesting that multiple subunits are involved in the processing of some exosome substrates, with individual enzymes catalyzing sequential processing steps (for discussion, see Ref. 26van Hoof A. Parker R. Cell. 1999; 99: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that exosome-like complexes are also present in other eukaryotes. A number of exosome subunit homologs could be identified in other species via BLAST searches. The human homologs of Rrp6p (PM-Scl100p) and Rrp4p can be coimmunoprecipitated, and PM-Scl100p, human Rrp4p, and human Rrp45p (PM-Scl75p) are all found in a large, exosome-sized complex (2Allmang C. Petfalski E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Mitchell P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2148-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition, just like the yeast Rrp6p, its human homolog is only present in the nuclear form of the complex. Additional data supporting the notion of functional conservation of the exosome come from the complementation of the phenotypes of the partial loss of function mutations in the yeastRRP4, RRP44 (DIS3), andCSL4 genes by the corresponding human cDNAs. However, in none of these cases was complementation of null alleles achieved. Therefore, it remains possible that the partial complementation reflects the ability of these subunits to perform their function as individual proteins. Indeed, the human Rrp4p was not stably incorporated into the yeast exosome complex (21Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the exosome subunit Rrp41p (Ski6p). In contrast to the above examples, AtRRP41 cDNA readily complements the null allele of the yeast RRP41 gene. In addition, its expression in the partial loss of function yeast mutantski6–100 corrects the defects in the 5.8 S rRNA processing and 3′→5′ mRNA degradation. Purified AtRrp41p behaves in vitro as a processive phosphorolytic exonuclease, and interestingly, it requires a single-stranded poly(A) tail on the substrate RNA as a “loading pad.” The ArabidopsisAtRrp41p protein is found predominantly in a high molecular mass complex in plant cells as well as in yeast, suggesting that it could restore the integrity of the exosome complex through evolutionarily conserved interactions with the yeast exosome proteins. In support of this view, the recombinant AtRrp41p protein interacts in vitro with the two yeast exosome subunit proteins, Rrp44p and Rrp4p. An Arabidopsis cDNA library derived from immature flower buds described in (30Weigel D. Alvarez J. Smyth D.R. Yanofsky M.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 843-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. A. thaliana strain Columbia was from Lehle Seeds. The yeast strain P118 (MATa his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1 ura3–52 gal2 galΔ108 GAL10::proteinA-RRP41(21Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar)) was a kind gift from Phil Mitchell and David Tollervey. Yeast strains yRP840 (MATa his4–539 leu2−3, 112 trp1-Δ1 ura3–52 cup1::LEU2/PGK1pG/ MFA2pG) and yRP1204 (MATα his4–539 leu2−3, 112 lys2−201 trp1-Δ1 ura3–52 cup1::LEU2/PGK1pG/MFA2pG ski6::URA3[ski6–100/LYS2]) were kindly provided by Roy Parker. Thecup1::LEU2/ PGK1pG/MFA2pG construct containsMFA2 and PGK1 genes with poly(G) insertions in their 3′-untranslated regions, each driven by the GAL1promoter, integrated into the CUP1 locus (15Hatfield L. Beelman C.A. Stevens A. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5830-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PNPase1-deficient E. coli strain CA244, Pnp− (31Zhou Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4391-4395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Murray Deutscher. An AtRRP41 probe used to screen the cDNA library was obtained by PCR amplification of the AtRRP41 sequence fragment contained within EST T43164 and overlapping with it EST 116G11XP, using oligonucleotides oDB464 (5′-CAAGAGCCAGCAAAAGAAGAA-3′) and oDB465 (5′-TTATGCAGCTCGGCGATACTC-3′). The library was screened using standard protocols (3). The phage with the longest insert was converted into plasmid form and sequenced. Oligonucleotides used for the 3′-RACE (12Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) on Arabidopsispoly(A)+ RNA were: (dT)17 adapter primer TRACER (5′-GATGGTACCTCTAGAGCTCT17-3′), adapter primer RACER (5′-GATGGTACCTCTAGAGCTC-3′), and AtRRP41 gene-specific primer oDB471 (5′-ACGCGAGGTACTTCAAGA-3′). 5′-RACE was done using theAtRRP41 gene-specific oligonucleotide oDB507 (5′-TGAATCGGCGACCATCTAAT-3′), but it did not produce any products that extended beyond the 5′-end of the sequence contained within the longest insert isolated by a hybridization screen of the cDNA library. For yeast complementation studies, the AtRRP41 open reading frame was amplified with the Pfu DNA polymerase using oligonucleotides oDB474 (5′-atggatccATGGAGTACGTAAACCCTGAA-3′; nucleotides that are not part of the AtRRP41 sequence are shown in lowercase) and oDB465 (5′-TTATGCAGCTCGGCGATACTC-3′). The amplified fragment was blunt end cloned into the SmaI site of the plasmid p112A1NE (24Riesmeier J.W. Willmitzer L. Frommer W.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), yielding the construct pDB460, in which the AtRRP41 sense strand is transcribed from theADH1 promoter. To create the GST fusion for the expression in E. coli, the same Pfu-amplified product was cut with BamHI and cloned into pGEX2T that was cleaved withEcoRI, filled in with Klenow fragment, and then cleaved withBamHI, to yield the construct pDB459. For the expression of AtRrp41p as a fusion to the maltose-binding protein (MBP), the AtRrp41p open reading frame was cloned into pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) to create pDB512. The following sequences were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers are given in parentheses): Arabidopsis PNPase (CAB43864), E. coli PNPase (P05055), Spinacia oleracea PNPase (U52048), Bacillus subtilis RNase PH (M85163), E. coli RNase PH (L10328, fragment),Pyrococcus horikoshii RNase PH (BAA30661), andSaccharomyces cerevisiae Rrp41p (CAA97221). Sequence alignment and tree building were performed using the Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI. Sequences were aligned using PileUp, edited with LineUp to exclude nonhomologous portions, distance matrix created with Distances (using Kimura correction for amino acid sequences), and the tree constructed by GrowTree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Expression of the GST-AtRrp41p fusion in pGEX2T (construct pDB459) was carried out in the BL21 host strain containing the E. coli dnaY gene on the plasmid pUBS520 (7Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). AtA 600 = 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the culture was induced overnight at 20 °C. Cells were washed in buffer A (50 mm Tris pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 0.01 volume of buffer A with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by sonication, and total extract was cleared by a 30-min centrifugation at 17,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor and loaded onto glutathione-agarose (Sigma). After extensive washing with buffer A, fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in buffer A. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. MBP-AtRrp41p was expressed in a similar manner, and the purification was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The PAB3 open reading frame was PCR-amplified using thePfu polymerase and primers oDB413 (5′-tataccatgGCCGATCAAACCCACCCGAAC-3′) and oDB481a (5′-ccaagtcgacGTCGGTGGTAGAGAAACCAA-3′; nucleotides that are not part of the PAB3 sequence are shown in lowercase). The resulting product was cut with SalI and cloned into pET24a that was cut with NdeI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and cut withXhoI. The resulting construct, pDB467, encodes the Pab3p with an added hexahistidine tag at its C terminus. The Pab3p protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) coexpressing the E. coli dnaYgene. Induction was carried out for 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature. Cells were washed with buffer X (20 mm Tris pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol), concentrated and lysed as for AtRrp41p, extract loaded onto ProBond resin (Invitrogen), washed with buffer X with 20 mmimidazole, and eluted with buffer X plus 200 mm imidazole. Purified Pab3p protein was tested in a gel shift assay with oligo(A)23 and was found to have a K d of 10 nm (not shown). The RNA substrates used for exonuclease assays were generated as follows: Oligo(A)23 (from Oligo Etc.) was 5′ labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. pSP65A38, containing a 38-nucleotide long poly(A) tract inserted between the PstI and HindIII sites of the polylinker of pSP65 (22Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was linearized with HindIII orSalI as indicated in the text and transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP with SP6 RNA polymerase. Bluescript SK(+) was cut with NotI and transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP with the T7 RNA polymerase. Where indicated, the resulting transcript was polyadenylated by yeast poly(A) polymerase (United States Biochemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To create templates for making transcripts with the 3′-poly(A) or poly(U) tail, a fragment of the Bluescript polylinker was amplified with the M13 “-20” primer and either oDB522 (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCCGCTCTAGAACT-3′) or the oDB523 (5′-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGCCGCTCTAGAACT-3′).In vitro transcription on the resulting double-stranded products, incorporating the T7 promoter sequence, was done with the T7 RNA polymerase. The transcripts obtained from these reactions are identical in sequence to those produced from the Bluescript SK(+) template cut with NotI, except for the addition of the (A)20 or (U)20 tail. Except where noted, all in vitro made transcripts were purified on a denaturing gel prior to use and heated at 75 °C for 8 min, snap-cooled on ice, and added to the reaction mix. Northern blot analysis and RNase H treatment were done as described (10Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes were as follows: for the 7 S precursor, 5′-TGAGAAGGAAATGACGCT-3′; for the mature 5.8 S rRNA, 5′-GCGTTGTTCATCGATGC-3′; for MFA2pG, 5′-ATATTGATTAGATCAGGAATTCC-3′; and for scR1 RNA, 5′-GTCTAGCCGCGAGGAAGG-3′. Quantitations were done on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. For the AtRRP41 expression survey, total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis tissues as described (18Logemann J. Schell J Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar), reverse transcribed in a 30-μl reaction with SuperScript II (Life Technologies) using oligo(dT) primer, and 1 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used directly for PCR with oDB474 and oDB465. Yeast techniques were according to (13Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R. (1991) Methods Enzymol. , 194.Google Scholar). For plasmid linkage analysis of the complementation phenotype, P118 transformed with pDB460 was grown in synthetic complete galactose medium supplemented with tryptophan for 3 days, plated onto YPGal plates, and 1,000 individual colonies were streaked in a grid onto synthetic complete galactose plates with and without tryptophan. The Trp− isolates were selected and streaked onto YPGal and YPD (glucose) plates. The exonuclease assay was performed in a 100-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 unit/μl RNasin, up to 3 pmol of GST-AtRrp41p fusion protein, and a 32P-labeled RNA substrate. Sodium phosphate was added to 10 mm final concentration where indicated. 15-μl aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 90 min and overnight incubation, added directly into 15 μl of sequencing loading mix, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% acrylamide, 7m urea gels in 1 × TBE. Ascending thin layer chromatography was done on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Sigma) in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. 100 nmol of cold 5′-UMP or 5′-UDP standards was added to the samples before loading. Standards were visualized by UV shadowing. To determine the native size of AtRrp41p in yeast, antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide with the sequence CENTKQLEYRRAA, corresponding to the very C terminus of AtRrp41p except for the addition of the first cysteine. This peptide was coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) and used as an immunogen to produce polyclonal antibody in rabbits. Yeast total protein extract and sedimentation through glycerol density gradient were as described (21Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), and Western analysis was done according to standard protocols (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Total plant extracts were prepared as described (29Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and resolved by sedimentation through glycerol gradients in the same way as for yeast extracts. For initial assays, the 10 open reading frames of the core exosomal subunits were PCR amplified with primer pairs purchased from Research Genetics (YHR069C (Rrp4p), YOL142W (Rrp40p), YDL111C (Rrp42p), YCR035C (Rrp43p), YDR280W (Rrp45p), YGR095C (Rrp46p), YGR158C (Mtr3p), YOL021C (Rrp44p), YNL232W (Csl4p), and YOR001W(Rrp6p)) and cloned into Bluescript. Linearized templates were transcribed and translatedin vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of the [35S]methionine. The resulting radioactive polypeptides were used to challenge ∼5 μg of GST or GST-AtRrp41p fusion prebound to the glutathione resin (Sigma), in the final volume of 250 μl of buffer A + 0.1 m KCl for several hours at 4 °C. After six washes with 0.3 ml of the binding buffer, the bound species were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For the assays shown on Fig. 10, 10 μg of purified recombinant yeast Rrp44p or Rrp4p was prebound to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) and challenged with 5 μg of GST or the recombinant GST-AtRrp41p. After six washes with 0.3 ml of the binding buffer, bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the AtRrp41p-specific antibody. Mock-treated resin was used as negative control. No binding of GST alone to either resin was observed. A TBLASTN search of theArabidopsis EST data base using the amino acid sequence of the yeast Rrp41p as a query, yielded a single strong hit (P(N) = 9.1Xe−9, GenBank accession number T43164). The full-length cDNA corresponding to this EST, hereafter referred to as AtRRP41, was reconstructed by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of an Arabidopsisimmature flower cDNA library (GenBank accession number AF191741). Southern analysis demonstrated that AtRrp41p is encoded by a single copy gene, and an RT-PCR tissue survey showed that it is expressed in all Arabidopsis tissues tested, including roots, stems, cauline and mature leaves, flowers, pollen, and siliques (not shown). Although these data cannot exclude qualitative or quantitative differences in the AtRRP41 expression at the level of individual cell types, they are most consistent with the view that AtRrp41p is encoded by a single gene that is constitutively expressed. Phylogenetic analysis of several amino acid sequences related to Rrp41p (see “Experimental Procedures”) supported the expectation that the AtRrp41p belongs to the family of RNase PH-like proteins (20Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and is most closely related to the yeast Rrp41p (38% identity, 50% similarity at the amino acid level). All of the amino acid residues universally conserved in the RNase PH family proteins, some of which are likely to be important for catalysis, are also present in AtRrp41p (not shown). We expressed the PCR-amplified AtRrp41p open reading frame as a fusion to GST in E. coli and purified it using the affinity tag (Fig. 1 A). To test whether it has an exonucleolytic activity that would be expected of a bona fide homolog of the Rrp41p, the 5′-end 32P-labeled oligo(A)23 was incubated with the fusion protein or with the GST alone as a control. Only an incubation with the GST-AtRrp41p fusion protein, but not with the GST alone, resulted in the degradation of the RNA substrate (Fig. 2). A rapid accumulation of short degradation products showing a precursor-product relationship with the full-length substrate labeled at the 5′-end strongly suggests that the enzyme acts in a 3′→5′ direction. Also, the fact that the binding of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to the 3′-terminal poly(A) tail completely protects polyadenylated RNA substrate from the AtRrp41p (below) is consistent with 3′→5′, but not 5′→3′, directionality. The predominance of very short products over intermediate length ones, even at those time points at which some full-length substrate still remained intact, suggests that AtRrp41p is most likely a processive enzyme (see also Fig. 6). To exclude the possibility that our results were affected by a tendency of the GST to dimerize (19Maru Y. Afar D.E. Witte O.N. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15353-15357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we have also assayed the AtRrp41p that was separated from the GST moiety by thrombin cleavage. In addition, we have expressed and purified the AtRrp41p as a fusion to MBP, naturally a monomer (Fig. 1 B). In both cases, a similar, processive exonucleolytic 3′→5′ activity was observed (see Fig. 5 and data not shown).Figure 2Exonuclease activity of AtRrp41p. 3 pmol of GST-AtRrp41p fusion protein, or GST alone, was incubated with the32P 5′-end-labeled oligo(A)23 RNA using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” (with 10 mm sodium phosphate), for 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 90 min, as indicated above the lanes.

Such enzymes use inorganic phosphate for the attack on the phosphodiester bond. Therefore, their ability to degrade RNA is phosphate-dependent, and they release mononucleoside diphosphates as the final reaction product. The assay shown in Fig. 2 was conducted in the presence of 10 mm inorganic phosphate. When phosphate was omitted, no substrate degradation occurred (Fig.3 A). The product released in the AtRrp41p reaction conducted in the presence of inorganic phosphate was identified by TLC as a mononucleoside diphosphate (Fig.3 C), confirming the expectation that the AtRrp41p is a phosphorolytic enzyme. Surprisingly, when we tested the AtRrp41p using two additional substrates, very different results were obtained. First, an RNA substrate of ∼100 nucleotides, including a 38-nucleotide poly(A) tail, was transcribed in vitro by an SP6 RNA polymerase from the pSP65(A)38 template (22Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs.3 B and 4 A, it was readily digested by the AtRrp41p. However, the transcript made with the T7 RNA polymerase from the Bluescript SK(+) template digested withNotI was significantly more resistant (Fig. 4 B). Additional assays were performed to distinguish between the poly(A) tail dependence of the enzyme and the inhibitory effects of the particular structures or sequences present in the Bluescript-derived RNA. First, pSP65(A)38 RNA was deadenylated in vitro using an oligo(dT) and RNase H, purified, and incubated with the AtRrp41p. Only a very slow degradation of the resulting deadenylated RNA was observed (Fig. 4 C). In addition, we assayed unadenylated pSP65 RNA made from the pSP65(A)38template cut with SalI, which cleaves before the run of 38 Ts on the template strand. The resulting RNA substrate was also much more resistant to the AtRrp41p digestion than the substrate transcribed from the HindIII-cut pSP65(A)38 template that had a 38-nucleotide long 3′-poly(A) tail (Fig. 4 D). Finally, we have assayed the transcript of the Bluescript polylinker that was modified by an addition of poly(A) tail to the 3′-end with poly(A) polymerase. The resulting polyadenylated transcript became as susceptible to the action of the AtRrp41p enzyme as pSP65(A)38 (Fig. 4 E). Both the GST and MBP fusions of the AtRrp41p were used in these experiments, with identical results. It has been"

Recently, it has been shown that MMPs may play a role in the degradation of fibrin. We have now investigated the role of collagenase-2 (MMP-8), macrophage elastase (MMP-12), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) in the degradation of fibrinogen and Factor XII of the plasma clotting system.

We have identified the amino termini of the major protein fragments. Cleavage of fibrinogen occurred in all chains and resulted in significantly impaired clotting. Moreover, rapid proteolytic inactivation of Factor XII (Hageman factor) by MMP-12, MMP-13, and MMP-14 was noted. These results support the hypothesis of an impaired thrombolytic potential of MMP-degraded Factor XII in vivo. MMP-induced degradation of fibrinogen supports a plasmin-independent fibrinolysis mechanism.

MMP-induced degradation of fibrinogen supports a plasmin-independent fibrinolysis mechanism. Consequently, degradation of these proteins may be important in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and angiogenesis, all of which are known to be influenced by MMP activity. matrix metalloproteinase batimastat catalytic domain fibrinopeptide A high performance liquid chromatography membrane-type MMP polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene difluoride The matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs1 and matrixins, form a family of structurally and functionally related zinc-containing endopeptidases. Together they are able to degrade most of the constituents of the extracellular matrix such as basement membrane, collagens, proteoglycans, fibronectin, and laminin (1Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). Thus, they are implicated in connective tissue remodeling processes associated with embryonic development, pregnancy, growth, and wound repair (2Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The deleterious potential of the MMPs is normally controlled by the endogenous and specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases or the more general nonspecific α2-macroglobulin (3Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Disturbance of the well balanced equilibrium of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases results in pathological situations such as rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, tumor growth, metastasis, and fibrosis (4Nagase H.

In addition to degradation of extracellular matrix constituents, plasma proteins such as serpins (9Knäuper V. Reinke H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or fibrinogen and cross-linked fibrin (10Bini A. Itoh Y. Kudryk B.J. Nagase H.

Fibrinogen is a 340-kDa dimeric glycoprotein consisting of a pair of three polypeptide chains Aα, Bβ, and γ that are interconnected by 29 disulfide bonds. The amino termini of these chains are joined together in a central domain that can be isolated as a single fragment from a plasmin digestion of fibrinogen (13Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 193-229Crossref Scopus (528) Google Scholar). During blood coagulation, fibrinogen participates in both the cellular phase and the fluid phase of blood clot formation (14Herrick S. Blanc-Brude O. Gray A. Laurent G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Henschen-Edman A.H. Haemost. 1999; 29: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen can be converted into an insoluble fibrin clot as a consequence of thrombin-catalyzed removal of fibrinopeptides A (FpA, Aα-(20–35)) 2Numbering of amino acids includes signal peptide sequences. and B (FpB, Bβ-(31–44)) from the Aα and Bβ chains (16Gorkun O.V. Veklich Y.I. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the ordinary route of thrombin generation (17Butenas S. Van't Veer C. Mann K.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via the tissue factor pathway, an alternative route exists that is initiated by the activation of Factor XII (Hageman factor) (18Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The activation of Hageman factor to yield active α-Factor XIIa takes place by a single cleavage at 372R↓V373 (numbering includes signal peptide) (19McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5328-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eventually, cleavage at353R↓N354 and362R↓L363 leads to the β-Factor XII (20Fujikawa K. McMullen B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10924-10933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which still exhibits full catalytic activity. After several more steps of zymogen activation, this alternative route leads into the ordinary pathway of blood coagulation, terminating in the proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. The purpose of this work is to examine the role of MMPs in the degradation of fibrinogen and Factor XII. We therefore examined the clotting of MMP-digested fibrinogen to support the idea that some of the biological functions of fibrinogen might be hampered (11Bini A. Wu D. Schnuer J. Kudryk B.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13928-13936Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition to this, the previously unreported degradation (and inactivation) of Factor XII is shown here. All digestions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by automated sequencing to characterize the generated fragments and identify the cleavage sites. Lyophilized human fibrinogen (F4883, >95% clottable and essentially plasminogen-free according to the manufacturer) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Thrombin and Owren's Veronal buffer (28.4 mm sodium barbital in 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.35) were supplied by DADE (Aguada). EDTA and the synthetic serine proteinase inhibitor Pefabloc® SC (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride) were delivered from Merck. The chromogenic thrombin substrate S-2302 was supplied by Chromogenix (Moelndal, Sweden). Active recombinant human cdMT1-MMP-(Ile114–Ile318) and cdMMP-8-(Met80–Gly242) were prepared as described previously (21Lichte A. Kolkenbrock H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Kleine T. Bartsch S. Bläser J. Schnierer S. Triebel S. Valentin M. Gote T. Tschesche H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14125-14131Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Active human neutrophil gelatinase B (MMP-9) was purified as described previously (23Triebel S. Bläser J. Reinke H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Active human recombinant cdMT2-MMP was a generous gift from Dr. Horst Will of INVITEK, Berlin-Buch, Germany (24Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The cdMMP-12 cDNA (base pairs 310–801) was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from total RNA isolation of placental tissue. The fragment was ligated into the vector pET-11a. pET-11a/cdMMP-12 was transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL-21(DE3). Cells were grown to mid-log growth phase (A 560, 0.6) and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Harvested cells were lysed, and the overexpressed protein was isolated as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in a urea buffer and dialysed three times against Tris buffer. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography (25Moore W.M. Spilburg C.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5189-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After elution with urea buffer, cdMMP-12 was refolded by dialyzing three times against Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The proΔMMP-13 cDNA (base pairs 71–805) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pEMBL-19 containing the complete cDNA for procollagenase-3 derived by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from total RNA isolated from breast cancer cells (26Freije J.M.P. Dietz-Itza I. Balbin M. Sanchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting 734-base pair fragment was cloned into the expression vector pET-12b and E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The expression and purification of the inclusion bodies were performed as described for cdMMP-12. The protein was purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography and gel filtration with Sephacryl S-100. The isolated proΔMMP-13 was activated before use by incubation with 5 mm HgCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. MMP activity was determined by gelatin zymography (27Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) and by a continuous assay using MCA peptide ((7-methoxy-coumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3-[2, 4-dinitrophenyl]-1–2-3-diaminopropionyl)-Ala-Arg-NH2) as a synthetic substrate (28Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen was incubated with cdMMP-8 in a 1:50 enzyme/substrate molar ratio at 37 °C for different time intervals. In the case of cdMMP-12, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP, a ratio of 1:10 was employed. All reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mg/ml Pefabloc® SC, and 100 μm ZnCl2. Digestions were terminated by addition of 0.1 μl of EDTA (0.1 μmol) and a third part of denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, 8 m urea, 30 mm NaCl, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). All reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. All reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels under reducing conditions followed by silver staining (29Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The molecular weights of apparent bands were estimated (30Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clotting time of cdMT1-MMP-treated fibrinogen was determined with a semiautomatic coagulometer by the functional method of Clauss (31Clauss A. Acta Haematol. Jpn. 1957; 17: 237-246Crossref Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). 1.03 mg of fibrinogen (3.97 nmol) in Owren's Veronal buffer was preincubated for different time intervals at 37 °C with the corresponding amount of MMP-8, MMP-12, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP, respectively. Substrate cleavage was stopped by adding a 10× molar excess of BB-94. Clotting was initiated by adding 200 μl of thrombin (90 NIH units/ml) to 200 μl of the pre-warmed (37 °C) fibrinogen sample. A timer was started with addition of the thrombin solution and halted automatically at the point of clotting by a metallic oscillator. Under the conditions used, clotting time depended mainly on the concentration of fibrinogen. The concentration of the remaining clottable fibrinogen was calculated from the clotting time according to a calibration curve that was established with known amounts of untreated fibrinogen. After enzymatic digestion Factor XII fragments were directly separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and electroblotted to a PVDF membrane (32Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen digestion products were first separated by reverse-phase HPLC and then run on 10% gels under reducing and denaturing conditions. After transferring the protein fragments to a PVDF membrane in 50 mmborate/NaOH buffer, pH 9.0, containing 20% methanol, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 solution. Protein bands were cut out of the membranes and subjected to automated sequencing on a Knauer gas-phase sequencer with online phenylthiohydantoin-derivative amino acid identification (33Reinke H. Fischer S. Reimann F. Tschesche H. Jornvall H. Hoog J.-O. Gustavson A.M. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1991: 55-66Crossref Google Scholar). To identify the MMP cleavage sites in fibrinogen, a sample of the digested protein was subjected to separation by reverse-phase HPLC using a Bakerbond C18-wide pore column. Elution of fibrinogen fragments was performed at ambient temperature using a gradient obtained with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (solvent B). Column flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. Collected fractions were lyophilized, diluted in denaturing buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to a PVDF membrane. 50 μl of Factor XII (400 μg/ml) was incubated with 5 μl of active MMP (200 μg/ml) in 50 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 100 μmZnCl2 for 45 and 90 min at 37 °C. After the incubation time was over, 1 μl of batimastat solution (1 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 5 min to inhibit MMP activity. 50 μl of this solution was mixed with 100 μl of S-2302 solution (4 mm) and the absorbance at 405 nm (reference: 490 nm) was measured with an interval of 2 min for 32 min overall. Measurements of the buffer alone, the batimastat solution, the active MMP alone, and the Factor XII solution without active MMP were taken as controls. We examined the catabolic activities of several MMPs on fibrinogen. Samples of digestion were taken at different time intervals, heat-treated in denaturing buffer, and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. The time course of fibrinogen degradation after incubation with cdMT1-MMP is shown in Fig. 1 A. Under reducing conditions in SDS gels, fibrinogen was separated into its subunits. The Aα, Bβ, and γ chains could be distinguished. The catalytic domain of MT1-MMP digested fibrinogen rapidly and extensively when an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:10 was employed. cdMT1-MMP treatment of fibrinogen resulted in the complete disappearance of fibrinogen α-chain after a 1-min incubation. In turn, several smaller α-chain fragments with molecular masses of 15, 13, and 6 kDa became apparent and could be identified. During fibrinogen digestion, progressive decreases of the 56-kDa Bβ-chain and the 47-kDa γ-chain were observed, leading to γ-chain fragments sized at 38 and 35 kDa, respectively. These fragments underwent further degradation to yield unidentified smaller digestion products. Thus, after 30 min of incubation no remaining β-chain could be visualized, and after 2 h the γ-chain was also completely cleaved. With MMP-12, quick disappearance of the fibrinogen α-chain could also be observed. No corresponding band was visible after a 2-min incubation. Fig.1 B shows that the bands indicating β- and γ-chains were diminished to a lesser extent than observed with MMP-14. Consistent with the observation of fibrinogen fragmentation, the generation of lower molecular mass products was noted with time leading to a set of bands. Of these, six could be identified by means of amino acid sequence analysis (Table I). Generally, we observed fast degradation of the fibrinogen α-chain by MMP-8, MMP-12, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP. At longer incubation times, degradation of β- and γ-chains were also noted. The identified amino termini of the generated fibrinogen fragments are summarized in Table I.Table IDepiction of the identified NH2-terminal sequences of HPLC fractionsEnzymekDaNH2-terminal sequence 1-aThe numbering of amino acids of all proteins includes signal peptide sequence.OriginMMP-86820ADSGEGDα-chain3220ADSGEGDα-chain3020ADSGEGDα-chain13442LRTGKEKVα-chain12442LRTGKEKVα-chain10442LRTGKEKVα-chainMMP-125020ADSGEGDα-chain3020ADSGEGDα-chain2520ADSGEGDα-chain15540FVSETESRGα-chain13433LVTSKGDKα-chain12540FVSETESRGα-chainMMP-134527YVATRDNγ-chain35ND 1-bNot determined.3220ADSGEGDα-chain28124RNSVDXLNXNβ-chain16ND14442LRTGKEKVα-chainMMP-144527YVATRDNγ-chain38105 XDAATLKSRγ-chain3592LTYNPDESγ-chain15105LTTNIXEXLα-chain13433LVTSKGDKEα-chain6117FXSANNRDα-chainFibrinogen was subjected to MMP-cleavage, and the resulting fragments were isolated.

Open table in a new tab Fibrinogen was subjected to MMP-cleavage, and the resulting fragments were isolated. The amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation. To identify the fibrinogen fragments generated by cdMMP-13 and cdMMP-14, respectively, separation by reverse-phase HPLC was performed. Fig.2 shows a typical HPLC profile for MT1-MMP-digested fibrinogen. We analyzed the homogeneity of the various peak fractions by subjecting a sample of each fraction to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Fractions containing more than one fragment were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. To further characterize the effect of fibrinogen degradation by MMPs, the clotting of digested fibrinogen was measured by the functional method of Clauss (31Clauss A. Acta Haematol. Jpn. 1957; 17: 237-246Crossref Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen was incubated with cdMMP-8, cdMMP-13, cdMMP-12, and cdMMP-14, respectively, for up to 2 h, and after stopping the fibrinogen degradation by adding a 10-fold molar excess of BB-94, the clotting capability of fibrinogen was measured. Fig. 3 shows the amount of clottable fibrinogen measured at different points of time. The individual fibrinogen concentrations were calculated from standard dose-response curves of fibrinogen concentrations versusclotting time. After an 8-min incubation with cdMT1-MMP, remaining fibrinogen clotting activity was already reduced to approximately 68%. Moreover, the clotting was reduced to an even greater extent when fibrinogen was incubated with MMP-8, MMP-12, or MMP-13, respectively. These results indicate a markedly impaired coagulant activity of MMP-treated fibrinogen compared with normal fibrinogen. Similar results were obtained by measuring clotting of MMP-8, MMP-12, or MMP-13-treated fibrinogen (see Fig. 3). To investigate the cleavage of Factor XII by MMP-13, reagents were incubated at 37 °C for up to 3 h (see Fig.4 A). The proteolytic cleavages resulted in breakdown of Factor XII into several fragments within minutes. With SDS-PAGE, after 4 min of incubation, two intermediate bands became apparent at 45 and 30 kDa, respectively. Prolonged incubation led to further degradation and disappearance of these fragments, and bands of lower molecular weight became visible (27 and 22 kDa, respectively). Amino-terminal sequence identification of these fragments showed that cleavage occurred at the beginning of the type II fibronectin-like and the epidermal growth factor-like domains. Moreover, a cleavage within the catalytic region was identified four residues downstream of the kallikrein cleavage site that leads to the activation of Factor XII. It is noteworthy that the fragment Leu377–Ser615 generated by MMP-12, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP did not show any catalytic activity against the chromogenic substrate S-2302. In addition to this, we have discovered that Factor XII cannot be activated by kallikrein after MMP-induced cleavage. This was shown by a separate experiment in which latent Factor XII was subjected to treatment by MMPs and tested for activation with the synthetic substrate S-2302. After addition of kallikrein, the control of untreated Factor XII yielded the expected cleavage of the chromogenic substrate whereas MMP-digested Hageman factor showed no activity. Cleavage of Hageman factor by cdMMP-12 is an as yet unknown capability of this matrix metalloproteinase. The time course of this degradation is shown in Fig. 4 B. The amino termini were also identified as His29 and Leu377 after cleavage by MMP-13. The amino terminus Tyr31 at the beginning of the type II fibronectin-like domain was identified as a yet unknown cleavage site generated by cdMMP-12. Moreover, the specificity for the cleavage site of human metalloelastase (HME) at residue Leu380 at the beginning of the catalytic region was also unknown. Cleavage of Hageman factor by MMP-14 generates fragments with approximate molecular masses of 50, 45, 33, 30, and 12 kDa. The identified amino terminus Leu377 was the same as that obtained with MMP-12 and MMP-13. The amino-terminal residue Leu351 was also generated by MMP-14 (Table 2).Table IIIdentified NH2-terminal sequences of MMP-cleaved Hageman factorEnzymekDaNH2-terminal sequence 2-aThe numbering of amino acids of all proteins includes signal peptide sequence.OriginMMP-124329HKYKAEEHTtype II FN4331YKAEEHTVtype II FN32351LTRNGPLcatalytic region30377LVALRGAHcatalytic region20380LRGAHPYcatalytic regionMMP-134529HKYKAXEHtype II FN4394VKDHXSKHgrowth factor30377LVAXRGAHcatalytic region27377LVAXRGAHcatalytic regionMMP-1470IXXXEAXKEHNH2-terminus45ND 2-bNot determined.33351LTRNGPLcatalytic region30377LVALRGAcatalytic regionFactor XII was degraded by MMPs and the generated NH2 termini were isolated and identified by Edman degradation.2-a The numbering of amino acids of all proteins includes signal peptide sequence.2-b Not determined. Open table in a new tab Factor XII was degraded by MMPs and the generated NH2 termini were isolated and identified by Edman degradation. The data presented in this work demonstrate the fibrinogenolytic activities of the catalytic domains of MMP-8, MMP-12, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP. All enzymes degrade predominantly the Aα-chain of fibrinogen and at longer incubation times the Bβ-chain and γ-chain as well. The structural alterations in fibrinogen caused by different concentrations of the employed matrix metalloproteinases were analyzed by electrophoresis of treated fibrinogen in polyacrylamide gels under denaturing and reducing conditions. We found that the MMP-treated fibrinogen was rapidly degraded to lower molecular mass intermediates (Fig. 1). At the earliest time point (1 min), the Aα-chains were almost completely cleaved whereas the Bβ- and γ-chains were apparently unaffected. When the incubation time was extended to 3 h, the staining intensities of the β- and γ-chains were also diminished. Most of the generated fibrinogen fragments were identified by amino-terminal sequencing (see Table 1). Sequencing data revealed that these fragments resulted mainly from cleavages in the Aα- and γ-chains of fibrinogen (Fig. 5). However, we were not able to determine the amino termini of all generated fragments. Amino acid sequence analysis of yet unidentified digestion products is currently being performed. To determine whether MMP treatment of fibrinogen influences thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization, we measured the clotting time of fibrinogen after digestion with cdMMP-8, cdMMP-12, cdMMP-13, and cdMT1-MMP. The clotting time reflected the amount of intact fibrinogen remaining after proteolytic attack by the individual matrixin. We have proven that the degradation of fibrinogen by MMPs resulted in a loss of fibrinogen function. Under the applied conditions, fibrinogen showed dramatically impaired clotting ability. In this context, we would like to mention that we were not able to determine correct clotting times of fibrinogen samples digested for times shorter than 5 min because of a delayed termination of MMP-mediated fibrinogen degradation by addition of BB-94. Thus, the determined concentrations of functional fibrinogen in the early stage of digestion appear to be too low. Nevertheless, the obtained data show that treatment of fibrinogen with matrixins prevents the self-assembly of large protofibrils and fibers. The clotting of fibrinogen was studied within vitro assays because the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was not enzymatically active in stabilized human plasma due to the presence of citrate or EDTA. The physiological significance of our findings refers to the obviously altered coagulant properties of digested fibrinogen. This fact may influence a number of cellular events including tumor growth, wound healing, and cell-attachment. Fibrinogen mediates cellular adhesion of a number of different cell types including thrombocytes, endothelial cells, and tumor cells. Fibrinogen contains RGD sequences both at the amino and carboxyl termini of the α-chain. These sequences as well as the carboxyl terminus of the γ-chain bind to the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (integrin αIIbβH3) (34Bennett J. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 35Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5357-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During incubation of fibrinogen with cdMT1-MMP, both Aα-chain RGD sequences were removed as well as the γ-chain dodecapeptide sequence (see Fig. 4). With MMP-8, MMP-12, and MMP-13, at least one of the RGD motifs is released. These cleaved fibrinogen fragments may still be recognized by and bound to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Nevertheless, platelet aggregation may be inhibited because the binding peptides are no longer interconnected. The data presented in this study show for the first time the degradation of Factor XII of the blood clotting system by matrix metalloproteinases. MMP-12, MMP-13, and MMP-14 cleave at Gly376↓Leu377. This cleavage site lies four residues downstream of the kallikrein cleavage site. Conversion of latent Hageman factor into its active form, Factor XIIa, takes place with cleavage of the Arg372↓Val373 peptide bond (19McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5328-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cool D.E. Edgell C.-J.S. Louie G.V. Zoller M.J. Brayer G.D. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13666-13676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no activity of Factor XII can be observed after MMP-induced cleavage. Moreover, MMP-treated latent Hageman factor cannot be activated by kallikrein (results not shown). It is therefore conceivable that the activation of Factor XII requires the kallikrein-generated terminal positive charge of Val373 to establish a stabilizing salt bridge as known from trypsin (37Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 38Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 displays the different cleavages of Hageman factor by MMP-12, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP in comparison to the naturally occurring cleavages by kallikrein. The effect of Factor XII cleavage by MMPs in vivo remains to be clarified because the ordinary route of thrombin generation takes place via the tissue factor pathway and is therefore independent of Hageman factor (18Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The importance of plasma protein cleavage by MMPs has to be further investigated, especially in tumor cells and endothelial cells that express high levels of MMPs. In 1995, the expression of MT1-MMP mRNA transcript in vascular endothelial cells was demonstrated (39Lewalle J.M. Munaut C. Pichot B. Cataldo D. Baramova E. Foidart J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This led to the speculation that this enzyme interacts not only with constituents of the extracellular matrix but also with blood components (12Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J.

Moreover, the enzyme was identified by polymerase chain reaction screening in human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood (40Machein U. Conca W. Ansorge S. Langner J. Cellular Peptidases in Immune Functions and Diseases. Plenum Press, NY1997: 97-128Google Scholar). MMP-8 has also been shown to have a possible influence on plasma proteins after secretion from polymorphonuclear leucocytes (9Knäuper V. Reinke H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several cell lines, e.g. T-lymphocytes (41Willroth F. Peter H.H. Conca W. Immunobiology. 1998; 198: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), macrophages, and endothelial cells (42Imai S. Konttinen Y.T. Jumppanen M. Lindy O. Ceponis A. Kemppinen P. Sorsa T.

The human metalloelastase is known to interact with several other plasma proteins (43Cornelius L.A. Nehring L.C. Harding E. Bolanowski M. Welgus H.G. Kobayashi D.K. Pierce R.A. Shapiro S.D. J.

Nature. 1994; 370: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). There is evidence for the successive release of MMPs in buffycoat-depleted red cell concentrates of blood donors during storage (45Schettler A. Thorn H. Jockusch B.M. Tschesche H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 46Hertfelder H.J. Süwer V. Tschesche H. Hanfland P. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Biochem. 1994; 32: 441-447PubMed Google Scholar). It is anticipated that these matrixins may also have the same mode of action in vivo. Taken together, these findings are consistent with an interaction of MMPs with blood components, especially with plasma proteins of the clotting system. The important role of matrixins in tumor invasion is suggested by a large number of correlation studies demonstrating a direct relationship between increased expression of proteases in tumor tissues and their invasive and metastatic behavior (47Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several groups have shown the degradation of several plasma proteins by some MMPs. Our experiments clearly support the findings that proteolytic activity of matrixins is not restricted to extracellular matrix components. Moreover, the spectrum for MMPs is broader, now including proteins involved in hemostasis like fibrinogen (Fig. 5 and Refs. 10Bini A. Itoh Y. Kudryk B.J. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13056-13063Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 11Bini A. Wu D. Schnuer J. Kudryk B.J.

Pierce R.A. Shapiro S.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6845-6852PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that MMPs in interaction with plasma proteins may play a role in the control of coagulation. In this work, we demonstrate a possible down-regulation of thrombotic potential caused by the impact of MMP on proteins participating in coagulation processes. This is an important finding that goes beyond physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, with respect to the successive release of MMPs from residual leukocytes during storage (9Knäuper V.

Our experiments were conducted with carboxyl-terminal truncated enzymes. It had been suggested that the substrate specificity of matrixins is attributed to the presence of the hemopexin-like domain at the carboxyl terminus of most of the MMPs (50Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Connell J.P. Docherty A.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, D'Ortho et al. (51D'Ortho M.P. Will H.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) compared the substrate specificity of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP with that of a variant of MT1-MMP containing the catalytic domain and the carboxyl-terminal hemopexin-like domain. These authors noted that both enzyme variants degraded the same substrates with comparable efficiency with the exception of the triple-helical collagens I and III. Cleavage of collagens required the presence of both the catalytic and the hemopexin-like domain. This matrixin domain appeared to have no role in the proteolytic specificity directed toward other substrates. We made the same observation with MMP-8, MMP-9 (52Diekmann O. Tschesche H. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994; 27: 1865-1876PubMed Google Scholar), and MMP-14 (results not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2097565501,"Disruption of the function of tumor suppressor proteins occasionally can be dependent on their subcellular localization. In about 40% of the breast cancer tissues, p53 is found in the cytoplasm as opposed to the nucleus, where it resides in normal breast cells. This means that the regulation of subcellular location of p53 is an important mechanism in controlling its function. The transport factors required for the nuclear export of p53 and the mechanisms of their nuclear export have been extensively characterized. However, little is known about the mechanism of nuclear import of p53. p53 contains putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) which would interact with a nuclear transport factor, importin α. In this report we demonstrate that importin α binds to NLSI in p53 and mediates the nuclear import of p53. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses showed that a truncated importin α deleted the region encoding the putative NLS-binding domain of p53, suggesting that it could not bind to NLSs of p53 proteins. Binding of importin α to p53 was confirmed by using yeast two-hybrid assay. When expressed in CHO-K1 cells, the truncated importin α predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. In truncated importin α expressing cells, p53 preferentially localized to cytoplasmic sites as well. A significant increase in the p21waf1/cip1 mRNA level and induction of apoptosis were also observed in importin α overexpressing cells. These results strongly suggest that importin α functions as a component of the NLS receptor for p53 and mediates nuclear import of p53.

Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Although inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins is generally thought to originate in their genetic mutations, disruption of their function can occasionally be independent of such mutations. Moll et al. (2Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) have reported that about 37% out of 27 samples of breast cancer tissues showed cytoplasmic localization of wild-type p53, resulting in inhibition of normal p53 function (2Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Nuclear exclusion of wild-type p53 has also been reported in neuroblastoma and colon carcinoma cells (3Moll J.M. Laquaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In another study, wild-type p53 was located in the cytoplasm of human cervical carcinoma cell lines with integrated human papillomavirus-18 or -16 (5Liang X.H. Volkmann M. Klein R. Herman B. Lockett S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2645-2652PubMed Google Scholar). In colon carcinoma, cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 correlates with unfavorable prognosis (4Bosari S. Viale G. Roncalli M. Graziani D. Borsani G. Lee A.K. Coggi G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 790-798PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that the regulation of p53 subcellular location is an important mechanism in controlling p53 function. In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. This spatial segregation requires a nuclear transport system to correctly import or export nuclear components at the proper time. The prototype of the nuclear transport signal is the classical nuclear localization signal (NLS),1 and nuclear import of proteins bearing an NLS is dependent on two cellular factors termed importin α and importin β (6Görlich D.

The initial cytoplasmic event in NLS-dependent nuclear protein import is the binding of the import cargo to the importin α/β heterodimer. Importin α provides the NLS-binding site and then interacts via its importin β-binding domain (IBB domain) with importin β, which in turn interacts with the nuclear pore complex (10Weis. K., Ryder, U., and Lamond, A. L. (1996) EMBO J.1818–1825Google Scholar, 12Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D.

The transfer of the trimeric NLS-importin α/β complex through the NPC is energy-dependent and appears to require GTP hydrolysis by Ran (15Moore M.S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), p53 must enter the cell nucleus where it can function as a transcription activator. p53 has three potential nuclear localization signals in the C terminus of the protein (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). The major one, PQPKKKP, is able to direct the cytoplasmic protein to the nucleus (16Dang C.V. Lee W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a set of transport factors required for the nuclear export of p53 has been identified and extensively characterized (17Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of the nuclear import has not yet been elucidated in vivo. Our work was initiated to study the mechanisms of importin α-mediated nuclear import of p53. We have newly identified a truncated form of importin α in a breast cancer cell line. The truncated importin α was tested for its biological activities in line with the nuclear import of p53. Human breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1 was grown in RPMI medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. HBL-100 (human mammary epithelial cell) and CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary cell line) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Total cell RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 cells of ZR-75-1 cell line using Catrimox-14TM surfactant solution (Iowa Biotechnology) as described by the manufacturer. The Takara RNA LA PCR kit (Takara) was used to RT-PCR with slight modification. In brief, 300 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase with oligo-d(T) adaptor primer and subsequent cDNA amplification using Takara LA Taq with upstream primer (5′-ATGTCCACCAACGAGAATGCTAATAC-3′) and downstream primer (5′-CTAAAAGTTAAAGGTCCCAGGAGCCCC-3′) for importin α-specific primers. RT was performed at 42 °C for 30 min. This was followed by a 2-min denaturation of DNA at 94 °C and 30 cycles of PCR amplification using a 30-s 94 °C denaturation step, a 30-s 56 °C annealing step and a 90-s 72 °C primer extension step. PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. To ensure the PCR products were amplified from importin α transcripts, Southern blot analysis was performed. PCR products resolved on 1% agarose gel were transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with a digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled importin α probe. For preparation of the digoxigenin-labeled importin α probe, pRIP vector (Bioneer) containing the full-length importin α was digested with PstI and fractionated in 1% agarose gel. About 0.35-kilobase PstI-digested fragment containing N-terminal fragment of importin α was isolated, labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP, and used as the probe. The detection of hybridized DNA was carried out using DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The positive bands identified by Southern blot analysis were isolated from agarose gel using GENECLEAN kit (Bio-101), cloned to SmaI digested-pRIP cloning vector (Bioneer), and subjected to sequencing using universal primers. AccuPowerTM DNA sequencing kit and SilverstarTM staining kit (Bioneer) were used for DNA sequencing. Point mutation was constructed by a PCR-based technique (18Horton R. Cai Z. Ho S. Pease L. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-531PubMed Google Scholar). For the p53 double point mutation of K320A and K321A, the first PCR reaction amplified the upstream fragment using the 5′ boundary primer (5′-GGAATTCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGAT-3′) and one of the mutant primers (5′-TCCATCCAGTGGTGCCGCCTTTGGCTGGGG-3′) readings from 3′ to 5′. The second PCR amplified the downstream fragment using mutant primer (5′-CCCCAGCCAAAGGCGGCACCACTGGATGGA-3′) readings from 5′ to 3′ and the 3′ boundary primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′). These upstream and downstream PCR products, which overlap at the mutation region, were mixed together and used as templates in the last PCR reaction with 5′ and 3′ boundary primers. The end PCR product with the desired mutation was gel-purified and digested with EcoRI and XhoI before ligation to pAD-GAL4 phagemid vector (Stratagene). Accuracy of these constructs was confirmed by sequencing. To investigate interactions between importin α and p53, and between importin α and the NLSI mutant p53, yeast two-hybrid system was used. Yeast strain YRG-2 (Matα ura3–52 his3–200 ade2–101 lys2–801 trp1–90 leu2–3 112 gal4–542 gal80–538LYS2::UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-HIS3 URA3::UASGAL4 17-mers(X3)-TATACYC1-lacZ) was co-transformed with pBD-Iα, pBD-IαΔNLSb and pAD-p53, pBD-IαΔNLSb and pAD-Iβ, and pBD-Iα and pAD-NLSmut p53, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described below. For importin α expression (pBD-Iα), a full-length cDNA encoding amino acids 1–529 was fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 in pBD-GAL4 Cam plasmid (Stratagene). pBD-IαΔNLSb was constructed by fusing the truncated importin α to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 in pBD-GAL4 Cam. pAD-p53 was constructed by fusing p53 to the activation domain of GAL4 in pAD-GAL4. pAD-Iβ was constructed by cloning a partial fragment of importin β (amino acids 331 to 876), covering the region to interact with importin α, into the activation domain of GAL4 in pAD-GAL4. To investigate interaction of importin α with NLS mutant p53, the hybrid proteins were constructed as described above. Competent cells of yeast strain YRG-2 were prepared by the LiOAc/single stranded DNA/PEG method (19Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Co-transformed cells were plated onto synthetic dropout medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotrizole (Sigma/Aldrich) to investigate interaction of the hybrid proteins. Interactions of two partners were confirmed by a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside filter-staining assay (20Bartel P. Field S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Yeasts transformed with empty vector alone (pGAL4, Stratagene) or recombinant plasmid and its corresponding empty vector were used as negative controls, whereas yeast transformed with pBD-p53 (Stratagene) and pAD-SV40 (Stratagene) was used as a positive control. To express the normal and the truncated importin α in CHO-K1, we constructed expression vectors of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused proteins using pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The open reading frames of the normal and truncated importin α were translationally fused to GFP in-frame. The coding region of importin α was amplified by using PCR method (primers: 5′-ATGTCCACCAACGAGAATGCTAATAC-3′ as upstream primer and 5′-AAAAGTTAAAGGTCCCAG-3′ as downstream primer) with Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and cloned to SmaI site of pEGFP-N1. The PCR fragment amplified by using PCR method (primers: 5′-ATGTCCACCAACGAGAATGCTAATAC-3′ as upstream primer and 5′-CTAAAAGTTAAAGGTCCCAGGAGCCCC-3′ as downstream primer) containing the truncated importin α was digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site in pEGFP-N1. The constructed plasmids were isolated using the ammonium acetate method (21Saporito-Irwin S.M. Geist R.T. Gutmann D.H. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and transfected to CHO-K1 cells as described below. Each 35-mm dish of cells grown to about 70% confluency was transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNAs by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA-liposome complexes were left in the culture medium for 8 h. At that time the medium was drained, and the cells were refed with fresh medium. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were passaged 1:10 into selective medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 and the G418-resistant colonies from each transfection were pooled and expanded into stable cell lines for Northern blot analysis. To express the normal and NLSI-mutated p53 in CHO-K1, the normal and the NLSI-mutant p53 generated as described above were ligated to the C terminus of the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in pECFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). The constructed plasmids were isolated with ammonium acetate method (21Saporito-Irwin S.M. Geist R.T. Gutmann D.H. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and transfected to CHO-K1 as described above. The transfected cells grown on coverslips were rinsed in PBS solution, fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and air dried. Expression of fusion proteins was monitored using fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMRBE). 4′,6′-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) staining was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunohistological staining was carried out using HistostainTM-plus kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, the transfected cells grown on coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. The cells were then incubated with anti-p53 antibodies (DO-1 for HBL-100 and ZR-75–1 cells, Pab 246 for CHO-K1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h, followed by three washes with PBS. The biotinylated secondary antibody was reacted with the primary antibody, followed by three rinses with PBS. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was then bound to the biotinylated secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody-enzyme complex was visualized by using AEC chromogen/substrate solution for red signal. Cell staining was observed by light microscopy (Leica DMRBE). Cellular RNA was isolated from G418-selected CHO-K1 cells with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. For Northern analysis, 10 μg of total cellular RNA was heat denaturated, separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane and probed with 32P-labeled p21waf1/cip1. A probe specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to confirm equal loading. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin and denatured by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, p53 protein was detected in Western blot experiments using anti-p53 antibody and ECL Western blot reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At 24 h post-transfection, adherent and floating cells were collected, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and stained with propodium iodide (Sigma). The cell cycle distribution of each sample was determined by measuring the DNA content through propidium iodide staining. Samples were analyzed in a cell sorter (FACSCalibur) using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickson). The apoptotic fraction was determined by quantitating the number of cells possessing a sub-G1 DNA content (22Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Different from other normal cell lines like HBL-100, a breast cancer cell ZR-75-1 showed substantial amounts of p53 locating in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). In ZR-75-1 cells, we have newly identified a truncated form of importin α in the experiments of RT-PCR with importin α-specific primers (Fig. 1 B). The mRNA level for the truncated importin α was much higher than that for normal importin α in the cells when tested by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). The truncated cDNA fragments shown in Fig. 1 B were extracted from the gel, cloned into a vector, and sequenced. Sequencing analysis of the truncated transcript of importin α showed that the truncated mutant of importin α was 387 base pairs in size and contained internal deletion in the cDNA of importin α (Fig. 1 C). The truncated mutant, which we termed IαΔNLSb, deleted nucleotides from 251 to 1458 and contained an open reading frame encoding 89 amino acids, resulting in premature protein of importin α (Fig.1 C). The truncated transcript IαΔNLSb contained the IBB domain whereas a part of the importin α transcript segment encoding the putative NLS-binding domain was deleted, suggesting that this deletion mutant would not bind to NLSs of p53 proteins (Fig.1 D). Importin α has been reported as a mediator for a classical nuclear transport (8Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization signals in the C terminus of the p53 protein are directly involved in its subcellular localization (16Dang C.V. Lee W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To be transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, the p53 protein must bind to a transport mediator through interaction between the NLS-binding domain of importin α and its NLSs. To investigate whether importin α interacts with p53, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed. Interaction between importin α and p53 was detected when yeast strain YRG-2 was co-transformed with pBD-Iα and pAD-p53 and monitored for leucine and tryptophan prototrophy, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by filter lift assay (Fig.2). On the other hand, the truncated importin α lacking the NLS-binding domain did not interact with p53, as expected (Fig. 2). When the truncated importin α-expressing plasmid (pBD-IαΔNLSb) was co-transfected with importin β-expressing plasmid (pAD-Iβ) in yeast, the β-galactosidase gene was normally turned on (Fig. 2). None of the negative controls (pBD-Iα plus pAD, pBD-IαΔNLSb plus pAD, and pBD-p53 plus pAD) showed any detectable blue color in filter lift assay. These results strongly suggest that the truncated region of the importin α is essential for the p53 binding. In p53, three potential nuclear localization signals reside in the C terminus of the protein. NLSI (PQPKKKP), especially, is the key player for the nuclear import of p53 (16Dang C.V. Lee W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, importin α would bind to p53 at the NLSI locus. To investigate whether this NLSI site mediates interaction between importin α and p53, we have carried out yeast two-hybrid assay with p53-expressing constructs containing the double mutation at NLSI site (KK320, 321AA) (Fig. 3 A). The yeast cells were co-transformed with pBD-Iα and pAD-NLSwt p53 or pAD-NLSmut p53, and the colonies showing leucine and tryptophan prototrophy were subjected to filter lift assay. Importin α did not interact with the NLS mutant while it did interact with wild-type NLS showing blue color in the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside assay (Fig. 3 B). NLS mutant showed blue color when co-transformed with pBD-SV40 (Fig.3 B), suggesting that the NLS mutant p53 was normally expressed in the transformed yeast. The expression of the NLS mutant p53 in yeast was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Because importin α did not interact with the p53 containing the double mutations (K320A/K321A) at NLSI site, the NLS mutant p53 might be sequestered in the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, we constructed an NLS mutant p53/CFP fusion protein containing KK320, 321AA in the putative p53 NLS (Fig. 3 A). When CHO-K1 cells were transfected with p53-expressing plasmid, the NLS mutant p53 were located only to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 C, lower panel), while NLS wild-type p53 located to the nucleus (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). These results suggest that the NLS mutant p53 does not bind to importin α and thus results in sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm, and supports that the nuclear import of p53 is mediated by importin α. Importin α is only known as a cargo receptor and importin β thus must first bind to importin β-binding domain of importin α for its nuclear translocation (8Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It is also known that only the IBB domain could transport the fusion protein to the nucleus (10Weis. K., Ryder, U., and Lamond, A. L. (1996) EMBO J.1818–1825Google Scholar, 25Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Notably, although the IαΔNLSb mutant deleted the region encoding the NLS-binding domain, it contained the IBB domain. To investigate whether the truncated importin α is functional in nuclear localization, expression vectors for fusion proteins in which the open reading frames of wild-type importin α and the truncated-type importin α were fused with that of GFP and were constructed and termed pIα/GFP and pIαΔNLSb/GFP, respectively. Using this method, the localization in cells of the fused proteins could be easily monitored by fluorescence microscopy. When expressed in CHO-K1 cell, the IαΔNLSb/GFP fusion protein was preferentially observed in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4, g and h) while control GFP protein was in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, a and b). In contrast, the Iα/GFP fusion protein was preferentially observed in the nucleus (Fig. 4, d and e). The same result was obtained when the fusion proteins were expressed in HBL-100 and 293 cells (data not shown)). These data strongly suggest that truncated importin α is not functional for nuclear localization even though it contains intact IBB domain. Different from other cell lines, ZR-75-1 cells were nicely stained by anti-p53 antibody at the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus in the experiments of immunohistochemical staining (Fig.1 A). Our accumulative results, showing that importin α binds to p53 protein, the truncated importin α loses its binding capacity to p53, and the truncated importin α is localized predominantly to the cytoplasm of CHO-K1 cells expressing the truncated importin α-GFP fusion protein, led us to assume that the p53 enhancement in the cytoplasm of ZR-75-1 is likely to be associated with the expression of truncated importin α. We have examined the p53 localization in the mutant Iα-expressing CHO-K1 cells. The expression of the truncated importin α and the location of p53 proteins were monitored by GFP fluorescence and immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig.5, p53 was accumulated at the cytoplasm in truncated importin α-expressing CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 5 B) while preferentially localized to the nuclei in normal importin α-expressing CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 5 A). These results, together with our previous results, strongly suggest that the p53 accumulation at the cytoplasm rather than efficient localization to the nucleus in the ZR-75-1 cells is, at least in part, due to the existence of dysfunctional importin α in the breast cancer cells. Biologically active p53 in nucleus modulates the transcription of its downstream target genes, such as bax,p21, GADD45, etc, resulting in growth arrest or apoptosis (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). To see whether the importin α-mediated nuclear-imported p53 shown in Fig. 5 is functional or not, we examined the expression level of the p21waf1/cip1 gene, which is considered to be the most important p53-responsive gene (26El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parson R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7903) Google Scholar), by Northern blot analysis in importin α-overexpressing CHO-K1 cells. A significant increase in waf1/cip1mRNA level was observed in CHO-K1 cells transfected with pIα/GFP plasmid, but not in GFP-transfected control cells nor in pIαΔNLSb/GFP-transfected CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6 A). Total protein level of p53 was slightly increased in the cells transfected with pIα/GFP plasmid (Fig. 6 B). In addition to the up-regulation of p21waf1/cip1, functional p53 in nucleus has been shown to transactivate several other genes that could be involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 27Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). If the hypothesis that the importin α facilitate the nuclear import of p53 is true, overexpression of importin α may cause cell growth arrest and apoptosis by enhancement of nuclear import of p53 and transactivation of p53-responsive apoptotic factors. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids, pGFP, pIα/GFP, pIαΔNLSb/GFP, and pp53. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, stained with propodium iodide, and subjected to flow-cytometric analysis. Cells with DNA content less than 2n (sub-G1 in Fig. 6 C) are considered apoptotic (28Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del, Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 C, wild-type p53- and importin α-transfected cells induced apoptosis by 17 and 24%, respectively, whereas GFP- transfected cells and truncated importin α-transfected cells induced only by 4 and 6%, respectively. These experimental results strongly suggest that importin α mediates the nuclear import of p53, followed by transactivation of p53-responsive genes in nucleus and induction of consecutive p53-mediated biological activities. We found a truncated form of importin α in the breast cancer cell ZR-75-1 in which substantial amounts of p53 were localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). The truncated importin α has a deletion in the middle of the RNA transcript (Fig. 1 C). The deleted region covers the putative p53 NLS-binding domain (Fig.1 D). As expected, this deletion mutant could not bind to the wild-type p53 protein (Fig. 2). Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that normal importin α interacts with p53 (Fig. 2), while the NLS1 mutant p53 does not bind to importin α (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the NLS1 of the p53 is an important binding site to importin α. The NLS mutant p53 was also sequestered in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 C). When expressed in CHO-K1 cells, the GFP-fused truncated mutant of importin α preferentially localized to the cytoplasm (Fig.4). In truncated importin α-expressing cells, p53 predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). Particularly noteworthy is that a significant increase in p21waf1/cip1mRNA level and enhancement of apoptosis were observed in the wild-type importin α-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that p53 is efficiently transported to the nucleus through the importin α-mediated nuclear transport system. Based on our present results, we address that the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in the breast cancer cell ZR-75-1 is likely to be associated with the presence of truncated importin α lacking in the NLS-binding domain, and is thus inefficient to transport p53 to the nucleus. We found that the breast cancer cell ZR-75-1 shows distinct immunohistological patterns for p53 localization. Large amounts of p53 were detected in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 1 A). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the truncated transcript of importin α exists in a cell line ZR-75-1 (Fig. 1 B). Generally, ZR-75-1 cells show predominant mRNA level for truncated importin α as compared with that for normal importin α as shown in Fig.1 B and in repeated quantitative RT-PCRs (data not shown). At times, however, the expression amount of mutant mRNA was not so much enhanced as usual. The fluctuation of mutant mRNA level is thought to be associated with the cell growth rate and culture conditions. Although a genomic sequence of importin α has not yet been identified, sequence analysis of the RNA transcripts at the junction of the deleted sequence suggested that these truncated transcripts might be generated by the aberrant RNA splicing. The truncated transcript of importin α containing AAG at the end of 5′ exon sequence and G/A at the 3′ exon sequence (Fig. 1) match the canonical consensus sequences of the upstream and downstream splice donor and acceptor sites. It has been shown that the truncated transcripts of tumor suppressor genes, such as WT1, BRCA1, and TSG101, are frequently found in breast cancer (29Silberstein G.B. Horn K.V. Strickland P. Roberts Jr., C.T. Daniel C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8132-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30Lu M. Conzen S.D. Cole C.N. Arrick B.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4578-4581PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lee M.P. Feinberg A.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3131-3134PubMed Google Scholar). Although importin α is unlikely to act as a direct tumor suppressor, alternation of its phenotype may have influence on the functions of other important tumor suppressors that should be transported to the nucleus to be functionally active. With this regard, we have characterized the truncated importin α, which may provide many important insights into the tumorigenesis of the breast cancer. Sequence analysis showed that a truncated importin α contains the IBB domain but lacks NLS-binding domain. It has been reported that importin β binds to the IBB domain of importin α and transports it into the nucleus (10Weis. K., Ryder, U., and Lamond, A. L. (1996) EMBO J.1818–1825Google Scholar). In our present study, however, the truncated importin α containing the IBB domain was preferentially detected at the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus of both CHO-K1 (Fig. 4) and HBL-100 cells (data not shown). The truncated importin α was confirmed still to have a binding capacity to importin β (Fig. 2) as reported previously in the experiment with other deletion mutants of importin α (23Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whereas, normal importin α was detected predominantly in the nucleus in the same condition. These results suggest that the IBB domain may not be enough for the importin β-mediated translocation of importin α into the nucleus. Lang and Clarke (33Lang S-H. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32699-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have reported that both NLSI and two other NLSI basic domains are concomitantly required for p53 nuclear import. This means that the NLS1 alone in p53 may not be enough to be bound to the importin α, resulting in a defect for nuclear localization of p53. In our experiments, however, NLS1 mutant p53 completely lost its binding capacity to importin α (Fig. 3), while K305A mutant p53 did not, and the nuclear localization of the K305A mutant was as efficient as that of wild-type p53 (data not shown). Although we did not perform the quantitative analysis of the binding affinity between importin α and each NLS of p53, our experimental results suggest that the NLS1 of p53 would be much more essential than other NLSs for importin α-binding and nuclear import of p53. Precise interaction mechanisms remain to be discovered. It has been proposed that export of importin α into cytoplasm is mediated by the Crm1 nuclear export protein which would interact with a leucine-rich nuclear export signal located between residues 207 and 217 in Arm repeat 3 of importin α (17Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 32Boche I. Fanning E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has also been proposed that export of importin α is dependent on the distinct nuclear export factor, CAS, which is another member of the importin β family and interacts with an unmapped nuclear export signal located near the C terminus of importin α (23Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of the importin α export into the cytoplasm is still unclear, it is generally accepted that importin α in the nucleus should be transported to the cytoplasm where it could be recharged with cargoes and re-transported by importin β. When expressed by transfection with pIα/GFP plasmid, however, the fusion protein Iα/GFP was preferentially localized to the nuclei of CHO-K1 (Fig. 4) and HBL-100 cells (data not shown). We assume that the GFP fusion to the importin α at the C terminus may inhibit the binding of nuclear export factor to importin α by masking or changing the conformation of the essential CAS/Crm1-binding domain in importin α. Even though the total amount of p53 was not markedly enhanced when cells were transfected with importin α-expression plasmid (Fig.6 B), p53 was efficiently localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5), suggesting that the enhancement of importin α expression may facilitate the nuclear localization of p53, resulting in the induction of p53-mediated biological activities, such as growth arrest or apoptosis (Fig. 6 C). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude nonspecific or other secondary effects that may lead to p21 up-regulation and apoptosis, for importin α is not an exclusive import factor for p53. Also, our illustration does not exclude the possibilities of plethoric effects of importin α-overexpression, which may cause apoptosis through other unrevealed mechanisms rather than p53-mediated apoptotic procedures. Other tumor suppressor nuclear proteins such as BRCA1 and, most recently, WT1 have also been observed to be mislocated in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells (28Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del, Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Recently, BRAP2, a novel cytoplasmic protein that interacts with two functional NLS motifs of BRCA1, has been reported to retain a newly synthesized BRCA1 protein in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells (34Li S. Ku C-Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y-S. Chen C-F. Lee W-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Upon receiving the appropriate environmental stimulus, BRCA1 is dissociated from BRAP2 and bound to importin α for moving into the nucleus. Besides, importin α has the intriguing features of the armadillo family proteins that can be attached to the cytoskeleton through the interaction of nuclear regulatory proteins anchored to the cytoskeleton (35Smith H.M. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1791-1799PubMed Google Scholar). NLS-dependent association of importin α with the cytoskeleton would be important for anchoring the NLS receptor in the cytoplasm, revealing that importin α could serve as both an anchor and a carrier protein of nuclear regulatory proteins. These data suggest that a certain defect or phenotypic changes of transport factors may cause mislocation of tumor suppressor proteins, leading to inactivation of their tumor suppressor functions. With this regard, we are assuming two possible mechanisms for the truncated importin α mutant-mediated inhibition of p53 nuclear import in breast cancer: (i) overexpression of mutant importin α may cause a feedback inhibition of functional importin α expression, resulting in the inhibition of p53 nuclear import, or (ii) even though the wild-type and mutant importin α have a similar binding capacity to importin β, the relative amounts of importin β available for this binding may not be enough to cover the mutant and wild-type importin α, thus functional importin α has only a little chance to bind importin β, resulting in inefficient translocation of p53 into the nucleus. During the period of this work, we have identified similar truncated importin α mutants lacking NLS-binding domain from several breast cancer cells and tumor tissues. 2D.-H. Kim, S.-M. Han, Y.-S. Bae, I.-S. Kim, and Y-H. Moon, unpublished results. Although there are still many questions remaining unanswered for its detail mechanisms, considering the report that mere reduction in p53 levels is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis (36Sundaresan V. Shi Y-P. Jones S.N. Vogel H. Bradley A. Pinkel D. Donehower A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4657-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), the truncated importin α is likely to be involved in the tumorigenesis or tumor progression of breast cancer and other tumors by causing inefficient nuclear import of functional p53 and/or other tumor suppressor nuclear proteins. Further intensive studies are required to reveal the precise biological role of truncate importin α in the breast cancer and other tumors. We thank Drs. J. O. Rimas, Bryan Show, and W.-H. Lee for valuable advice and comments during the preparation of this manuscript. We also acknowledge Dr. D. Richardson for his warmhearted editorial help."

However, within the last few years many proteins besides polymerases δ and ε and the clamp loader replication factor C (RF-C) have been found to interact with PCNA.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). At the same time, PCNA has been shown to have roles in cellular pathways other than DNA replication, such as nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, base excision repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and transcription. All of these interactions led to the idea that PCNA plays a central role in connecting all of these important cellular processes and can act as a cellular communicator (9Jónsson Z. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PCNA has furthermore been identified in quaternary complexes with the kinase inhibitor p21, the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks), and their regulatory partners, the cyclins (4Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The pairs of Cdk-cyclin found in these complexes were Cdk4-cyclin D, Cdk2-cyclin E, Cdk2-cyclin A, and Cdc2-cyclin B. Cdks represent a family of protein kinases that control the transition between successive phases of the cell cycle in all eukaryotic cells (10Nigg E. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The G0 → G1 transition is regulated by Cdk4-cyclin D and Cdk6-cyclin D; G1 → S transition by Cdk2-cyclin E; the G2 and S phases by Cdk2-cyclin A; and the G2 → M transition by Cdc2-cyclin B. The different Cdk-cyclin complexes display distinct physiological functions. Cdk4-cyclin D can phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product pRb, which sequesters transcription factors, to allow the progression into S phase (11Hinds P.W. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 189-199Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) are also substrates of Cdk-cyclin (16Din S. Brill S. Fairman M. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In mitosis, the nuclear lamina is disassembled by a direct Cdc2-cyclin B phosphorylation (10Nigg E. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Since PCNA is found in a complex with Cdks and can bind many proteins, the function of the PCNA-Cdk2-cyclin A complex could function in attracting proteins and in particular replication proteins as target for kinases. While searching for interacting partners with PCNA, we found that Cdk2 can directly interact with PCNA. First, Myc-tagged PCNA was transiently overexpressed in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated by using an anti-Myc antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins as well as polymerase δ (p125 subunit and p50 subunit), Lig I, Fen I, and p21 were detected by immunoblotting. The interaction between PCNA and Cdk2 was clearly confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance. Since the function of this complex is unknown, we studied the PCNA-Cdk2 complex in more detail. The PCNA-Cdk2 complex was present throughout the cell cycle as shown by immunoprecipitation. Since both Cdk2 and PCNA are involved in S phase events, PCNA was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts to see if a Cdk-cyclin kinase activity can be co-immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitation of PCNA from nuclear cell extracts resulted in a PCNA-Cdk2-cyclin A complex that was active in phosphorylating the PCNA binding region of RF-Cp145 as well as Lig I. Finally, PCNA was found to be necessary for binding of Lig I to Cdk2 and to stimulate phosphorylation of Lig I by Cdk2-cyclin A, suggesting that PCNA might bring the Cdk2-cyclin A complex to its site(s) of action. For cell culture, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum (FCS) and the solution of penicillin and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Hydroxyurea was from Sigma. Flow cytometry analyses were done by using a FACScanTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The IBIS system (Intersens Instruments BV, Amersfoort, Holland) was used for surface plasmon resonance (17Dekker J. Kanellopoulos P. van Oosterhout J.A. Stier G. Tucker P.A. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 277: 825-838Google Scholar). CM5 research grade sensor chips and coupling agents were purchased from BIAcore (Upsala, Sweden). Poly(dA)1000–1500 was from Sigma, and oligo(dT) was from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). To generate constructs for eukaryotic overexpression of wild type PCNA and PCNA mutants, polymerase chain reaction primers were constructed to either generate a single N-terminal Myc tag or a Kozak consensus sequence in front of the PCNA open reading frame. Following polymerase chain reaction amplification, the resulting fragments were cloned into either pCDNA3 (for N-Myc-PCNA) or pCDNA3.1 (for C-Myc-His-PCNA). All clones were sequenced completely to confirm the absence of polymerase chain reaction-induced errors. The pGEX-3X plasmids expressing human wild type Cdk2 GST fusion protein and human wild type cyclin A GST fusion protein were kindly provided by C. Bonne-Andréa and R. Fotedar, respectively. The plasmid pT7/PCNA was a gift of Bruce Stillman. Human wild type PCNA was produced in E. coli using the plasmid pT7/hPCNA and purified to homogeneity as described (18Schurtenberger P. Egelhaaf S. Hindges R. Maga G. Jónsson Z. May R. Glatter O. Hübscher U. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutant PCNA proteins were purified as described (9Jónsson Z. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3 derivative clones were used for transient expression of Myc- or Myc-(poly-His)-tagged proteins. Cells were transfected according to Hottiger and Nabel (19Hottiger M. Nabel G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8252-8256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified Cdk2-cyclin A complex (13Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was a gift from H. P. Nasheuer. The histone H1 was from Roche. Anti-Cdk2 rabbit (H-298), anti-cyclin A rabbit (H-432), anti-PCNA mouse (PC10), and anti-GST rabbit antibodies (Z-5) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse IgG1,κ (MOPC-21) purified immunoglobulin from Sigma was used as negative control for immunoprecipitation. The polyclonal antibody against human DNA ligase I was a gift from T. Lindahl. HeLa and 293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 μg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For synchronization in G1, cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were arrested by serum starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS and released at 2 h. S phase cells were harvested 2 h after release from a 24-h block with 2 mm hydroxyurea. The proportion of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. For S-100 extracts, cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 5 mm NaCl, 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After 10 min of centrifugation at 3000 × g, the supernatant was adjusted to 120 mm NaCl and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. For nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (20Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), HeLa cells were grown to approximately 60% confluence. Harvested cells were first lysed at 4 °C in buffer A containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin for 5 min. The cytoplasmic extract was collected after 5 min of centrifugation at 8000 × g and diluted 1:3 with buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20% glycerol). The nuclei pelleted were extracted for 15 min in buffer C containing 20 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The nuclear fraction was diluted 1:6 in buffer D. For in vitro binding, 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 10 μM of GST-proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-proteins bound to the beads were incubated with 100 ng of purified PCNA or 100 μg of 293 S-100 extracts containing overexpressed wild type and mutant His-PCNA. After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin (binding buffer) at 4 °C, and bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 8% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue (SDS sample buffer). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Purified PCNA was covalently coupled to the dextran of a CM5 research grade sensor chip. The carboxymethylated dextran was activated for 5 min with 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in water. The ligand was then injected on the reactive surface (100 μl of 0.8 mm PCNA) in 10 mm NaCH3COOH (pH 5.3) and 20 mm NaCl. Afterward, the residualN-hydroxysuccinide esters on the sensor chip surface were deactivated for 5 min with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5) in water. Final regeneration of the matrix was performed with 0.5m NaCl and 0.025% (w/v) SDS. Purified wild-type GST-Cdk2 and mutant proteins were diluted in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. A 100-μl sample was injected over the PCNA-coupled surface for 5 min. Multiple injections at various concentrations were performed for each ligand. The association phases of the recorded sensorgrams were fitted to a first order binding model (Rt = R 0 + (ka CR max/kS)(1 − e−kSt)) by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using the IBIS kinetic evaluation software. At various concentrations of analyte, the kS values were determined, and the association rate constantka was calculated by the linear curve fitting of akS versus C plot (kS =ka·C + kd). 150 μg of cytoplasmic HeLa, 50 μg of nuclear HeLa, and 150 μg of S-100 HeLa extracts were adjusted to 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 8 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin (IP buffer) and added to a column coupled or preincubated with antibody. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the column was washed with IP buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer as described under “Pull-down Assays.” Protein samples were separated in a SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc.) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, and 20% methanol using a Bio-Rad Trans Blot apparatus. After blocking with 5% milk in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST), antibodies were incubated for 2 h and then washed in TBST. The antigen/antibody reaction was revealed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Pierce). The assays were performed with purified Cdk2-cyclin A complexes (13Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or Cdk-cyclin complexes immunoprecipitated. Protein G-Sepharose containing the immunocomplex was washed with IP buffer and then with a solution containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 8 mmMgCl2 (kinase buffer). Assays were performed in a reaction mixture of 18 μl containing kinase buffer, 33.3 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), the substrate (histone H1, RF-C B, or Lig I), and 10 μl of packed protein G-Sepharose or purified Cdk2-cyclin A complexes. After 20 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed for 90 min at 120 V, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. We first performed co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged PCNA transiently overexpressed in 293 cells to discover PCNA-interacting proteins. Since Cdk2 was clearly shown to interact with PCNA, experiments were done to confirm the interaction with endogenous proteins. For this purpose, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from unsynchronous HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-Cdk2 and anti-cyclin A antibodies. The immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Cdk2, anti-cyclin A, and anti-PCNA antibodies. The anti-Cdk2 antibody co-precipitated cyclin A as well as PCNA from both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig.1). While cyclin A was found in a complex with Cdk2 in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm, a ternary PCNA-Cdk2-cyclin A complex could only be found in the nucleus, as seen in Fig. 1, when immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-cyclin A antibody. Next we addressed the question of whether the formation of the complex between PCNA and Cdk2 is cell cycle-specific. For this, immunoprecipitations of Cdk2 were performed from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of HeLa cells synchronized in G1 and S phase. The cells were synchronized in G1 phase by serum starvation (0.5% FCS) followed by a release of 2 h and in S phase by hydroxyurea block followed by a release of 2 h. The synchronization was analyzed by flow cytometry. The co-immunoprecipitated complexes were identified by immunoblot, by using anti-Cdk2 and anti-PCNA antibodies. When the majority of HeLa cells are in G1 phase, PCNA and Cdk2 formed a complex in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm (Fig.2 A). The same result was obtained by hydroxyurea block (data not shown). When most of the cells are in S phase, the complex was found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B). These results suggested that a PCNA-Cdk2 complex could be formed in the cytoplasm in the S phase. To test a direct interaction with PCNA, Cdk2, and cyclin A were generated as GST fusion proteins. The GST fusion proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed PCNA and isolated by immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose. The washing steps were done with 150 mm NaCl. Bound PCNA was then detected by immunoblotting with an anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (PC10). Fig. 3 A shows an interaction between PCNA and Cdk2 but no interaction between PCNA and cyclin A. The PCNA binding region of RF-Cp145 (RF-C B) and p21 were used as positive controls. The DNA binding region of RF-Cp145 (RF-C A) and GST were negative controls (21Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hübscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Different salt concentrations for washing were used to test the salt dependence of the interaction between PCNA and Cdk2 (Fig. 3 B). The interaction could resist up to 1 m NaCl and was lost at 2m, which is characteristic of a hydrophobic interaction. Next, the binding properties of PCNA to Cdk2 were measured by using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay (IBIS System, Intersens Instruments BV). Fig. 3 C shows sensorgrams obtained with GST-Cdk2, heat-denatured GST-Cdk2, and GST injected on a dextran sensor chip coupled with PCNA. The response (R), expressed in millidegrees, is a measure for the protein mass at the surface of the sensor chip; binding is detected as an increased of millidegrees (R) in time. Only native GST-Cdk2 was able to interact with PCNA. GST and heat-denatured GST-Cdk2 were boiled and used as negative controls to exclude unspecific binding of GST and buffer jump, respectively. The association rate constant (ka) derived from multiple measurements at different concentrations of GST-Cdk2 is 8.3 ± 3.2 × 105m−1 s−1. This ka is in the same range as the one already described for PCNA/p21 interaction (1.1 × 105m−1 s−1; Ref. 22Knibiehler M. Goubin F. Escalas N. Jónsson Z. Mazarguil H. Hübscher U. Ducommun B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Taken together, the GST binding experiment and the surface plasmon resonance analysis show a direct interaction between Cdk2 and PCNA. To map the binding site of Cdk2 on PCNA, we used mutants of PCNA that were N-terminally Myc-tagged and transiently overexpressed in 293 cells. The three mutants were constructed by changing residues of loops exposed on the surface of the PCNA trimer (9Jónsson Z. Hindges R. Hübscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The mutant S43A/H44A/V45A is mutated in the βC1–βD1 loop, which forms a part of the hydrophobic pocket on the front side of the trimer close to where the C termini are located. The second mutant, Q125A/L126A/G127A/I128A, targets the middle of the domain-connecting loop, and the third mutant, V188A/D189A/K190A, targets the loop between βD2 and βD1 on the backside of the torus. Wild type PCNA with either an N-terminal Myc tag or a C-terminal Myc-His tag was also overexpressed in the same cell line. Extracts were prepared from these cells and used in GST pull-down experiments, to see if the overexpressed mutant and wild type proteins were able to bind Cdk2. GST-RF-C B was used as a positive control. In pull-down assays, N-Myc-tagged PCNA was found to interact strongly with Cdk2 (Fig. 4 A), whereas no interaction was observed between Cdk2 and C-Myc-His-PCNA from cell extracts or bacterially expressed C-His-PCNA. All three mutants were able to bind Cdk2 (Fig. 4 B). This may suggest that the different mutated regions are not directly involved in the interaction with Cdk2 or that Cdk2 interacts with a relatively large region on the PCNA surface. These results suggested that the binding site of Cdk2 on PCNA is located at the PCNA front side of where the C termini are located. To determine if PCNA and the kinase inhibitor p21cip1/WAF-1 have the same interaction site on Cdk2, p21 was used as a potential competitor of PCNA for binding wild type Cdk2 in a GST pull-down experiment. From the structure of p27kip1 bound to the Cdk2-cyclin A complex, it has been shown that the members of the Kip/Cip family interact with the N-terminal lobe of Cdk2. As described above, GST-proteins bound to beads were incubated with PCNA (100 ng) or a mixture of PCNA (100 ng) and p21 (100 ng). The ability to bind the GST-Cdk2 was determined by immunoblot with an anti-PCNA antibody (PC10). As seen in Fig.5, p21 bound to Cdk2 did not affect the ability of PCNA to interact with Cdk2, while interacting with Cdk2, indicating that PCNA does not bind the same site on Cdk2 as on p21. Next, experiments were designed to see if the Cdks could phosphorylate proteins involved in DNA replication. PCNA was immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts, and the activity of the co-immunoprecipitated Cdk-cyclins was tested in a kinase assay. Histone H1, Lig I, and the PCNA binding region of RF-C (RF-C B) were used as substrates (2 μg), since Lig I and RF-C B have many potential Cdk-cyclin phosphorylation sites. The Cdk2-PCNA complex was able to phosphorylate histone H1 (Fig.6 A). Phosphorylation of bacterially expressed PCNA binding region of RF-Cp145 (Fig.6 B) and Lig I (Fig. 6 C) was also evident and specific for Cdks, since the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 prevented phosphorylation of both PCNA-binding replication protein and the control protein histone H1. From this experiment we concluded that PCNA could target Cdk-cyclin to PCNA-binding DNA replication proteins. To test a possible direct interaction between Lig I and Cdk2, GST-Cdk2 fusion proteins bound on beads were incubated with bacterially expressed Lig I (500 ng) or a mixture of Lig I (500 ng) and PCNA (500 ng). Bound Lig I was then detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Lig I polyclonal antibody. Fig.7 shows that the interaction between Lig I and Cdk2 was favored 5 times in the presence of an equal amount of PCNA, as compared with the control reaction in the absence of PCNA. Finally, phosphorylation of Lig I by pure Cdk2-cyclin A complex was tested in the presence or absence of PCNA. Different amounts of Cdk2-cyclin A complex (25, 50, and 100 ng) and Lig I (100 ng) and different amounts of PCNA (50, 100, and 200 ng) were first incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and the mixture was then tested in a kinase assay. When PCNA was added in the reaction (Fig.8), phosphorylation of Lig I was stimulated. Phosphorylation was increased 4 times with equal amounts of Cdk2-cyclin A complexes, PCNA, and Lig I (lane 7), as compared with the control reaction in the absence of PCNA (lane 5). As a negative control, p21 was added to the reaction. Inhibition of the assay showed that phosphorylation was specific to Cdk2-cyclin A complex. A complex with PCNA was identified in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells by immunoprecipitating cyclin A and Cdk2 (Fig. 1). However, the ternary complex was not detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting that Cdk2 is represented in this compartment of the cell in two pools, namely either bound to PCNA alone or to cyclin A alone. PCNA-Cdk2 complex is present in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle and is preferentially formed during S phase in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). These results together with the fact that a direct interaction between PCNA and Cdk2 is also seen in GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 3 A) and by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 3 C) suggested that PCNA and Cdk-cyclin could form a complex. Cdk2 did not bind C-terminally Myc-tagged PCNA (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that the front side of PCNA containing the C terminus is involved in the interaction with Cdk2. We did not detect competition between PCNA and p21 for binding to Cdk2, suggesting that these two proteins bind Cdk2 using distinct interaction sites (Fig. 5). By immunoprecipitation, we observed that the PCNA-Cdk2 complex is present in the nucleus both during G1 and S phases, but during S phase the complex was also detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). We therefore hypothesize that Cdk2 could be involved in the translocation of PCNA from the cytoplasm into the nucleus during S phase, as detected by complex formation, since PCNA has no nuclear localization sequence. Alternatively, Cdk2-PCNA complex formation could be inhibited in the cytoplasm during G1 phase, while during S phase productive complex formation in the cytoplasm could result in nuclear import of Cdk2-PCNA complexes. The finding that a Cdk activity brought to PCNA was able to phosphorylate two DNA replication proteins, the PCNA binding region of RF-Cp145 (Fig. 6 B) and Lig I (Fig. 6 C) could be physiologically significant. A Cdk2-cyclin recognition motif has been identified in substrate proteins, and p21-like cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (23Adams P. Sellers W. Sharma S. Wu A. Nalin C. Kaelin W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This recognition motif was present in the sequence of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb); the transcription factors E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3; and the Cdk inhibitor p21, p27, and p57. These findings suggested a recognition step between Cdks-cyclins and substrates preceding phosphorylation. Lig I has many potential sites of phosphorylation by Cdk-cyclin, suggesting a phosphorylation of Lig I by the PCNA-Cdk-cyclin complex (Fig. 6 C). Although the putative Cdk2-cyclin binding motif of p27 and p57 (23Adams P. Sellers W. Sharma S. Wu A. Nalin C. Kaelin W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) is present at the C-terminal and the N-terminal parts of Lig I, we could demonstrate in a pull-down experiment that this motif was alone not sufficient. Consequently, PCNA might be the link between Lig I and Cdk2 (Fig. 7), suggesting that in a Lig I-PCNA-Cdk2 complex, Lig I can bind to Cdk2 only via an interaction with PCNA. The other point was the finding that PCNA could stimulate the phosphorylation of Lig I by Cdk2-cyclin A (Fig. 8). Our data suggest that PCNA may contribute to the recognition step preceding phosphorylation by acting as a kind of connector for Cdks-cyclins, which are active on specific target proteins. PCNA is a trimer, probably interacting with several different proteins simultaneously. Even if these bind to the same site of a PCNA monomer, the proteins could still bind different monomers in the PCNA trimer. As PCNA binds a large number of proteins, it could connect Cdk2 and its substrates. The involvement of Cdk2 in the control of S phase is not completely established. It has been shown that a Cdk2-cyclin A complex is responsible for activating SV40 plasmid replication in mammalian S phase cell extracts (25Fotedar A. Cannella D. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Gupta S. Doree M. Fotedar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31627-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in replication are also substrates for this kinase family. Phosphorylation regulates the origin binding (26McVey D. Brizuela L. Mohr I. Marshak D. Gluzman Y. Beach D. Nature. 1989; 341: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and DNA helicase activity of T antigen (12McVey D. Ray S. Gluzman Y. Berger L. Wildeman A. Marshak D. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that polymerase α primase (13Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is unable to initiate SV40 DNA replication in vitro when phosphorylated. RPA-32 (16Din S. Brill S. Fairman M. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and polymerase δ (14Wu S. Zhang P. Zeng X. Zhang S-J. Mo J. Li B. Lee M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are two other replication proteins phosphorylated by Cdks, but it is not known if and how their function is affected. Here we present evidence that the PCNA binding regions of RF-Cp145 and Lig I are also substrates of Cdk2. Recently it has been shown that a strong casein kinase II consensus site of Lig I, which is localized on the PCNA binding site, is dephosphorylated during G1 and S phase. Dephosphorylation in these cell cycle phases correlated with the capacity of Lig I to bind PCNA (27Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in preliminary immunoprecipitations of Myc-tagged PCNA overexpressed in 293 cells, we could show an interaction with Cdk4 that is involved in G1 phase and is bound to cyclin D (data not shown). Indeed, PCNA has been found in complexes with cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin E-Cdk2, and cyclin B-Cdc2, which control the entry points of G1, S, and G2/M phases, respectively (4Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). An interaction of PCNA and Cdc2 active in S phase associated with cyclin A has not yet been investigated, and consequently the role of PCNA in such complexes has not yet been established. Cdks are cell cycle regulatory proteins and involved in the control of gene expression by the pRb pathway. Our findings of the phosphorylation of target proteins involved in DNA replication and the dependence of DNA replication upon Cdk2 activity suggest that Cdk2 also controls DNA replication. It will be interesting to see which step(s) of DNA replication Cdk2 controls. Phosphorylation of a target DNA replication protein could lead to activation or inhibition in its function. Since DNA replication is a meticulously organized macromolecular event, Cdk2 could act in many different steps. The finding of all target proteins phosphorylated by Cdk2 and its consequences will eventually allow us to understand the control of DNA replication by Cdk2 in more detail.

https://openalex.org/W2065926472,"Targeted mutations of the Myf-5/MRF4 gene locus in mice have led to defects in myotome formation and to severe malformations of the ribs. We have generated two new mouse strains in which the coding region of Myf-5 was replaced with the cDNA for FGF-6 and exon I of Myf-5 gene was deleted by Cre-recombinase, respectively. Both strains do not show malformations of the ribs despite a loss of early myotome formation in homozygous mice. We conclude that the rib phenotype in previously described Myf-5 and MRF4 mutant mice is caused by long-distance effects on a yet unknown gene. The myogenic program in mammals is dependent on a family of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) comprising Myf-5, MyoD, Myogenin, and MRF4 (also independently isolated as Myf-6 and Herculin; 13Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. et al.Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Gene knockout experiments of each MRF confirmed the essential role of MRFs for muscle cell determination and differentiation in mice (for a recent review see 1Arnold H.H. Braun T Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2000; 48: 129-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since the activity of MRFs is restricted to striated skeletal muscle, the presence of skeletal abnormalities specific to the ribs in homozygous Myf-5 mutant mice came as a surprise. Homozygous Myf-5 mutant mice lack the distal parts of the ribs, which leads to perinatal death (3Braun T. Rudnicki M.A. Arnold H.-H. Jaenisch R Cell. 1992; 71: 369-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This striking phenotype was also observed in a second Myf-5 mutation in which the lacZ gene, together with the PGK-neo selection cassette, was inserted at the same position into the Myf-5 locus (11Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Buckingham M Nature. 1996; 384: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To explain the Myf-5 rib phenotype it has been suggested that the early myotome might be the source of inductive, trophic, and/or patterning interactions required to form the ribs, which arise from a subset of sclerotomal cells immediately adjacent to the myotome (3Braun T. Rudnicki M.A. Arnold H.-H. Jaenisch R Cell. 1992; 71: 369-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Since the formation of the myotome is dependent on Myf-5 and a number of potential inductive signals expressed in myotome like FGFs and PDGF are absent in Myf-5 mutant mice (4Grass S. Arnold H.H. Braun T Development. 1996; 122: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar), this hypothesis appeared plausible and logical. The view that the rib phenotype is caused by secondary events due to myotome defects was further supported by the generation of three different alleles of the MRF4 gene, which is located 8 kb upstream of the Myf-5 gene on mouse chromosome 10 (2Braun T. Arnold H.H EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1176-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Patapoutian A. Yoon J.K. Miner J.H. Wang S. Stark K. Wold B Development. 1995; 121: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang W. Behringer R.R. Olson E.N Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All three MRF4 knockout alleles were characterized by a variable intensity of rib defects that correlated with the severity of myotomal defects. The differing effects of MRF4 mutations on rib formation were believed to result from cis-effects of induced MRF4 mutations on the expression of the neighboring Myf-5 gene. We wanted to prove our initial hypothesis that the lack of trophic signals from the myotome may account for the rib defects by replacing the coding region of Myf-5 with the cDNA for FGF-6 yielding Myf-5FGF6-ki mice. The mutant allele does not contain a PGK-neo-TK selection cassette since the latter was removed by Cre-recombinase-mediated excision nor does it show an alteration of exon–intron boundaries (Figure 1). We also generated a conditionally active Myf-5 allele by insertion of a loxP site upstream of exon I of the Myf-5 gene and a loxP-flanked PGK-neo-TK cassette into the first intron of the Myf-5 gene. The selection cassette was enzymatically removed by Cre-recombinase. Subsequently, mouse strains were created from these cells and mice were bred with the deleter strain mice (10Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), which carry a ubiquitously active Cre-recombinase gene driven by the human cytomegalovirus minimal promotor (PBi-2) generating Myf-5ΔloxP mice. The Cre-mediated deletion removes a 3 kb fragment encompassing exon I, which contains most of the coding region including the bHLH DNA binding region and 2 kb of upstream sequences (Figure 1). As expected the Myf-5loxP conditional allele is functional prior to recombination while Myf-5 mRNA was fully absent from Myf-5ΔloxP/Myf-5ΔloxP mice. Heterozygous Myf-5FGF6-ki and Myf-5ΔloxP mice were mated, and the genotype of the offspring was determined by Southern Blot analysis at birth. Newborn mice including homozygous mutants appeared clinically normal at birth. This observation is in marked contrast to the situation caused by the original Myf-5m1 mutation and in Myf-5lacZ and Myf-6m1 homozygous mutants, which die without exception a few minutes after delivery due to the lack of the distal parts of the ribs. Homozygous E18.5 Myf-5FGF6-ki and Myf-5ΔloxP embryos were subjected to whole mount bone and cartilage staining; no alterations of the ribs or other skeletal elements were discernible (Figure 2). Most Myf-5ΔloxP/Myf-5ΔloxP mice reached adulthood and were fertile. The absence of any rib or other skeletal abnormalities was corroborated by analysis of a larger group of Myf-5ΔloxP/Myf-5ΔloxP mice in the F2 and F3 generation. From this set of data we conclude that the absence of Myf-5 mRNA is not sufficient to cause the rib phenotype observed in homozygous mutant Myf-5m1 mice. The unexpected phenotype of homozygous Myf-5ΔloxP and Myf-5FGF6-ki mice led us to reinvestigate the absence of myotome formation in Myf-5 mutant mice. At E9.75 we performed an in situ analysis of myogenin and MRF4 mRNA and MyHC, titin, nebulin, and desmin protein expression, respectively. While the different molecules were easily detectable in wild-type and in heterozygous mutant Myf-5ΔloxP embryos, homozygous Myf-5ΔloxP embryos failed to show any signals in somites (Figure 2). Later on during development, MyoD expression started and apparently rescued the early defect in myogenesis leading to grossly normal muscle tissue at birth (data not shown). Further breeding with Myf-5ΔloxP with MyoD mutant mice revealed that double homozygous MyoD/Myf-5ΔloxP mice lack all skeletal myotubes as their MyoD/Myf-5m1 counterparts. The Myf-5/MRF4 locus has been targeted several times. Most alleles published so far generated significant, though different, rib pattern formation deficits. The explanation for the rib phenotype concentrated on defects in myotome formation caused by a lack or a massive reduction of Myf-5 expression. The results of three different mutations introduced into the MRF4 gene, which is located approximately 8 kb upstream of Myf-5 on mouse chromosome 10 seemed to support this view (8Olson E.N. Arnold H.H. Rigby P.W. Wold B.J Cell. 1996; 85: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The generation of the two new Myf-5 alleles reported here, which do not show any malformations of the ribs or other skeletal elements despite the absence of Myf-5 mRNA in somites and the complete loss of early myotome formation, exclude this explanation. We can rule out a direct involvement of the Myf-5 and/or MRF4 proteins in the generation of the short rib phenotype. Neither the Myf-5ΔloxP nor the “weakest” MRF4 mutations, which are true null-alleles of the Myf-5 and the MRF4 gene, respectively, nor Myf-5ΔloxP/Myf-6m1 mice and Myf-5ΔloxP/Myf-5m1 compound heterozygous mice show any rib truncations. These findings now strongly suggest that an alteration of the activity of a third or more unknown gene(s) is the real cause for the skeletal malformations seen in Myf-5m1, Myf-5lacZ, and the various MRF4 knockout mouse strains. This does not necessarily mean that no cross-talk between different somitic layers is necessary for rib formation. A number of separate experiments indicate that the dermomyotome but not necessarily the myotomal cell layer is involved in the morphogenesis of the distal parts of the ribs (6Henderson D.J. Conway S.J. Copp A.J Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Huang R. Zhi Q. Schmidt C. Wilting J. Brand-Saberi B. Christ B Development. 2000; 127: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). It is still feasible that inductive influences from the dermomyotome are necessary for early specification of lateral sclerotome. Alteration of a gene that is normally active in the dermomyotome by the Myf-5 mutation may therefore be causative for sclerotomal malformations. How does the phenotype of the knockout of the Myogenin gene that resides on a differerent chromosome but also results in a rib phenotype (5Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmundson D.G. Venuti J. Olson E.N. Klein W.H Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) fit into this picture? (1) The myogenin phenotype is rather different from the Myf-5 phenotype. (2) It was never very likely to depend on the same mechanism, since the lack of Myogenin did not result in a lack of myotome formation and the development of primary muscle cells in Myogenin mutant embryos was not severely affected (12Venuti J.M. Morris J.H. Vivian J.L. Olson E.N. Klein W.H J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 128: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It appears most likely that either the increase of the relative numbers of myoblasts during primary or secondary myogenesis affects the delicate balance between dermomyotome and sclerotome or at a later stage the interaction of the rib blastema with surrounding tissues. This may lead to a phenocopy of some aspects of the Myf-5 phenotype without affection of the gene that causes the phenotype in Myf-5 mutants. Sequence analysis of the greater Myf-5 locus is in progress. Expression analysis of potential open reading frames from this region during embryonic development in wild-type, Myf-5ΔloxP, and Myf-5m1 mice will allow us to determine whether these genes might be involved in formation and growth of the sclerotome, rib primordia, or chondrocytes. Final proof of the role of these genes will await genetic manipulation of their expression in transgenic mice. The Myf-5 example emphasizes the fact that our current ability to build valid models explaining the phenotype of targeted mutations is strongly biased by our knowledge of neighboring genes. Although a number of cases have been described where genes of the same multigene group in a cluster were affected by a targeted mutation, no examples have been described where an unrelated gene was influenced in cis by gene targeting experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2163830816,"Dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is expressed on the surface of infected cells and is a target of human antibody responses to dengue virus infection. We show here that dengue virus uses the cellular glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage pathway to express a GPI-anchored form of NS1 and that GPI anchoring imparts a capacity for signal transduction in response to binding of NS1-specific antibody. This study is the first to identify GPI linkage of a virus-encoded protein. The GPI anchor addition signal for NS1 was identified, by transfection of HeLa cells with dengue cDNA constructs, as a downstream hydrophobic domain in NS2A. GPI linkage of NS1 in both transfected and infected cells was demonstrated by cleavage of NS1 from the surface by PI-specific phospholipase C and by metabolic incorporation of the GPI-specific components ethanolamine and inositol. In common with other GPI-anchored proteins, addition of specific antibody resulted in signal transduction, as evidenced by tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Antibody-induced signal transduction by GPI-linked NS1 suggests a mechanism of cellular activation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of human dengue disease. Signal transduction by a GPI-anchored viral antigen interacting with a specific antibody that it induces is a new concept in the pathogenesis of viral disease."

The low molecular mass isoform of FGF-2 (18 kDa) is primarily localized to the cytoplasm and acts through cell-surface receptors, whereas the high molecular mass isoforms of FGF-2 (22, 22.5, and 24 kDa) are targeted to the nucleus and may signal independently of transmembrane receptor pathways (12Bikfalvi A.

Our previous study using an antisense RNA approach to inhibit the expression of one or more members of the FGF family could not determine whether the effects of FGF on vasculogenesis were mediated through intracellular signals or through interaction with FGFRs on the cell surface (9LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strategies directed at decreasing FGFR availability can assess the importance of cell-surface receptor versus nuclear signaling in regulating vascular development. Expression of a truncated FGFR lacking a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain allows for the formation of nonfunctional heterodimers with wild-type endogenous receptors, thereby inhibiting receptor-mediated signal transduction (23Amaya E.

In the present study, expression of a dominant-negative FGFR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in inhibition of FGF signaling as evidenced by impairment of MAPK activation. Disruption of FGFR signaling induced endothelial cell apoptosis and inhibition of endothelial cell migration in response to FGF, but not in response to VEGF. To test the hypothesis that signaling through the FGFR is essential for normal vascular development, a mouse embryo culture model was employed (9LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative mutant of FGFR-1 was expressed in the developing endothelium of an embryonic day 9.0 mouse embryo to inhibit FGFR signaling. Overexpression of a dominant-negative FGFR in the mouse embryo disrupted embryonic and extra-embryonic vascular development and prevented the formation of a mature vascular network. Thus, signaling by FGF through its transmembrane receptor is essential for normal endothelial cell function in vitro and the development and maintenance of the embryonic vasculature in vivo. Replication-deficient human type 5 adenovirus containing the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter (AdCMV/lacZ) was provided by the Institute for Human Gene Therapy of the University of Pennsylvania. A recombinant adenovirus containing a 1.1-kilobase pair fragment of the murine FGF-2 cDNA in the antisense orientation (AdCMV/antisense FGF-2) was generated as described (9LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An adenoviral vector containing a dominant-negative mutant of murine FGFR-1 (AdCMV/DNFGFR) was constructed as described previously (31Miyamoto T. LeConte I. Swain J.L. Fox J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, truncated, kinase-deficient, dominant-negative FGFR-1 was generated by PCR using a forward primer corresponding to positions 470–487 of the FGFR-1 cDNA (5′-GTGGAGAATGAGTATGGG-3′) and a reverse primer corresponding to positions 1046–1063 of FGFR-1 followed by 10 amino acid sequence of the human c-myc epitope, a stop codon, and anSpeI restriction enzyme recognition site (5′-TAATGTGATACTAGTTTATAGGTCTTCTTCACTTATGAGCTTCTGTTCCACTGTTACCTGTCTGCG-3′). High titer stocks were prepared by infecting human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the recombinant virus and were purified as described (33Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Bio/Technology. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Virus was resuspended in 3% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C prior to injection. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described previously (34Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6001) Google Scholar) and maintained in essential growth medium (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). Cells were seeded on 6-well plates coated with 1% gelatin (Sigma) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and, 24 h later, were infected with recombinant adenovirus for 24 h. Following infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested using cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in PBS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% Tris/glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.2% Tween 20 at room temperature. Transgene expression was detected by incubating the membrane with a monoclonal antibody to c-Myc (clone 9E10, Oncogene Products) at 2 μg/ml. Membranes were washed three times with PBS and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:2000. Following three washes with PBS, blots were developed and visualized through an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To assess the presence of endogenous FGFR-1 protein, membranes were stripped and reprobed using a polyclonal antibody against a peptide sequence to the carboxyl terminus of human FGFR-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To control for loading and transfer efficiency, blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma). HUVECs were infected with 5 × 103 particles/cell of either AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/DNFGFR for 12 h and then replated at 1.7 × 104cells/well in 6-well dishes. The cells were incubated in either essential growth medium or minimal EBM containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 25 ng/ml bFGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24, 48, or 72 h at 37 °C. At each time point, duplicate wells were harvested by trypsinization and counted three times using a Brightline hemocytometer. Modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm well, 8.0-μm pores, 10-μm thickness; Transwell, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were utilized. The lower surface of the membrane was coated with 10 μg/ml collagen type I (Vitrogen 100, Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA); rinsed once with PBS; and placed into the lower chamber containing medium (EBM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) alone or with one of the following: 10% serum, 30 ng/ml bFGF (Life Technologies, Inc.), or 30 ng/ml VEGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). HUVECs infected with either AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/DNFGFR were plated in the upper chamber (5 × 104) and allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C. Non-migrating cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane with a cotton swab, and the cells migrating to the lower chamber were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 9.0) and 2% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature. Cell counts from six random high power fields/well in triplicate wells were obtained. HUVECs were infected with recombinant adenovirus for 12 h and replated on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Positive controls were obtained by incubating with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min at room temperature to induce DNA strand fragmentation. TUNEL staining was performed using an in situcell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Labs, Inc.) prior to analysis by light microscopy. To determine the phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPK, Western blot analysis was used. HUVECs were infected with recombinant adenovirus (5 × 103 particles/cell) for 12 h, trypsinized, and replated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates in serum-free minimal EBM. Three hours later, the cells were treated with 25 ng/ml recombinant bFGF or VEGF for 10 min in the absence or presence of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm; New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Protein samples were probed with antibody to activated forms of p42/p44 MAPK (1:5000; Sigma). Blots were reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody to confirm equivalent protein loading. Timed pregnant CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Portage, MI). The embryos (embryonic days 8.0–8.25, one to five somites) were removed from pregnant females and washed with sterile Dulbecco's PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) as described (35Strum K. Tam P.P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 164-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Embryos were dissected free from the decidua and Reichart's membrane using fine forceps, leaving the yolk sac intact. Five to six embryos were placed in a 50-ml Falcon tube containing 5 ml of culture medium (70% heat-inactivated rat serum and 30% sterile Dulbecco's PBS). Rat serum was isolated as described (36Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Cultures were equilibrated with 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 and rotated during incubation (37 °C, 30 rpm) for 12–16 h. Viable embryos were removed from culture and placed in 37 °C Dulbecco's PBS. Adenovirus stocks were diluted 1:2 with PBS and injected into the sinus venosus of the embryos using microcapillary pipettes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) as described previously (9LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following injection, embryos were collected and placed in culture medium equilibrated with 20% O2, 5% CO2, and 75% N2 for an additional 22–26 h (AdCMV/lacZ, n = 59; AdCMV/DNFGFR, n = 78; and AdCMV/antisense FGF-2,n = 10). The embryos were subgrouped with respect to the following properties: presence of beating heart, extent of neural tube closure, development of functioning extra-embryonic circulation, and degree of turning of the embryos. Microangiography was performed in randomly selected embryos (AdCMV/lacZ, n = 25; AdCMV/DNFGFR, n = 30; and AdCMV/antisense FGF-2,n = 6) by injection of phenol red dye into the vitelline arteries of embryos injected with AdCMV/lacZ (control), AdCMV/DNFGFR, or AdCMV/antisense FGF-2. To detect the expression of the dominant-negative mutant of FGFR-1 in embryos injected with AdCMV/DNFGFR, PCR amplification was performed using specific target sequences. Total RNA from AdCMV/lacZ (control)-, AdCMV/antisense FGF-2-, and AdCMV/DNFGFR-injected embryos was isolated using a total RNA isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's directions. Reverse transcription utilizing 2 μg of total RNA was performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). To reverse-transcribe dominant-negative FGFR-1, a reverse primer corresponding to the c-myc epitope (5′-TAGGTCTTCTTCACTTATGAGCTTCTGTTC-3′) was used. A random hexamer primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a control. The primers used to detect the dominant-negative and endogenous FGFRs were 5′-GTGGAGAATGAGTATGGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CACTGTTACCTGTCTGCG-3′ (reverse primer). PCR was performed using a forward primer (5′-CCTGAAGGGTGGTGCCAAAAG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CCATCCACAGTCTTCTGAGTG-3′) for detecting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Cultured embryos were collected and dissected free of extra-embryonic membranes. For whole-mount immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, bleached with 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, and blocked in PBSMT (PBS containing 3% instant skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20). The embryos were incubated with anti-PECAM antibody (1:100; Pharmingen) in PBSMT at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with PBSMT at 4 °C, embryos were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:100; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The embryos were washed with PBSMT, and peroxidase staining was performed as described previously (37Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar). For cryostat sections, embryos were embedded in OCT and then sectioned at 6 μm. Sections were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 3% goat serum in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated with monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody, anti-PECAM antibody, or monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase clone GAL-13 (Sigma) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rat IgG and developed using Vectastain (ABC kit, Vector Labs, Inc.). The sections were then counterstained with methyl green or nuclear fast red (Vector Labs, Inc.). Following injection and culture, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2. Embryos were incubated with a solution containing 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm MgCl2, and a 1 mg/ml concentration of the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Promega) for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Embryos were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed three times with PBS, and embedded in paraffin; and 6-μm sections were cut. Sections were cleared twice in 100% xylene, rehydrated through a series of ethanol washes (100 to 70%), washed with distilled water, and counterstained with hematoxylin. To demonstrate the expression of the c-myc-tagged truncated FGFR protein, Western blot analysis was performed. The truncated FGFR protein was detected as a doublet between 50 and 67 kDa (Fig.1 A). The expression of the dominant-negative FGFR transgene was observed to be dose-dependent when increasing titers of AdCMV/DNFGFR were used for infection. To confirm these results, a monoclonal antibody to the ectodomain of FGFR-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used to reprobe the blot and demonstrated results identical to those using the anti-c-Myc antibody (data not shown). To detect the endogenous FGFR, the blot was reprobed with a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide sequence to the carboxyl terminus of human FGFR-1. As shown in Fig. 1 B, endogenous FGFR-1 was expressed at similar levels in both AdCMV/lacZ- and AdCMV/DNFGFR-infected cells. To normalize for loading and transfer efficiency, a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody was used to reprobe the blots (Fig. 1 C). To examine whether the expression of the truncated FGFR interferes with FGF signaling, cells were infected with either AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/DNFGFR and subsequently treated with bFGF or VEGF in the presence or absence of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Fig.2). Treatment of control cells with bFGF or VEGF resulted in the stimulation of MAPK phosphorylation in the absence of the MEK1 inhibitor. Addition of PD98059 under the above conditions inhibited MAPK phosphorylation. In cells expressing the dominant-negative FGFR, bFGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation was effectively inhibited, whereas VEGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation was normal. These data demonstrate that the dominant-negative FGFR selectively disrupts FGFR signaling, as indicated by inhibition of MAPK activation. The AdCMV/lacZ-infected cells cultured in minimal EBM supplemented with FGF increased in number over time (Fig.3). In contrast, cells expressing the mutant FGFR failed to increase in number when cultured under similar conditions and actually decreased in number with time, similar to AdCMV/lacZ-infected cells cultured in minimal medium without FGF. By microscopic examination, the cells expressing the dominant-negative FGFR were shrunken, disintegrated into small vesicles, and ultimately detached from the culture dishes. To determine whether the morphological changes and decreased cell number were due to apoptosis, TUNEL staining was performed (Fig. 4). The proportion of TUNEL-positive cells expressing the dominant-negative FGFR was 37%, compared with 4% of control-infected cells supplemented with FGF. This was similar to β-galactosidase-expressing cells cultured without supplemented FGF. These results indicate that signaling through the FGFR is necessary for FGF-mediated cell survival.Figure 4Apoptosis induced by the dominant-negative FGFR. HUVECs infected with either AdCMV/lacZ (control;A) or AdCMV/DNFGFR (B) were cultured in minimal EBM containing bFGF (25 ng/ml) for 48 h and labeled by TUNEL, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. TUNEL-positive cells aredarkly stained. As a positive control, AdCMV/lacZ-infected cells were cultured in minimal EBM without supplemental FGF (C) or were incubated with DNase I (D). The proportion of apoptotic cell death was determined by counting TUNEL-positive cells per field (E).lacZ-infected cells cultured in essential growth medium (white bar) or minimal EBM containing bFGF (black bar) showed significantly less apoptosis than cells infected with AdCMV/DNFGFR and cultured in minimal EBM containing 25 ng/ml bFGF(gray bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Assays were performed to determine whether FGF signaling through cell-surface receptors induces cell migration (Fig.5). Cell migration was stimulated by bFGF, VEGF, and serum in control cells. In contrast, expression of the dominant-negative FGFR significantly decreased bFGF-induced cell migration, whereas VEGF- or serum-induced migration was not inhibited. This observation suggests that the activation of FGFR signaling is required for endothelial cell migration. To detect the expression of the transgene in embryos injected with AdCMV/DNFGFR, total RNA was isolated from embryos 22–26 h post-injection, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed (Fig.6). AdCMV/DNFGFR viral DNA was used as a positive control. AdCMV/DNFGFR-injected embryos expressed the truncated FGFR (641 bp), whereas no transgene-specific bands were detected in the embryos injected with adenoviruses encoding lacZ or antisense FGF-2 (Fig. 6 A). To detect endogenous FGFR-1, a random hexamer was used for reverse transcription. A 593-bp band corresponding to the endogenous FGFR was expressed in the samples from embryos injected with adenoviruses encoding lacZ, antisense FGF-2, and the dominant-negative FGFR (Fig. 6 B). No bands were detected in samples from AdCMV/DNFGFR-injected embryos amplified in the absence of Taq polymerase. AdCMV/DNFGFR viral DNA as a positive control yielded a 593-bp band. As an internal control, reverse transcription-PCR using primers to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed (Fig.6 C). These data demonstrate that injection of embryos with AdCMV/DNFGFR results in expression of the dominant-negative FGFR transgene. Previous reports indicate that the expression of adenoviral vectors under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter is restricted to the endocardium of the heart and developing blood vessels (9LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Embryos injected with either AdCMV/lacZ or a mixture of AdCMV/DNFGFR plus AdCMV/lacZ (2:1 ratio) and cultured for an additional 24 h were stained for β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 7). β-Galactosidase activity was detected only in the endocardium and vascular endothelium of whole embryos injected with either AdCMV/lacZ (Fig. 7 A) or AdCMV/DNFGFR plus AdCMV/lacZ (Fig. 7 B). Upon sectioning the embryos, β-galactosidase expression was clearly evident in the endothelium of the dorsal aorta (Fig. 7, C andD), the endocardium of the heart (Fig. 7, E andF), and the endothelium of yolk sac blood vessels (Fig. 7,G and H) in both AdCMV/lacZ (control)-injected and AdCMV/DNFGFR plus AdCMV/lacZ-injected embryos. To confirm endothelial cell-specific expression of the transgene, the expression of PECAM and β-galactosidase was assessed by immunohistochemistry. PECAM and β-galactosidase were coexpressed in the vascular endothelium (Fig. 8, A andB). To examine the localization of the transgene, immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to the c-Myc epitope tag was performed in frozen sections from AdCMV/lacZ- and AdCMV/DNFGFR-injected embryos. The pattern of expression for the dominant-negative FGFR in the AdCMV/DNFGFR-injected embryos resembled that of β-galactosidase expression in embryos injected with AdCMV/lacZ. The truncated FGFR was localized to"

The transcription activity of a cloned 5′-flanking region (1.6 kilobases) of the rat TXS gene (5′FL-TXS) was examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. TXS mRNA expression and the transcription activity of 5′FL-TXS were inhibited by PPARγ ligands, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(PGJ2), and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRO) in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of PPARγ also significantly suppressed transcription, and further addition of PGJ2 or TRO augmented the suppression. Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARγ effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (−98/−88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor2). Moreover, the complex was decreased with PGJ2, TRO, or in vitro translated PPARγ. The transcription suppression by PPARγ was confirmed using this truncated NRF2-binding element (−98/−88) by the reporter gene assay. Finally, a direct interaction between PPARγ and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. In conclusion, the NRF2-binding site (−98/−88) is the major promoter of 5′FL-TXS which can be suppressed by activated PPARγ via a protein-protein interaction with NRF2 in macrophages.

We also have observed that TXS mRNA is induced in an inflammatory model of hydronephrosis characterized by infiltration of macrophages in the renal interstitium (8Tsutsumi E. Takeuchi K. Abe T.

Although the transcriptional regulatory regions of the human (9Lee K.D. Baek S.J. Shen R.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and mouse TXS (10Zhang L. Xiao H. Schultz R.A. Shen R.F. Genomics. 1997; 45: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) genes have been cloned, analysis of their gene transcription has not yet been extensively performed, and any role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) in TXS gene transcription has never been examined.PPAR is one of the nuclear receptors that serves as a transcription factor (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Three different types of PPAR isoforms are present: PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ. PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (12Leblanc B.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and regulate transcription through binding to the PPAR-response element, which is present in the transcriptional regulatory region in several genes. PPARs appear to exhibit distinct patterns of tissue distribution and have different ligands, suggesting that they have their own functions in different tissues. PPARγ was initially identified in differentiated adipocytes, and its role has been determined in relation to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance because the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (insulin sensitizers), such as troglitazone (TRO), was identified with a ligand of PPARγ (13Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar) as well as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(PGJ2) (14Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Recently, however, PPARγ has been shown to be expressed not only in adipocytes, but also in vascular tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells, and in macrophages in atheromatous plaques (15Marx N. Sukhova G. Murphy C. Libby P. Plutzky J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARγ activators inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in VSMCs (16Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and thrombin-induced endothelin-1 production in endothelial cells (17Delerive P. Martin-Nizard F. Chinetti G. Trottein F. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Duriez P. Staels B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In monocytes/macrophages, PPARγ activators suppress production of inflammatory cytokines (18Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and stimulate the expression of scavenger receptors and the uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein, leading to differentiation of monocytes/macrophages to foam cells (19Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Intimal hyperplasia of a balloon-injured rat aorta was also inhibited by TRO (20Shinohara E. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Funahashi T. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Kameda-Takemura K. Matsuzawa Y. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 275-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PPARγ plays a role in vascular metabolism.In this study, we assessed the role of PPARγ in TXS gene regulation in macrophages since both TXS and PPARγ are expressed in macrophages and are possibly involved in atherogenesis. We first cloned a 5′-flanking region of the rat TXS gene (5′FL-TXS), and identified its major promoter in macrophages. We then observed suppression of TXS gene transcription by PPARγ and revealed the mechanism. In conclusion, PPARγ can inhibit TXS gene transcription by a possible direct protein-protein interaction between NRF2 and PPARγ via the NRF2-binding site (−98/−88) in 5′FL-TXS.DISCUSSIONTXS gene transcription analysis with deletion mutants (Fig.3 A) and a construct harboring the mutated NF-E2/AP-1 site (−1598mLuc) (Fig. 8 B) suggests that the major promoter in macrophages whose sequence is homologous to the NF-E2/AP-1 site is present in the −98/−88 region. Consistent with our observation, Leeet al. (9Lee K.D. Baek S.J. Shen R.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have shown that the NF-E2/AP-1 site in the human TXS gene plays a crucial role in TXS gene transcription in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. They have also shown that transcription via the NF-E2/AP-1 site is activated by overexpression of NF-E2 (p45) and have concluded that the NF-E2 site is important for enhancing the TXS gene promoter activity in HL-60 cells, although they have not identified the transcription factor binding to the NF-E2/AP-1 site. In the present study, we observed inhibition of protein-DNA complex formation with anti-NRF2 serum in EMSA using nuclear extracts from macrophages, and the specificity of the inhibitory effect of anti-NRF2 serum was confirmed by a pre-absorption experiment. The results indicated that the NF-E2/AP-1 site (−98/−88) in 5′FL-TXS is possibly bound by NRF2 as an endogenous transcription factor in macrophages. This is the first evidence that NRF2 is involved in the regulation of the TXS gene promoter in macrophages. However, we do not exclude a possibility that other factors, including BACH and p45, are also involved in protein-DNA complex formation. In megakaryocytes, the human TXS promoter was also shown to be bound by NF-E2 (p45) (34Deveaux S. Cohen-Kaminsky S. Shivdasani R.A. Andrews N.C. Filipe A. Kuzniak I. Orkin S.H. Romeo P.H. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further analysis is needed to identify other factors than NRF2 that interact with the NF-E2/AP-1 site in macrophages.NRF2 is a transcription factor with a leucine zipper structure and one of the Cap'n'Collar family transcription factors, including p45, NRF1, NRF3, BACH1, and BACH2 (36Itoh K. Ishii T. Wakabayashi N. Yamamoto M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that NRF2 is involved in the induction of heme oxygenase-1 gene expression by oxidative stress (37Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 38Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Indeed, in NRF2-deficient macrophages, an important role of NRF2 has been demonstrated in the oxidative stress-induced response of heme oxygenase-1 gene expression (39Ishii T. Itoh K. Sato H. Bannai S. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, NRF2 is also involved in gene transcription of phase II detoxifying enzyme genes, including the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 gene (40Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase subunit gene (41Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), via an interaction with the antioxidant response element or the electrophile response element, which possesses the sequence related to an NF-E2/AP-1-binding site. Thus, NRF2 is now known to play an important role in the gene transcription of oxidative stress-induced genes and phase II detoxifying enzymes. The TXS gene (belonging to a cytochrome P450 subfamily) is another new target gene transactivated by NRF2.The NF-E2/AP-1 site was shown to be the major promoter of the TXS gene in macrophages. On the other hand, in RLECs and VSMCs, the major promoter appears to be located in the region where a putative TATA box is present and downstream of the NF-E2/AP-1 site. Moreover, the transcription activity of 5′FL-TXS is suggested to be most potent in macrophages, followed by RLECs and VSMCs, in proportion to the mRNA expression levels in these cells. Consistent with our present results, it has also been shown that the TXS protein is abundantly expressed in macrophages (5Nüsing R. Ullrich V. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 175-180PubMed Google Scholar). 5′FL-TXS is thus suggested to exert different transcription activities dependent on the tissues.PPARγ has been shown to transactivate some genes, most typically the lipoprotein lipase gene (42Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), dependent on the PPAR-response element. Accumulated observations have shown, however, that activation of PPARγ can suppress transcription of some genes, including the angiotensin AT1 receptor (43Sugawara A. Takeuchi K. Ikeda Y. Uruno A. Kudo M. Taniyama Y. Ito S. Hypertension. 1999; 34 (abstr.): 363Google Scholar) and endothelin-1 (17Delerive P. Martin-Nizard F. Chinetti G. Trottein F. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Duriez P. Staels B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) genes. In the present study, we focused on the molecular mechanism of transcription suppression by PPARγ in the TXS gene. Treatment with PPARγ activators PGJ2 and TRO inhibited transcription of 5′FL-TXS as well as mRNA expression levels. Moreover, overexpression of PPARγ also inhibited transcription of 5′FL-TXS, and the addition of PGJ2 or TRO augmented the transcription inhibition. We thus confirmed the transcription suppression of 5′FL-TXS by PPARγ activation. Next, we tried to identify the element responsible for the transcription inhibition. The negative regulation by PPARγ was not observed in 5′-flanking region constructs lacking the major promoter (−98/−88) in macrophages (Fig. 7). It was therefore hypothesized that PPARγ would be involved in the transcription activity of the NF-E2/AP-1 site. Using a reporter construct of the truncated NF-E2/AP-1 site, we examined the transcription suppression by PPARγ. As shown in Fig. 11, the transcription activity of the NF-E2/AP-1 site was stimulated by cotransfection with NRF2 cDNA, and the stimulation was inhibited by PGJ2 as well as by TRO. Overexpression of PPARγ also inhibited the transcription by NRF2, and further addition of PGJ2 or TRO augmented the inhibition. These inhibitory responses in gene transcription were identical when full-length 5′FL-TXS was used. In EMSA with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, the formation of the protein-DNA complex was markedly inhibited by PGJ2 or TRO. Moreover, we observed pronounced inhibition of complex formation by in vitro synthesized PPARγ, but not by RXRα (Fig. 10). The results clearly indicate that activation of PPARγ inhibits the protein-DNA complex formation caused by the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear proteins including NRF2. Finally, in the GST pull-down assay, PPARγ was shown to physically interact with NRF2. This is the first report of the direct interaction of PPARγ with NRF2 that possibly leads to gene transcription suppression. Taken together, the results suggest that PPARγ can interact with NRF2 and may suppress transcription of the TXS gene, probably interfering with the binding of NRF2 to the NF-E2/AP-1 site.Thromboxane inhibitors have been reported to inhibit the progression of experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats (44Hora K. Oguchi H. Furukawa T. Hora K. Tokunaga S. Nephron. 1990; 56: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to ameliorate microalbuminuria in diabetic patients (45Giustina A. Perini P. Desenzani P. Bossoni S. Ianniello P. Milani M. Davi G. Romanelli G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In inflammatory kidneys, infiltrating macrophages express abundant TXS protein (46Berkes E.A. Croker B.P. Barri Y.M. Peterson J.C. Wilcox C.S. Ramos E.L. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1344-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and enhanced thromboxane synthesis in monocytes/macrophages leads to glomerular injury (47Stahl R.A. Thaiss F. Kahf S. Schoeppe W. Helmchen U.M. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is thus suggested that thromboxane synthesis from infiltrating macrophages plays an important role in inflammatory diseases. Thiazolidinediones are now widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has also been reported that the agents would possess other clinical benefits such as inhibiting neointimal formation following balloon injury (20Shinohara E. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Funahashi T.

Hypertens. 1995; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and ameliorating microalbuminuria (49Imano E. Kanda T. Nakatani Y. Nishida T. Arai K. Motomura M. Kajimoto Y. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 2135-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), although the causative mechanisms are still in need of examination. The present observations may provide an insight into the role of PPARγ in vascular and renal diseases in terms of regulation of gene expression.In summary, we have revealed the structure of the functional transcriptional regulatory region of the rat TXS gene. In macrophages, 5′FL-TXS is primarily dependent on the NRF2-binding element (−98/−88) in basal transcription. Activation of PPARγ may possibly suppress TXS gene expression at a transcriptional level. The NRF2-binding element is responsible for the transcription suppression by PPARγ. In EMSA, the formation of the protein-DNA complex caused by the NRF2-binding element and nuclear extracts from macrophages was clearly inhibited by PPARγ. The GST pull-down assay indicated the direct interaction between PPARγ and NRF2. RXRα was not implicated in the mechanism. In conclusion, activation of PPARγ can suppress transcription of the TXS gene via a possible interaction with NRF2 in macrophages. Thromboxane A2 is a labile metabolite of arachidonic acid and a potent inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction (1Needleman P. Kulkarni P.S. Raz A. Science. 1977; 195: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and cell proliferation (2Zucker T.P. Bonisch D. Muck S. Weber A.A. Bretschneider E. Glusa E. Schror K. Circulation. 1998; 97: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thromboxane A2 has been known to play a pathophysiological role in atherosclerosis (3Mehta J.L. Lawson D. Mehta P. Saldeen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and glomerulonephritis (4Remuzzi G. Imberti L. Rossini M. Morelli C. Carminati C. Cattaneo G.M. Bertani T. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thromboxane synthase (TXS)1 catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane A2 and is expressed in lung, liver, kidney, and blood cells including macrophages (5Nüsing R. Ullrich V. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 175-180PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of human (6Ohashi K. Ruan K.H. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 789-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (7Zhang L. Chase M.B. Shen R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and rat (8Tsutsumi E. Takeuchi K. Abe T. Takahashi N. Kato T. Taniyama Y. Ikeda Y. Ito S. Abe K. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) TXS have been reported and are indicated to belong to a cytochrome P450 subfamily. We also have observed that TXS mRNA is induced in an inflammatory model of hydronephrosis characterized by infiltration of macrophages in the renal interstitium (8Tsutsumi E. Takeuchi K. Abe T. Takahashi N. Kato T. Taniyama Y. Ikeda Y. Ito S. Abe K. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional regulatory regions of the human (9Lee K.D. Baek S.J. Shen R.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and mouse TXS (10Zhang L. Xiao H. Schultz R.A. Shen R.F. Genomics. 1997; 45: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) genes have been cloned, analysis of their gene transcription has not yet been extensively performed, and any role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) in TXS gene transcription has never been examined. PPAR is one of the nuclear receptors that serves as a transcription factor (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Three different types of PPAR isoforms are present: PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ. PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (12Leblanc B.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and regulate transcription through binding to the PPAR-response element, which is present in the transcriptional regulatory region in several genes. PPARs appear to exhibit distinct patterns of tissue distribution and have different ligands, suggesting that they have their own functions in different tissues. PPARγ was initially identified in differentiated adipocytes, and its role has been determined in relation to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance because the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (insulin sensitizers), such as troglitazone (TRO), was identified with a ligand of PPARγ (13Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar) as well as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(PGJ2) (14Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Recently, however, PPARγ has been shown to be expressed not only in adipocytes, but also in vascular tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells, and in macrophages in atheromatous plaques (15Marx N. Sukhova G. Murphy C. Libby P. Plutzky J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARγ activators inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in VSMCs (16Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and thrombin-induced endothelin-1 production in endothelial cells (17Delerive P. Martin-Nizard F. Chinetti G. Trottein F. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Duriez P. Staels B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In monocytes/macrophages, PPARγ activators suppress production of inflammatory cytokines (18Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and stimulate the expression of scavenger receptors and the uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein, leading to differentiation of monocytes/macrophages to foam cells (19Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Intimal hyperplasia of a balloon-injured rat aorta was also inhibited by TRO (20Shinohara E. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Funahashi T. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Kameda-Takemura K. Matsuzawa Y. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 275-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PPARγ plays a role in vascular metabolism. In this study, we assessed the role of PPARγ in TXS gene regulation in macrophages since both TXS and PPARγ are expressed in macrophages and are possibly involved in atherogenesis. We first cloned a 5′-flanking region of the rat TXS gene (5′FL-TXS), and identified its major promoter in macrophages. We then observed suppression of TXS gene transcription by PPARγ and revealed the mechanism. In conclusion, PPARγ can inhibit TXS gene transcription by a possible direct protein-protein interaction between NRF2 and PPARγ via the NRF2-binding site (−98/−88) in 5′FL-TXS. DISCUSSIONTXS gene transcription analysis with deletion mutants (Fig.3 A) and a construct harboring the mutated NF-E2/AP-1 site (−1598mLuc) (Fig. 8 B) suggests that the major promoter in macrophages whose sequence is homologous to the NF-E2/AP-1 site is present in the −98/−88 region. Consistent with our observation, Leeet al. (9Lee K.D. Baek S.J. Shen R.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have shown that the NF-E2/AP-1 site in the human TXS gene plays a crucial role in TXS gene transcription in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. They have also shown that transcription via the NF-E2/AP-1 site is activated by overexpression of NF-E2 (p45) and have concluded that the NF-E2 site is important for enhancing the TXS gene promoter activity in HL-60 cells, although they have not identified the transcription factor binding to the NF-E2/AP-1 site. In the present study, we observed inhibition of protein-DNA complex formation with anti-NRF2 serum in EMSA using nuclear extracts from macrophages, and the specificity of the inhibitory effect of anti-NRF2 serum was confirmed by a pre-absorption experiment. The results indicated that the NF-E2/AP-1 site (−98/−88) in 5′FL-TXS is possibly bound by NRF2 as an endogenous transcription factor in macrophages. This is the first evidence that NRF2 is involved in the regulation of the TXS gene promoter in macrophages. However, we do not exclude a possibility that other factors, including BACH and p45, are also involved in protein-DNA complex formation. In megakaryocytes, the human TXS promoter was also shown to be bound by NF-E2 (p45) (34Deveaux S. Cohen-Kaminsky S. Shivdasani R.A. Andrews N.C. Filipe A. Kuzniak I. Orkin S.H. Romeo P.H. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further analysis is needed to identify other factors than NRF2 that interact with the NF-E2/AP-1 site in macrophages.NRF2 is a transcription factor with a leucine zipper structure and one of the Cap'n'Collar family transcription factors, including p45, NRF1, NRF3, BACH1, and BACH2 (36Itoh K. Ishii T. Wakabayashi N. Yamamoto M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that NRF2 is involved in the induction of heme oxygenase-1 gene expression by oxidative stress (37Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 38Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Indeed, in NRF2-deficient macrophages, an important role of NRF2 has been demonstrated in the oxidative stress-induced response of heme oxygenase-1 gene expression (39Ishii T. Itoh K. Sato H. Bannai S. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, NRF2 is also involved in gene transcription of phase II detoxifying enzyme genes, including the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 gene (40Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase subunit gene (41Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), via an interaction with the antioxidant response element or the electrophile response element, which possesses the sequence related to an NF-E2/AP-1-binding site. Thus, NRF2 is now known to play an important role in the gene transcription of oxidative stress-induced genes and phase II detoxifying enzymes. The TXS gene (belonging to a cytochrome P450 subfamily) is another new target gene transactivated by NRF2.The NF-E2/AP-1 site was shown to be the major promoter of the TXS gene in macrophages. On the other hand, in RLECs and VSMCs, the major promoter appears to be located in the region where a putative TATA box is present and downstream of the NF-E2/AP-1 site. Moreover, the transcription activity of 5′FL-TXS is suggested to be most potent in macrophages, followed by RLECs and VSMCs, in proportion to the mRNA expression levels in these cells. Consistent with our present results, it has also been shown that the TXS protein is abundantly expressed in macrophages (5Nüsing R. Ullrich V. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 175-180PubMed Google Scholar). 5′FL-TXS is thus suggested to exert different transcription activities dependent on the tissues.PPARγ has been shown to transactivate some genes, most typically the lipoprotein lipase gene (42Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), dependent on the PPAR-response element. Accumulated observations have shown, however, that activation of PPARγ can suppress transcription of some genes, including the angiotensin AT1 receptor (43Sugawara A. Takeuchi K. Ikeda Y. Uruno A. Kudo M. Taniyama Y. Ito S. Hypertension. 1999; 34 (abstr.): 363Google Scholar) and endothelin-1 (17Delerive P. Martin-Nizard F. Chinetti G. Trottein F. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Duriez P. Staels B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) genes. In the present study, we focused on the molecular mechanism of transcription suppression by PPARγ in the TXS gene. Treatment with PPARγ activators PGJ2 and TRO inhibited transcription of 5′FL-TXS as well as mRNA expression levels. Moreover, overexpression of PPARγ also inhibited transcription of 5′FL-TXS, and the addition of PGJ2 or TRO augmented the transcription inhibition. We thus confirmed the transcription suppression of 5′FL-TXS by PPARγ activation. Next, we tried to identify the element responsible for the transcription inhibition. The negative regulation by PPARγ was not observed in 5′-flanking region constructs lacking the major promoter (−98/−88) in macrophages (Fig. 7). It was therefore hypothesized that PPARγ would be involved in the transcription activity of the NF-E2/AP-1 site. Using a reporter construct of the truncated NF-E2/AP-1 site, we examined the transcription suppression by PPARγ. As shown in Fig. 11, the transcription activity of the NF-E2/AP-1 site was stimulated by cotransfection with NRF2 cDNA, and the stimulation was inhibited by PGJ2 as well as by TRO. Overexpression of PPARγ also inhibited the transcription by NRF2, and further addition of PGJ2 or TRO augmented the inhibition. These inhibitory responses in gene transcription were identical when full-length 5′FL-TXS was used. In EMSA with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, the formation of the protein-DNA complex was markedly inhibited by PGJ2 or TRO. Moreover, we observed pronounced inhibition of complex formation by in vitro synthesized PPARγ, but not by RXRα (Fig. 10). The results clearly indicate that activation of PPARγ inhibits the protein-DNA complex formation caused by the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear proteins including NRF2. Finally, in the GST pull-down assay, PPARγ was shown to physically interact with NRF2. This is the first report of the direct interaction of PPARγ with NRF2 that possibly leads to gene transcription suppression. Taken together, the results suggest that PPARγ can interact with NRF2 and may suppress transcription of the TXS gene, probably interfering with the binding of NRF2 to the NF-E2/AP-1 site.Thromboxane inhibitors have been reported to inhibit the progression of experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats (44Hora K.

Taken together, the results suggest that PPARγ can interact with NRF2 and may suppress transcription of the TXS gene, probably interfering with the binding of NRF2 to the NF-E2/AP-1 site. Thromboxane inhibitors have been reported to inhibit the progression of experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats (44Hora K. Oguchi H. Furukawa T. Hora K. Tokunaga S. Nephron. 1990; 56: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to ameliorate microalbuminuria in diabetic patients (45Giustina A. Perini P. Desenzani P. Bossoni S. Ianniello P. Milani M. Davi G. Romanelli G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In inflammatory kidneys, infiltrating macrophages express abundant TXS protein (46Berkes E.A. Croker B.P.

It is thus suggested that thromboxane synthesis from infiltrating macrophages plays an important role in inflammatory diseases. Thiazolidinediones are now widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has also been reported that the agents would possess other clinical benefits such as inhibiting neointimal formation following balloon injury (20Shinohara E. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Funahashi T.

The present observations may provide an insight into the role of PPARγ in vascular and renal diseases in terms of regulation of gene expression. In summary, we have revealed the structure of the functional transcriptional regulatory region of the rat TXS gene. In macrophages, 5′FL-TXS is primarily dependent on the NRF2-binding element (−98/−88) in basal transcription. Activation of PPARγ may possibly suppress TXS gene expression at a transcriptional level. The NRF2-binding element is responsible for the transcription suppression by PPARγ. In EMSA, the formation of the protein-DNA complex caused by the NRF2-binding element and nuclear extracts from macrophages was clearly inhibited by PPARγ. The GST pull-down assay indicated the direct interaction between PPARγ and NRF2. RXRα was not implicated in the mechanism. In conclusion, activation of PPARγ can suppress transcription of the TXS gene via a possible interaction with NRF2 in macrophages.

Although the sphingomyelin content in LY-A and LY-B cells was ∼40 and ∼15%, respectively, of the wild-type level without accumulation of ceramide, these mutant cells were almost identical in cholesterol content and also in plasma membrane cholesterol level to the wild-type cells. However, density gradient fractionation analysis of Triton X-100-treated lysates of cells prelabeled with [3H]cholesterol showed that the [3H]cholesterol level in the low-density floating fraction was lower in sphingomyelin-deficient cells than in wild-type cells. When cells were exposed to methyl-β-cyclodextrin, cholesterol was more efficiently fluxed from sphingomyelin-deficient cells than wild-type cells. These results suggest that the steady state level of cholesterol at the plasma membrane is little affected by the sphingomyelin levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells, but that sphingomyelin levels play an important role in the retention of cholesterol in the plasma membrane against efflux to extracellular cholesterol-acceptors, due to interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol in detergent-resistant membrane domains.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Recent developments in membrane biology have demonstrated various lines of evidence that the plasma membrane has microdomains, termed detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains or lipid rafts, which are involved in various cellular events, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar, 3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). DRM domains are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and probably exist as liquid-ordered phase, characterized by a conformationally ordered state of the acyl chains of phospholipids that are laterally diffusible (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Formation of the liquid-ordered phase reflects the fact that cholesterol interacts favorably with phospholipid acyl chains in an extended conformation. SM and saturated glycerophospholipids readily form the extended acyl chain conformation, while unsaturated phospholipids having cis-configuration of the double bond do not. Many studies with model membranes have indicated that cholesterol interacts with SM more strongly than with unsaturated glycerophospholipids, the predominant forms of natural glycerophospholipids (4Demel R.A.

In addition, previous studies with model membrane vesicles consisting of pure lipids have shown that cholesterol enhances detergent insolubility of SM, and that sphingolipids or saturated glycerophospholipids tending to form the lipid-ordered phase are also important for detergent insolubility of cholesterol (8Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar,9Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).Only a few reports, however, have addressed the issue of the participation of SM in the formation of DRM domains in cells, whereas many studies have demonstrated various lines of evidence that cholesterol is responsible for formation and functions of DRM domains in cells using specific biological and chemical tools to inhibit cholesterol synthesis and to remove cholesterol from cells (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar, 3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

We previously showed evidence that reduction of the cellular sphingolipid level renders glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins more sensitive to bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (11Hanada K. Izawa K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13820-13823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also enhances solubility of GPI-anchored proteins in the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (12Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The blockage of ceramide synthesis by fumonisin B1, a potent inhibitor of dihydrosphingosine-N-acyltransferase, has been shown to inhibit folate uptake via the GPI-anchored receptors (13Stevens V.L. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18020-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and to enhance conversion of prion protein, a GPI-anchored protein, to its scrapie isoform (14Naslavsky N. Shmeeda H. Friedlander G. Yanai A. Futerman A.H. Barenholz Y. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20763-20771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These previous studies have indicated that sphingolipids are important components of DRM domains. However, a mouse melanoma cell mutant defective in glycosphingolipid synthesis has very recently been shown to retain almost normal DRM domains (15Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is therefore imperative that we determine whether SM is a key component of DRM domains.Analysis of SM-deficient cells may yield insight into the biological role of SM. Although treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) is a convenient method for depletion of SM from cell surfaces, this method has the unavoidable flaw that degradation of SM by SMase results in accumulation of ceramide, which serves as a modulator of various cellular functions containing the metabolism and dynamics of cholesterol (16Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Härmälä A.-S. Pörn M.I. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1210: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Ridgway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, when using this method, one must carefully eliminate the possibility that effects of SMase treatment of cells are due to accumulation of ceramide, rather than depletion of SM. Unfortunately, this possibility cannot be eliminated by showing that externally supplied ceramides do not mimic the SMase effects, because long-chain natural ceramide in culture medium is hard to incorporate into the plasma membrane of cells, and short-chain unnatural ceramides that are readily incorporated into cells are quite different in physicochemical properties from natural ceramide produced by treatment of cells with SMase. One way of overcoming this problem is to use cell mutants defective in production of SM without accumulation of ceramide. Recently, we have isolated 2 types of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants defective in sphingolipid biosynthesis (19Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One is LY-A strain defective in ATP-dependent endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus trafficking of ceramide directed to SM biosynthesis (20Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of SM, but not of glycosphingolipids, in LY-A cells is lower than the wild-type level. Another mutant, LY-B strain, has a defect in the LCB1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis, thereby being incapable of de novo synthesis of any sphingolipid species.In the present study, by analysis with CHO cell mutants, we demonstrated that reduction of cellular SM to ∼15% of the wild-type level without accumulation of ceramide causes no change in the plasma membrane cholesterol level, but that SM plays a role in the retention of plasma membrane cholesterol against efflux to extracellular acceptors of cholesterol. In addition, this study showed for the first time that SM is implicated in the formation of DRM domains in cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the effects of reduction of cellular SM on cholesterol behavior in the plasma membrane using CHO cell mutants defective in SM production. There were no differences in the content of cellular cholesterol and its distribution to the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool between these mutant and wild-type cells, even when the SM content in the mutant cells was 15–40% of the wild-type level (Tables I and II, and Fig. 2). LY-B cells were also deficient in ceramide and glycosphingolipids, while the ceramide and glycosphingolipid content in LY-A cells was similar to the wild-type levels (Table I, and see also Ref. 19Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Hence, the possibility was eliminated that the failure to affect the cholesterol levels under SM-deficient conditions was due to functional compensation by an increase of ceramide or glycosphingolipid content. These results indicated that the reduction of cellular SM to ∼15% of the wild-type level has no effect on the steady-state level of cellular cholesterol and its distribution to the plasma membrane. Enrichment of SM in the plasma membrane has been hypothesized to force cholesterol to be also enriched in the plasma membrane, based on the observations that addition of SM to cultured human skin fibroblasts results in an increase in cellular cholesterol content according to the increase in cellular SM level (35Kudchodkar B.J. Albers J.J. Bierman E.L. Atherosclerosis. 1983; 46: 353-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and that cholesterol interacts with SM more strongly than with glycerophospholipids in model membranes (6Lund-Katz S. Laboda H.M. McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3323-3416Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36Wattenberg B.W. Silbert D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2284-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Meer B.W. Hilkmann H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, our analyses with CHO cells suggest that neither SM, glycosphingolipids, nor ceramide is essential for the preferential distribution of cholesterol to the plasma membrane. Consistent with these results, a recent study has shown that most cellular cholesterol is present in the plasma membrane even after depletion of cell surface SM by treatment of human skin fibroblasts with bacterial SMase (38Pörn M.I. Slotte J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the reduced level of SM in the CHO mutant cells is still sufficient for a stoichiometric association with cholesterol at the plasma membrane, because the estimated amount of SM in LY-B cells (∼20 nmol/μmol cellular phospholipid) is far less than that of cholesterol (∼300 nmol/μmol cellular phospholipid) (Tables I andII), and 70–80% of cholesterol in both LY-B and wild-type cells appears to be distributed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Energy-dependent transport of de novosynthesized cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane may be primarily responsible for enrichment of cholesterol in the plasma membrane (39DeGrella R.F. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).We previously showed that sphingolipids are involved in the detergent insolubility of a GPI-anchored protein in CHO cells (12Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, another research group has recently shown that glycosphingolipids are dispensable for formation of DRM domains in murine melanoma cells (15Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), although the original concept of lipid-raft is based on the assumption that the hydrogen bond interaction between the sugar head groups of glycosphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins is important for formation of detergent-resistant rafts (41Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Ostermeyer et al. (15Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that there is no difference in MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol between glycosphingolipid-depleted cells and control cells. We herein demonstrated that CHO mutant LY-A cells having a lower level of SM, but not of glycosphingolipids, had a lower level of DRM-associated cholesterol than wild-type cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that SM plays a role in the formation of DRM domains in CHO cells. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the liquid-ordered phase of lipid bilayers forms in model membranes containing cholesterol and SM (42Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In model membranes, total mol % of lipids tending to form the liquid-ordered phase has been shown to be important for the formation of DRM domains (8Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 9Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Considering that levels of total sphingolipids in SM-deficient CHO mutant cells are lower than the wild-type level (Table I), the total level of SM and glycosphingolipids, but not the level of SM itself, might be a key factor for the formation of DRM domains in cells (see also below).Various investigators have demonstrated that treatment of cells with exogenous SMase enhances efflux of cellular cholesterol to the extracellular cholesterol acceptors, such as high density lipoproteins and cyclodextrins (31Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these previous studies did not eliminate the possibility that the enhanced efflux of cholesterol after SMase treatment was due to accumulation of ceramide. We herein demonstrated that the reduction of cellular SM content without any increase in ceramide level renders plasma membrane cholesterol prone to flux to the extracellular acceptor MβCD (Fig.4). Thus, we conclude that SM play a role in the retention of cholesterol in the plasma membrane against efflux to the extracellular cholesterol-acceptor, probably due to favorable van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions between cholesterol and SM (47Kan C.C. Ruan Z.S. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7759-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 48Bittman R. Kasireddy C.R. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This conclusion does not exclude the possibility that total sphingolipids (SM, ceramide, and glycosphingolipids) or complex sphingolipids (SM and glycosphingolipids) are responsible for the retention of cholesterol. However, treatment of cells with bacterial SMase not only enhances cholesterol efflux from cells (Refs. 31Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G.

Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 6) and also reduces cholesterol distribution to DRM domains (46Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although total sphingolipid levels most likely remain unchanged after SMase treatment. Therefore, levels of SM itself or total complex sphingolipids in cells are likely to be important for the formation of DRM domains and the retention of cholesterol against efflux.Interestingly, MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol from cells results in reduction of cholesterol level in DRM, but not non-DRM domains (Fig.3). The simplest explanation for this observation is that MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol preferentially occurs at the DRM domains in cells. Fielding and Fielding (22Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 49Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that cholesterol efflux from the cell surface to high density lipoproteins occurs largely at DRM domains of the plasma membrane. Alternatively, MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol may occur at non-DRM domains of the plasma membrane, but cellular cholesterol is rapidly redistributed from DRM to non-DRM domains for homeostasis of the cholesterol level of non-DRM domains. A previous study has shown that de novosynthesized cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum is delivered to DRM domains of the plasma membrane by a caveolin-dependent mechanism, and that the cholesterol delivered to DRM domains then rapidly flows to non-DRM domains at the plasma membrane (40Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).It is also noteworthy that cytotoxic susceptibility of CHO cells to MβCD is enhanced when cellular SM level is reduced (Figs. 5 and 6). Because MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol is enhanced in SM-deficient cells (Fig. 4), it is likely that cholesterol is depleted below the level necessary for sustaining viability more easily from SM-deficient cells than from control cells. The higher toxicity of MβCD to SM-deficient cells than control cells may allow the use of this drug for a positive selection of revertants of SM-deficient mutant cells. Both cholesterol and sphingomyelin (SM)1 are preferentially distributed in the plasma membrane of cells (1van Meer G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Recent developments in membrane biology have demonstrated various lines of evidence that the plasma membrane has microdomains, termed detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains or lipid rafts, which are involved in various cellular events, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar, 3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

DRM domains are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and probably exist as liquid-ordered phase, characterized by a conformationally ordered state of the acyl chains of phospholipids that are laterally diffusible (3Brown D.A.

London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar,9Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Only a few reports, however, have addressed the issue of the participation of SM in the formation of DRM domains in cells, whereas many studies have demonstrated various lines of evidence that cholesterol is responsible for formation and functions of DRM domains in cells using specific biological and chemical tools to inhibit cholesterol synthesis and to remove cholesterol from cells (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar, 3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar, 10Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). We previously showed evidence that reduction of the cellular sphingolipid level renders glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins more sensitive to bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (11Hanada K. Izawa K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13820-13823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also enhances solubility of GPI-anchored proteins in the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (12Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The blockage of ceramide synthesis by fumonisin B1, a potent inhibitor of dihydrosphingosine-N-acyltransferase, has been shown to inhibit folate uptake via the GPI-anchored receptors (13Stevens V.L. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18020-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and to enhance conversion of prion protein, a GPI-anchored protein, to its scrapie isoform (14Naslavsky N. Shmeeda H. Friedlander G. Yanai A. Futerman A.H. Barenholz Y. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20763-20771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These previous studies have indicated that sphingolipids are important components of DRM domains. However, a mouse melanoma cell mutant defective in glycosphingolipid synthesis has very recently been shown to retain almost normal DRM domains (15Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is therefore imperative that we determine whether SM is a key component of DRM domains. Analysis of SM-deficient cells may yield insight into the biological role of SM. Although treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) is a convenient method for depletion of SM from cell surfaces, this method has the unavoidable flaw that degradation of SM by SMase results in accumulation of ceramide, which serves as a modulator of various cellular functions containing the metabolism and dynamics of cholesterol (16Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Härmälä A.-S. Pörn M.I. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1210: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Ridgway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, when using this method, one must carefully eliminate the possibility that effects of SMase treatment of cells are due to accumulation of ceramide, rather than depletion of SM. Unfortunately, this possibility cannot be eliminated by showing that externally supplied ceramides do not mimic the SMase effects, because long-chain natural ceramide in culture medium is hard to incorporate into the plasma membrane of cells, and short-chain unnatural ceramides that are readily incorporated into cells are quite different in physicochemical properties from natural ceramide produced by treatment of cells with SMase. One way of overcoming this problem is to use cell mutants defective in production of SM without accumulation of ceramide. Recently, we have isolated 2 types of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants defective in sphingolipid biosynthesis (19Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One is LY-A strain defective in ATP-dependent endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus trafficking of ceramide directed to SM biosynthesis (20Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of SM, but not of glycosphingolipids, in LY-A cells is lower than the wild-type level. Another mutant, LY-B strain, has a defect in the LCB1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis, thereby being incapable of de novo synthesis of any sphingolipid species. In the present study, by analysis with CHO cell mutants, we demonstrated that reduction of cellular SM to ∼15% of the wild-type level without accumulation of ceramide causes no change in the plasma membrane cholesterol level, but that SM plays a role in the retention of plasma membrane cholesterol against efflux to extracellular acceptors of cholesterol. In addition, this study showed for the first time that SM is implicated in the formation of DRM domains in cells. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the effects of reduction of cellular SM on cholesterol behavior in the plasma membrane using CHO cell mutants defective in SM production. There were no differences in the content of cellular cholesterol and its distribution to the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool between these mutant and wild-type cells, even when the SM content in the mutant cells was 15–40% of the wild-type level (Tables I and II, and Fig. 2). LY-B cells were also deficient in ceramide and glycosphingolipids, while the ceramide and glycosphingolipid content in LY-A cells was similar to the wild-type levels (Table I, and see also Ref. 19Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Hence, the possibility was eliminated that the failure to affect the cholesterol levels under SM-deficient conditions was due to functional compensation by an increase of ceramide or glycosphingolipid content. These results indicated that the reduction of cellular SM to ∼15% of the wild-type level has no effect on the steady-state level of cellular cholesterol and its distribution to the plasma membrane. Enrichment of SM in the plasma membrane has been hypothesized to force cholesterol to be also enriched in the plasma membrane, based on the observations that addition of SM to cultured human skin fibroblasts results in an increase in cellular cholesterol content according to the increase in cellular SM level (35Kudchodkar B.J. Albers J.J. Bierman E.L. Atherosclerosis. 1983; 46: 353-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and that cholesterol interacts with SM more strongly than with glycerophospholipids in model membranes (6Lund-Katz S. Laboda H.M. McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3323-3416Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36Wattenberg B.W. Silbert D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2284-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Meer B.W. Hilkmann H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, our analyses with CHO cells suggest that neither SM, glycosphingolipids, nor ceramide is essential for the preferential distribution of cholesterol to the plasma membrane. Consistent with these results, a recent study has shown that most cellular cholesterol is present in the plasma membrane even after depletion of cell surface SM by treatment of human skin fibroblasts with bacterial SMase (38Pörn M.I. Slotte J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the reduced level of SM in the CHO mutant cells is still sufficient for a stoichiometric association with cholesterol at the plasma membrane, because the estimated amount of SM in LY-B cells (∼20 nmol/μmol cellular phospholipid) is far less than that of cholesterol (∼300 nmol/μmol cellular phospholipid) (Tables I andII), and 70–80% of cholesterol in both LY-B and wild-type cells appears to be distributed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Energy-dependent transport of de novosynthesized cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane may be primarily responsible for enrichment of cholesterol in the plasma membrane (39DeGrella R.F. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).We previously showed that sphingolipids are involved in the detergent insolubility of a GPI-anchored protein in CHO cells (12Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, another research group has recently shown that glycosphingolipids are dispensable for formation of DRM domains in murine melanoma cells (15Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), although the original concept of lipid-raft is based on the assumption that the hydrogen bond interaction between the sugar head groups of glycosphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins is important for formation of detergent-resistant rafts (41Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Ostermeyer et al. (15Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that there is no difference in MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol between glycosphingolipid-depleted cells and control cells. We herein demonstrated that CHO mutant LY-A cells having a lower level of SM, but not of glycosphingolipids, had a lower level of DRM-associated cholesterol than wild-type cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that SM plays a role in the formation of DRM domains in CHO cells. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the liquid-ordered phase of lipid bilayers forms in model membranes containing cholesterol and SM (42Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In model membranes, total mol % of lipids tending to form the liquid-ordered phase has been shown to be important for the formation of DRM domains (8Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 9Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Considering that levels of total sphingolipids in SM-deficient CHO mutant cells are lower than the wild-type level (Table I), the total level of SM and glycosphingolipids, but not the level of SM itself, might be a key factor for the formation of DRM domains in cells (see also below).Various investigators have demonstrated that treatment of cells with exogenous SMase enhances efflux of cellular cholesterol to the extracellular cholesterol acceptors, such as high density lipoproteins and cyclodextrins (31Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these previous studies did not eliminate the possibility that the enhanced efflux of cholesterol after SMase treatment was due to accumulation of ceramide. We herein demonstrated that the reduction of cellular SM content without any increase in ceramide level renders plasma membrane cholesterol prone to flux to the extracellular acceptor MβCD (Fig.4). Thus, we conclude that SM play a role in the retention of cholesterol in the plasma membrane against efflux to the extracellular cholesterol-acceptor, probably due to favorable van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions between cholesterol and SM (47Kan C.C. Ruan Z.S. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7759-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 48Bittman R. Kasireddy C.R. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This conclusion does not exclude the possibility that total sphingolipids (SM, ceramide, and glycosphingolipids) or complex sphingolipids (SM and glycosphingolipids) are responsible for the retention of cholesterol. However, treatment of cells with bacterial SMase not only enhances cholesterol efflux from cells (Refs. 31Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G.

Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 6) and also reduces cholesterol distribution to DRM domains (46Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although total sphingolipid levels most likely remain unchanged after SMase treatment. Therefore, levels of SM itself or total complex sphingolipids in cells are likely to be important for the formation of DRM domains and the retention of cholesterol against efflux.Interestingly, MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol from cells results in reduction of cholesterol level in DRM, but not non-DRM domains (Fig.3). The simplest explanation for this observation is that MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol preferentially occurs at the DRM domains in cells. Fielding and Fielding (22Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 49Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that cholesterol efflux from the cell surface to high density lipoproteins occurs largely at DRM domains of the plasma membrane. Alternatively, MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol may occur at non-DRM domains of the plasma membrane, but cellular cholesterol is rapidly redistributed from DRM to non-DRM domains for homeostasis of the cholesterol level of non-DRM domains. A previous study has shown that de novosynthesized cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum is delivered to DRM domains of the plasma membrane by a caveolin-dependent mechanism, and that the cholesterol delivered to DRM domains then rapidly flows to non-DRM domains at the plasma membrane (40Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).It is also noteworthy that cytotoxic susceptibility of CHO cells to MβCD is enhanced when cellular SM level is reduced (Figs. 5 and 6). Because MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol is enhanced in SM-deficient cells (Fig. 4), it is likely that cholesterol is depleted below the level necessary for sustaining viability more easily from SM-deficient cells than from control cells. The higher toxicity of MβCD to SM-deficient cells than control cells may allow the use of this drug for a positive selection of revertants of SM-deficient mutant cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of reduction of cellular SM on cholesterol behavior in the plasma membrane using CHO cell mutants defective in SM production. There were no differences in the content of cellular cholesterol and its distribution to the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool between these mutant and wild-type cells, even when the SM content in the mutant cells was 15–40% of the wild-type level (Tables I and II, and Fig. 2). LY-B cells were also deficient in ceramide and glycosphingolipids, while the ceramide and glycosphingolipid content in LY-A cells was similar to the wild-type levels (Table I, and see also Ref. 19Hanada K.

We previously showed that sphingolipids are involved in the detergent insolubility of a GPI-anchored protein in CHO cells (12Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the liquid-ordered phase of lipid bilayers forms in model membranes containing cholesterol and SM (42Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E.

In model membranes, total mol % of lipids tending to form the liquid-ordered phase has been shown to be important for the formation of DRM domains (8Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We herein demonstrated that the reduction of cellular SM content without any increase in ceramide level renders plasma membrane cholesterol prone to flux to the extracellular acceptor MβCD (Fig.4). Thus, we conclude that SM play a role in the retention of cholesterol in the plasma membrane against efflux to the extracellular cholesterol-acceptor, probably due to favorable van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions between cholesterol and SM (47Kan C.C.

Therefore, levels of SM itself or total complex sphingolipids in cells are likely to be important for the formation of DRM domains and the retention of cholesterol against efflux. Interestingly, MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol from cells results in reduction of cholesterol level in DRM, but not non-DRM domains (Fig.3). The simplest explanation for this observation is that MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol preferentially occurs at the DRM domains in cells. Fielding and Fielding (22Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 49Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that cholesterol efflux from the cell surface to high density lipoproteins occurs largely at DRM domains of the plasma membrane. Alternatively, MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol may occur at non-DRM domains of the plasma membrane, but cellular cholesterol is rapidly redistributed from DRM to non-DRM domains for homeostasis of the cholesterol level of non-DRM domains. A previous study has shown that de novosynthesized cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum is delivered to DRM domains of the plasma membrane by a caveolin-dependent mechanism, and that the cholesterol delivered to DRM domains then rapidly flows to non-DRM domains at the plasma membrane (40Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that cytotoxic susceptibility of CHO cells to MβCD is enhanced when cellular SM level is reduced (Figs. 5 and 6). Because MβCD-mediated efflux of cholesterol is enhanced in SM-deficient cells (Fig. 4), it is likely that cholesterol is depleted below the level necessary for sustaining viability more easily from SM-deficient cells than from control cells. The higher toxicity of MβCD to SM-deficient cells than control cells may allow the use of this drug for a positive selection of revertants of SM-deficient mutant cells."

Of the six known human IAP-related proteins, XIAP is the most potent inhibitor. To study the mechanistic effects of XIAP on DNA damage-induced apoptosis, we prepared U-937 cells that stably overexpress XIAP. The results demonstrate that XIAP inhibits apoptosis induced by 1-[β-d-arabinofuranosyl]cytosine (ara-C) and other genotoxic agents. XIAP had no detectable effect on ara-C-induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and attenuated cleavage of procaspase-9. In addition, we show that ara-C induces the association of XIAP with the cleaved fragments of caspase-9 and thereby inhibition of caspase-9 activity. The results also demonstrate that ara-C induces cleavage of procaspase-3 by a caspase-8-dependent mechanism and that XIAP inhibits caspase-3 activity. These results demonstrate that XIAP functions downstream of procaspase-9 cleavage as an inhibitor of both proteolytically processed caspase-9 and -3 in the cellular response to genotoxic stress.

The available evidence indicates that IAP proteins suppress apoptosis by direct inhibition of caspases (14Deveraux Q. Roy N. Stennicke H. Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E. Salvesen G.

For example, studies have shown that XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 inhibit caspase-9 and thereby block the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3, -6, and -7 (15Roy N. Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G. Reed J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). By contrast, IAP proteins are reported to have no apparent effect on caspase-8-induced activation of procaspase-3 (16Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G. Reed J. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). In this study, human U-937 cells were stably transfected to overexpress XIAP. The results demonstrate that overexpression of XIAP is associated with inhibition of apoptosis induced by ara-C and other genotoxic agents. The results also demonstrate that XIAP attenuates procaspase-9 cleavage and, in addition, inhibits caspase-9 activity. Furthermore, our findings support a role for XIAP downstream of caspase-9 as an inhibitor of proteolytically processed caspase-3. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. The full-lengthmyc-tagged XIAP cDNA was removed from pcDNA3-Myc-XIAP (provided by Dr. John Reed, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) by digesting with HindIII-XhoI. Blunt-ended Myc-XIAP cDNA was cloned into the pEF1-neo vector (17Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Weichselbaum R.R. Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. J. Biol.

U-937 cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulsar, Bio-Rad; 0.25 V, 960 microfarads) with either the pEF1-neo plasmid (U-937/neo) or pEF1-neo containing Myc-XIAP (U-937/XIAP). Transfectants were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml Geneticin sulfate. Limiting dilutions were carried out to obtain single cell clones. The two highest XIAP-expressing clones were used in all experiments. Cells were treated with 10 μm ara-C (Sigma), 30 ng/ml TNF (BASF Bioresearch Corp., Worcester, MA), or 5 μg/ml mouse anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (18Robertson M.J. Manley T.J. Pichert G. Cameron C.

Irradiation was performed with a γ-ray source (137Cs, Gamma Cell 1000, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ontario, Canada) at a fixed dose rate of 13 grays/min. Lysates were prepared by suspending cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Myc monoclonal (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cytochromec (monoclonal clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody.

Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (5 × 106) were harvested; washed; and suspended in 50 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). After incubation at 50 °C for 6 h, the samples were mixed with 50 μl of 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) low-melting-point agarose and 40% sucrose for 10 min at 70 °C. The DNA was separated on 2% agarose gels. After treatment with RNase, the gels were visualized by UV illumination. Analysis of DNA content was performed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). The number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content was determined with a MODFIT LT program (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). S-100 cytosolic fractions were immunodepleted of cytochrome c by incubation with anti-cytochrome cantibody (monoclonal clone 6H2.B4) and protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C (20Liu X. Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). The immunodepletion procedure was repeated twice with centrifugation to remove the beads. [35S]Methionine-labeled caspase-9 was synthesized by the coupled transcription and translation method (Promega, Madison, WI). Caspase-9 was incubated with 10 μl of cytochrome c-free lysate, 1 mm dATP, and 1 μg of cytochrome c(Sigma) at 30 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm EDTA. The reaction products were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then autoradiography. Lysates from U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells before and after cytochrome c depletion were immunoblotted with anti-Apaf-1 (a gift from Xiaodong Wang), anti-XIAP, or anti-cytochrome c antibody. Assays to measure the activities of caspase-9 and -3 using LEHD-pNA or DEVD-pNA as substrate were performed as described (caspase-9 and -3 colorimetric assay kit, BioVision, Palo Alto, CA).

Immunoblot analysis of transfectants with anti-Myc or anti-XIAP antibody confirmed overexpression of XIAP (Fig.1 A) and no detectable change in cIAP levels (data not shown). U-937/neo cells treated with ara-C and harvested at 4 h exhibited a pattern of DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Similar findings were observed after ionizing radiation (IR) exposure (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, overexpression of XIAP was associated with inhibition of ara-C- and IR-induced DNA cleavage (Fig. 1 B). XIAP also inhibited apoptosis induced by TNF or anti-Fas antibody (Fig.1 C). Apoptosis was also monitored by analyzing cells for sub-G1 DNA content. The results confirmed that XIAP inhibits apoptosis induced by ara-C and IR (TableI). Similar results were obtained for TNF- and anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (Table I). These findings demonstrate that, like treatment with TNF or anti-Fas antibody, overexpression of XIAP inhibits apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents.Table IEffect of XIAP overexpression on apoptosis induced by genotoxic agentsCell typeControlara-CIRTNFAnti-Fas AbU-937/neo6.9 ± 1.159.4 ± 4.540.3 ± 1.124.2 ± 3.520.8 ± 2.2U937/XIAP5.2 ± 2.48.2 ± 1.911.6 ± 0.812.4 ± 1.811.3 ± 2.1Cells were treated with 10 μm ara-C for 4 h or with 20 groups of IR, 20 nm TNF, or 5 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody (Ab) and harvested at 6 h.

Genotoxic agents induce apoptosis by signaling the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (21Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

To determine whether XIAP affects cytochrome c release, we treated cells with ara-C and subjected cytoplasmic lysates to immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody. The results demonstrate that overexpression of XIAP had little, if any, effect on ara-C-induced release of cytochrome c (Fig.2 A). Similar findings were obtained in IR-treated cells (Fig. 2 A). In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c and dATP bind to Apaf-1 and promote autoproteolytic activation of procaspase-9 (23Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that XIAP blocks the processing of procaspase-9 in vitro (14Deveraux Q. Roy N. Stennicke H. Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E. Salvesen G. Reed J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). In this context, comparison of proenzyme levels in ara-C-treated U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells indicated that XIAP expression attenuated, in part, the processing of procaspase-9. Moreover, treatment of U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells with ara-C resulted in proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 with increases in the 35-kDa cleaved fragment (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained in IR-treated cells (Fig. 2 A). Processing of procaspase-9 in XIAP-overexpressing cells was therefore analyzed at different times of ara-C exposure. The results demonstrate that procaspase-9 was cleaved to a 35-kDa fragment in both ara-C-treated U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 2 B). However, XIAP expression blocked ara-C-induced apoptosis, even after prolonged exposure to this agent (Fig. 2 legend and Table I). To provide further evidence that procaspase-9 is cleaved in XIAP-expressing cells, we performed an in vitro assay using cytochrome c-immunodepleted S-100 extracts from U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells. The cell extracts were incubated with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled procaspase-9 in the presence or absence of dATP and cytochrome c. Lysates from the XIAP-overexpressing cells failed to inhibit cytochromec/dATP-induced proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 to the 35- and 37-kDa fragments (Fig. 2 C). Since levels of both XIAP and Apaf-1 can affect the processing of procaspase-9, cytochromec-immunodepleted lysates were assayed for XIAP and Apaf-1 levels. Immunoblot analysis with anti-XIAP antibody demonstrated that XIAP was not immunodepleted by cytochrome c (Fig.2 D). Similar results were obtained for Apaf-1 (Fig.2 D). These findings demonstrate that overexpression of XIAP attenuates, but does not completely inhibit, the proteolytic processing of procaspase-9. To determine whether XIAP inhibits caspase-9 activity, we assayed for cleavage of the conjugated substrate LEHD-pNA. Incubation of cytochromec-immunodepleted S-100 extracts from U-937/neo cells with cytochrome c and dATP was associated with induction of caspase-9 activity, whereas this activity was significantly inhibited in U-937/XIAP extracts (Fig.3 A). Since procaspase-9 can be activated in the absence of processing by binding to Apaf-1 (24Stennicke H. Deveraux Q. Humke E. Reed J. Dixit V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 25Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri T. Alnemri E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), we assayed for caspase-9 activity in ara-C-treated U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells. Lysates from U-937/neo cells exhibited an increase in LEHD-pNA cleavage activity at 4 and 6 h of ara-C exposure (Fig.3 B). By contrast, there was little, if any, induction of LEHD-pNA in ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that overexpression of XIAP inhibits caspase-9 activity. Previous studies have shown that caspase-9 proteolytically cleaves and activates procaspase-3 (23Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). Cleavage of procaspase-3 by caspase-9 generates p24 and p12 fragments (23Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

The p24 large subunit is then further processed to p20 or p17 subunits (26Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). U-937/neo cells responded to ara-C exposure with proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 to p20 and p17 subunits and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PKCδ (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, there was little, if any, cleavage of procaspase-3 to p20/p17 subunits or PKCδ in ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar effects were observed in IR-treated U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 4 A). However, overexpression of XIAP failed to inhibit the processing of procaspase-3 to the p24 subunit (Fig. 4 A). Since XIAP inhibits caspase-9 activity, other caspases with large prodomains such as caspase-1, -2, -8, and/or -10 might substitute for caspase-9. To assess the role of XIAP in preventing caspase-3 activation and apoptosis after longer exposures to genotoxic stress, we treated U-937 and U-937/XIAP cells with ara-C for up to 18 h. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from U-937/XIAP cells with anti-caspase-3 antibody revealed that cleavage of procaspase-3 to p24, p20, and p17 subunits was detectable at 8 h and maximal at 18 h (Fig. 4 B). Caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PKCδ, however, was not observed in U-937/XIAP cells treated with ara-C (Fig.4 C). Analysis of cells with sub-G1 DNA content after longer exposures to ara-C confirmed that XIAP inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 4 legend and Table I). To further define the effect of XIAP on caspase-3 activity, we assayed lysates for their ability to cleave DEVD-pNA. U-937/neo cells responded to ara-C with induction of DEVD-pNA-cleaving activity (Fig. 4 D). By contrast, there was little, if any, increase in DEVD-pNA cleavage in ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 4 D). These in vivo andin vitro findings are in concert with the demonstration that XIAP inhibits the activity of processed caspase-3 fragments in vitro (15Roy N. Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G. Reed J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). In addition, our results demonstrate that, despite XIAP overexpression, exposure to genotoxic stress nonetheless results in delayed and attenuated processing of procaspase-3. However, these findings do not exclude the possibility that even higher levels of XIAP overexpression might completely block caspase-3 processing. To explore the mechanisms responsible for caspase-3 processing in U-937/XIAP cells, we asked whether the association between XIAP and processed caspase-9 is reversible during exposure to genotoxic agents. Cell lysates from ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-9 antibody. The results demonstrate that association of XIAP with the cleaved fragment of caspase-9, but not procaspase-9, was detectable at 8 and 14 h of ara-C exposure (Fig. 5 A). These findings, although in contrast to published results (14Deveraux Q. Roy N. Stennicke H. Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E. Salvesen G. Reed J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), further indicate that overexpression of XIAP fails to inhibit processing of procaspase-9 in vivo in the response to genotoxic stress. Immunoblot analysis of lysates before and after immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody demonstrated the presence of both Myc-XIAP and the cleaved caspase-9 fragment (Fig. 5 A). Nonetheless, the low level of caspase-9 activity in ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells (Fig.4 D) supports the presence of sufficient Myc-XIAP to bind and inhibit the cleaved subunits of caspase-9. The association of XIAP and the apoptosome complex (cytochrome c/Apaf-1/procaspase-9) was further analyzed by subjecting lysates from untreated and ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells to immunoprecipitation with anti-cytochrome c or anti-Myc antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-cytochrome c or anti-Myc antibody demonstrated no detectable coprecipitation of Myc-XIAP and cytochrome c (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these results indicate that XIAP binds to processed caspase-9, and not to the apoptosome complex. Considerable evidence indicates that caspase-9 is a major, but not obligatory, activator of caspase-3. In this regard, anti-Fas or anti-CD3 antibody-induced apoptosis in caspase-9-deficient T-cells is mediated through caspase-3 (27Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G. Henderson D. Woo M. Soengas M.

Also, caspase-8 proteolytically cleaves and activates procaspase-3 in the absence of mitochondrial signals (28Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA damage-induced apoptosis can be mediated through expression of Fas ligand and activation of caspase-8 (29Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Direct substrates of caspase-8 include Bid and procaspase-3 (30Luo X. Budiharjo H. Zou H. Slauhter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 31Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-j. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar). To assess activation of caspase-8, we subjected lysates from ara-C-treated U-937/neo and U-937/XIAP cells to immunoblotting with anti-Bid antibody. U-937/neo cells responded to ara-C with the cleavage of Bid at 4 h, and this effect was delayed in U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 6, upper panel). Cleavage of Bid in U-937/XIAP cells was observed at 8 h after ara-C exposure and coincided with the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 (Fig. 6, lower panel). Since Bid can also be cleaved by caspase-3, Bid cleavage in ara-C-treated U-937/neo cells can be attributed to the activities of both caspase-3 and -8. Thus, given the absence of caspase-3 activity in U-937/XIAP cells (Fig. 4), these results support the involvement of Apaf-1-bound procaspase-9, caspase-8, or a caspase-8-like protease in the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 in response to genotoxic stress. This study thus demonstrates that XIAP functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis induced by diverse genotoxic agents. ara-C incorporates into DNA and functions as a relative chain terminator (32Fram R.J. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4050-4053PubMed Google Scholar), whereas IR induces DNA double strand breaks (33Hall E.J. Astor M. Fry M. Oleinick N. Waldron C. Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 11: 220-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results indicate that, in the presence of both types of DNA damage, XIAP has no detectable effect on cytochrome c release, but attenuates, in part, procaspase-9 cleavage. Indeed, other studies have demonstrated that XIAP inhibits procaspase-9 cleavage in vitro (14Deveraux Q. Roy N. Stennicke H. Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E. Salvesen G. Reed J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) and may exhibit cell type-specific effects. Although other studies have demonstrated that activation of procaspase-9 may not require cleavage, binding to Apaf-1 is essential (24Stennicke H. Deveraux Q. Humke E. Reed J. Dixit V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 25Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri T. Alnemri E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Additional proteins in the complex could thus conceivably interfere with the ability of unprocessed procaspase-9 to assume an active configuration (as found with cleaved caspase-9) that is necessary for the XIAP interaction. In this context, XIAP blocked induction of caspase-9 activity found in the response of cells to DNA damage. In addition, the results demonstrate that DNA damage-induced caspase-3 activity is blocked in the XIAP-overexpressing cells. This study also demonstrates that DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mediated by at least two interrelated pathways (Fig. 6). Treatment of U-937 cells with ara-C or IR was associated with the release of cytochrome c, cleavage of procaspase-9, and activation of caspase-3. In addition, both genotoxic agents induced, as later events, the activation of caspase-8. The observation that cytochromec is released in the absence of Bid cleavage in ara-C-treated U-937/XIAP cells supports involvement of a Bid-independent mechanism in DNA damage-induced cytochrome crelease. In this regard, recent studies have supported the involvement of a cytosolic factor other than Bid in caspase-6 and -7-induced cytochrome c release (34Gross A. Yin X.-M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The finding that benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a broad inhibitor of caspases, blocks etoposide-induced cleavage of Bid, but not release of cytochrome c, further supports the involvement of a Bid-independent mechanism in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (36Sun X. Macfarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B. Green D. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Overexpression of XIAP had no apparent effect on caspase-8-mediated cleavage of caspase-3, but blocked caspase-3 activity and thereby apoptosis. These findings are in concert with the identification of DNA damage-induced signals that confer the release of cytochromec (22Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and, as a separate pathway through engagement of the Fas receptor, the activation of caspase-8 (29Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that Bid can be cleaved by caspase-3 (31Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-j. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar, 36Sun X. Macfarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B. Green D. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Thus, cleavage of Bid observed in ara-C-treated U-937, but not U-937/XIAP, cells at 4 h may be mediated by a caspase-3-dependent, caspase-8-independent mechanism. Our findings are in concert with previous results demonstrating that DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mediated by a p35-sensitive, CrmA-insensitive mechanism (6Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Weichselbaum R.R. Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1965-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whereas p35, like XIAP, functions as an inhibitor of caspase-3, CrmA blocks caspase-8 activity (37Zhou Q. Snipar S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In this context, the finding that overexpression of CrmA in U-937 cells has no effect on cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-3, or induction of apoptosis (6Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supports a caspase-8-independent pathway that involves recognition of DNA lesions and transduction of signals to mitochondria (Fig.7). Although the precise signals of the caspase-8-independent pathway are unclear, previous work has demonstrated that DNA damage activates JNK/SAPK (38Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y.

Bacterial growth at 37 °C and the chelation of calcium from the culture medium artificially activate the Yersinia type III pathway, leading to the massive secretion of 14 proteins (YopBDEHMNOPQRT, LcrV (lowcalcium response), and YscM1/YscM2 (LcrQ)) into the surrounding medium (yop) (23Michiels T.

Immun. 1999; 67: 5395-5408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). lcrV mutant yersiniae have been reported to be defective in the type III secretion of YopB and YopD (30Sarker M.R. Neyt C. Stainier I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cornelis (39Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism whereby the formation of an LcrV·YopB·YopD complex allows type III export and assembly of an injectisome on the bacterial surface. The Yersiniainjectisome, presumably composed of many proteins in addition to LcrV·YopB·YopD, is thought to insert into the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, thereby catalyzing the translocation of effector Yop proteins (39Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the Yersiniainjectisome has not yet been purified or viewed by microscopy. We have examined the subcellular location of LcrV during Yersinia enterocolitica infection of HeLa cell cultures using the digitonin fractionation technique (8Lee V.T. Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When incubated in tissue culture medium with or without HeLa cells, yersiniae secrete YopBDR and LcrV into the extracellular medium even in the presence of 1.8 mmcalcium. During infection of HeLa cultures, lcrV mutant yersiniae secrete YopBDR into the extracellular medium, but fail to inject YopEHMN. This defect is complemented by plasmid-encoded wild-type lcrV and, at least in part, by GST2-lcrV, specifying a hybrid protein that cannot be exported by the type III pathway. GST-LcrV copurifies with LcrG, but not with YopB or YopD. Expression of GST-LcrV in lcrV mutant yersiniae causes the same Los (loss of type III targeting specificity) phenotype as knockout mutations oflcrG, resulting in premature activation of the type III targeting pathway and in secretion of all Yop proteins into the extracellular medium. Thus, intrabacterial LcrV is essential for the type III targeting pathway, whereas secreted LcrV appears to ensure the fidelity of the Yop protein injection process.

The PCR products were cut withSacI-EcoRI or EcoRI-PstI, fused at the EcoRI site, and cloned between theSacI-PstI sites of pLC28. To generate pVL49, thelcrV open reading frame was PCR-amplified with two primers carrying abutted NdeI and BamHI restriction sites: LcrV.5 (5′-AACATATGATTAGAGCCTACGAACAA-3′) and LcrV.6 (5′-AAGGATCCTCATTTACCAGACGTGTCATC-3′). The PCR product was digested with NdeI-BamHI and cloned between theNdeI and BamHI sites of the low-copy-number plasmid pVL41 (9Lee V.T. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1619-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to generate pVL49. pVL47 was generated by PCR amplification using primers LcrV.6 and LcrV.7 (5′-AAGGTACCATTAGAGCCTACGAACAAAACC-3′). lcrV sequences were cut with KpnI-BamHI and cloned into pDA255 (44Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Expression of LcrV and GST-LcrV is under the control of thetac promoter. The lacI Q allele is also cloned on the low-copy-number vector, and Y. enterocoliticatransformants were induced for expression of LcrV and GST-LcrV by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. To raise LcrV-specific antibody, the N-terminal domain of LcrV was appended to an affinity tag and purified. lcrV coding sequence was PCR-amplified with primers that carry abutted BamHI sites (LcrV.8, 5′-AAGGATCCATGGCTTACGACCTTTCTGAG-3′; and LcrV.9, 5′-AAGGATCCAATTTTTAATTCGGCGGTAAGC-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and cloned into pQE30 (QIAGEN Inc.), thereby generating pVL1067. Yersiniae were grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 5 mm calcium chloride or 5 mm EGTA. Overnight cultures of Yersinia were diluted 1:50 into 30 ml of fresh medium, grown for 2 h at 26 °C, and induced at 37 °C for 3 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was separated from the cell pellet. Proteins in both fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and suspended in sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoreactive species were quantified as chemiluminescent signals on x-ray film using laser densitometry scanning. Overnight cultures of Yersinia were diluted 1:20 into 30 ml of fresh Luria broth and grown for 2 h at 26 °C with shaking. Bacteria were sedimented at 8000 × g for 10 min and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluency in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to infection, cells were washed twice with PBS, covered with 10 ml of DMEM, and warmed to 37 °C for 30 min. Aliquots of HeLa cells were counted, and each flask was infected with yersiniae at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The culture medium was removed and centrifuged at 32,000 ×g for 15 min to separate soluble proteins from non-adherent bacteria in the sediment. HeLa cells as well as adherent bacteria were scraped off the flasks into 10 ml of digitonin in PBS and placed on a rotary shaker for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged at 32,500 ×g for 15 min. A 7-ml aliquot was withdrawn and precipitated with chloroform/methanol, whereas the remaining supernatant was discarded. The sediment was suspended in 10 ml of PBS, and a 7-ml aliquot was precipitated with chloroform/methanol. Protein precipitates were solubilized in sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antiserum. Immunoreactive species were quantified as chemiluminescent signals on x-ray film using laser densitometry scanning. Escherichia coliXL1-Blue/pVL1067 cells (1 liter) were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min and suspended in 20 ml of buffer A (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The sample was incubated with intermittent vortexing on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 32,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose that had been pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A, 10 ml of buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 20 ml of buffer C (same as buffer B, but pH 6.3). LcrV-His6 was eluted with 4 ml of buffer D (same as buffer B, but pH 4.5). Samples were aliquoted and stored frozen at −80 °C. Purified LcrV was emulsified with Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits to raise polyclonal antibodies. Antiserum reactivity and specificity were examined by comparing bacterial extracts of wild-type and mutant lcrV strains with the purified antigen. Overnight cultures of Y. enterocolitica CT1/pVL47 were diluted 1:50 into fresh tryptic soy broth supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Bacteria were grown and induced by incubation for 2 h at 26 °C and for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells from 500 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 20 ml of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20% sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0), and bacteria were broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 32,500 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant, containing soluble cytoplasmic extract, was subjected to affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. The column was washed with 30 column volumes of column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and proteins were eluted with 4 ml of column buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. Eluted proteins were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer containing 3 m urea and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate for 48 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with DMEM prior to infection with Y. enterocolitica strains W22703/pDA37 (wild type, expressing plasmid-encoded Npt (neomycinphosphotransferase)), CT1/pDA37 (lcrV −, expressing plasmid-encoded Npt), CT1/pVL49 (expressing plasmid-encoded wild-type LcrV), and CT1/pVL47 (expressing plasmid-encoded GST-LcrV) for 3 h at an multiplicity of infection of 20. After infection, coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. All fixation was quenched by adding 0.1 m glycine for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Coverslips were then incubated with anti-YopE polyclonal antibodies for 45 min. After washings with PBS, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 45 min. Samples were washed and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu CCD camera. To determine the fate of LcrV during infection, HeLa cell cultures were infected with Y. enterocolitica W22703. The medium was decanted and centrifuged, separating non-adherent bacteria from the extracellular medium. HeLa cells and adherent yersiniae were extracted with digitonin, thereby disrupting the cholesterol-containing plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. The bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation and separated from the cytosol of HeLa cells. Proteins in all fractions were precipitated with chloroform/methanol and analyzed by immunoblotting (8Lee V.T. Anderson D.M. Schneewind O. Mol.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was not released and sedimented with the bacteria. The Yersinia type III machinery secreted YopBDR into the extracellular medium and targeted YopEH into the cytosol of HeLa cells. Small amounts of LcrV were found in the extracellular medium; however, the majority of LcrV sedimented with yersiniae after digitonin extraction of HeLa cells (Fig.1 A and TableI). LcrV was not detected in the supernatant of digitonin-extracted HeLa cells, suggesting that LcrV is not injected into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells.Figure 4Overexpression of LcrV and GST-LcrV in wild-type yersiniae causes an up-regulation of the type III pathway. Y. enterocolitica W22703 was transformed with pDA37 (vector control), pVL49 (LcrV), or pVL47 (GST-LcrV). HeLa cells were infected with yersiniae and subjected to digitonin (Dig) fractionation and immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

A, infection of HeLa cells with Y. enterocolitica W22703. HeLa cells were infected for 3 h. The tissue culture medium (Med) was decanted and centrifuged to separate secreted proteins (supernatant (S)) from those present within non-adherent bacteria (pellet (P)). HeLa cells and adherent yersiniae were extracted with digitonin (Dig), a detergent that solubilizes the eukaryotic plasma membrane, but not the bacterial envelope. Extracts were centrifuged to separate proteins solubilized from the HeLa cytoplasm (supernatant) from those that sedimented with the bacteria (pellet). Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with chloroform/methanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. p130Cas is located in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, whereas Npt is located in the cytoplasm of yersiniae. Y. enterocolitica W22703 injected YopE and YopH into HeLa cells, whereas YopBD and LcrV were secreted into the extracellular medium. B, Y. enterocolitica W22703 was incubated in tissue culture medium (DMEM with 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 1.8 mm calcium) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cultures were centrifuged to separate proteins secreted into the extracellular medium with the supernatant from those that sedimented into the bacterial pellet. Samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In the presence of 1.8 mmcalcium, yersiniae secreted YopBDR and LcrV into the extracellular medium, whereas YopEH and Npt were not secreted.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether YopBDR and LcrV are secreted prior to the attachment of yersiniae to eukaryotic cells, tissue culture medium (DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 1.8 mmcalcium) was inoculated with Y. enterocolitica W22703. After incubation for 3 h, cultures were centrifuged, and the supernatant and pellet fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immunoblotting. YopBDR and LcrV were found in the tissue culture medium, indicating that these proteins had been secreted even without bacterial attachment to HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B and Table I). YopE and YopH were not found in the tissue culture medium, but sedimented with the bacteria. This result is consistent with the notion that export of type III targeting substrates requires bacterial attachment to eukaryotic cells (11Rosqvist R. Magnusson K.-E. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As a control, Npt sedimented with the bacteria into the pellet fraction. A knockout mutation of lcrV was generated by introducing a stop codon and +1 frameshift mutation at position 11 of the lcrV open reading frame. To examine the role of LcrV in type III secretion, Y. enterocolitica strains W22703 (wild type) and CT1 (lcrV −) were grown at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 5 mm calcium. Cultures were centrifuged, and the supernatant and pellet fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.2). When induced by low calcium, wild-type yersiniae secreted YopBDE and LcrV into the extracellular medium. As a control, LcrG and LcrH, two bacterial chaperones, were found in the sediment of all cultures examined. The addition of calcium reduced the expression and type III secretion of YopBDE. In contrast, LcrV was found secreted equally in the presence and absence of calcium. The lcrV mutant strain CT1 expressed less LcrGH and YopBD than did wild-type yersiniae both in the presence and absence of calcium (Table II). Nevertheless, in the absence of calcium, YopBD were secreted at a level similar to that observed for the wild-type strain. Transformation ofY. enterocolitica CT1 with pVL49, encoding wild-typelcrV, not only restored LcrV expression and secretion, but also increased the expression of the lcrGVHyopBD operon (Table II). The data suggest that lcrV knockout mutations result in reduced expression of the lcrGVHyopBD operon without affecting YopBD secretion. These data are in disagreement with the previous report that LcrV may be required for the secretion of YopB and YopD (30Sarker M.R. Neyt C. Stainier I. Cornelis G.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2013096494,"Translationalregulation plays an important role in the control of gene expression. Changes in translation initiation rates are the most common translation-regulating mechanisms, resulting in alterations in mRNA loading of ribosomes. This differential mobilization of mRNAs onto polyribosomes was used in differential screening to directly identify cDNAs whose transcripts are translationally controlled during antigenic stimulation of primary human T lymphocytes. Ribosome-free and polysome-bound mRNAs were prepared from quiescent and activated T cells and used as templates to synthesize four cDNA pools. These in turn were used as probes to hybridize four identical replicas of a T cell library or, alternatively, four cDNA arrays. Translational activation was indicated by redistribution of the hybridization signals from the ribosome-free fraction in resting T cells to the polysome-associated fraction in activated T cells. Translational repression corresponded to the opposite hybridization pattern. Fifty-two cDNAs were identified as translationally controlled by screening 472 genes in a cDNA array; 12 additional ones were obtained by screening a cDNA library. Several of the transcripts corresponded to mRNAs previously reported to be translationally controlled, thus validating the method. For the majority, however, such regulation had not yet been described. Translational control was verified for representative examples by demonstrating the redistribution of the corresponding mRNAs on polysome gradients in response to T cell activation. Our strategy therefore provides an efficient tool to directly isolate or identify translationally controlled mRNAs in a variety of physiological situations. Moreover, differential screening using arrays enables simultaneous analysis of both transcriptional and translational regulation, further enhancing the power of gene expression analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2127599923,"Endoxylanases are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze the β-1,4-linked xylose backbone of xylans. They are predominantly found in two discrete sequence families known as glycoside hydrolase families 10 and 11. The Streptomyces lividans xylanase Xyl10A is a family 10 enzyme, the native structure of which has previously been determined by x-ray crystallography at a 2.6 Å resolution (Derewenda, U., Swenson, L., Green, R., Wei, Y., Morosoli, R., Shareck, F., Kluepfel, D., and Derewenda, Z. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 20811–20814). Here, we report the native structure of Xyl10A refined at a resolution of 1.2 Å, which reveals many features such as the rare occurrence of a discretely disordered disulfide bond between residues Cys-168 and Cys-201. In order to investigate substrate binding and specificity in glycoside hydrolase family 10, the covalent xylobiosyl enzyme and the covalent cellobiosyl enzyme intermediates of Xyl10A were trapped through the use of appropriate 2-fluoroglycosides. The α-linked intermediate with the nucleophile, Glu-236, is in a4 C 1 chair conformation as previously observed in the family 10 enzyme Cex from Cellulomonas fimi (Notenboom, V., Birsan, C., Warren, R.

The different interactions of Xyl10A with the xylobiosyl and cellobiosyl moieties, notably conformational changes in the –2 and –1 subsites, together with the observed kinetics on a range of aryl glycosides, shed new light on substrate specificity in glycoside hydrolase family 10.

Xylan, the major constituent of hemicellulose, is composed of a β-1,4-linked d-xylose backbone substituted at the 2′ and 3′ positions withl-arabinofuranose, d-glucuronic acid, and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, and it displays a varying degree of acetylation, depending on the source. Xylanases have as yet unrealized potential in the pulp and paper industries for prebleaching and bio-pulping applications. They also find application in the food industries, including such roles as reducing the viscosity of poultry feeds and the pretreatment of silage grasses. The majority of xylanases fall into families 10 and 11 of the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases (1Henrissat B. Biochem.

The S. lividans enzyme, SlXyl10A, is primarily a xylanase with little activity against glucose-based polymers. Its three-dimensional structure, at 2.6 Å, was the first family 10 enzyme structure to be reported (5Derewenda U. Swenson L. Green R. Wei Y. Morosoli R. Shareck F. Kluepfel D. Derewenda Z.S. J. Biol.

In this paper, we present its native structure refined at atomic (1.2 Å) resolution, together with the structure of both the trapped 2-fluoroxylobiosyl enzyme intermediate at 1.65 Å and the trapped cellobiosyl enzyme intermediate at 1.7 Å. Kinetic analysis of a series of aryl glycosides has also been performed, which reveal a preference for xylo-derived substrates. Comparison of Xyl10A with the family 10 C. fimi enzyme Cex, which displays a more liberal substrate tolerance, gives insight into substrate specificity in this family of glycoside hydrolases. Endo-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) attack the internal β-xylosidic glycosidic linkages of the xylan backbone. Xylan, the major constituent of hemicellulose, is composed of a β-1,4-linked d-xylose backbone substituted at the 2′ and 3′ positions withl-arabinofuranose, d-glucuronic acid, and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, and it displays a varying degree of acetylation, depending on the source. Xylanases have as yet unrealized potential in the pulp and paper industries for prebleaching and bio-pulping applications. They also find application in the food industries, including such roles as reducing the viscosity of poultry feeds and the pretreatment of silage grasses. The majority of xylanases fall into families 10 and 11 of the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases (1Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 2Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 3Henrissat B. Bairoch A.

All of these structures are of the intact catalytic core domains alone (glycoside hydrolases are frequently modular enzymes 12Gilkes N.R. Henrissat B. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A.J.

Fujimoto, personal communication. 1Z. Fujimoto, personal communication. Family 10 xylanases perform catalysis with net retention of configuration. The mechanism is a double displacement in which a covalent intermediate is formed and then hydrolyzed via oxocarbenium ion-like transition states, essentially as described by Koshland in 1953 (Ref. 13Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 14Davies G. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press, London1997: 119-209Google Scholar). The covalent intermediate for these reactions has been trapped (15Withers S.G. Street I.P. Bird P. Dolphin D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7530-7531Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional analyses of the trapped covalent enzyme intermediates of the family 10 enzyme Cex with both 2-fluoro-substituted and natural ligands represent a significant advance in our knowledge of the catalytic mechanism of retaining glycoside hydrolases (16White A.

One interesting feature of family 10 xylanases is that, in addition to their xylanolytic activity, they display a range of activities against glucose-derived substrates such as cellulose. The S. lividans enzyme, SlXyl10A, is primarily a xylanase with little activity against glucose-based polymers. Its three-dimensional structure, at 2.6 Å, was the first family 10 enzyme structure to be reported (5Derewenda U. Swenson L. Green R. Wei Y. Morosoli R. Shareck F. Kluepfel D. Derewenda Z.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20811-20814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we present its native structure refined at atomic (1.2 Å) resolution, together with the structure of both the trapped 2-fluoroxylobiosyl enzyme intermediate at 1.65 Å and the trapped cellobiosyl enzyme intermediate at 1.7 Å. Kinetic analysis of a series of aryl glycosides has also been performed, which reveal a preference for xylo-derived substrates. Comparison of Xyl10A with the family 10 C. fimi enzyme Cex, which displays a more liberal substrate tolerance, gives insight into substrate specificity in this family of glycoside hydrolases. We are grateful to Tony Warren and Annabelle Varrot for supplying S. J. C. with Cex and to Prof. Harry Gilbert for useful discussions."

The role of the terminase small subunit is to specifically recognize the packaging initiation site (cos orpac) and to form a nucleoprotein structure that helps to position the terminase large subunit to cleave at the pac orcos site (1Casjens S.

Morita M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two general principles for packaging of concatemeric DNA into a virus head have been proposed. The first implies a site-specific packaging that shows some constraint in DNA size, in which the recognition sequence (termed cos in phage λ) plays an important role in initiation and termination of packaging. This packaging process is well-characterized in coliphages λ, T3, and T7 (1Casjens S. Casjens S. Virus Structure and Assembly. Jones and Bartlett, Portola Valley, CA1985: 75-147Google Scholar, 2Feiss M. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Black L.W. Annu. Rev.

The second principle implies headful packaging, in which the packaging initiates at a specific site (termed pac in phage SPP1) but with the capacity of the prohead playing a predominant role in the termination step. Within the poorly characterized headful packaging mechanism, phages P1, P22, T4, and SPP1 are included (1Casjens S. Casjens S. Virus Structure and Assembly.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The terminase enzyme of Bacillus subtilis phages SPP1 and SF6 is composed of a small (G1P) and a large (G2P) subunit (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The terminase initiates unidirectional DNA packaging from a concatemeric DNA substrate by binding topac DNA, introducing a 1-bp staggered cut, within the 83-bppacC subsite, and encapsidating the DNA from the cleaved end into an empty prohead until no more DNA can be inserted (headful) (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Deichelbohrer I. Messer W. Trautner T.A. J.

DNA packaging terminates when the DNA inside the prohead is separated from the concatemer by a cutting process (headful cut). The headful cleavage generates a new end that serves as the starting point for the second round of DNA packaging. The pacC cut is precise, and the headful cut is imprecise and could be spread over a 2.5-kb region of DNA (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol.

SPP1 and SF6 wt G1P are 184 and 151 residues long, respectively, and share 71% identity clustered in three discrete regions (domains I, II, and III) (14Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C.

Within domain I lies the B-type nucleotide-binding motif, the DNA-binding motif, and a G1P:G2P interacting region, and within domain II lies the A-type putative phosphate-binding loop (AXXXXGK(L/A)), the G1P:G1P interacting domain, and a G1P:G2P interacting region (11Chai S.

No apparent biological role can be assigned to domain III and the extended SPP1 G1P C-terminal region (see Refs. 14Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C.

The SPP1 and SF6 G1P (native molecular masses of ∼200 and ∼170 kDa, respectively) consist of a specific ring containing 10 monomers of G1P (11Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol.

A comparable ring-like structure was also observed in the terminase small subunit, gp16, of phage T4 (17Lin H. Simon M. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). G1P, which is an abundant protein, binds cooperatively to two discrete (pacL (non-encapsidated left DNA end) and pacR (the encapsidated right DNA end)) subsites and holds the two binding sites together in a DNA loop of about 20 turns of the DNA helix (11Chai S.

The SPP1 and SF6 G2P, which has a predicted molecular mass of 48,840 kDa and is a long product of 422 residues, contains a putative B-type nucleotide-binding motif preceded by hydrophobic amino acids between residues 106 and 114. An A-type NTP-binding loop (see Ref. 18Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar), however, was not found in the G2P protein (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol.

The presence of a histidine-rich metal-binding motif, identified in the terminase large subunit of phages λ, T3, T7, and T4, and a leucine zipper region are not obvious from the primary sequence of SPP1 and SF6 G2P (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that a plasmid-borne SPP1 H6-G2P fully complements the growth defect of different SPP1 conditional lethal mutants in gene 2 (15Gual A. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1998; 242: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results presented here provide the first evidence that the SPP1 terminase large subunit, in a DNA structure-dependent manner, introduces double strand nicks within both target sites within pacC. The available information suggested that the roles of G1P in the holoenzyme is to promote initiation of headful packaging by forming a nucleoprotein structure (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol.

Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) was described previously (19Studier F.W. J. Mol.

Plasmids pCB236, pCB220, and pCB231, containing G1PΔN62, G1PN64-C141, and G1PΔC55, respectively, were constructed by fusing the indicated DNA sequence of G1P to the last His codon of the His-Tag pQE vector. Ultrapure acrylamide was purchased from Serva; molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad; rifampicin was from BioChemika; DTE and proteinase K were from Sigma; trizma base was from Biomedicals, Inc.; isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Calbiochem; and DNA restriction and modification enzymes, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, poly(dC), and poly[d(I-C)] were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All were used as recommended by the suppliers. All chemicals used were of reagent grade, and solutions were made in quartz-distilled H2O. [α-32P]rNTP, [α-32P]dNTP, or [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Covalently closed circular plasmid DNA was purified by using the SDS lysis method (21Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), followed by purification on a cesium chloride-EtBr gradient. Gel-purified DNA fragments were end-labeled by filling in the restriction site with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, and [α-32P]dATP. Analytical and preparative gel electrophoreses of plasmid DNAs and restriction fragments were carried out either in 0.8% (w/v) agarose/Tris-acetate-EDTA/EtBr horizontal slab gels or on 6% (w/v) urea/polyacrylamide/Tris-borate gels. The concentration of DNA was determined using molar extinction coefficients of 6500 m−1 × cm−1at 260 nm. DNA was expressed as moles of DNA molecules. SPP1 wt G1P and the truncated G1P products either lacking the first 62 residues (G1PΔ62 (formerly termed G1P*)) or the last 48 residues (G1PΔC136 (formerly termed Chi1)) were purified as described previously (14Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). B. subtilischromatin-associated protein Hbsu was purified as previous described (22Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). G1PΔN55, G1PN64-C141, and H6-G2P were purified from BL21(DE3) cells carrying plasmids pCB231, pCB220, and pCB191, respectively, after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). After a 30-min induction, rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 90 min after rifampicin addition, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C. For the purification procedure, the pellet was thawed, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTE, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl, and lysed with a French press. The crude extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for a posterior purification using a Hitrap nickel-cheating column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The molar extinction coefficient for the different proteins was calculated as described by Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance, using the corresponding molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Spectra were recorded on a 4054 UV-visible spectrophotometer LKB Biochrom Ultrospec Plus. The wt G1P, G1PΔ62, and G1PΔC136 concentrations are expressed as moles of protein decamers, whereas the H6-G1PΔN55, H6-G1PN64-C141, and H6-G2P concentrations are expressed as moles of protein monomers. The native molecular mass of G2P was determined by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chromatography was carried out in buffer C (50 nmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, and the A 280 was measured. G2P (200 μg) was applied onto the column. A standard curve of K av versuslog10 of relative mobility was determined as recommended by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein standards were obtained from the manufacturer (ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; and catalase, 232 kDa). For protein cross-linking, the pure proteins were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.04% glutaraldehyde at room temperature in buffer D (60 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 30 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 mm DTE), containing either 25 or 100 mm NaCl. Aliquots were collected at different times, and the reactions were stopped by precipitating the proteins with 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, followed by two washing steps with acetone. The pellets were dissolved in loading buffer and loaded in a 7–15% SDS-PAGE. The DNA fragment used to analyze the binding of H6-G2P to DNA through EMSA was the SPP1 242-bp [α32P]XhoII-HinfI (containing part of pacL, pacC, andpacR sites, coordinates 157–399) from plasmid pCB363. The end-labeled DNA (1 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of H6-G2P in buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTE, 5% glycerol), containing 10 mm CaCl2 (in a 20-μl reaction) for 30 min at 37 °C. When indicated, increased concentrations of poly[d(I-C)] (nonspecific) or cold SPP1 242-bpXhoII-HinfI DNA fragment (specific) were added as competitor DNA. The reaction was stopped (by the addition of 3 μl of loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, glycerol 30%, bromphenol blue 0.25%, xylene cyanol 0.25%), immediately loaded onto a 1× TAE, and separated in a 4% non-denaturing PAGE. Gels were run for 3 h at 150 V and room temperature and dried prior to autoradiography. Supercoiled pBT363 DNA containing the SPP1 pac site (10 nm) was incubated with H6-G2P (20 nm) in buffer B containing 10 mm MgCl2, at 37 °C for a variable time. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of loading buffer containing 0.4 m EDTA, and the resultant products were then separated in 0.8% agarose gel. The SPP1 242-bp XhoII-HinfI DNA fragment obtained as a 320-bp EcoRI-PstI DNA segment from plasmid pBT363 or the SF6 233-bp EarI-HinfI (coordinates 223–456) obtained as a 311-bp EcoRI-PstI DNA segment were end-labeled at the top strand. The radiolabeled DNA (1 nm) was preincubated with Dis (1 or 100 μm) in buffer B, containing 10 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at 37 °C, and then incubated with H6-G2P (5–40 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C. the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of loading buffer, containing 0.4 mEDTA, and the resultant products were separated in 6% denaturing PAGE. Autoradiographs of the dried gel were subsequently taken. The SPP1 399-bp HpaII-HinfI DNA fragment from plasmid pCB53 was end-labeled at the bottom strand. The radiolabeled DNA (1 nm) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of Dis (1–100 μm) in buffer B, containing 10 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at 37 °C, and then incubated with G2P (20 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of loading buffer containing 0.4 m EDTA, and the resultant products were separated on a 6% non-denaturing PAGE. Autoradiographs of the dried gel were subsequently taken. The ATPase standard reactions were incubated in buffer B containing 10 mmMgCl2 in a final volume of 20 μl. The reactions were initiated by addition of the substrate after a preincubation of 5 min at 37 °C and allowed to proceed for 15 min more at the same temperature. ATPase activity was determined by measuring the amount of phosphate set free upon hydrolysis as described previously (24Ayora S. Rojo F. Ogasawara N. Nakai S. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies were performed using 20 nmH6-G2P and an ATP concentration range of 0.5 μm to 10 mm (10–0.05 μCi/nmol). The initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis was determined within the linear range of each reaction, and the kinetic constants were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the experimental data using the KaleidaGraph version 3.0.2 software program (Abelbeck). dNTP or rNTP hydrolysis reactions (30 μl) were performed in buffer B, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 400 μmdNTP (with 2 nm [α-32P]dNTP) or rNTP (with 2 nm [α-32P]rNTP), 150 μmpoly(dC), and 20 nm of H6-G2P, for 15 min at 37 °C. Products were separated by chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose as described by Scott et al. (25Scott J.F. Eisenberg S. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the formation of [α-32P]dNDP or [α-32P]rNDP was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by using the Molecular Imager and Molecular Analyst software package version 2.1 (Bio-Rad). SPP1 20-kDa wt G1P (predicted molecular mass 20.7 kDa), G1P variants with deletions at its N-terminal (13-kDa G1PΔN62) or C-terminal moiety (15-kDa G1PΔC136) (14Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or isolated G1P domains (7-kDa H6-G1PΔC55 and 9-kDa H6-G1PN64-C141) (15Gual A. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1998; 242: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the 49-kDa H6-G2P (predicted molecular mass 49.7 (H6, 0.9 + G2P, 48.8) kDa) were purified from the E. coliBL21(DE3) strain bearing a plasmid-borne SPP1 gene 1, gene 1ΔC136, His-tagged domain I or domain II of gene 1, or His-tagged gene 2 as described previously (14Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Gual A. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1998; 242: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purified polypeptides (G1P, G1PΔC136, G1PΔN62, H6-G1PΔC55, H6-G1PN64-C141, and H6-G2P) were more than 99% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). N-terminal protein sequence analysis of the first 10 N-terminal residues of the purified proteins were in full agreement with the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequences. Previously, it has been shown that G1P and G1PΔC136 specifically bind dsDNA and are not able to hydrolyze ATP (11Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Gual A. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1998; 242: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). G1PΔN62, H6-G1PΔC55, and H6-G1PN64-C141 do not bind DNA or hydrolyze ATP (14, 15, data not shown). The abilities of H6-G2P to act as dsDNA nuclease (exo- or endonuclease), ATPase in the presence or absence of ssDNA or dsDNA, and DNA helicase and to bind to dsDNA or ssDNA were assayed. As shown below H6-G2P possesses an endonuclease and a modest ATPase and is able to bind dsDNA. All these activities co-purified in a Ni-agarose column with H6-G2P and exhibited the same kinetics of heat inactivation (data not shown). Furthermore, such activities were not observed when the same protocol and a Ni-agarose column was used to purify proteins from BL21(DE3) plasmid-free strain (data not shown). EMSA had indicated that the highly purified H6-G2P interacts with a linear intrinsically curved 320-bp DNA (1 nm) fragment (containing the SPP1 242-bpXhoII-HinfI (part of pacL,pacC, and pacR sites) from plasmid pCB363), provided that a divalent cation (e.g. Mg2+, Ca2+) is present in the reaction mixture. In the presence of Mg2+, the DNA substrate is hydrolyzed (see below), thus we performed the experiment in buffer containing 10 mmCaCl2. The protein·DNA complex was separated in a 4% non-denaturing PAGE. The 320-bp DNA segment, which migrates as a 520-bp fragment, is intrinsically curved (11Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two discrete H6-G2P·DNA complexes (CI and CII) were seen on addition of 20 and 40 nm (in monomers) of H6-G2P (Fig.1, lanes 5 and 4). A slowly migrating form (CIII) and material that did not enter in the gel was observed in the presence of 80 and 160 nm of H6-G2P (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 2). TheK app of the H6-G2P·DNA complex was estimated to be ∼35 nm at pH 7.8 and 37 °C. When the H6-G2P was present in limiting amounts (35 nm), the addition of 5-fold excess of a nonspecific poly[d(I-C)] DNA fully competed for the formation of H6-G2P·pac DNA complex (data not shown). Furthermore, when non-curved DNA was used the H6-G2P·DNA complex did not enter in the gel (data not shown). It is likely, therefore, that H6-G2P binds curved dsDNA with low sequence specificity. The supercoiled (form I) pBT363-borne pacsite, containing a small amount (<10%) of relaxed circular DNA (form II), was incubated with a fixed amount of H6-G2P for varying times (Fig. 2). The resulting products were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel (Fig. 2). At early times of incubation (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4) ∼20% of form I DNA was converted to form II DNA, with a small fraction as form III DNA. The H6-G2P nicking of both DNA strands was uncoupled. At later times the reaction seemed to be saturated (Fig. 2, lanes 6–12), because no further conversion of form I DNA into form II, then into form III, was observed. A fine mapping ofpac-containing form II DNA revealed that H6-G2P introduced many discrete endonucleolytic nicks (data not shown). Under these experimental conditions, we were not able to identify a specific cut at pacC. Similar results were obtained when the pUC18 DNA control was used (data not shown). A time courses for cleavage using various concentrations of H6-G2P (80–240 nm) at a constant concentration of pBT363 DNA revealed that, at high enzyme/DNA ratios, the data are biphasic and yield a fast and slow phase of the reaction. A reduction in the enzyme concentration not only resulted in the complete disappearance of the fast rate but also substantially limited the extent of nicking (cleaving) of pBT363 DNA (data not shown). These data suggested that the reaction did not have a catalytic turnover. No H6-G2P nuclease activity was seen in the absence of Mg2+ or in the presence of a 2-fold excess of EDTA with respect to the metal ion. Varying the MgCl2 concentration from 0.5 to 20 mm revealed a similar pattern of cleavage by H6-G2P. Increasing concentrations of Mg2+correlated with an increasing endonucleolytic activity of H6-G2P with an optimum at ∼10 mm. Mn2+ partially replaced Mg2+ (an optimal concentration gave ∼50% of the activity observed with Mg2+), but when Ca2+ or Zn2+ was used no H6-G2P endonuclease activity was observed. The presence of a nucleotide cofactor (0.1–1 mm ATP), which exerts a negative effect in H6-G2P endonuclease activity, did not increase the cleavage specificity of H6-G2P (data not shown). The endonuclease activity exhibited a relatively narrow pH optimum, which was maximal at pH 7.8. The activity decreased rapidly below pH 7.0 and above pH 8.5. Increasing concentrations of NaCl correlated with an increasing endonucleolytic activity of H6-G2P until an optimum was reached at ∼50 mm, with a sharp decrease beyond 120 mm NaCl. The SPP1 pacC subsite contains two directly oriented Box b repeats (10-bp in length) (Fig.3). DNA encapsidation initiates upon terminase cleavage at the Box b site proximal to thepacR subsite (8, 9, Fig. 3 A). Hence, terminase has to discriminate between the two Box b sites at the 83-bppacC subsite and to introduce a 1-bp staggered cut within one of them (5′-CTATTGCG(G↓C-3′) (8–10, Fig. 3 B). On the basis of genome organization and sequence identity, we predict that the SF6 terminase upon recognition of pacL (non-encapsidated) and pacR (encapsidated end) directs the terminase large subunit toward pacC (Fig. 3). To initiate unidirectional encapsidation, terminase introduces a double strand cleavage within the 13-bp Box b site (5′-GCTATTGgGGG↓CAG-3′) proximal to pacR (9, see Fig. 3). Alternatively, terminase cleaves both Box b sites, but by an uncharacterized mechanism only, the cut at the Box b proximal atpacR is used as a substrate for in vivo DNA encapsidation. Previously, Chai et al. (8Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that the pac DNA end that is not the substrate for encapsidation is nucleolytically degraded, and such effect is independent of the major host-encoded nuclease (Exo V enzyme).

https://openalex.org/W2032188997,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) controls a genetic program known as 'invasive growth', which involves as critical steps cell adhesion, migration, and trespassing of basement membranes. We show here that in MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells, these steps are elicited by HGF/SF but not by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Neither factor substantially alters the production or activity of extracellular matrix proteases. HGF/SF, but not EGF, selectively promotes cell adhesion on laminins 1 and 5, fibronectin, and vitronectin through a PI3-K-dependent mechanism. Increased adhesion is followed by enhanced invasiveness through isolated matrix proteins as well as through reconstituted basement membranes. Inhibition assays using function-blocking antibodies show that this phenomenon is mediated by multiple integrins including beta1, beta3, beta4, and beta5. HGF/SF triggers clustering of all these integrins at actin-rich adhesive sites and lamellipodia but does not quantitatively modify their membrane expression. These data suggest that HGF/SF promotes cell adhesion and invasiveness by increasing the avidity of integrins for their specific ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2059002026,"In contrast to the extensive studies of light-induced conformational changes in rhodopsin, the cytoplasmic architecture of rhodopsin related to the G protein activation and the selective recognition of G protein subtype is still unclear. Here, we prepared a set of bovine rhodopsin mutants whose cytoplasmic loops were replaced by those of other ligand-binding receptors, and we compared their ability for G protein activation in order to obtain a clue to the roles of the second and third cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin. The mutants bearing the third loop of four other G<sub>o</sub>-coupled receptors belonging to the rhodopsin superfamily showed significant G<sub>o</sub> activation, indicating that the third loop of rhodopsin possibly has a putative site(s) related to the interaction of G protein and that it is simply exchangeable with those of other G<sub>o</sub>-coupled receptors. The mutants bearing the second loop of other receptors, however, had little ability for G protein activation, suggesting that the second loop of rhodopsin contains a specific region essential for rhodopsin to be a G protein-activating form. Systematic chimeric and point mutational studies indicate that three amino acids (Glu<sup>134</sup>, Val<sup>138</sup>, and Cys<sup>140</sup>) in the N-terminal region of the second loop of rhodopsin are crucial for efficient G protein activation. These results suggest that the second and third cytoplasmic loops of bovine rhodopsin have distinct roles in G protein activation and subtype specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1977269501,"Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells remain pluripotent in vitro when grown in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF withdrawal results in progressive ES cell differentiation. Here we show that during this differentiation process, part of the cells undergo apoptosis concomitant with an activation of the p38 MAP kinase. To gain insight into events mediated by LIF in ES cells, the expression of potential candidate genes was analyzed in the absence or presence of this cytokine by using a semiquantitative RT-PCR assay. We focused on early response genes and on a new type of cytokine repressors (the Socs proteins), some of which exhibit anti-apoptotic properties. We found that expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB was induced upon LIF treatment whereas that of JunD, the tyrosine phosphatase ESP, and the components of the LIF receptor remained unaffected. Expression of Socs-3, but not Socs-1 or Socs-2, was stimulated in the presence of LIF. Finally, uncontrolled overexpression of Socs-1 and Socs-3 led to repression of LIF-dependent transcription and severely reduced cell viability, suggesting that the disturbance of a well balanced Socs protein content has adverse effects on cell survival."

Curnow A.W. Söll D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are part of a highly organized translation system (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The number of synthetases in this fragile complex varies in different laboratories, but a stable core of nine of these enzymes plus three non-synthetase proteins can be isolated reproducibly (5Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog.

Evidence has accumulated that the multienzyme synthetase complex reflects associations among these proteins that pre-exist in vivo(8Filonenko V.V. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, several studies suggested that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases might also be present in nuclei. Thus, in early work, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities could be detected in crude nuclear fractions (11Amar-Costesec A. Turu C. Biol. Cell. 1989; 65: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 12Hampel A. Enger M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, it could be argued that these activities were due to cytoplasmic adherence to the outer nuclear surface. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, as well as elongation factor 1 (EF1),1 also could be detected in nuclei by immunochemical methods (13Mirande M. LeCorre D. Waller J.-P. Eur. J.

However, these studies provided no information as to whether the nuclear-localized synthetases were active. Nuclear localization was also suggested by the identification of possible nuclear localization signals in yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (17Schimmel P. Wang C.-C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 127-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have attracted considerable interest because of their potential involvement in nuclear to cytoplasmic transport of tRNA. Exclusion of defective tRNA from the cytoplasm was shown to be due to nuclear proofreading, and it was proposed that aminoacylation of tRNA serves as this proofreading step (18Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Sarkar S. Azad A.K. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While there is still some discussion whether aminoacylation or binding to the nuclear export receptor, exportin-t, is actually responsible for proofreading, there is agreement that nuclear aminoacylation increases tRNA export efficiency (21Arts G.-J. Kuersten S. Romby P. Ehresmann B. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7430-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22Lipowsky G. Bischoff F.R. Tzaurralde E. Kutay U. Schäfer S. Gross H.J. Beier H. Görlich D. RNA ( N.Y. ). 1999; 5: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, it was of interest to carefully examine nuclei for the presence of active aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and to determine what percentage of total cellular synthetase activity might reside in the nucleus. The data reported here directly demonstrate that active aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are present in the nuclei of two different mammalian cell lines. Most importantly, we find that the nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are organized into a high molecular weight, multienzyme complex that is even more stable than the complex present in the cytoplasm. 3H-Labeled arginine, proline, leucine, glycine, histidine, valine, and 14C-labeled isoleucine, phenylalanine, lysine, and threonine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 3H-labeled aspartic acid, serine, and tryptophan were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CompleteTM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Rabbit kidney (LCC-RK1) cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CRL-1781) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit liver tRNA was prepared as described previously (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rabbit kidney cells were cultured as described previously (8Filonenko V.V. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17375-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were maintained as monolayers in α minimum essential medium containing ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in Nunc flasks at 37 °C in air containing 5% CO2 and were transferred every 2–3 days. Cells were harvested at 80–90% of confluence by incubation with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.53 mmEDTA. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in sucrose buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.32m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 tablet/50 ml of solution)) and counted in a hemacytometer. The cell suspension was immediately supplemented with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase assays. After harvesting and washing in PBS, the rabbit kidney cell pellet was quickly frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath and thawed in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm spermine, 130 mm KCl, 1% thiodiglycol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors). The cells in this buffer were incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional stirring. The crude lysate, prepared in this manner, was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant fraction was used for gel filtration. The cytoplasmic fraction of CHO cells was prepared in the same way except that the cells were thawed in the sucrose buffer. After harvesting, the frozen pellet of rabbit kidney cells was thawed in ice-cold Buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cells at a concentration of ∼2 × 107cells/ml were disrupted in a Dounce-type tissue homogenizer (Wheaton) using five strokes of the B pestle. The cell lysate was spun down for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the same procedure (resuspension, homogenization and centrifugation) was repeated with the pellet. The final crude nuclear pellet was suspended in sucrose buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. This suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.2 msucrose, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1 mmEDTA. Purified nuclei were collected by centrifugation through the sucrose solution using 2.2 m sucrose as a cushion (23Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10.6-4.10.10Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for isolation of CHO cell nuclei except that the cell pellet was thawed directly in sucrose buffer, and after five strokes with the Dounce homogenizer the procedure described in Ref. 23Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10.6-4.10.10Google Scholar was followed directly. Sucrose at 1.9 m was used for the cushion. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity assays were carried out at 37 °C in reaction mixtures containing: 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mg/ml rabbit liver tRNA, 0.1 mm3H- or 14C-labeled amino acid (∼20–100 cpm/pmol), and sufficient cell extract, nuclear extract, or column fraction to measure significant synthetase activity within the linear range. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.5% casamino acids (Difco). Aminoacyl-tRNA precipitates were collected and counted as described previously (4Bandyopadhyay A.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study we did not attempt to optimize the assay conditions for each amino acid in terms of pH, ionic strength, cation requirements, etc. Rather, the same assay conditions were used for measuring all of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities. After electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar, 25Flings S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in Tris-glycine buffer (0.375m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, 20% methanol). Blocking of the membrane was with a 5% solution of nonfat milk in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then treated with monoclonal antibody F7 directed against rabbit arginyl-tRNA synthetase (8Filonenko V.V. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17375-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in TBS buffer supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 (2 μg of antibody/10 ml of buffer) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Visualization of the protein bands followed the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using, as the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. To ensure that the purified nuclei were free of contamination, nuclei at each step of the purification procedure were stained with azure C and examined by light microscopy (26Miramatsu M. Smetana K. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1963; 23: 510-518Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic adherence was clearly visible in crude nuclei, but after purification, no cytoplasmic contamination was evident. Moreover, assay of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, confirmed that the purified nuclei were devoid of cytoplasm. Thus, CHO and rabbit kidney cell extracts contained approximately 600 and 300 units of lactate dehydrogenase activity/106 cells, respectively (1 unit = 1 μmol NADH formed per min). Lactate dehydrogenase activity in nuclei from each of these sources was below the level of detection (25 millinunits per 106 nuclei) or <0.01%. Purified nuclei were also assayed for the possibility of mitochondrial contamination. The amounts of citrate synthase and cytochromec oxidase in nuclei from each cell were again below the level of detection representing <0.2% of that present in detergent-treated cell extracts. Most importantly, mammalian cell cytoplasmic extracts are known to contain two forms of arginyl-tRNA synthetase, one present in the multienzyme complex and one free form (27Deutscher M.P. Ni R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6003-6006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As will be shown below, the low molecular weight form is absent from the nuclear preparations. These data all support the conclusion that the nuclear preparations used for these studies were free of contamination. Total cellular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, determined by assay of lysates prepared by Nonidet P-40 treatment, and total nuclear activity, determined in nuclear lysates, were compared for the two cell lines (Table I). Nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity clearly was present in both cells. However, in each case, it represented only a small percentage of the total cellular activity, amounting to about 2–3% for the CHO cells and less than 1% for the rabbit kidney cells.Table IActivities of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in nuclear fractions of CHO and rabbit kidney cellsSynthetaseAminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activityCHO cellsRabbit kidney cellsTotalNuclearAmount in nucleiTotalNuclearAmount in nucleiunits/10 9 cells or nuclei%units/10 9 cells or nuclei%Arginyl-1304.13.22001.30.67Isoleucyl-2603.51.32200.710.32Leucyl-1102.72.4Lysyl-2106.53.12601.70.67Prolyl-982.82.9Threonyl-840.330.401600.240.15Cells were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclei after isolation were resuspended in sucrose buffer and counted in a hemacytometer. Approximately 4 × 104 cells or 2 × 106 to 8 × 106 nuclei were assayed for aminoacyl-tRNA activities for 2 min. A unit of activity corresponds to the formation of 1 nmol of aminoacyl-tRNA/min at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab Cells were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclei after isolation were resuspended in sucrose buffer and counted in a hemacytometer. Approximately 4 × 104 cells or 2 × 106 to 8 × 106 nuclei were assayed for aminoacyl-tRNA activities for 2 min. A unit of activity corresponds to the formation of 1 nmol of aminoacyl-tRNA/min at 37 °C. There are several possible explanations for the higher percentage of nuclear activity in CHO cells compared with rabbit kidney cells. One reason may be the difference in growth rate of the two cells (10 h doubling time for CHO cells and 45 h for rabbit kidney cells). The higher growth rate for CHO cells would necessitate a greater flux of tRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm and consequently an increased requirement for nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Second, rabbit kidney cells are much more difficult to disrupt, and isolation of their nuclei also requires a greater period of time. This may result in increased nuclear breakage and/or leakage of nuclear synthetases during the isolation procedure. Nevertheless, these data show that active aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are present in mammalian nuclei, although at a relatively low level. Many cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are found in extracts as part of a multienzyme complex (4Bandyopadhyay A.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to ascertain whether the corresponding nuclear enzymes might also be part of a complex or whether complex formation is only a cytoplasmic phenomenon. For this purpose, the size distribution of 13 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were examined by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-400. Since very similar patterns were obtained for rabbit kidney and CHO cell extracts, only those relating to CHO cells will be presented here. Prior to chromatography, the nuclear fraction was concentrated so that the amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic synthetase activities loaded on the column would be more comparable. Assay conditions (amount of column fraction and time of assay) were also adjusted to ensure that the levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic activities would be similar. Treatment of the rabbit kidney nuclear extract with DNase I (1200 units/ml for 90 min) did not alter the elution profiles (data not shown). The size distribution of cytoplasmic synthetase activities is presented in Fig. 1, A and B. Of the 13 activities assayed, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for arginine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, and proline co-eluted as a high molecular weight peak with an apparent molecular mass of ∼106 Da (Fig. 1 A), in complete agreement with the known composition of the stable core of the multienzyme complex from CHO cells (13Mirande M. LeCorre D. Waller J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Arginyl-tRNA synthetase also had a second peak of activity in the low molecular weight region, as expected (27Deutscher M.P. Ni R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6003-6006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the seven other synthetase activities measured, all except valyl-tRNA synthetase eluted primarily as free proteins, although in some cases shoulders of higher molecular weight forms were also observed (Fig. 1 B). Valyl-tRNA synthetase is known to form a complex with EF-1H (29Negrutskii B.S. Shalak V.F. Kerjan P. El'skaya A.V. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4545-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) resulting in a higher molecular weight entity, but one that is clearly smaller than the multienzyme synthetase complex (Fig. 1 B). The elution profiles of the nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are presented in Fig. 1, C and D. Surprisingly, not only do the nuclear activities elute as high molecular weight proteins, but more of them do so. The synthetases that normally are found in the cytoplasmic multienzyme complex (Fig. 1 A), also co-elute in the nuclear fraction, strongly suggesting that they exist as a multienzyme complex in nuclei as well. Moreover, the enzymes that are predominantly found as free forms in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B) elute as much larger entities in the nuclear extract (Fig.1 D), with at least a portion of all of them eluting as part of the complex. As a consequence, the nuclear complex is considerably larger than its cytoplasmic counterpart (∼2.5 × 106compared with ∼1 × 106 Da). Additional evidence for the nuclear multienzyme complex comes from immunoprecipitation experiments. Using the monoclonal antibodies against glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (8Filonenko V.V. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17375-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were able to co-immunoprecipitate at least three other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (data not shown). These data support the conclusion that the nuclear aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are physically associated. Interestingly, the low molecular weight form of arginyl-tRNA synthetase, which is prevalent in the cytoplasmic extract (Fig.1 A), is not seen in the nuclear extract (Fig.1 C). Furthermore, Western immunoblot analysis of proteins from rabbit kidney nuclei failed to detect any low molecular weight arginyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig. 2). These data confirm the purity of the nuclear preparation and indicate that this form of arginyl-tRNA synthetase is exclusively a cytoplasmic component. It was postulated that the low molecular weight form of arginyl-tRNA synthetase provides arginyl-tRNA for the N-terminal arginylation of proteins targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (30Sivaram P. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that this process is located only in the cytoplasm. Multienzyme complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been isolated from a variety of higher eukaryotic cells (5Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the composition of these complexes often varies. A relatively stable complex of nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases plus three non-synthetase proteins can be isolated reproducibly, but smaller and larger complexes have also been isolated. This has led to some uncertainty as to whether the multienzyme complex only contains nine synthetases or whether that form of the complex simply represents a more stable core from which the more easily dissociable components have already been removed during preparation. Our findings that nuclei contain a larger, apparently more stable complex suggest that the different sizes of complex obtained from different sources and by different laboratories may, in fact, be due to stability during isolation. It is particularly noteworthy that in the nuclear system the tightly bound core synthetases are still exclusively found in the complex, whereas those usually found as free forms in the cytoplasm are found in the nucleus both in the large complex and in intermediate-sized entities. However, almost no free forms are seen. This argues strongly for partial breakdown of the nuclear complex leading to partial removal of the more easily dissociable synthetases. If this explanation is correct, it suggests that the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of the multienzyme complex may be assembled into a similar organized structure. This, of course, raises the interesting question of what might be the function of a nuclear multienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. The simplest explanation is that these enzymes always remain associated with each other in vivo, whether in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, to carry out their function of aminoacylation. Aminoacyl-tRNA is known to be channeled in vivo (3Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, EF1 is also present in the nucleus (15Barbarase E. Koppel D.E. Deutscher M.P. Smith C.L. Ainger K. Morgan F. Carson J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2781-2790PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M.C. Dijk J. Möller V. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and very recent work indicates that it also participates in nuclear to cytoplasmic transport of tRNA (32Grosshans H. Hurt E. Simas G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in this context, the aminoacylation of tRNA and its transfer to EF1 in the nucleus could be completely analogous to the process in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, the multienzyme complex may itself function as a high efficiency tRNA transport machine. In this case, newly synthesized aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases would enter the nucleus, either as free enzymes that assemble into a multienzyme complex or as a preformed complex. Synthetases would then associate with their cognate tRNAs, and multiple tRNAs and synthetases would be transported to the cytoplasm together, perhaps in cooperation with exportin-t (21Arts G.-J.

One advantage of such a model would be to maintain a cytoplasmic ratio of tRNA to cognate synthetase of 1:1 and would result in partial assembly of the cytoplasmic translation apparatus already in the nucleus. If this model were correct, the channeling of tRNA, known to occur in the cytoplasm, would need to be extended to nuclear processes as well. Current work clearly shows a role for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in nuclear to cytoplasmic transport of tRNA (18Lund E. Dahlberg J.E.

Whether this role is limited only to proofreading by aminoacylation or whether there might also be a role as an actual tRNA transporter remains to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2121336305,"To understand the molecular properties of matrilin-3, a newly discovered member of the novel extracellular matrix protein family, we cloned a MAT-3 cDNA from developing chicken sterna. Real time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction indicates that MAT-3 mRNA is mainly expressed in the proliferation zone of a growth plate. It is also expressed in the maturation zone, overlapping with that of the mature chondrocyte-abundant matrilin-1 mRNA. This suggests that matrilin-3 may self-assemble in the proliferation zone, in addition to its co-assembly with matrilin-1 during endochondral ossification. Transfection of a MAT-3 cDNA into COS-7 cells shows that MAT-3 predominantly forms a homotetramer but also a trimer and a dimer. Co-transfection of both MAT-3 and MAT-1 cDNAs results in three major matrilins as follows: (MAT-1)(3), (MAT-3)(4), and (MAT-1)(2)(MAT-3)(2). Thus matrilin-3 may assemble into both homotypic and heterotypic oligomers. Our analysis shows that the assembly of MAT-3 does not depend on the number of epidermal growth factor repeats within the molecule, but the presence of Cys(412) and Cys(414) within the coiled-coil domain, which form covalent disulfide linkage responsible for both homo-oligomerization of MAT-3 and hetero-oligomerization of MAT-3 and MAT-1. Our data suggest that the varying synthetic levels of matrilins in different zones of a growth plate may result in a change of matrilin oligomeric forms during endochondral ossification."
https://openalex.org/W2017873630,"Apoptosis plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. Dietary oxidants like peroxidized lipids could perturb cellular redox status and disrupt mucosal turnover. The objective of this study was to delineate the role of lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) -induced redox shifts in intestinal apoptosis using the human colonic CaCo-2 cell. We found that subtoxic concentrations of LOOH increased CaCo-2 cell apoptosis. This LOOH-induced apoptosis was associated with a significant decrease in the ratio of reduced glutathione-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), which preceded DNA fragmentation by 12 to 14 h, suggesting a temporal relationship between the two events. Oxidation of GSH with the thiol oxidant diamide caused significant decreases in cellular GSH and GSH/GSSG at 15 min that correlated with the activation of caspase 3 (60 min) and cleavage of PARP (120 min), confirming a temporal link between induction of cellular redox imbalance and initiation of apoptotic cell death. These kinetic studies further reveal that oxidant-mediated early redox change (within 1 h) was a primary inciting event of the apoptotic cascade. Once initiated, the recovery of redox balance did not prevent the progression of CaCo-2 cell apoptosis to its biological end point at 24 h. Collectively, the study shows that subtoxic levels of LOOH disrupt intestinal redox homeostasis, which contributes to apoptosis. These results provide insights into the mechanism of hydroperoxide-induced mucosal turnover that have important implications for understanding oxidant-mediated genesis of gut pathology.–Wang, T.-G., Gotoh, Y., Jennings, M.

https://openalex.org/W2076535984,"As in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans harbors three chitin synthases called CaChs1p, CaChs2p, and CaChs3p, which are structurally and functionally analogous to the S. cerevisiae ScChs2p, ScChs1p, and ScChs3p, respectively.

In healthy individuals, it remains in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and genitalia; however, it colonizes and invades various tissues and organs and causes systemic fungal infections in neutropenic individuals, such as AIDS patients and those undergoing cancer chemotherapy or immunomodulation therapy for organ transplantation. Polyenes and azoles are used to treat systemic Candida infections, but the adverse effects of polyenes and the emergence ofCandida strains resistant to azole compounds make the treatment of patients with systemic mycosis difficult (1Georgiev V.St. Infectious Disease in Immunocompromised Hosts.

CaChs1p and CaChs3p are required for septum formation and for a large part of the cell wall synthesis, respectively (11Bulawa C. Miller D. Henry L.K. Becker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Robbins P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the cachs3Δ null mutants retained the ability to develop hyphae in vitro (11Bulawa C. Miller D.

S. A. 1995; 92: 6216-6220Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cell wall chitin plays important roles in pathogenicity. Whereas neither CaCHS2 norCaCHS3 is essential for viability, the fact that a null mutation of CaCHS1 is impossible implies thatCaCHS1 is essential for the growth of C. albicans(14Mio T. Yabe T.

The inhibitor designated RO-09-3143 inhibited the septum formation and the growth of C. albicans cells. Further characterization of the compound, using the null mutant strains of the chitin synthase genes, showed that the inhibition of CaChs1p only arrested the cell growth, but the inhibition of CaChs1p and Chs2p was lethal in C. albicans.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified RO-09-3143 as a highly potent and specific inhibitor of C. albicans Chs1p. Although its effect on ScChs2p was remarkably weaker than its effect on CaChs1p, RO-09-3143 also inhibited the activity of S. cerevisiae Chs2p (a functional homolog of CaChs1p) but not the activity of ScChs1p that is a homolog of CaChs2p. This suggests that RO-09-3143 is interactive only with chitin synthases that belong to the family of S. cerevisiae Chs2p. In vivo, RO-09-3143 abrogated septum formation and arrested the growth of C. albicans cells. This result of RO-09-3143 suggests that septum formation is an essential process of cell division in C. albicans. In fact, RO-09-3143 reduced the fungal burden in kidneys and prolonged the survival of mice that had been systemically infected with a lethal dose of C. albicans. 2M. Sudoh, T. Yamazaki, M. Arisawa, and H. Yamada-Okabe, manuscript in preparation. Although the deletion of ScCHS2, which is functionally equivalent toCaCHS1 and thereby responsible for septum formation, is viable in S. cerevisiae, it also delays the cell growth and causes aberrant morphology in S. cerevisiae (8Silverman S.J. Sburlati A. Slater M.L. Cabib E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4735-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,10Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).On the other hand, RO-09-3143 caused cell death in thecachs2Δ null mutant but not in the cachs3Δnull mutant in C. albicans. This was a rather unexpected result because in S. cerevisiae a double disruption ofScCHS1 and ScCHS2 is still viable, and only the simultaneous inactivation of ScCHS2 and ScCHS3 is lethal (10Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of RO-09-3143 and nikkomycin Z to the wild-type C. albicans cells also led to cell death, although neither compound was a fungicidal agent for C. albicans when used alone. By using the S. cerevisiaechitin synthases, nikkomycin Z has been shown to be rather selective to ScChs1p and ScChs3p. The K i value of nikkomycin Z to ScShs2p is 4000 times greater than the K i value of nikkomycin Z to ScChs1p and 700 times greater than theK i value of nikkomycin Z to ScChs3p (24Gaughran J.P. Lai M.H. Kirsch D.R. Silverman S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5857-5860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also inC. albicans, we observed that CaChs2p was highly susceptible to nikkomycin Z. Although the enzyme assay for CaChs3p and the susceptibilities of CaChs3p to nikkomycin Z remain to be established, the above results strongly suggest that the lethality caused by the addition of RO-09-3143 and nikkomycin Z is also a result of the dual inhibition of CaChs1p and CaChs2p. In S. cerevisiae, RO-09-3143 also transiently reduced the number of viable cells of ECY36-3D (scchs1Δ/scchs3Δ mutant), but it failed to kill these cells. The failure of RO-09-3143 to cause cell death of ECY36-3D presumably may be because of the lower susceptibility of ScChs2p to RO-09-3143 and also to a limited water solubility of the compound.Although RO-09-3143 transiently reduced the number of viable cells of the C. albicans cachs3Δ null mutant, we considered that this would be the consequence of the highly clumpy feature of thecachs3Δ null mutant cells, and thereby, an artifact of the colony assay. Another possibility may be that the stability of RO-09-3143 influenced the killing kinetics of C. albicans cachs2Δ and cachs3Δ null mutants differently. In fact, in an animal model the initial step of the major RO-09-3143 metabolism was N-demethylation, which drastically reduced the potency as a CaChs1p inhibitor; the MIC50 value of the demethylated form of RO-09-3143 was about 1000 times greater than that of the intact RO-09-3143. However, this possibility is unlikely because doubling times in the YPD medium of thecachs2Δ and cachs3Δ null mutants were similar, and the half-life of RO-09-3143 in the C. albicansconditioned medium was longer than 5 h, which is sufficient to cover several cell cycles of these mutant cells. In fact, further addition of RO-09-3143 at 12 and 24 h after the first addition of RO-09-3143 did not cause cell death, and it only delayed recovery of the growth of the cachs3Δ null mutant cells.Whereas the dual inhibition of CaChs1p and CaChs2p appears to be lethal in C. albicans, the function of CaChs2p is still obscure despite the fact that its protein level is supposed to be much higher than that of the other two chitin synthases (13Munro C.A. Schofield D.A. Gooday G.W. Gow N.A.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, ScChs1p, the functional homolog of CaChs2p, is believed to repair the cell wall at the bud scar during and/or after bud separation (7Cabib E. Sburlati A. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1655-1672Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We and others (12Gow N.A.R. Robbins P.W. Lester J.W. Brown A.J. Fonzi W.A. Chapman T. Kinsman O.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, a decrease of the chitin contents in the hyphae of the cachs2Δ null mutants depended on the methods used to extract chitin from the cells (13Munro C.A. Schofield D.A. Gooday G.W. Gow N.A.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results of this study imply that CaChs2p has some unknown function that may in part be overcome by CaChs1p.

This suggests that RO-09-3143 is interactive only with chitin synthases that belong to the family of S. cerevisiae Chs2p. In vivo, RO-09-3143 abrogated septum formation and arrested the growth of C. albicans cells. This result of RO-09-3143 suggests that septum formation is an essential process of cell division in C. albicans. In fact, RO-09-3143 reduced the fungal burden in kidneys and prolonged the survival of mice that had been systemically infected with a lethal dose of C. albicans. 2M. Sudoh, T. Yamazaki, M. Arisawa, and H. Yamada-Okabe, manuscript in preparation. Although the deletion of ScCHS2, which is functionally equivalent toCaCHS1 and thereby responsible for septum formation, is viable in S. cerevisiae, it also delays the cell growth and causes aberrant morphology in S. cerevisiae (8Silverman S.J.

Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).On the other hand, RO-09-3143 caused cell death in thecachs2Δ null mutant but not in the cachs3Δnull mutant in C. albicans. This was a rather unexpected result because in S. cerevisiae a double disruption ofScCHS1 and ScCHS2 is still viable, and only the simultaneous inactivation of ScCHS2 and ScCHS3 is lethal (10Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of RO-09-3143 and nikkomycin Z to the wild-type C. albicans cells also led to cell death, although neither compound was a fungicidal agent for C. albicans when used alone. By using the S. cerevisiaechitin synthases, nikkomycin Z has been shown to be rather selective to ScChs1p and ScChs3p. The K i value of nikkomycin Z to ScShs2p is 4000 times greater than the K i value of nikkomycin Z to ScChs1p and 700 times greater than theK i value of nikkomycin Z to ScChs3p (24Gaughran J.P. Lai M.H. Kirsch D.R. Silverman S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5857-5860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also inC. albicans, we observed that CaChs2p was highly susceptible to nikkomycin Z. Although the enzyme assay for CaChs3p and the susceptibilities of CaChs3p to nikkomycin Z remain to be established, the above results strongly suggest that the lethality caused by the addition of RO-09-3143 and nikkomycin Z is also a result of the dual inhibition of CaChs1p and CaChs2p. In S. cerevisiae, RO-09-3143 also transiently reduced the number of viable cells of ECY36-3D (scchs1Δ/scchs3Δ mutant), but it failed to kill these cells. The failure of RO-09-3143 to cause cell death of ECY36-3D presumably may be because of the lower susceptibility of ScChs2p to RO-09-3143 and also to a limited water solubility of the compound.Although RO-09-3143 transiently reduced the number of viable cells of the C. albicans cachs3Δ null mutant, we considered that this would be the consequence of the highly clumpy feature of thecachs3Δ null mutant cells, and thereby, an artifact of the colony assay. Another possibility may be that the stability of RO-09-3143 influenced the killing kinetics of C. albicans cachs2Δ and cachs3Δ null mutants differently. In fact, in an animal model the initial step of the major RO-09-3143 metabolism was N-demethylation, which drastically reduced the potency as a CaChs1p inhibitor; the MIC50 value of the demethylated form of RO-09-3143 was about 1000 times greater than that of the intact RO-09-3143. However, this possibility is unlikely because doubling times in the YPD medium of thecachs2Δ and cachs3Δ null mutants were similar, and the half-life of RO-09-3143 in the C. albicansconditioned medium was longer than 5 h, which is sufficient to cover several cell cycles of these mutant cells. In fact, further addition of RO-09-3143 at 12 and 24 h after the first addition of RO-09-3143 did not cause cell death, and it only delayed recovery of the growth of the cachs3Δ null mutant cells.Whereas the dual inhibition of CaChs1p and CaChs2p appears to be lethal in C. albicans, the function of CaChs2p is still obscure despite the fact that its protein level is supposed to be much higher than that of the other two chitin synthases (13Munro C.A. Schofield D.A. Gooday G.W. Gow N.A.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, ScChs1p, the functional homolog of CaChs2p, is believed to repair the cell wall at the bud scar during and/or after bud separation (7Cabib E. Sburlati A. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. J.

Moreover, a decrease of the chitin contents in the hyphae of the cachs2Δ null mutants depended on the methods used to extract chitin from the cells (13Munro C.A. Schofield D.A. Gooday G.W. Gow N.A.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results of this study imply that CaChs2p has some unknown function that may in part be overcome by CaChs1p.

https://openalex.org/W4250042301,"Apoptosis plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. Dietary oxidants like peroxidized lipids could perturb cellular redox status and disrupt mucosal turnover. The objective of this study was to delineate the role of lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) -induced redox shifts in intestinal apoptosis using the human colonic CaCo-2 cell. We found that subtoxic concentrations of LOOH increased CaCo-2 cell apoptosis. This LOOH-induced apoptosis was associated with a significant decrease in the ratio of reduced glutathione-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), which preceded DNA fragmentation by 12 to 14 h, suggesting a temporal relationship between the two events. Oxidation of GSH with the thiol oxidant diamide caused significant decreases in cellular GSH and GSH/GSSG at 15 min that correlated with the activation of caspase 3 (60 min) and cleavage of PARP (120 min), confirming a temporal link between induction of cellular redox imbalance and initiation of apoptotic cell death. These kinetic studies further reveal that oxidant-mediated early redox change (within 1 h) was a primary inciting event of the apoptotic cascade. Once initiated, the recovery of redox balance did not prevent the progression of CaCo-2 cell apoptosis to its biological end point at 24 h. Collectively, the study shows that subtoxic levels of LOOH disrupt intestinal redox homeostasis, which contributes to apoptosis. These results provide insights into the mechanism of hydroperoxide-induced mucosal turnover that have important implications for understanding oxidant-mediated genesis of gut pathology."

A functional interaction between mechanical stimuli and locally produced vasoactive agents is suggested to be crucial for vascular remodeling. We examined the effect of mechanical stretch on fibronectin gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and the role of vascular angiotensin II in the regulation of the fibronectin gene in response to stretch. Cyclic stretch induced an increase in vascular fibronectin mRNA levels that was inhibited by actinomycin D and CV11974, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist; cycloheximide and PD123319, an angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist, did not affect the induction. In transfection experiments, fibronectin promoter activity was stimulated by stretch and inhibited by CV11974 but not by PD123319. DNA-protein binding experiments revealed that cyclic stretch enhanced nuclear binding to the AP-1 site, which was partially supershifted by antibody to c-Jun. Site-directed mutation of the AP-1 site significantly decreased the cyclic stretch-mediated activation of fibronectin promoter. Furthermore, antisense c-jun oligonucleotides decreased the stretch-induced stimulation of the fibronectin promoter activity and the mRNA expression. These results suggest that cyclic stretch stimulates vascular fibronectin gene expression mainly via the activation of AP-1 through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.

Fibronectin (FN)1 is an important component of the extracellular matrix and is implicated functionally in the regulation of several cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, transformation, and motility and wound healing. FN has been found to modulate the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and regulate VSMC growth (1Mercurius K.O. Morla A.O. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We previously found that angiotensin II (Ang II) enhances transcription of the FN gene through the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) in VSMCs, at least in part via activation of the rat FN promoter AP-1 binding motif (rFN/AP-1) (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M. Toya Y. Takasaki I. Takagi N. Ishii M. Oda K. Horiuchi M. Umemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26487-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although rFN/AP-1 may not be involved in the regulation of FN gene expression in cells other than VSMCs (3Bowlus C.L. McQuillan J.J. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1122-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Suzuki M. Kuroda C. Oda E. Tsunoda S. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this result proposes that rFN/AP-1 is functionally important for the regulation of vascular FN expression in response to various stimuli. Accumulated evidence suggests that hemodynamic forces (including stretch and shear stress) as well as endocrine factors (such as Ang II) are among the most important factors implicated in the physiology and pathophysiology of the vascular wallin vivo. Interactions between extracellular matrix proteins and cellular receptors can transduce signals that lead to changes in shape, motility, and growth of VSMCs. Thus, investigation of mechanical stress-mediated regulation of the extracellular matrix and the tissue renin-angiotensin system in VSMCs may be important for the elucidation of a molecular mechanism of vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis. With respect to vascular FN regulation, several in vivostudies have reported that hypertension activates the vascular renin-angiotensin system and induces expression of vascular FN (5Shiota N. Miyazaki M. Okunishi H. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Takasaki I. Chobanian A.V. Sarzani R. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21935-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, we have recently examined expression of the tissue renin-angiotensin system and FN genes in inbred Dahl Iwai salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats (7Tamura K. Chiba E. Yokoyama N. Sumida Y. Yabana M. Tamura N. Takasaki I. Takagi N. Ishii M. Horiuchi M. Umemura S. J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The expression of tissue angiotensinogen, AT1 receptor, and FN is regulated differently in DS and DR rats, and salt-mediated hypertension in DS rats stimulates the aortic FN gene, with activation of the tissue renin-angiotensin system in a tissue-specific manner. Although our previous studies and others suggest that Ang II in vitro and hypertension in vivo increase vascular FN expression, the molecular mechanisms of mechanical stress-mediated regulation of vascular FN is still unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of cyclic stretch on gene expression of extracellular matrix components (FN and collagen) and renin-angiotensin system components (angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and AT1 receptor in VSMCs. Cyclic stretch of VSMCs induced mRNA expression of FN, collagen, ACE, and AT1 receptor, and Ang II secreted in an autocrine/paracrine manner is involved in stretch-induced expression of FN. Furthermore, a specific promoter region, rFN/AP-1, may play an important role in the stretch-mediated increase in FN gene transcription. RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Ang II, actinomycin D (AMD), cycloheximide, and saralasin were purchased from Sigma. AT1 receptor-specific antagonist CV11974 and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2 receptor)-specific antagonist PD123319 were supplied by Takeda Chemical and Parke Davis, respectively. VSMCs were isolated and cultured as described previously (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M. Toya Y. Takasaki I. Takagi N. Ishii M. Oda K. Horiuchi M. Umemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26487-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the experiments, cells at approximately 80% confluence in dishes were made quiescent by incubation with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h, unless otherwise stated. Cells grown in 6-well silicone elastomer-bottomed culture plates (Flexcell Corp.) were subjected to cyclic mechanical stretch in a FX-3000 Flexercell Strain Unit with BioFlex Loading Stations (Flexcell Corp.). The strain unit, a modification of the device described by Banes et al. (8Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gilbert et al. (9Gilbert J.A. Weinhold P.S. Banes A.J. Link G.W. Jones G.L. J. Biomech. 1994; 27: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), consists of a computer-controlled vacuum unit and a base plate to hold the culture dishes on the Loading Stations. Vacuum is repetitively applied (1 Hz, 0.5 s on-time) at 60 cycles per min to the rubber-bottomed dishes via the base plate, which is placed in a standard CO2 tissue culture incubator. When vacuum is applied to a flexible culture dish with the Flexercell Strain Unit and Loading Stations, the bottom deforms across the post face, creating uniform radial and circumferential strain to the bottom of culture dish, principally as described previously (10Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This process allows cell culture in a uniform mechanically active environment so that all cells stretched over the loading station surface receive the same amount of strain. Previous studies showed that cyclic stretch of VSMCs with the Flexercell Strain Unit induced increases in DNA synthesis and total protein synthesis, thereby suggesting that this system is useful forin vitro analysis of the processes involved in vascular remodeling (11Sudhir K. Wilson E. Chatterjee K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Li Q. Muragaki Y. Hatamura I. Ueno H. Ooshima A. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine possible cellular injury due to mechanical stretch, viability of stretched VSMCs was constantly monitored by either the trypan blue dye exclusion test or assay of the mitochondrial reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan (Chemicon International Inc.) (13Green L.M. Reade J.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 70: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The attached cells showed a viability of 82 ± 7, 84 ± 7, and 87 ± 6% in the 30% stretched, 20% stretched, and nonstretched regimens (12 h), respectively. The viability of stretched VSMCs did not differ from that of nonstretched VSMCs throughout the experiments in this study. Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M. Toya Y. Takasaki I. Takagi N. Ishii M. Oda K. Horiuchi M. Umemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26487-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of each total RNA sample were denatured, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization proceeded in the solution containing denatured salmon sperm DNA and the32P-labeled probes. Membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film or to the imaging plate of a FUJIX BIO-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film). Probes used in this study were described previously (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M. Toya Y. Takasaki I. Takagi N. Ishii M. Oda K. Horiuchi M. Umemura S. J. Biol.

The conditioned medium was collected from culture dishes of VSMCs either nonstretched or stretched for 12 h at 20% elongation. Samples were applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). Peptides were eluted with 80% methanol, dried, and dissolved in Tris acetate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing 2.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Concentration of immunoreactive Ang II was determined by a specific direct radioimmunoassay with an antibody to Ang II as described previously (14Tamura K. Umemura S. Nyui N. Yamakawa T. Yamaguchi S.

Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides for the AP-1 element of the rat FN promoter (rFN/AP-1 element; 5′-TTCTCAGAGGTGACGCAATGTTCTCAA-3′, locates at positions −463 to −437 of the transcriptional start site and AP-1 binding motif is underlined), mutated rFN/AP-1 element (rFN/m[AP-1] element; 5′-TTCTCAGAGGTacgtCAATGTTCTCAA-3′, −463 to −437 and mutated nucleotides are shown in bold), mutated rFN/CRE element (rFN/m[CRE] element; 5′-CGTACCCCGTG ACGT CACCCGGACTCCG-3′, −169 to −142 and deleted nucleotides are shown in bold and italic), and mutated rFN/Sp1 element (rFN/m[Sp1] element; 5′-GCAGGAtttttttGGGGAGTCGGA-3′, −111 to −88, and mutated nucleotides are shown in bold) were also synthesized and purified. Plasmid rFN-CAT was constructed by insertion of a 2044-base pair PstI/PstI rat FN promoter fragment (−1908 to +136 relative to the major transcription start site) into the BglII/HindIII sites upstream of pUCSV0CAT as described previously (2Tamura K.

Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Once the mutations were obtained and confirmed by sequencing, the altered 2044-base pair (−1908 to +136) fragments were subcloned into the BglII/HindIII sites of pUCSV0CAT to construct rFN/m[AP-1]-CAT, rFN/m[Sp1]-CAT, and rFN/m[CRE]-CAT. Construction of TK-CAT, containing the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the CAT coding gene, was described previously (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M.

The FN promoter-CAT chimeric construct (5 μg) and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (1 μg), which is used to normalize transfection efficiency, were transiently co-transfected into VSMCs by the CaPO4 precipitation method as described previously (2Tamura K.

Media were replaced with fresh serum-free media 12 h after the transfection, and cells were incubated for 36 h. VSMCs were then pretreated with Ang II receptor antagonists or signaling inhibitors for 30 min, and cells were subjected to 9 h of cyclic stretch (20%). Aliquots of cell extracts containing equal amounts of total protein (60 μ g) were used for CAT assay. CAT assay was performed as described previously (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M.

The conversion ratios of [14C]chloramphenicol were measured with BAS2000. VSMCs were pretreated with Ang II receptor antagonists or signaling inhibitors for 30 min and subjected to 6 h of cyclic stretch (20%). Nuclear extracts from VSMCs were prepared with a modification of the protocol of Dignam et al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) and Swick et al. (19Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed essentially as described previously (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M. Toya Y.

For the supershift experiments, antibodies with epitopes specific to c-Jun, JunB, and conserved regions of the Fos family (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. The DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described previously (20Wilson E. Sudhir K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The FN promoter fragment from −746 to −414 relative to the transcriptional start site was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, followed by digestion with RsaI (−656) to generate a probe. We first examined whether cyclic stretch (20%) modulated gene expression of extracellular matrix and renin-angiotensin system components in VSMCs. VSMCs were plated on silicone elastomer-bottomed dishes coated with type I collagen, unless otherwise stated. Expression of FN and type I collagen started to increase 1 h after cyclic stretch, and peaked at 12 h (the maximum induction ratios were 4.2-fold for FN, 3.5-fold for type I collagen, and 1.8-fold for ACE); at 48 h these mRNA levels were still elevated compared with control levels (Fig.1). The levels of ACE mRNA also began to increase 1 h after cyclic stretch, peaked at 6 h, and remained higher than control levels at 48 h. The increase in AT1 receptor mRNA level was first detected 12 h after cyclic stretch, and the mRNA levels were still rising at 48 h. On the other hand, the angiotensinogen mRNA level did not show any significant change in stretched VSMCs, at least by Northern blot analysis. These results indicate that cyclic stretch of VSMCs increases extracellular matrix and renin-angiotensin system mRNA expression, although the responsible mechanism may differ between them. Next, VSMCs were incubated with various degrees of cyclic stretch. A significant increase in FN mRNA levels was observed at 5% cyclic stretch compared with control, and a %stretch-dependent increase in expression of FN mRNA by cyclic stretch was observed between 5 and 20% stretch (Fig.2 A). Maximum activation of FN mRNA was obtained by 20% cyclic stretch, and the levels of FN mRNA stimulated by 25 and 30% cyclic stretch were almost the same as that stimulated by 20% stretch. Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed by 20% cyclic stretch of VSMCs in serum-free medium.Figure 1Time-dependent effect of cyclic stretch on expression of extracellular matrix and renin-angiotensin system components mRNA.

Wilson E. Chatterjee K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Bardy N. Merval R. Benessiano J. Samuel J.L. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine a possible effect of extracellular matrix proteins on the induction of FN mRNA by cyclic stretch in VSMCs, we coated the silicone elastomeric bottom of dishes with type I collagen, elastin, FN, or laminin (Type I collagen was used as a control, as stated earlier). However, there were no significant differences in the degree of activation of FN mRNA expression induced by 20% cyclic stretch among these extracellular matrix proteins (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether de novo RNA or protein synthesis was required for a cyclic stretch-induced increase in FN mRNA, VSMCs were pretreated with AMD or cycloheximide for 30 min and stretched (20%) for 6 h. The RNA synthesis inhibitor AMD almost abolished the cyclic stretch-mediated increase in FN mRNA, whereas the induction of FN mRNA by cyclic stretch was not significantly altered by cycloheximide (Fig.3 A). None of these inhibitors alone had any influence on the expression of FN mRNA in control VSMCs. These results indicate that de novo mRNA transcription is required for the induction of FN mRNA expression by cyclic stretch, but that the effects of cyclic stretch do not require de novo protein synthesis to stimulate the expression of FN mRNA. A previous study using an organ culture model of the aorta showed that the effect of transmural pressure was mediated by stimulation of the vascular renin-angiotensin system (21Bardy N. Merval R. Benessiano J. Samuel J.L. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the results of the present study indicated that cyclic stretch of VSMCs up-regulated mRNA expression of the local renin-angiotensin system. Thus, to examine a possible involvement of autocrine/paracrine Ang II in the cyclic stretch-mediated increase in FN mRNA and, if so, to determine the type of Ang II receptor(s) involved in mediating the enhanced expression of FN mRNA in response to cyclic stretch, the effects of Ang II receptor antagonists were analyzed. VSMCs were incubated for 30 min with Ang II receptor antagonists and were subjected to 20% cyclic stretch for 6 h. Treatment of VSMCs with the AT1 receptor-specific antagonist CV11974 (10 μm) significantly decreased the stimulatory effect of cyclic stretch (Fig.3 B). In contrast, incubation of cells with the AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123319 (100 μm) did not affect the response to cyclic stretch at all. None of these Ang II receptor antagonists alone had any influence on the expression of FN mRNA in control VSMCs. It is possible that the lack of inhibition by PD123319 was due to an insufficient dose of the inhibitor. However, preincubation of VSMCs with increasing doses of PD123319 (100 and 500 μm) did not affect the response to cyclic stretch at all (data not shown). These results indicate that cyclic stretch activates FN mRNA expression, at least partly, through an AT1 receptor-dependent pathway in VSMCs. A previous study using the Flexercell strain system showed that concentration of immunoreactive Ang II in the conditioned medium was elevated by cyclic stretch of VSMCs (12Li Q. Muragaki Y. Hatamura I. Ueno H. Ooshima A. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and in the present study cyclic stretch of VSMCs caused increases in ACE and AT1 receptor mRNA expression. To determine whether the autocrine/paracrine-secreted Ang II actually contributes to the increase in FN mRNA expression in response to cyclic stretch, incubation medium obtained from VSMCs that were stretched for 12 h was transferred to VSMCs cultured on regular culture dishes. The addition of conditioned media for 12 h significantly enhanced FN mRNA levels in recipient VSMCs (Fig.4 A). Pretreatment of the VSMCs with the AT1/AT2 receptor antagonist saralasin or CV11974 completely blocked the increase induced by the addition of conditioned media, whereas pretreatment with PD123319 or BQ123, an endothelin-1 type A receptor antagonist, did not affect the increase in FN mRNA levels. Furthermore, the culture medium from stretched VSMCs showed a significant increase in immunoreactive Ang II compared with that from nonstretched control VSMCs (Fig. 4 B). Thus, Ang II secreted from stretched VSMCs is suggested to be the major molecule in conditioned medium that up-regulates FN mRNA levels. We examined whether cyclic stretch activates transcription directed by the FN promoter. We transfected a rat FN promoter (−1908 to +136 of the transcriptional start site)-CAT chimeric gene (rFN-CAT) into VSMCs and stimulated VSMCs with cyclic stretch (20%) for 6 h. Cyclic stretch increased CAT activity of rFN-CAT by 4.1-fold (Fig.5). We also examined what type of Ang II receptor(s) was involved in mediating the enhanced CAT activity through the FN promoter in response to cyclic stretch. Incubation of VSMCs with 10 μm saralasin or CV11974 significantly decreased the stimulatory effect of cyclic stretch, whereas incubation of cells with 100 μm PD123319 did not affect the response to cyclic stretch at all. Thus, the AT1 receptor appears to play a role in the cyclic stretch-mediated increase in FN promoter activity in VSMCs. The results of a DNA transfection study showed that cyclic stretch stimulated transcription directed by the FN promoter in VSMCs. Previous studies showed that the 5′-flanking region of the rat FN gene contained the motifs for transcription factors E4TF1, AP-1, AP-2, PEA2, Sp1, and CRE (24Ruiz-Ortega M. Egido J. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1497-1510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Among them, the AP-1-binding motif is known to be one of the targets of Ang II-mediated transcriptional activation (22Kato H. Suzuki H. Tajima S. Ogata Y. Tominaga T. Sato A. Saruta T. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that a rat FN promoter region from −473 to −447 of the transcriptional start site (rFN/AP-1), which contains an AP-1 binding motif, is involved in the Ang II-mediated transcriptional activation of the FN gene (2Tamura K. Nyui N. Tamura N. Fujita T. Kihara M. Toya Y. Takasaki I. Takagi N. Ishii M. Oda K. Horiuchi M. Umemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26487-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of cyclic stretch on binding of nuclear factors to this element, we first performed DNase I footprint analysis. VSMCs were subjected to cyclic stretch (20%) for 6 h. The results showed that a sequence from −458 to −439 in the rFN/AP-1 element was protected from digestion by DNase I (lanes 2 and 3, denoted by the hatched box, Fig.6 A). The pattern of DNase I footprinting disclosed increased protection upon 20% cyclic stretch I (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4 and 5). In footprinting competition assay, this protection was inhibited by the addition of nonlabeled rFN/AP-1 element to the reaction mixture (Fig. 6 A, lane 6). We next carried out EMSA using rFN/AP-1 as a probe. VSMCs were subjected to cyclic stretch (20%) for 6 h. Incubation of VSMC-nuclear extracts with the 32P-labeled rFN/AP-1 produced a single shifted band, and cyclic stretch significantly increased the intensity of this band (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1 and 2). In electrophoretic mobility shift competition assay, the shifted band was specifically competed out by the unlabeled rFN/AP-1 element, but not by the rFN/m[AP-1] element which contained substitution mutations interrupting the AP-1 binding motif (Fig.6 B, lanes 3–6).

The mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli as fusion proteins with the LE1413 hydrophobic polypeptide and purified from inclusion bodies; these steps were followed by CNBr cleavage and oxidative refolding. The mutants inhibited the blood-clotting proteinases with association constants in the range of 103–1010m−1. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein, factors Xa and XIIa, thrombin, and protein C could be improved by up to 2 orders of magnitude by the K15R substitution. The highest increase in the association constant for P3 mutant was measured for factor XIIa; P13S substitution increased the K a value 58-fold. Several other substitutions at P3 resulted in about 10-fold increase for factor Xa, thrombin, and protein C. The cumulative P3 and P1 effects onK a values for the strongest mutant compared with the wild type bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor were in the range of 2.2- (plasmin) to 4,000-fold (factors XIIa and Xa).

The specificity of a particular enzyme toward its cognate sequence results from well defined subsites on the enzyme surface recognizing not only the scissile peptide bond but often also more extended regions. These structural studies nicely explain earlier data on sequence-specific cleavage of natural substrates and provide a framework for drug design efforts. Because the coagulation/fibrinolysis processes are of vital importance, they are precisely controlled. Protein inhibitors are one of the most essential regulating factors. Interestingly, the scaffold of Kunitz-type inhibitors is used both to control the natural coagulation process in human blood and to prevent blood clotting in a blood-sucking organism, the soft tick. In the former case, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)1 composed of three tandemly arranged Kunitz-type domains inhibits different clotting proteinases (e.g. factor Xa at the second domain) through the canonical proteinase binding loop. On the contrary, the amino terminus of tick anticoagulant peptide, which also possesses a Kunitz-domain fold, is involved in non-canonical binding to the active site of factor Xa (7Wei A. Alexander R.S. Duke J. Ross H. Rosenfeld S.A. Chang C.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both TFPI and tick anticoagulant peptide were recognized as potential antithrombotic drugs (8Neeper M.P. Waxman L. Smith D.E. Schulman C.A. Sardana M. Ellis R.W. Schaffer L.W. Siegl P.K. Vlasuk G.P.

Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) is the best known example of Kunitz-type inhibitors. It consists of 58 amino acid residues cross-linked by three disulfide bridges that contribute to a compact tertiary structure and remarkable thermodynamic stability (10Moses E. Hinz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Makhatadze G.I. Kim K-S. Woodward C. Privalov P.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Wild type BPTI is a powerful competitive inhibitor of several serine proteinases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and tissue kallikrein (12Fritz H. Wunderer G. Arzneim. Forsch. 1983; 33: 479-494PubMed Google Scholar). BPTI is not a strong immunogen because specific antibodies have not been observed in humans (12Fritz H. Wunderer G. Arzneim. Forsch. 1983; 33: 479-494PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type protein has been used as an antifibrinolytic agent in cardiac surgery (13Hardy J.F. Desroches J. Can. J. Cardiol. 1992; 39: 353-365Google Scholar) and in acute pancreatitis (12Fritz H. Wunderer G. Arzneim. Forsch. 1983; 33: 479-494PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its low immunogenicity and well known mechanism of action, BPTI appears to be an ideal candidate for protein engineering studies with the aim of directing its specificity toward blocking unbalanced proteolysis. So far, several studies have shown that through semisynthetic (14Wenzel H.R. Tschesche H. von Goldammer E. Netzelmann U.

In all the mutants the wild type Lys-15 was replaced with Arg because of its more favorable binding to the studied enzymes. Although the inhibitor contacts different serine proteinases using about seven amino acid residues of the binding loop (26Huber R. Kukla D. Bode W. Schwager P. Bartels K. Deisenhofer J. Steigemenn W.

It is generally recognized that the unprimed side of the binding loop is energetically more essential than the prime side (27Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In addition, much less substrate kinetic data is available for the prime side residues. Furthermore, our data on seven P1′ mutants showed that in BPTI-serine proteinase complexes the P1′ side chain sterically conflicts with the side chain of Ile (P3′) leading to a large decrease in the association energy (28Grzesiak A. Helland R. Smalås A.O. Krowarsch D. Dadlez M. Otlewski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 207-218Google Scholar).

Bovine β-trypsin was supplied by Worthington Biochemical. All the mutants of BPTI were overexpressed as fusion proteins inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, using the T7 promotor system (30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) as described (31Staley J.P. Kim P.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The plasmids, derived from pAED4, bearing a portion of the E. coli trp operon, which serves as a leader sequence, followed by a Met residue and the mutant BPTI encoding sequences, were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (32Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). All recombinant variants contained the additional mutation M52L to allow CNBr cleavage of the fusion protein. Details of the purification and oxidative refolding protocols have been published elsewhere (33Krowarsch D. Dadlez M. Buczek O. Krokoszynska I. Smalas A.O. Otlewski J. J. Mol.

Electrospray mass spectrometry of all variants used in this study was performed with a Finnigan MAT TSQ-700. Samples were dissolved in a methanol:water:acetic acid mixture (50:49:1). Thermal denaturation was monitored by following the ellipticity at 223 nm with continuous monitoring of the thermal transition at a constant rate of 1 °C/min. The temperature of the sample was monitored directly using a probe immersed in a cuvette and was controlled with PFD. A band slit of 2 nm and a response time of 4 s was applied. Automatic Peltier accessory PFD 350S allowed 350S/350L Peltier type FDCD attachment. Protein was dissolved in 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.0 and passed through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter before measurements. The data were analyzed assuming a 2-state reversible equilibrium transition, θ(T)=(θF+mF[T])+(θU+mU[T])expΔHvHR1Tden−1T1+expΔHvHR1Tden−1TEquation 1 where T is the absolute temperature in K,R is the gas constant (1.98 cal/mol K),θ(T) is the ellipticity signal at 223 nm,ΔH vH is van't Hoff enthalpy, θF is the value of the folded signal extrapolated to 0 K,m F is the slope of the temperature dependence of the CD signal for the folded protein, θU is the value of the unfolded signal extrapolated to 0 K, m U is the slope of the temperature dependence of the CD signal for the unfolded protein, and T den is the denaturation temperature. Human plasmin was dissolved in 1 mm HCl containing 20 mm CaCl2. Plasmin concentration was determined by titration with wild type BPTI, which in turn was standardized with NPGB-titrated trypsin (35Chase T. Shaw E. Methods. Enzymol. 1970; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Plasma kallikrein and thrombin were dissolved in MilliQ water. The concentrations of both enzymes were determined using respective molar absorbance coefficients ε280 = 93,280 m−1cm−1 and 24,240m−1 cm−1(36Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Protein C was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and its concentration was determined from the 56,640m−1 cm−1molar absorbance coefficient at 280 nm (37Kisiel W. Davie E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 320-333Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The concentration of factor Xa was calculated from the Briggs-Haldane equation applying published values of catalytic parametersk cat and K m for the Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA substrate (38Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E. Zupan A. Christenen U. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The concentration of factor XIIa was determined from kinetic parametersk cat = 15 s−1 andK m = 1.9 × 10−4m for H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (39Silverberg M. Dunn J. Garren L. Kaplan A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7281-7286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following substrates were used to measure the residual enzyme activities: Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA (bovine trypsin), H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (α-plasmin), Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA (factor Xa), H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (α-factor XIIa), Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (plasma kallikrein), Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-pNA (α-thrombin), and Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA (protein C). All inhibitor concentrations were determined by titration with NPGB-standardized trypsin. The association constant (K a) values were determined by a modified method of Green and Work, as described by Empie and Laskowski (40Empie M.W. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2274-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Otlewski and Zbyryt (41Otlewski J. Zbyryt T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in 100 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.3. Although pH 8.3 is above the optimum pH for most of the proteinases used, at this pH theK a values are not perturbed by the pK of His-57, and it is a reference pH routinely used in our laboratory. To determine the association constant, increasing amounts of the inhibitor were added to a constant concentration of the proteinase.K a determinations were done singly; for eachK a value 7–10 data points were measured. The enzyme concentration was chosen to fulfil the condition: 1 < [E 0] × K a < 50. For the determination of low K a values (103–107m−1), the inhibitors were used at much higher concentrations than the enzyme, to force complex formation. After a suitable incubation time the residual enzyme activity was measured for about 500 s by monitoring the linear release ofp-nitroanilide with an HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The recorded signal was the average value of absorbance in the 380–410-nm range corrected for the background average absorbance in the 480–510-nm range. The value ofK a was calculated by a 3-parameter algorithm, (E) = f(E 0, K a , F), using the non-linear regression analysis program GraFit, according to the equation,[E]=12·[E0]−F·[I0]−Ka−1+([E0]+F·[I0]+Ka−1) 2−4·[E0]·F·[I0]Equation 2 where [E 0] and [I 0] are the total enzyme and inhibitor concentrations, respectively, [E] is the residual enzyme concentration, and F is the enzyme-inhibitor equimolarity factor. In the case of weak associations (K a < 107m−1) only the 2-parameter algorithm (E) =f(E 0, K a) and the default value of F = 1 were applied. The BPTI molecule contains a solvent-exposed proteinase binding loop spanning the residues P3 through P3′ (Fig.1). Thirteen mutations were installed in this segment using site-directed mutagenesis. All the mutants were expressed in E. coli with an average yield of 5 mg of pure protein per 1 liter of culture. Mutant proteins were purified on a C18 Vydac HPLC column in both their reduced and oxidized states. Experimental molecular masses determined by electrospray spectrometry of all variants were within 1.0 atomic mass unit of the expected values. All the mutant proteins showed similar CD spectra both in the near- and far-UV range, so no major conformational changes occurred upon installing the amino acid substitutions (data not shown). Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of the mutants was studied by thermal denaturation monitored by a 223-nm CD signal. All transitions were well reversible, as judged by the similarity of their CD spectra recorded at 20 °C before and after the experiment. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed a ΔH cal to ΔH vH ratio close to unity, which is indicative of a 2-state transition (data not shown). Fig.2 shows an example of denaturation curves for the pseudo wild type BPTI (K15R, M52L) and its two P3and P4 mutants: P13A and G12V. TableI summarizesT den and ΔH vH values determined for all the mutants at pH 2.0. It can easily be noticed that both the K15R and M52L mutations, which were introduced into all the mutants, did not lead to stability changes. However, all P3and P4 mutants were systematically destabilized by about 12.5 and 22 °C, respectively.Table IThermal denaturation parameters for P3 and P4 mutants of BPTIBPTI mutantT denΔT denΔH denP4P3P2P1°C°Ckcal/moleG 1-aWild type.P 1-aWild type.C 1-aWild type.K 1-aWild type.85.068.2G 1-bPseudo wild type.P 1-bPseudo wild type.C 1-bPseudo wild type.R 1-bPseudo wild type.83.067.2GGCR70.412.655.6GACR70.212.855.8GVCR70.412.658.0GICR70.612.456.8GFCR69.513.555.2GSCR71.211.856.8GDCR71.211.856.8GHCR70.512.555.5GRCR69.813.253.7SPCR63.519.539.5FPCR59.523.536.6VPCR60.422.636.8ΔT den values of P3 and P4 mutants were related to the pseudo wild type BPTI.

All the mutants were found to be functionally active, because they inhibited bovine trypsin. For all P3 mutants the association constants were very high (over 8 × 1011m−1) and could not be determined exactly (Table II). However, the P4 mutants showed large drops in their association constants with trypsin, in the range of 1300- to 4500-fold.Table IISequence alignment of the Asp-189 region of seven different serine proteinases together with the Ka values for wild type BPTI (P1 Lys) and pseudo wild type (P1 Arg)The calculated effects of the K15R substitution in BPTI are compared with those in the squash inhibitors.

For five of the proteinases Arg is significantly better than Lys. The largest increase of the association constant was observed for factor Xa (484-fold); the lowest increase was for thrombin (17-fold). Factor XIIainhibition by wild type BPTI and its Arg-15 mutant is shown in Fig. 3. Plasmin was the only enzyme that did not differentiate between the two basic side chains, and the measured association constants were the same, within experimental error. In the following analysis all association constants are compared with the pseudo wild type BPTI containing two mutations: K15R and M52L. This allows the calculation of single amino acid substitution effects at the P3 and P4 sites. The P3 position (Pro-13 in the wild type) was probed with nine side chains: Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Phe, Ser, Asp, His, and Arg. A set of P3 variants was chosen to include different properties of the side chain, such as polarity, charge, hydrophobicity, size, and branching. The observed effects on proteinases are reported in TableIII. The largest effects with respect to the substitutions at the P3 site were observed for factor XIIa. With the exception of Ile (5-fold decrease), all P3 mutants showed stronger inhibition of this proteinase than did the pseudo wild type BPTI. The largest increase (58-fold) was observed for Ser; the weakest effect, which still increased theK a value, was observed for the P3 Val residue (2-fold). In the case of plasma kallikrein, the best residue was Ile (2.2-fold increase), and the worst was Asp, which decreasedK a by a factor of 32.Table IIIAssociation constants for BPTI mutants and six human proteinasesInhibition effects were compared with the pseudo wild type BPTI (K15R,M52L). Arrows directed down indicate a decrease, and arrows directed up indicate an increase of the association constant value upon mutation. The mutated positions in the BPTI binding loop are in bold. The conditions were as follows: 100 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.3 at 22 °C. Errors in K a values are ±30%. Inhibition effects were compared with the pseudo wild type BPTI (K15R,M52L). Arrows directed down indicate a decrease, and arrows directed up indicate an increase of the association constant value upon mutation. The mutated positions in the BPTI binding loop are in bold. The conditions were as follows: 100 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.3 at 22 °C. Errors in K a values are ±30%. Three hydrophobic side chains (Val, Ile, and Phe) installed at P3 improved binding to thrombin by 4.6-, 5.7-, and 1.5-fold, respectively. Other mutations were destabilizing in the range of 1.3- to 23-fold. In the case of plasmin no clear effects of the substitution at P3 were observed. Two residues, His and Arg, improved binding to this protease 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. The most destabilizing side chain was that of Val (5.6-fold). Three mutations (Val (8-fold), Phe (8-fold), and His (4-fold)) substantially improved binding of BPTI to factor Xa. Gly and Ser at the P3 site were clearly destabilizing (6.4- and 3.5-fold, respectively). For protein C the most stabilizing were β-branched side chains of Val (6-fold) and Ile (4.4-fold) but also Arg (3.4-fold). Small side chains of Ala, Ser, and Asp destabilized the complex formation by 7.4-, 5.3-, and 3.6-fold, respectively. In this study the wild type Gly-12 was substituted with Ser, Val, or Phe residues. These three BPTI mutants could be oxidatively refolded, although with an average yield of 20%, compared with 80% for the P3 mutants. In addition, as described above, all P4 mutants showed much greater destabilization compared with P3 mutants (TableI). Generally, mutations at P4 affected the association energy with the studied enzymes to a larger extent than did mutations at the P3 position. In all studied cases the effect of Gly-12 substitution led to a rather drastic lowering of K avalues. The largest drops were found for trypsin (over 3 orders of magnitude), the largest effect reported in this paper. In the case of plasma kallikrein, installation of the β-branched Val residue also decreased K a by 3 orders of magnitude. Phe at P4 was almost as poor as Val. Substitution of Gly with Ser did not significantly lower the association constant. The relatively small effect of G12S substitution was also found for other enzymes studied here. The interactions of protein C and plasmin with three P4 mutants were similar to those described for plasma kallikrein; the largest (several hundred-fold) decrease of theK a value occurred in the case of Val, and a smaller but still substantial decrease (30–40-fold) occurred upon mutation to Phe. For the remaining three proteinases (factors Xa and"

The steady-state level of pol γ-β mRNA increases during the first hours of development, reaching its maximum value at the start of mtDNA replication inDrosophila embryos. In contrast, the steady-state level of pol γ-α mRNA decreases as development proceeds and is low in stages of active mtDNA replication. This difference in mRNA abundance results at least in part from differences in the rates of mRNA synthesis. The pol γ genes are located in a compact cluster of five genes that contains three promoter regions (P1–P3). The P1 region directs divergent transcription of the pol γ-β gene and the adjacent rpII33 gene. P1 contains a DNA replication-related element (DRE) that is essential for pol γ-β promoter activity, but not for rpII33 promoter activity in Schneider's cells. A second divergent promoter region (P2) controls the expression of theorc5 and sop2 genes. The P2 region contains two DREs that are essential for orc5 promoter activity, but not for sop2 promoter activity. The expression of the pol γ-α gene is directed by P3, a weak promoter that does not contain DREs. Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments demonstrate that the DRE-binding factor (DREF) regulatory protein binds to the DREs in P1 and P2. DREF regulates the expression of several genes encoding key factors involved in nuclear DNA replication. Its role in controlling the expression of the pol γ-β and orc5genes establishes a common regulatory mechanism linking nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication.

The remainder of the ∼1000 mitochondrial proteins, including those involved in mtDNA replication and transcription, are encoded in the nucleus, translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and targeted by a complex import mechanism to the mitochondrial compartment (1Attardi G.

Biol. 1995; 30: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in mitochondrial proliferation and maturation (i.e. mitochondrial biogenesis) during cell division, growth, and differentiation are poorly understood. During early embryonic stages, the mitochondria that are stored in the oocyte are segregated into various cellular territories; as development proceeds, mitochondrial proliferation begins. When differentiation ceases, the cells contain the correct number of mitochondria with the specific morphology and intracellular distribution to meet the highly variable energetic requirements of the various tissues of the organism (3Vallejo C.G.

Chem. 1980; 5: 23-27Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). How the mitochondrial mass, the extent of mitochondrial differentiation, and the mtDNA copy number are controlled in a defined cell type is not known. In addition to this increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in response to unidentified developmental cues, cells can also regulate the expression of the genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in response to a variety of physiological signals, including hormones, cyclic nucleotides, contractile activity, and thermogenesis (5Williams R.S.

Several DNA elements recognized by regulatory proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial genes have been identified in mammals, including Mts, REBOX/OXBOX, and GRBOX elements (9Suzuki H.

In addition, two transcription factors involved in nucleo-mitochondrial communication, nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF1 1 and NRF2), have been characterized during the last few years by Scarpulla and co-workers (12Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell.

NRF1 activates the expression of several genes that encode functional components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and key elements of the transcriptional/replication machinery of mitochondria such as Tfam (also known as mitochondrial transcription factor A) and the RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (7Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Binding sites for NRF1 have been also identified in several genes involved in cell proliferation and intermediary metabolism (12Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, NRF1 likely plays an important role in the control of mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis under a variety of conditions requiring high energy supply. Although mtDNA replication is required for eukaryotic cell proliferation, the mechanisms that regulate this process are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the cytoskeleton plays an active role in the mitochondrial dynamics of the cell (for a review, see Ref. 15Hermann G.J. Shaw J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 265-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and that the replication of the mitochondrial genome occurs in the perinuclear space (16Davis A.F. Clayton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The key enzyme in mtDNA replication is DNA polymerase γ (pol γ), which constitutes only ∼1% of the total cellular DNA polymerase activity (17Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 18Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The pol γ holoenzyme has been characterized extensively inDrosophila (19Olson M.W. Wang Y. Elder R.H. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28932-28937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); it is a heterodimer of a 125-kDa α subunit containing DNA polymerase and 3′–5′ exonuclease catalytic activities (20Lewis D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23389-23394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and a 35-kDa accessory subunit that increases the catalytic efficiency of the holoenzyme and is likely involved in primer recognition and in enhancing processivity (21Wang Y.

The catalytic subunit shares homology with the family A DNA polymerases (20Lewis D.L. Farr C.L. Wang Y. Lagina III, A.T. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

Garesse R. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we report on the transcriptional regulation of the pol γ-α and pol γ-β genes. Whereas our data indicate that the catalytic subunit of pol γ is expressed constitutively at a low level, the developmental pattern of expression of the pol γ-β gene suggests that the accessory subunit plays an important role in the control of mtDNA replication. Moreover, the transcription factor DREF, which activates the expression of genes encoding components of the nuclear replication machinery (29Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), is critical for pol γ-β promoter activity. This regulatory protein is also critical for the activity of the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) promoter (30Ruiz de Mena I. Lefai E. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13628-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), establishing firmly a molecular link between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. Total RNAs from staged embryos; first-, second-, and third-instar larvae; early and late pupae; and adults ofDrosophila melanogaster Oregon R were extracted using the Trizol kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. For Northern analysis, 30 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.8 m formaldehyde and 1.2% agarose gels, blotted on a Zeta Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed in ZAP buffer (0.25 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2., 7% SDS) at 65 °C using various [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA clones as probes. Filters were washed in 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC at 65 °C and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −70 °C. To obtain nuclei from Drosophila adults, flies (100 in a typical experiment) were homogenized in 1 ml of buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.35 m sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol. Embryos were dechorionated by sodium hypochloride treatment and washed extensively before homogenization. Transcriptional run-on reactions were performed essentially as described by Linialet al. (31Linial M. Gunderson N. Groudine M. Science. 1985; 230: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) using 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and ∼107 nuclei. Radiolabeled RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol and hybridized in ZAP buffer at 65 °C to 5 μg of 18 S rDNA and pol γ-α and pol γ-β cDNAs that were immobilized on nylon filters using the Manifold II system (Schleicher & Schüll) and denatured by NaOH treatment. Filters were washed in 0.1% SDS and 02 × SSC at 65 °C and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −70 °C. DNA fragments containing the promoter regions (P1–P3) of the five genes were amplified by PCR using several sets of oligonucleotide primers (Table I). The resulting parental DNA fragments were used as substrates for generation of deletion constructs. After digestion with restriction endonucleases, DNA fragments were excised from agarose gels and inserted into the pxp2 vector, which contains the luciferase gene as reporter. The nucleotide sequences of the parental DNA fragments and each of the promoter constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in this studyPromoter regionPositionsForward oligonucleotide (5′ → 3′)Reverse oligonucleotide (5′ → 3′)P1−2270/+473ACTGTACTATGAAGTGCACGTGCTCGAGCGGAATGTTGCCCGGCP2−1858/+316AACGGACTGATGCAGTTGCGGGCCCTCGAGGGTGGCTAAATGCGP3−2013/+119AACGTGCGTAACAGCACTGGTCCTCGAGTTAATAAAGGAAACAT+1 represents the transcriptional start site of pol γ-β,orc5, and pol γ-α, respectively.

Open table in a new tab +1 represents the transcriptional start site of pol γ-β,orc5, and pol γ-α, respectively. The XhoI restriction sites included in the reverse oligonucleotides are underlined. Their positions are according to +1. Deletions of the parental DNA fragment were generated as follows. EcoRV/XhoI and XmnI/XhoI fragments were cloned into the pxp2 vector that was digested with SmaI/XhoI to generate constructs α−1710/+113 and α−1197/+113 (where +1 corresponds to the transcriptional start site). TheXmnI/XhoI fragment was also digested withDraI, and the XmnI/DraI fragment was cloned into pxp2 that was digested with SmaI to generate construct α−1197/−183. To obtain construct α−407/+113, a 520-bpBglII/XhoI fragment was cloned into pxp2 that was digested with BglII/XhoI. To mutate the putative NRF1-like binding site in P3, we used the oligonucleotide 5′-GCCAGCCTAGGTATTTTTGccCcCTccCcCGGCGG-3′ (from positions +42 to +8 in the template strand for transcription); the lowercase letters represent the nucleotides that were changed from the original sequence (5′-GCCAGCCTAGGTATTTTTGTGCGCTTGCGCGGCGG-3′), and those that are underlined represent the mutated NRF1 site. After several steps of subcloning, PCR, and additional subcloning, construct α−407/+113mut was obtained. This plasmid is identical to its parental construct, α−407/+113, except for the six nucleotide changes within the NRF1-like site. Deletions in the parental PCR fragment were generated as follows.HindIII/XhoI and PvuII/XhoI fragments were cloned into the pxp2 vector that was digested withHindIII/XhoI and SmaI/XhoI, respectively, to generate constructs β−1806/+467 and β−1319/+467. To obtain constructs β−569/+467 and β−212/+467, the parental DNA fragment was digested with PstI and then withClaI, rendered blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and cut with XhoI. Purified fragments were then ligated into the pxp2 vector that was digested with SmaI/XhoI. A 797-bp DNA fragment from positions −326 to +473 was also amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides as primers: the same reverse primer described above (Table I) and a new forward primer (5′-GCACTGCAGTTTTGTTTTGATGAA-3′) containing a PstI site at position −318. The amplified product was digested with PstI and XhoI and cloned into the pBluescript vector that was digested with the same restriction enzymes, generating pBS-PI. The construct was then digested with ClaI; end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase; and religated to obtain pBS-PImut, in which the DREF-binding site is changed from TATCGATT to TATCgcGATT. TheBamHI/XhoI fragments of pBS-PI and pBS-PImut were cloned into pxp2 that was digested withBamHI/XhoI to generate the β−318/+467 and β−318/+467mut constructs, respectively. The BamHI/XhoI fragments of pBS-PI and pBS-PImut were also cloned into pxp2 that was digested withBamHI/XhoI to generate constructs rpII−715/+71 and rpII−715/+71mut, with the inverse orientation of the DNA fragments. These constructs are numbered with respect to the transcriptional start site (+1) of the rpII33 gene. Deletions of P2 were generated by digestion of the parental PCR fragment as follows. TheHindIII/XhoI and SalI/XhoI fragments were cloned into pxp2 that was digested with the same enzymes to generate constructs sop−1616/+307 and sop−604/+307. (+1 represents the transcriptional start site in the sop2 gene that maps at a position 326 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon. This +1 position is shared in the complementary strand by theorc5 gene.) A 627-bp DNA fragment from positions −326 to +473 was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides as primers: the same reverse primer described above (Table I) and a forward primer (5′-CCAGAGCTCTCGTCTGCTTT-3′) containing a PvuII site at position −306. The PvuII/XhoI fragment was cloned into the pBluescript vector that was digested withEcoRV/XhoI to obtain construct pBS-PII. The construct was then digested with ClaI; end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase; and religated to obtain construct pBS-PIImut, in which the region containing the two DREF sites is modified by a small deletion, changing the sequence TATCGATataacgaaaTAACGATAgtattgagggccatcgatt, where the ClaI sites are underlined and the DREF sites are in uppercase letters. The BamHI/XhoI fragments of pBS-PII and pBS-PIImut were cloned into pxp2 that was digested with BamHI/XhoI to obtain constructs sop−303/+307 and sop−303/+307mut. A 2230-bp DNA fragment from positions −2080 to +351 (where +1 corresponds to the transcriptional start site of the orc5 gene) was amplified by PCR using the two oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCAGAGCTCTCGTCTGCTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCCCTCGAGGGTGGCTAAATGCG-3′ (reverse), in which aPvuII site was introduced at a position corresponding to +343. The SalI/PvuII fragment was cloned into pxp2 that was digested with SalI/SmaI to generate construct orc−1405/+346. The SalI/KpnI fragment was cloned into pxp2 that was digested withSalI/KpnI to generate construct orc−1405/+117. Finally, the BamHI/EcoRV fragments of pBS-PII and pBS-PIImut were cloned into pxp2 that was digested withSmaII/BglII to obtain the orc−170/+346 and orc−170/+346mut constructs, respectively. For cotransfection experiments, we cloned the complete Erect Wing (EWG) and DREF cDNAs in the vector pMK26 (32Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), which allows strong expression under the control of the actin 5C promoter. A BamHI/XhoI fragment containing the complete DREF cDNA (30Ruiz de Mena I. Lefai E. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13628-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase and subcloned into the pBluescript vector that was digested with EcoRV to obtain pBS-DREF. For EWG plasmid construction, the pET3dEWG6His clone (a kind gift of Dr. Richard Scarpulla) was first digested with XbaI/BamHI, end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase, and then inserted into the pBluescript vector that was digested with EcoRV to obtain pBS-EWG. Finally, the HindIII/PstI fragments obtained from pBS-DREF and pBS-EWG were cloned into the pMK26 vector that was digested with HindIII/PstI, generating constructs pMK-DREF and pMK-EWG, respectively. Transfection in Schneider's S2 cells was carried out according to Soeller et al. (33Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 IU/ml) were added to the medium, and cells were transfected with 10 μg of the vector pSVβgal (Promega) and 5 μg of the corresponding pxp construct. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 ml of fresh medium, and incubated for 60–80 h at 25 °C. To prepare extracts, cells were harvested by centrifugation; washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then with fresh buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl; resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); and subjected to five cycles of freezing for 60 s at −70 °C and heating for 60 s at 37 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Promoter activities were calculated by normalizing luciferase activity (pxp constructs) to β-galactosidase activity (pSVβgal). Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out using protein prepared from two sources: the in vitro TNT transcription/translation system (Promega) for DREF binding assays and Schneider's cell nuclear extracts for DREF and NRF1 binding assays. The binding reactions were carried out using 2 μl of in vitro transcription and translation product or 5 μg of nuclear protein and 50,000 cpm of the DNA probe in binding buffer containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 9.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 200 mm KCl. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, reaction products were electrophoresed on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels (for PCR probes) or 6% polyacrylamide gels (for oligonucleotide probes) containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. DNA probes were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. For the P1 probes, two DNA fragments containing the DRE were used as probes: a double-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotide from positions −225 to −204 and a 173-bp fragment from positions −325 to −153 that was obtained by PCR amplification (where +1 corresponds to the transcriptional start site for pol γ-β). For the P2 probe, a 120-bp DNA fragment from positions −132 to −13 containing the DREs was amplified by PCR (where +1 corresponds to the transcriptional start site for sop2). In DREF EMSA experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of various oligonucleotides was used as competitor, including unlabeled DNA probes and oligonucleotides from the mtSSB promoter containing wild-type or mutated DRE sites (30Ruiz de Mena I. Lefai E. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13628-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the P3 probe, a double-stranded 35-mer oligonucleotide from positions +42 to +8 containing the NRF1-like site and its mutated version (described above) was used. DREF antiserum was prepared as described (30Ruiz de Mena I. Lefai E. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13628-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Antiserum against EWG was kindly provided by Dr. Kalpana White. In supershift assays, 2 μl of a 1:100 dilution of the relevant antiserum was used. The genes encoding the two subunits of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase map within a cluster of genes, the pol γ cluster, that extends over a region of 10.5 kilobases in the alcohol dehydrogenase region (34D–E) of the second chromosome of D. melanogaster (27Ashburner M. Misra S. Roote J. Lewis S.E. Blazej R. Davis T. Doyle C. Galle R. George R. Harris N. Hartzell G. Harvey D. Hong L. Houston K. Hoskins R. Johnson G. Martin C. Moshrefi A. Palazzolo M. Reese M.G.

Biol. 2000; 9: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cluster contains five genes that encode proteins involved in essential cellular processes, including the two pol γ subunits (pol γ-α and pol γ-β), one subunit of RNA polymerase II (RpII33), one subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC5), and one subunit of the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (SOP2/ARC41). The pol γ cluster is extremely compact: the genes are tightly packed with very little intergenic space, with some overlap in their 5′- and 3′-ends (Fig. 1). The cluster contains three promoter regions (P1–P3), and two of them direct bidirectional transcription (28Lefai E. Fernández-Moreno M.A. Kaguni L.S. Garesse R. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This tight organization suggests that the structure of the pol γ cluster plays an important role in regulating the expression of its genes. This is a particularly important consideration given that two of the genes encode the subunits of the key enzyme in the mitochondrial DNA replication process (pol γ-α and pol γ-β), representing a rare example in eukaryotes of genes encoding functionally related proteins that are linked in the genome. Moreover, a third gene of the pol γ cluster, orc5, encodes an essential component of the nuclear DNA replication machinery, suggesting the presence of potential common regulatory mechanisms for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. As a first step to study the factors involved in regulating the expression of the pol γ genes, we determined (by Northern analysis) their patterns of expression during Drosophila development and compared them with the expression profiles of the other genes encoded in the pol γ cluster. The level of pol γ-α mRNA was relatively high in eggs and decreased rapidly during embryonic development (Fig. 2 A). This result is perhaps surprising because mtDNA replication started ∼10 h after egg laying (AEL); and at this developmental stage, the level of pol γ-α mRNA has declined substantially. During the larval stages, a period characterized by increases in body weight and cell ploidy, the steady-state level of pol γ-α mRNA remained very low, whereas that in adults was comparatively higher. The spatiotemporal pattern of expression of pol γ-α mRNA, examined by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization, is in good agreement with the Northern results. pol γ-α mRNA was distributed homogeneously in early blastoderm, and the intensity of the signal decreased through gastrulation and was very faint or undetectable in older embryos (data not shown). pol γ-β mRNA showed a different developmental profile (Fig.2 A). The level present in eggs was relatively low, but its steady-state level increased in early embryonic stages, reaching its maximum between 6 and 12 h AEL. In late embryos, its steady-state level decreased; and in first-instar larvae, there was a modera"

We have now examined the effect of insulin on geranylgeranyltransferase I in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Insulin increased GGTase I activity 3-fold and augmented the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A by 18%. Both effects of the insulin were blocked by an inhibitor of GGTase I, GGTI-286. The insulin-induced increases in the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A resulted in potentiation of the Rho-A-mediated effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) on a serum response element-luciferase construct. Preincubation of cells with insulin augmented the LPA-stimulated serum response element-luciferase activation to 12-fold, compared with just 6-fold for LPA alone (p < 0.05). The potentiating effect of insulin was dose-dependent, inhibited by GGTI-286 and not mimicked by insulin-like growth factor-1. We conclude that insulin activates GGTase I, increases the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A protein, and potentiates the Rho-A-dependent nuclear effects of LPA in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Whether a protein is farnesylated or geranylgeranylated is determined by its specific C-terminal sequence. Ras proteins contain serine, methionine, or glutamine at the X position of the terminal CAAXbox and are farnesylated, whereas Rho proteins have leucine at this position and are geranylgeranylated. The C terminus of the Rab proteins contains either a CC or CXC sequence, which is double geranylgeranylated by GGTase II.We have recently demonstrated that insulin promotes the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase, increases its enzymatic activity, and augments the amounts of farnesylated p21 ras in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (11Goalstone M.L.

Furthermore, tissues of hyperinsulinemic animals display both increased activity of FTase and increased amounts of farnesylated p21 ras (14Goalstone M.L. Wall K. Leitner J.W. Kurowski T. Ruderman N.

Because FTase and GGTase I share the same α-subunit of the heterodimeric structure (15Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we decided to evaluate the potential effect of insulin on GGTase I and the amount of geranylgeranylated Rho proteins. This has not been tested experimentally to date.Furthermore, because Rho-A mediates transcriptional activation of the serum response element (SRE)-dependent genes by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), we also examined whether the insulin-induced increases in the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A potentiate the transcriptional activity of LPA in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Rho-A was immunoprecipitated and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC Silica gel 60 plates) using a solution containing 0.75 mammonium formate, 0.5 m LiCl, and 0.57 m HCl. Gels were dried overnight, then sprayed with acid molybdate reagent, and allowed to dry. The position of labeled GTP and GDP on the TLC plates was visualized by autoradiography. The areas of the gel corresponding to the GTP and GDP bands of the autoradiogram were excised from the plates, and the amounts of labeled nucleotide were assessed by scintillation counting. The amounts of GTP were expressed in percentage above control of total GTP/GDP binding to Rho-A.Effect on SRE-dependent Gene TranscriptionMCF-7 cells were grown to confluence at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (as described above). Using LipofectAMINE/Plus reagent, the cells were co-transfected with either a SRE-Luc construct or a luciferase construct minus the SRE (PGL3), and a CMV-βGal construct, which was used as a control for transfection efficiency and processing. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h, preincubated with insulin (100 nm) in the absence or presence of GGTI-286 (3 μm) for 24 h, and then challenged with LPA (10 μm) for 16 h. Control cells were incubated with or without insulin for 40 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by a freeze/thaw method using a Triton X-100-based lysis buffer provided in the Enhanced Luciferase Assay kit. Luciferase activity was then measured on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD) using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay kit and corrected for by β-galactosidase activity (determined by chemiluminescence). Efficiency is equal to the luciferase activity divided by the β-galactosidase activity.Statistical AnalysisStatistics were analyzed by Student's paired or unpaired t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant.DISCUSSIONThe salient feature of this investigation is that insulin activates GGTase I and increases the cellular amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A. Physiologically, this action of insulin results in the augmentation of the Rho-A-mediated transcriptional activation of SRE-dependent genes by LPA. Cells preincubated with insulin and then followed by LPA exhibited a 12-fold increase in luciferase activity, which was greater than stimulation by insulin alone (3-fold), LPA alone (6-fold), or the addition of these two results. Thus, the response to insulin plus LPA was synergistic and gave a greater than additive effect in luciferase activity, clearly showing the ability of insulin to potentiate LPA's action on SRE-dependent genes. Synergy is defined as a result greater then that of either A or B alone and greater than could be expected from simple addition of the individual effects (18Katzung B. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, CT1989Google Scholar). The effect of insulin alone was not significantly different from the control, but the dose response to insulin showed a greater “priming” effect with increasing doses of insulin (Fig. 5 B).We have previously shown that insulin is a potent activator of FTase and GGTase II in a variety of cell types and tissues (11Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27585-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated FTase activity results in significant increases in the amounts of farnesylated p21 ras and augmentation of DNA synthesis in response to other growth factors, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (13Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Leitner J.W. Kline T. Carel K., M., G. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IGF-1, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor elicit greater incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts preincubated with insulin than in its absence. In vascular smooth muscle cells, insulin potentiates the platelet-derived growth factor-induced vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression and thymidine incorporation (12Goalstone M.L. Natarajan R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Leitner J.W. Carel K. Scott S. Nadler J. Sowers J.R. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These “priming” effects of insulin are blocked by an inhibitor of FTase, α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid, suggesting that the effects of insulin are mediated by increased activity of FTase (12Goalstone M.L. Natarajan R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Leitner J.W. Carel K. Scott S. Nadler J. Sowers J.R. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Leitner J.W. Kline T. Carel K., M., G. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin also promotes increases in the activity of GGTase II and the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-3 and Rab-4 (16Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Golovchenko I. Stjernholm M.R. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2880-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the effect of insulin on geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins remains to be determined.The mechanism of insulin's effect on the prenyltransferases involves the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase (19Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GGTase II (16Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Golovchenko I. Stjernholm M.R. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2880-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that insulin also promotes the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of GGTase I in MCF-7 cells. Inhibition of the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase results in diminution of FTase activity (19Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to promote the phosphorylation of the α-subunit and activate these prenyltransferases is insulin-specific and is not mimicked by IGF-1, epidermal growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor (13Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This effect requires the presence of the intact insulin receptor, as cells derived from insulin receptor knock-out mice did not respond to insulin in terms of FTase activation (13Goalstone M.L.

Furthermore, cells with a chimeric insulin-IGF-1 receptor also fail to activate FTase in response to insulin (13Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Even though IGF-1 is a more potent mitogen than insulin, IGF-1 alone showed no significant increase in the amounts of farnesylated p21 ras , indicating no effect on the activity of farnesyltransferase (13Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present data are in agreement and demonstrate that IGF-1 alone exerted a greater influence on SRE-Luc than insulin, yet had no effect on either phosphorylation of the GGTase I α-subunit (Fig. 2) or potentiation of the nuclear effect of LPA (Fig. 5 A). Because GGTase I shares the α-subunit with FTase (15Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and IGF-1 has no effect on its phosphorylation (Fig. 2), it would not, therefore, be expected to have an effect on GGTase I activity. Furthermore, the inability of IGF-1 to prime the effect of LPA is consistent with the lack of IGF-1 effect on prenylation.Investigation of insulin signaling to GGTase I was beyond the scope of this study. Previously, we have shown that insulin's effect on the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase and GGTase II was blocked by an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (16Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Golovchenko I. Stjernholm M.R. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2880-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by transfection with a dominant negative mutant of Ras (19Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that insulin activates FTase in a “positive feedback” fashion using the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to promote the phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme. Interestingly, however, other growth factors, which activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, fail to influence FTase (13Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating the specificity of insulin action and that other signaling intermediates may be involved for insulin to activate prenyltransferases.The α-subunit of FTase also belongs to GGTase I (15Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Because this subunit is phosphorylated in response to insulin, one could propose that insulin might activate GGTase I similarly to FTase. We have demonstrated that insulin increases the activity of GGTase I and consequently, the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A. The question that presents itself is, what could be the physiological or pathophysiological consequences of this aspect of insulin action? Rho-A is a member of the Ras superfamily of small (20–25 kDa) GTPases. Currently at least 14 mammalian Rho family proteins have been identified and have been shown to share 50–90% amino acid sequence homology (2Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Similar to Ras, Rho proteins function as GTP/GDP-regulated binary switches, which control signaling pathways responsible for numerous important cellular functions. Rho proteins are active when they are in the GTP-bound state. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (of the Dbl oncogene family) catalyze the release of bound GDP, thus allowing GTP to bind and activate these GTPases (21Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 22: F1-F23Google Scholar). GTPase-activating proteins, on the other hand, stimulate the low intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rho proteins, hence acting as negative regulators of Rho protein function (22Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).Rho-A is an important cellular GTPase that appears to mediate the effects of LPA on the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (23van Dijk M.C. Postma F. Hilkmann H. Jalink K. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), multiple nuclear responses including cell cycle progression (2Ridley A.J. Curr.

Acta. 1997; 22: F1-F23Google Scholar). At least five Rho family proteins have been implicated as critical regulators of Ras-mediated oncogenic transformation (22Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and recent observations indicate that aberrant function of Rho family proteins may also contribute to malignant transformation (21Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 22: F1-F23Google Scholar). An important aspect of the transformed phenotype is the ability of Rho-A to promote cell motility (25Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T. Takeichi M. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and invasion.

The protection by α-crystallin of SDH activity was essentially unaffected by high ionic strength (i.e. 0.5m NaCl). On the other hand, the transparency of the protein solution was lost at a high salt concentration because of the precipitation of the α-crystallin/SDH adduct. Magnesium and calcium ions present at millimolar concentrations antagonized the protective action exerted by α-crystallin against the thermally induced inactivation and aggregation of SDH. The lack of protection of α-crystallin against the inactivation of SDH induced at 55 °C by thiol blocking agents or EDTA together with the additive effect of NADH in stabilizing the enzyme in the presence of α-crystallin suggest that functional groups involved in catalysis are freely accessible in SDH while interacting with α-crystallin. Two different adducts between α-crystallin and SDH were isolated by gel filtration chromatography. One adduct was characterized by a highM r of approximately 800,000 and carried exclusively inactive SDH. A second adduct, carrying active SDH, had a size consistent with an interaction of the enzyme with monomers or lowM r aggregates of α-crystallin. Even though it had a reduced efficiency with respect to α-crystallin, bovine serum albumin was shown to mimic the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin in protecting SDH from thermal denaturation. These findings suggest that the multimeric structural organization of α-crystallin may not be a necessary requirement for the stabilization of the enzyme activity. Sorbitol dehydrogenase (l-iditol:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase, E.C. 1.1.1.14) (SDH) was significantly protected from thermally induced inactivation and aggregation by bovine lens α-crystallin. An α-crystallin/SDH ratio as low as 1:2 in weight was sufficient to preserve the transparency of the enzyme solution kept for at least 2 h at 55 °C. Moreover, an α-crystallin/SDH ratio of 5:1 (w/w) was sufficient to preserve the enzyme activity fully at 55 °C for at least 40 min.

Believed to be strictly a lens-specific protein, α-crystallin has now been found in several cells and non-lenticular tissues (1Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurube N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Oshima K. Biochim.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23337-23341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both αA and αB chains have a conserved domain, called the “α-crystallin domain,” which is peculiar to the SHSP1 family (3Boelens W.C. de Jong W.W. Mol. Biol.

The chaperone-like action of α-crystallin, which was assumed from the observed sequence homology between α-crystallin subunits and the SHSP gene of Drosophila (9Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), was then confirmed by the strong in vitro anti-aggregation effect of α-crystallin on denaturating thermally stressed proteins (10Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). In fact, the effectiveness of α-crystallin as an anti-aggregant is often used as a simple assay for in vitro assessments of molecular chaperone power (11Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The thermally induced precipitation of β- and γ-crystallin (12Boyle D. Takemoto L. Exp.

Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was efficiently prevented by α-crystallin present at variable ratios with respect to the target protein. Enzymes undergoing thermal stress were protected by α-crystallin from aggregation but generally not from inactivation, except for the restriction enzyme NdeI (16Hess J.F. Fitzgerald P.G. Mol. Vis. 1998; 15: 4-29Google Scholar) and for bovine liver catalase in which activity was only slightly protected by α-crystallin (17Hook D.W.A. Harding J.J. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The situation was different when the enzyme was subjected to different post-translational modifications, such as glycation, carbamylation, and steroid-induced inactivation where α-crystallin was shown to protect the enzyme activity (17Hook D.W.A. Harding J.J. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin on sorbitol dehydrogenase (l-iditol:NAD+2-oxidoreductase, E.C. 1.1.1.14) (SDH), purified from bovine lens. SDH is a heat labile tetrameric enzyme that requires Zn2+ and NADH as cofactors for its activity (18Jeffery J. Jornvall H. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 47-106PubMed Google Scholar) and is the only known mechanism responsible for the removal of sorbitol in the cell. SDH was protected by bovine lens α-crystallin not only from thermally induced aggregation but also from inactivation. Calf eyes were obtained from a local abattoir soon after slaughtering; the lenses were removed and frozen at −20 °C until used. Molecular weight markers for SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, dithiothreitol, NAD+, β-d(−)fructose, and d-sorbitol were from Sigma-Aldrich. NADH was supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals, EDTA by Serva Feinbiochemica, and YM30 ultrafiltration membrane by Amicon. The electrophoretic equipment was from Bio-Rad. Sepharose CL-4B and Sepharose 6B, were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Spectra/Por molecular porous membrane tubing (cut off 60KDa) was from Spectrum. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Sorbitol dehydrogenase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as described previously (19Marini I. Bucchioni L. Borella P. Del Corso A. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The final enzyme preparation (approximately 1 mg/ml) with a specific activity of 51 units/mg was stored at 4 °C in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7 (S-buffer) supplemented with 2 mmdithiothreitol and 0.1 mm NADH. The purified enzyme stored in the above preservative mixture was dialyzed against S-buffer just before use. The assay of enzyme activity was performed at 37 °C as described previously (19Marini I. Bucchioni L. Borella P. Del Corso A. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in a reaction mixture (0.5 ml final volume) containing 0.24 mmNADH and 0.4 md-fructose in a 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The rate of NADH oxidation measured in a parallel assay in which the substrate was omitted was subtracted as a blank. One unit of enzyme activity is the amount of SDH that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol/min of NADH. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Frozen lenses were suspended (1.5 g/10 ml) in S-buffer and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The suspension was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. An aliquot of the resulting supernatant was applied to a Sepharose 6B column (1.5 × 65 cm), and the elution was performed with S-buffer at a flow rate of 3 ml/h. Eluted fractions (1 ml) containing low molecular weight α-crystallin were pooled and concentrated on an Amicon YM30 membrane. The concentrated protein solution was chromatographed on a Sephadex S200 column (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with S-buffer. The eluted fractions containing α-crystallin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and then stored at −20 °C in an S-buffer until use at a final protein concentration of approximately 2 mg/ml. The thermal denaturation of SDH both in the absence and presence of α-crystallin was followed by monitoring, as an index of turbidity, the absorbance at 360 nm in a Beckman DU-6 spectrophotometer. Incubations of SDH (0.1–0.3 mg/ml) were performed at 55 °C both in S-buffer and in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer pH 7.4, using a water bath at a controlled temperature. Gel filtration analyses of SDH/α-crystallin mixtures were carried out both at 25 and 55 °C by Sepharose CL-4B on a XK16/70 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equipped with a thermostatic jacket. Elution was performed with S-buffer at a flow rate of 60 ml/h, and fractions of 1 ml were collected. The following standards were used for apparent molecular weight calibration: apoferritin, M r 443,000; β-amylase, M r 200,000; alcohol dehydrogenase,M r 150,000. The relative elution volume (R f) is expressed as R f = (V s −V o)/(V b −V o), where V s,V o, and V b refer to the sample elution volume, the column exclusion volume (as determined by the elution of a dextran blue standard), and the resin bed volume, respectively. SDH initial velocity measurements were performed spectrophotometrically as described above. For each set of measurements, data were analyzed by double reciprocal plots. Rate measurements in each set of assays were in duplicate with a reproducibility of ≤5%, and each plot was repeated at least twice.K m and V max values measured for fructose and NADH were determined by non-linear regression with a relative standard deviation of 5%. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Blue binding assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDH and α-crystallin localizations in the elution profiles of chromatographic analyses were carried out by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 12% acrylamide slab gels, 0.75-mm thick. The following standards were used for apparent molecular weight calibration: bovine serum albumin, M r 66,000; ovalbumin, M r 45,000; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, M r 36,000; human erythrocytes carbonic anhydrase, M r 29,000, trypsinogen,M r 24,000, and trypsin inhibitor,M r 20,000. Gels were stained by the silver stain technique (22Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). To test the ability of low M r α-crystallin aggregates to protect SDH, the enzyme (50 μg/ml in 3.8 ml of S-buffer) was incubated at 50 °C in the presence of a dialysis bag (cut-off, 60 KDa) containing α-crystallin (1 mg/ml in 0.4 ml of S-buffer). At different times, SDH activity was measured on 2-μl aliquots. Control measurements were performed by incubating SDH, under the same experimental conditions, in the presence of a dialysis bag containing only 0.4 ml of S-buffer. A progressive inactivation of SDH was observed by incubating the enzyme at increasing temperatures. The pseudo-first order inactivation rate constant increased from 3.51 × 10−4 ± 0.29 × 10−4 s−1 to 1.40 × 10−3 ± 0.07 × 10−3 s−1 when the incubation temperature of SDH (0.01 mg/ml) was raised from 25 °C to 60 °C. The inactivation process was affected by the protein concentration, nature, and concentration of the buffer and by the presence of the pyridine cofactor. NADH, up to 0.1 mm, partially protected the enzyme against thermal inactivation. However, for all the temperatures tested the NADH-dependent protection led to a SDH activity that was never more than 20% higher than the control values. The time course of SDH inactivation at 55 °C with different final enzyme concentrations, ranging from 0.01 to 0.3 mg/ml, showed that after 15 min of incubation the residual activity was increased from approximately 25 to 70%, respectively. However, incubations of SDH in the concentration range of 0.1–0.3 mg/ml performed at 55 °C for more than 15 min led to protein precipitation (see below). The precipitation phenomena at long incubation times were affected by the nature and concentration of the buffer. Although the 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, appeared to protect the protein from precipitation, the Tris-HCl buffer used in this study (50 mm, pH 7.4) appeared to magnify the susceptibility of SDH to thermal aggregation. Moreover, the concentration of the Tris buffer affected the enzyme's stability. At 55 °C, the residual activity of SDH (0.01 mg/ml) after 40 min of incubation rose from approximately 20 to 40% when the buffer concentration was increased from 10 to 50 mm (data not shown). The changes in the nominal pH values occurring in the buffer in the temperature range from 25 to 55 °C (pH from 7.4 to 6.3) did not affect the enzyme inactivation (data not shown). When SDH was thermally stressed in the presence of α-crystallin, both enzyme inactivation and precipitation were prevented. α-Crystallin present in the incubation at a ratio as low as 1:2 (w/w) with SDH prevented protein aggregation when the enzyme (0.3 mg/ml, final concentration) was incubated at 55 °C (Fig.1). High ionic strength interfered with the anti-aggregation capability of α-crystallin; this is shown by the increase in turbidity observed when transparent α-crystallin/SDH mixtures, but not α-crystallin alone, were supplemented at 55 °C with NaCl ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 m. The effect exerted by 0.5 m NaCl is shown in Fig. 1. Under these conditions, the rate of the increase in absorbance at 360 nm was inversely proportional to the α-crystallin/SDH ratio in the mixture. To determine whether the precipitation induced by high ionic strength in α-crystallin/SDH mixtures involved only SDH or both target and protector proteins, the precipitate formed after NaCl addition was collected by centrifugation, washed three times by warmed (i.e. 55 °C) 0.5 m NaCl in Tris-HCl buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results, shown in theinset of Fig. 1, indicate that both SDH and α-crystallin are present in the precipitate in a proportion comparable with the original composition of the mixture (compare lanes a andb of Fig. 1, inset). The ability of α-crystallin to protect enzyme activity was evaluated at various temperatures. The residual SDH activity was measured during incubation in the absence or presence of α-crystallin at a ratio with the enzyme of 5:1 (w/w) (Fig. 2). In all cases up to 55 °C, the presence of α-crystallin fully protected the enzyme for at least 40 min of incubation. Prolonged incubations at 55 °C led to a gradual decline in SDH activity. The remaining enzyme activity after 3 h of incubation at 55 °C of 0.15 mg/ml SDH with 1:5 (w/w) α-crystallin was 75–80% of the initial activity (data not shown). At a higher temperature (i.e. 60 °C), α-crystallin was only partially active. In fact, as shown in Fig. 2, after 40 min of incubation at 60 °C, although SDH alone was completely inactive, 50% of the initial activity was still detectable when α-crystallin was present with the enzyme. When under the above conditions (5:1, w/w α-crystallin/SDH mixtures at 0.1 mg/ml SDH, 55 °C), the ionic strength of α-crystallin/SDH mixtures was increased by the the addition of 0.5 m NaCl, a rather modest effect on the stabilizing ability of α-crystallin toward SDH activity was observed. A recovery of approximately 75% of the control value was detected 45 min after the addition of the salt. Calcium and magnesium ions interfere with the protective action of α-crystallin against both thermal inactivation and aggregation of SDH. Both metal ions at millimolar concentrations induced protein aggregation when added to clear mixtures of SDH and α-crystallin at 55 °C. After 40 min of incubation at 55 °C, the SDH present in a transparent mixture (0.1 mg/ml) containing α-crystallin 1:1 (w/w) was readily precipitated following the addition of 2 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm Mg2+ (Fig.3 A). No precipitation was observed when both metal ions were added at 55 °C to a solution containing α-crystallin alone (data not shown). A concentration-dependent action of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in antagonizing the stabilization exerted by α-crystallin on SDH activity is reported in Fig. 3 B. The strongest effect of Ca2+ was observed at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mm, whereas the strongest effect of Mg2+ was between 0.5 and 3 mm. The increase in the α-crystallin/SDH ratio resulted in a reduced efficiency for both of the metal ions to induce enzyme inactivation. In particular, when the ratio of α-crystallin/SDH was increased from 1:1 to 5:1, the residual activity measured after 20 min at 55 °C from the addition of the metal ion (either 2 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm Mg2+) increased from approximately 50 to 80% (data not shown). ATP, Mg2+, and KCl were necessary for the GroE system to exert its chaperone action (23Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP, in the presence of Mg2+, KCl, and α-crystallin, elicited the partial recovery of citrate synthase activity after the enzyme had been previously denatured by guanidinium chloride (24Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our study, the presence of 5–10 mm ATP and 2 mmKCl neither improved the stabilization exerted by α-crystallin on SDH nor interfered with the antagonism to the stabilization process exerted by Mg2+. The elution profiles of a size exclusion chromatography of a mixture of α-crystallin and SDH (5:1, w/w) after incubation and separation at 25 and 55 °C are shown in Fig. 4,panels A and B, respectively. In Fig.4 C, the profile of a chromatographic analysis at 25 °C of SDH in the absence of α-crystallin is also reported. The elution profile at 280 nm reported in Fig.4 A revealed two peaks, one of which at a R f of 0.71 (low M rpeak) was associated with SDH activity. SDS-PAGE analysis (inset) revealed that whereas SDH was indeed exclusively in the low M r peak, α-crystallin, mainly present at aR f of 0.45 (high M rpeak), was distributed in a wide range of elution volumes overlapping the peak of SDH activity. The staining intensity of the α-crystallin bands in the fractions containing active SDH was higher when compared with fractions eluting immediately before the SDH activity peak (compare lanes c and b in Fig.4 A, inset). Moreover, no α-crystallin bands were detectable by SDS-PAGE in fractions with elution volumes corresponding to low M r peak of chromatographic runs performed at 25 °C (data not shown) in which α-crystallin was analyzed in the absence of SDH (compare lanes c and d in Fig. 4 A, inset). The elution profile of the chromatographic separation performed at 55 °C (Fig. 4 B) revealed that the low M r peak of 280 nm absorbing material was lost. Nevertheless, a symmetrical peak of active SDH (R f = 0.65) was detectable. The SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted fractions (Fig. 4 B, inset) revealed that, as occurs for the chromatographic separation at 25 °C, α-crystallin co-eluted with active SDH. In fact, also in this case, the staining intensity of the α-crystallin bands in the fractions containing active SDH was higher than that observed in fractions eluting immediately before the activity peak (comparelanes c and b in Fig. 4 B, inset). When α-crystallin was subjected to gel filtration at 55 °C in the absence of SDH (data not shown), the analysis by SDS-PAGE of fractions corresponding to the active SDH peak (R f = 0.65) revealed α-crystallin bands of a very weak intensity (comparelanes c and d in Fig. 4 B, inset). The main difference, as revealed by SDS-PAGE analysis, between the chromatographic separations performed at the two different temperatures is that at 55 °C inactive SDH coeluted with α-crystallin in the high M r region (R f = 0.47). The elution volume of active SDH in the chromatographic analysis performed at 25 °C on an α-crystallin/SDH mixture (Fig.4 A) is slightly lower than that observed for SDH analyzed in the absence of α-crystallin (R f = 0.73, Fig.4 C). However, such a decrease (approximately 3 ml, corresponding to an increase of 30 KDa) is too small to attempt any specific evaluation of the M r of the α-crystallin/SDH complex. A further decrease in the elution volume of active SDH was observed when the α-crystallin/SDH mixture was analyzed at 55 °C. However, in such a condition, even though highM r α-crystallin aggregate and active SDH were separated (see inset, Fig. 4 B), a slight delay in α-crystallin elution was also observed (differentialR f = 0.02). This finding would seem to indicate a modest but still detectable change in the resolution power of the column at 55 °C. Because of the difficulties in finding suitable standard proteins, no calibration of the column could be done at 55 °C. The possibility that low M r aggregates of α-crystallin subunits might protect SDH from thermal inactivation was tested by measuring at different times the enzyme activity of SDH kept at 50 °C in the presence of a dialysis bag containing α-crystallin (see ”Experimental Procedures“). Under those conditions, it was possible to measure a residual activity of approximately 90% after 1 h of incubation. When α-crystallin were not present in the dialysis bag, a residual activity of approximately 70% was measured. The ability of α-crystallin to protect SDH activity against thiol blocking agents and metal chelators was tested at 55 °C in mixtures containing α-crystallin and SDH in a ratio of 5:1 (w/w). Both iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid led to a complete inactivation of SDH. When 0.01 mg/ml bovine lens SDH was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer at 55 °C with 0.5 mm of either iodoacetamide or iodoacetic acid, an inactivation occurred at the same rate (with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 2.5 × 10−3 ± 0.6 × 10−3 s−1) irrespective of the presence of α-crystallin. The presence of 0.1 mm NADH significantly delayed (k = 6.5 × 10−4 ± 1 × 10−4 s−1) but did not prevent the loss of enzyme activity. Bovine lens SDH, which contains Zn2+ as a prosthetic group (18Jeffery J. Jornvall H. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 47-106PubMed Google Scholar), is inactivated by EDTA and recovers its activity upon treatment with ZnSO4 (19Marini I. Bucchioni L. Borella P. Del Corso A. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When 0.01 mg/ml SDH was treated with 100 μm EDTA at 55 °C, no reactivation occurred upon addition of the Zn2+. α-Crystallin, 5:1 (w/w) with the enzyme, did not protect SDH at 55 °C from the rapid and complete loss of activity induced by EDTA. However, the inactivation was completely reversed when the inactive protein mixture, following thermal treatment, was incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 100 μm ZnSO4 (data not shown). NADH, which has been shown to protect SDH at 37 °C from EDTA-induced inactivation (19Marini I. Bucchioni L. Borella P. Del Corso A. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was also able at 55 °C to protect SDH from EDTA in the presence of α-crystallin. The effectiveness of SDH as a catalyst of the NADH-dependent reduction of fructose was tested after the thermal treatment of the enzyme. Reaction rates were measured at 37 °C at different substrate concentrations by using 0.01 mg/ml SDH pre-incubated at 55 °C for different times (0–40 min) both in the absence and in the presence of α-crystallin in a ratio of 5:1 (w/w) with respect to the enzyme. No changes in K m values with respect to the untreated SDH for both fructose (200 ± 3 mm) and NADH (0.049 ± 0.001 mm) were observed, either for the thermally stressed enzyme stabilized by α-crystallin (205 ± 4 and 0.046 ± 0.005 mm for fructose and NADH, respectively) or for the enzyme undergoing inactivation in the absence of α-crystallin (200 ± 3 and 0.049 ± 0.001 mmfor fructose and NADH, respectively). Moreover,V max measured for the enzyme previously heated at 55 °C in the presence of α-crystallin (0.068 ± 0.008 μmol/min/mg of protein) was essentially identical to the one measured under the same conditions on the native unstressed enzyme (0.064 ± 0.005 μmol/min/mg of protein). To assess the specificity of action of α-crystallin, we made use of BSA, a thermally stable protein, which shows a completely different structural organization with respect to α-crystallin (25Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone-like activities of BSA and α-crystallin were compared by evaluating their ability to stabilize SDH activity (0.01 mg/ml of enzyme) at protector/target ratios ranging from 0 to 1 (data not shown). The results indicated that at low protector/target protein ratios, α-crystallin was the most effective protective agent. 50% of initial enzyme activity was still detectable after 40 min of incubation at 55 °C at an α-crystallin/SDH ratio of 0.1. To achieve the same protection, a ratio of BSA/SDH of at least 0.4 was required. However, at high protector/target ratios (higher than 0.7), α-crystallin and BSA were equivalent as protective agents, both being able to almost completely preserve SDH activity. When the anti-aggregation action was evaluated, no protection against SDH precipitation at 55 °C was observed when α-crystallin was substituted by an equivalent concentration (mg/ml) of BSA under the conditions adopted in Fig. 1. However, a significant delay before precipitation (approximately 50 min) and a 50% reduction in the maximal extent of protein precipitation were observed when the BSA/SDH ratio was increased from 0.5 to 1.0 (data not shown). After incubation at 55 °C, SDH purified from bovine lens aggregated and α-crystallin, present at a ratio of 2:1 in weight with the enzyme, completely suppressed precipitation phenomena, subsequently keeping the solution transparent for at least two h. A new target protein, SDH, thus confirms the ability of α-crystallin to prevent thermally induced protein aggregation and insolubilization. Moreover, unlike what was observed for other target proteins (10Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), besides being protected from thermal aggregation, SDH activity was completely stabilized by α-crystallin even in terms of enzyme activity. Indeed, at an α-crystallin/SDH ratio of 5:1, a full retention of SDH activity for at least a 40-min incubation at 55 °C was observed (Fig. 2). Because it is a multimeric protein, in which activity is linked to a pyridine cofactor and to a bound metal ion (i.e.Zn2+) acting as a prostetic group, SDH may undergo inactivation by a variety of triggering events, which probably occur through different unfolding"

In cell lines and cancers, inhibition of tissue-specific genes and tumor suppressor genes expression seems to be related to such hypermethylation. The 5’ end of the breast cancer predisposition gene BRCA1 is embedded in a large CpG island of ~2.7 kb in length. In human sporadic breast cancers, the down-regulation of BRCA1 does not seem to be related to BRCA1 gene alterations.

We have therefore investigated the potential role of methyl-CpG binding proteins in the regulation of BRCA1 gene expression. In vitro, partial methylation of constructs containing this region strongly inhibits gene expression in the presence of MeCP2 protein. Moreover, in the five human cell lines analyzed, chemically induced hypomethylation is associated with BRCA1 gene activation.

https://openalex.org/W4252068751,"The role for nerve blood flow (NBF) vs. other factors in motor nerve conduction (MNC) slowing in short-term diabetes was assessed by evaluating alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin on NBF, MNC, as well as metabolic imbalances and oxidative stress in the neural tissue. Control and diabetic rats were treated with or without prazosin (5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) for 3 wk). NBF was measured by hydrogen clearance. Both endoneurial vascular conductance and MNC velocity were decreased in diabetic rats vs. controls, and this decrease was prevented by prazosin. Free NAD(+):NADH ratios in mitochondrial cristae, matrix, and cytosol assessed by metabolite indicator method, as well as phosphocreatine levels and phosphocreatine/creatine ratios, were decreased in diabetic rats, and this reduction was ameliorated by prazosin. Neither diabetes-induced accumulation of two major glycation agents, glucose and fructose, as well as sorbitol and total malondialdehyde plus 4-hydroxyalkenals nor depletion of myo-inositol, GSH, and taurine or decrease in (Na/K)-ATP-ase activity were affected by prazosin. In conclusion, decreased NBF, but not metabolic imbalances or oxidative stress in the neural tissue, is a key mechanism of MNC slowing in short-term diabetes. Further experiments are needed to estimate whether preservation of NBF is sufficient for prevention of nerve dysfunction and morphological abnormalities in long-standing diabetes or whether the aforementioned metabolic imbalances closely associated with impaired neurotropism are of greater importance in advanced than in early diabetic neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W4254464763,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms exert specific intracellular functions, but the different isoforms display little substrate specificity in vitro. Selective PKC isoform targeting may be a mechanism to achieve specificity. We used a green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) to test the hypothesis that local changes in [Ca(2+)](i) regulate translocation of PKCalpha and that different modes of Ca(2+) and Ca(2+) release play a role in PKCalpha targeting. We constructed deletion mutants of PKCalpha to analyze the Ca(2+)-sensitive domains and their role in targeting. Confocal microscopy was used and [Ca(2+)](i) was measured by fluo-3. The fusion protein PKCalpha-GFP was expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and showed a cytosolic distribution similar to the wild-type PKCalpha protein. The Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin induced a speckled cytosolic PKCalpha-GFP distribution, followed by membrane translocation, while depolarization by KCl induced primarily membrane translocation. Selective voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel opening led to a localized accumulation of PKCalpha-GFP near the plasma membrane. Opening Ca(2+) stores with InsP(3), thapsigargin, or ryanodine induced a specific PKCalpha-GFP targeting to distinct intracellular areas. The G-protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin induced a rapid translocation of the fusion protein to focal domains. The tyrosine kinase receptor agonist PDGF induced Ca(2+) influx and led to a linear PKCalpha-GFP membrane association. PKCalpha-GFP deletion mutants demonstrated that the C2 domain, but not the catalytic subunit, is necessary for Ca(2+)-induced PKCalpha targeting. Targeting was also abolished when the ATP binding site was deleted. We conclude that PKCalpha can rapidly be translocated to distinct intracellular or membrane domains by local increases in [Ca(2+)](i). The targeting mechanism is dependent on the C2 and ATP binding site of the enzyme. Localized [Ca(2+)](i) changes determine the spatial and temporal targeting of PKCalpha."

All mutants were normally expressed. Among the 57 mutants (L99C to I155C), nine conserved arginine-, aspartate-, and glycine-replaced ones exhibited greatly reduced tetracycline resistance and almost no transport activity, and five conserved glycine- and proline-replaced mutants exhibited greatly reduced tetracycline transport activity in inverted membrane vesicles despite their high or moderate drug resistance. All other cysteine-scanning mutants retained normal drug resistance and normal tetracycline transport activity except for the L142C and I143C mutants.

The NEM reactivity patterns of the TM4 and TM5 mutants were quite different from each other. TM4 could be divided into two halves, that is, a NEM nonreactive periplasmic half and a periodically reactive cytoplasmic half, indicating that TM4 is tilted toward a water-filled transmembrane channel and that only its cytoplasmic half faces the channel. On the other hand, NEM-reactive mutations were observed periodically (every two residues) along the whole length of TM5. A permeability barrier for a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, was present in the middle of TM5 between Leu-142 and Gly-145, whereas all the NEM-reactive mutants as to TM4 were not accessible to 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, indicating that the channel-facing side of TM4 is located inside the permeability barrier.

Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and its 12-membrane-spanning structure (Fig. 1) was established by site-directed competitive chemical modification of cysteine-replaced mutants of a cysteine-free TetA(B) (5Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We reported that putative transmembrane helices 3 (6Kimura T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are totally embedded in a highly hydrophobic environment because none of the cysteine-scanning mutants as to these transmembrane helices reacted with a maleimide derivative, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), whereas cysteine mutants as to putative loop regions are generally highly reactive with NEM, except for those that are mutants as to a small number of nonreactive positions (9Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar transmembrane segments totally embedded in a hydrophobic interior are known for the erythrocyte anion exchanger (10Tang X.-O. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol.

On the other hand, some transmembrane cysteine mutants of MFS transporters, such as lactose permease (12Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R.

A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), are certainly inactivated by SH reagents, indicating that in these transporters, SH reagents can possibly gain access to some of the residues located in the interior of the transmembrane region. Recently, we found that some cysteine-scanning mutants as to putative transmembrane helix 2 of TetA(B) are reactive with NEM (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NEM-reactive and nonreactive positions were periodically observed in TM2, indicating that one side of the transmembrane helix faces a water-filled transmembrane channel. It is impossible that such a water-filled channel is composed of only one amphiphilic helix. Therefore, at least some other counterparts should be present in the transmembrane region of TetA(B). Considering the amphiphilic nature of the metal-tetracycline chelation complex (1Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the water-filled channel may be at least a part of the substrate translocation pathway. The fact that the NEM-reactive cysteine-scanning mutants as to TM2 were all inactivated by NEM except for P59C, whereas the mutants as to the loop region were generally less affected by NEM, supporting the idea that the NEM-reactive positions in TM2 may face a substrate translocation pathway (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, TM4, TM5, and the flanking loop regions were subjected to cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and chemical modification. The TM4 region shares features with MFS members in that arginine and glycine residues are conserved (Fig. 2), suggesting a common role of this region in the structure and function of MFS transporters. On the other hand, the TM5 region contains a glycine-rich motif,132GXXGXXXGXGXXXGPXXGG150, which is a characteristic sequence conserved in bacterial drug efflux proteins (Fig. 2) (21Varela M.F. Sansom C.E. Griffith J.K. Molecular Membrane Biol. 1995; 12: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Hansen L.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. Hirsh D.C. Antimicrob.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that TM5 possibly plays an important role in the drug recognition or translocation function. In previous topological studies, we found that mutants S92C to Y98C (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and S156C to H158C (7Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were reactive with NEM and thus were located in periplasmic loop 3–4 and loop 5–6, respectively. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the site-directed chemical modification of 57 cysteine-scanning mutants, L99C to I155C. As a result, we found that TM5 also faces a transmembrane water-filled channel, as does TM2, and that the channel has a permeability barrier for hydrophilic compounds in the middle of the membrane, which is necessary to avoid uncoupling. On the other hand, only the cytoplasmic half of TM4 faces the channel; that is, the transmembrane segment is tilted toward the channel. The blocking of NEM binding to the G141C mutant by tetracycline suggested that TM4 comprises a part of the substrate binding site or a site sensitive to a substrate-induced conformational change. N-[Ethyl-1-14C]maleimide (1.5 GBq/mmol) and [3H]tetracycline (3.7 GBq/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other materials were of reagent grade and were obtained from commercial sources. Cysteine-scanning mutants were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which carries the 2.45 kb Tn10 tetA and tetR gene fragments, was used as a template. The I118C mutant was constructed by the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber method (27Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Mizuno T. Ogasahara Y. Nakagawa M. Gene. 1995; 152: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using Mutan®-Super Express Km (Takara-Shuzo Co.,) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pKFB3 (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

Yasojima K. Tsujimura A. Gene. 1995; 167: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was used for the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber method. All of the mutations were detected as the appearance of a newly introduced restriction site and then verified by DNA sequencing. Low copy number mutant plasmids were constructed through exchange of EcoRV-EcoRI fragments of cysteine-scanning mutanttetA(B) genes with the corresponding fragments of low copy number plasmid pLGC377A, which encodes a cysteine-free mutant TetA(B) (8Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and then used for tetA(B) gene expression. Tetracycline resistance was determined by means of a 2-fold agar dilution method as described previously (29Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration. The [14C]NEM binding experiment was performed as described previously (9Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a membrane suspension prepared by brief sonication of Escherichia coli W3104 cells carrying pLGC377A or one of its derivatives was incubated with 0.5 mm [14C]NEM in 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) including 0.1 m KCl for 5 min at 30 °C. The membrane protein was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm unlabeled NEM, and then TetA(B) proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-TetA(B) C-terminal peptide antiserum (30Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 165: 17-19Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Pansorbin Staphylococcus aureus cells (31Philipson L. Anderson P. Olshevsky U. Weinberg R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1978; 13: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The TetA(B) protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for visualization with a BAS-1000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo). Five μl of 100 mm AMS (final concentration, 5 mm) or the same volume of distilled water was added to 100 μl of a suspension of E. coli W3104 cells expressing mutant TetA(B) or a sonicated membrane suspension containing a mutant TetA(B), followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 2 μl of 25 mm [14C]NEM (final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by incubation for 5 min, and then the mixture was diluted with 900 μl of the same buffer containing 5 mm unlabeled NEM. Immediately after the dilution, the cells were collected and washed once with the same buffer. Then, the cells were disrupted by brief sonication, and membranes were collected. The membranes were solubilized, and TetA(B) proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. The radioactive band densities on pretreatment with AMS were compared with those without AMS treatment. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli W3104 cells carrying pLGC377A or one of its derivatives, and tetracycline transport assay was performed as described previously (1Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the 57 cysteine-scanning mutants, mutants L99C to L103C (32Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), D120C (5Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and R127C (32Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were constructed previously. The other 50 cysteine-scanning mutants were constructed in this study. First of all, the tetracycline resistance levels of these mutants were measured by means of a 2-fold agar dilution method (29Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). As shown in Table I, the MIC values of E. coli W3104 cells carrying pLGT2 encoding wild-type TetA(B) and the host cells without the plasmid were 200 and 1.6 μg/ml, respectively. Out of the 57 cysteine-scanning mutants, R101C, D120C, R127C, G135C, G139C, and G141C completely lost the drug resistance (MIC, 1.6 μg/ml). The possible roles of Arg-101 and Asp-120 in the tetracycline transport function were reported previously (32Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Someya Y. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

The G145C and P146C mutants exhibited moderate resistance (25 and 50 μg/ml, respectively). The other 44 mutants retained the wild-type resistance level (100 or 200 μg/ml). Although Gly-100, Gly-108, and Gly-149 are conserved in MFS transporters and/or bacterial drug exporters (Fig. 2), their mutation did not affect the drug resistance.Table IThe tetracycline resistance levels of E. coli W3104 cells harboring the plasmid encoding each cysteine-scanning mutant TetA(B)MutantMICMutantMICMutantMICMutantMICμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlHost1.6T110C200Q126C200L142C200pLGT2200G111C6.3R127C1.6I143C6.3M96C100A112C200V128C200A144C200L97C200V113C200K129C200G145C25Y98C100A114C200W130C200P146C50L99C200A115C200F131C100I147C200G100C200S116C100G132C12.5I148C200R101C1.6V117C400W133C200G149C200L102C200I118C200L134C200G150C3.1L103C200A119C200G135C1.6F151C200S104C200D120C1.6A136C200A152C200G105C6.3T121C200S137C200G153C200I106C200T122C200F138C200E154C200T107C100S123C200G139C1.6I155C200G108C200A124C200L140C200A109C200S125C200G141C1.6The resistance levels are expressed as the MICs of tetracycline determined by the 2-fold agar dilution method (29Yamaguchi A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetracycline transport activity was measured in inverted membrane vesicles as proton motive force-driven uptake. As shown in Fig.3, four resistanceless mutants, R127C, G135C, G139C, and G141C, had completely lost the tetracycline transport activity. As for the other two resistanceless mutants, R101C and D120C, R101C showed no transport activity (32Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the apparently contradictory behavior of the D120C mutant was discussed in detail previously (33Someya Y. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 210-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With respect to the five low resistance mutants, four of them, G105C, G111C, G132C, and G150C, exhibited very low transport activity, consistent with their resistance level, whereas the I143C mutant retained moderate transport activity, i.e. about 40% of the wild-type level. On the other hand, the G145C and P146C mutants exhibited no transport activity despite their moderate drug resistance. In addition, the G100C, L142C, and G149C mutants showed greatly reduced transport activity despite their wild-type level drug resistance (200 μg/ml). These high or moderate resistance mutants with low transport activity seem to be unstable and partially denatured during the preparation of membrane vesicles, except for the L142C mutant, which is a low affinity and high V max-type mutant (data not shown). In brief, all of the conserved glycine and proline residues are functionally or structurally important except for Gly-108. In addition to conserved glycine, proline, and charged residues, Leu-142 and Ile-143 participate in the function and/or maintenance of the structure of TetA(B). A maleimide derivative reacts with a deprotonated form of a sulfhydryl group, and this reaction requires a water molecule as a proton acceptor (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); thus, the degree of NEM binding will depend on the presence of a water molecule. Therefore, a region embedded in a hydrophobic environment can be distinguished on the basis of the NEM reactivity of a cysteine mutant (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A.

Fig. 4 A shows the amounts of mutant proteins (Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, upper rows) and [14C]NEM binding (autoradiography,lower rows). Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of immunoprecipitated mutant TetA(B) proteins indicated that there were no significant differences in the amounts of mutant proteins expressed in E. coli cells. On the other hand, there were clear differences in the levels of binding of NEM to these mutants. All of the NEM nonreactive mutations were distributed between Leu-99 and Ile-118 and between Ala-136 and Ala-152. As for the intervening 17 amino acid residues, Ala-119 to Gly-135, all mutants exhibited high or moderate NEM reactivity more than 50% that of the S123C mutant (Fig.4 B). We previously reported that Cys mutants S92C to Y98C were all reactive with NEM (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be concluded that the former 20 residues, Leu-99 to Ile-118, and the latter 17 residues, Ala-136 to Ala-152, comprise TM4 and TM5, respectively. In the former 20-amino acid transmembrane region, Cys mutants as to the first 10 residues, Leu-99 to Gly-108, were all NEM nonreactive or low reactive. As shown in Fig. 4 B, most of the Cys mutants as to the first 10-amino acid region showed 10% or less reactivity with NEM compared with the S123C mutant. The reason why the S123C mutant was chosen as a control was that NEM reactivity of the mutant was about the average value among the NEM reactive mutants as to the hydrophilic loop region. Only two mutants, S104C and G108C, exhibited low reactivity,i.e. around 25–30%. Thus, the first half of TM4 seems to be totally embedded in the hydrophobic environment. On the other hand, as to the latter 10 amino acid residues of TM4, five Cys mutants, A109C, G111C, A112C, A115C, and S116C, exhibited more than 50% of the NEM reactivity of S123C. These high reactive mutations appeared periodically, and they are located on the same side of the α-helical projection of TM4 (Fig. 5), indicating that the latter half of TM4 faces a water-filled cavity or channel. This labeling pattern with NEM was different from the pattern in the case of TM2 (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and indicates that TM4 is tilted away from the water-filled channel if it crosses through the membrane. This conclusion is contradicted by the facts that three mutants, R101C, G105C, and G111C, were inactive and an additional one, G100C, lost the transport activity during the membrane preparation. However, it should be noted that there was no relationship between NEM reactivity and their residual activity, i.e. R101C and G105C were nonreactive, whereas G111C was highly reactive with NEM. Thus, it is not likely that the totally nonreactive nature of the first half of TM4 is due to the conformational change caused by a mutation of a structurally essential residue. The NEM binding pattern of the TM5 region was different from that of the TM4 region. Between Ala-136 and Ala-152, Cys mutations highly reactive with NEM (more than 50% of the S123C level) appeared almost every two residues (Fig. 4 B). The other mutants showed very low reactivity, i.e. less than 15% of the S123C level, except for Ala-136, of which the reactivity was about 40%. The high reactive mutations were also located on one side of the α-helical wheel projection of TM5 (Fig. 5), indicating that TM5 faces a water-filled channel along its whole length. The 17-amino acid length is shorter than that required for a polypeptide chain to cross the membrane as an α-helical form. Because the NEM reactivities of W133C and G132C (50–60%) were somewhat lower than those of their flanking mutants, the TM5 helix may extend to Gly-132. As to TM5, some of the NEM-reactive mutants lost the drug resistance (G139C, G141C, and G150C), or lost the transport activity (G145C and P146C). However, because the other NEM-reactive mutants, A136C, F138C, and G149C, showed wild-type drug resistance and retained the transport activity, the high NEM reactivity of TM5 mutants was not likely to be due to mutational denaturation. The results of an NEM binding experiment on cysteine-scanning mutants as to TM5 as well as TM2 strongly indicated the presence of a water-filled transmembrane channel. However, if such a channel crosses the membrane, water molecules with protons would freely permeate through the channel, and as a result, the membrane would be unfavorably uncoupled. A neck or permeability barrier for solute molecules must be present in the water-filled channel to avoid uncoupling. In order to detect such a permeability barrier, we investigated the accessibility of a membrane-impermeable maleimide derivative, AMS (34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), to NEM-reactive cysteine residues in the transmembrane region, as determined from the blocking of [14C]NEM binding with AMS. Fig. 6 shows the effect of AMS pretreatment of intact cells and sonicated membranes on the NEM binding to NEM-reactive Cys mutants as to TM4 (Fig. 6 A) and TM5 (Fig. 6 B). As to TM4, NEM binding was not affected by AMS in intact cells, whereas the NEM binding was almost completely blocked by AMS in sonicated membranes (Fig. 6 A), indicating that the NEM-reactive positions in TM4 were located inside the permeability barrier. Among the mutants, the A109C one was not reactive with NEM in intact cells despite its high reactivity in sonicated membranes. As to TM5, NEM binding to the NEM-reactive mutants as to downstream from P146C was completely blocked and the binding to the G145C mutant was largely prevented by AMS in intact cells, whereas mutants as to upstream from L142C were not affected by AMS, except for the G141C one. These results indicated that the permeability barrier for AMS is present between Leu-142 and Gly-145. Although the G145C, P146C, and G150C mutations are located in the putative transmembrane region, AMS molecules had access to cysteine residues at these positions. Thus, AMS molecules can penetrate to the middle of the transmembrane water-filled channel. On the other hand, with respect to sonicated membranes, the NEM binding of all the NEM-reactive Cys mutants as to TM5 was significantly prevented by AMS, indicating that the water-filled channel is accessible from both sides of the membrane and the thickness of the permeability barrier is within one turn of the α-helix. The prevention of the NEM binding to some of Cys mutants, G141C, L142C, G145C, P146C, G149C, and G150C, by AMS was not complete even in sonicated membranes (Fig. 6 B). We previously found in the case of the S65C and L97C mutants (5Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that a small portion of sonicated membranes was sealed, and thus, AMS did not completely prevent the NEM binding to these mutants in sonicated membranes despite their locations in hydrophilic loop regions. Although it is not clear why the degree of the sealing of sonicated membranes depends on the mutations, the incompleteness of the AMS prevention of the NEM binding in sonicated membranes seems to be due to the presence of sealed vesicles. However, considering the fact that the mutations exhibiting incomplete accessibility of AMS in sonicated membranes are mainly located in the middle of TM5, the possibility that the small structural distortion during membrane preparation may affect the accessibility of AMS cannot be excluded. The reason why the G141C and A109C mutants were inert as to NEM in intact cells despite their high reactivity in sonicated membranes is not clear. Because the A109C mutant exhibited normal drug resistance and transport activity in inverted vesicles whereas the G141C mutant was inactive, the alteration in the NEM reactivity was not due to denaturation during preparation of the membranes. It should be noted that Ala-109 and Gly-141 are both located close to the permeability barrier in TM4 and TM5, respectively. The small structural distortion near the barrier during membrane preparation may increase the accessibility of NEM without affecting the transport activity. We previously observed tetracycline-induced acceleration and inhibition of NEM binding to hot spot Cys mutants as to a conformationally sensitive loop region (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Kimura T. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If the water-filled channel is a substrate translocation pathway, the NEM binding to Cys mutants facing the channel may be affected by tetracycline. Fig.7 shows the NEM binding in sonicated membranes in the presence or absence of 1 mm tetracycline. As to TM4, no mutants were significantly affected by tetracycline. In contrast, among the Cys mutants as to TM5, only the binding to the G141C mutant was specifically blocked by tetracycline; the binding to the other Cys mutants was not prevented at all. Gly-141 is the residue close to the permeability barrier. Similar prevention of the NEM binding by tetracycline was observed in the case of the A51C mutant (data not shown); 2N. Tamura, S. Iwaki, T. Kimura-Someya, N. Nada, and A. Yamaguchi, manuscript in preparation. this mutated residue is also very close to the permeability barrier in TM2. Therefore, it is possible that the tetracycline binding around the permeability barrier prevents the NEM binding to the G141C and A51C mutants. This conclusion suffers from the fact that the G141C mutant is inactive; however, the A51C mutant exhibited the normal activity. Thus, it seems that the prevention is not due to the artifact in the inactive G141C mutant but rather reflects the substrate binding. Of course, there is an another possibility that the prevention is caused by a remote conformational effect by a substrate binding at a distant site. The effect of 2 mm NEM preincubation on the tetracycline transport activity of inverted membrane vesicles was measured (Fig.8). As reported previously, most NEM-reactive Cys mutants as to the transmembrane region of TM2 were inactivated by NEM, whereas only a few hot spot mutants as to the loop regions were sensitive to NEM (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As to TM4, almost all of the NEM-reactive mutants as to the transmembrane region were severely inactivated more than 70% by NEM, the exception being the G108C mutant, which was moderately inactivated, i.e. about 35%. In contrast, as to the loop 4–5 region, most of the mutants were not affected or only moderately inactivated by NEM, the exceptions being the A119C and V128C mutants, which were hot spot mutants inactivated more than 90% by NEM. These properties of Cys mutants were similar to in the case of TM2 and its flanking loops (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It seems that the cytoplasmic half of TM4 comprises a part of the wall of the substrate translocation pathway and that chemical modification at these positions sterically prevents the substrate translocation even if the residues themselves are not essential for the function. With respect to TM5, it is difficult to make a general rule for the NEM effect on the transport activity because most of the NEM-reactive positions in TM5 are critical for the transport function and the Cys mutants lost the transport activity. Only four NEM-reactive mutants, A136C, F138C, L142C, and G149C, retained significant tetracycline transport activity (Fig. 3). Among them, the G149C mutant was almost completely inactivated, and the activity of A136C was greatly reduced by NEM, whereas the L142C mutant was rather stimulated by NEM,i.e. about 3-fold, and the F138C mutant was not affected at all. Because the activity of the L142C mutant was one-third that of the wild-type, the level of activity of NEM-modified L142C was the same as that of the wild-type. Leu-142 is the residue just before the barrier. The volume and shape of the side chain at this position may be deeply related to the transport function through the local conformation, and a maleimidyl side chain may be better than a sulfhydryl side chain for the local conformation. In this study, we observed two different NEM binding patterns for the transmembrane regions of TetA(B). TM5 faces a water-filled channel along its whole length, as does TM2, whereas only the cytoplasmic half of TM4 faces the channel. This is a new pattern indicating that TM4 is tilted away from a water-filled transmembrane channel. In addition, the reason that the transmembrane water-filled channel does not cause uncoupling was determined in this study. The channel has a permeability barrier for hydrophilic molecules in the middle, which helps avoid uncoupling. Finally, we showed that only NEM binding at position 141 was prevented by tetracycline; however, it is not clear whether this position is a substrate binding site or only a site sensitive to a substrate-induced conformational change. On the basis of these results, we present the detailed topology around TM4 and TM5 with the intervening loop region (Fig. 9). On comparison with the transmembrane regions estimated on hydropathy analysis (5Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Eckert B. Beck C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11663-11670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TM4 determined through the NEM binding experiment (Leu-99 to Ileu-118) (Fig. 9) was in good agreement with the estimate (Leu-99 to Ala-119) (Fig. 1), whereas TM5 determined through the experiment (Ala-136 to Ala-152) was greatly different from the estimate (Trp-130 to Ala-152). The experimentally determined TM5 region only comprises 17 amino acid residues, which seems shorter than the number required for crossing of the membrane as an α-helix. Loop 5–6 comprises only six residues (Fig. 1), and the region of TM6 is known because it is a transmembrane segment entirely not reactive with NEM (7Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the region of TM5 may be expanded upstream to Gly-132. The degree of NEM binding to the W133C and G132C mutants was between 50 and 60%, which was lower than in the case of the flanking mutants, and the periodical appearance of NEM low reactive mutations every two residues in TM5 was maintained until the G132C mutant. Therefore, at the cytoplasmic end of TM5, a water-filled channel may widen like a funnel, and the end of TM5 is exposed to the aqueous phase. Despite its drastically reduced transport activity, the L142C mutant retained full resistance, probably due to the highV max value with high drug concentrations. Interestingly, the transport activity of the L142C mutant was significantly (about 3.3-fold) increased when it was modified with NEM (Fig. 8). This phenomenon is similar to in the case of the P59C mutant as to TM2 (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is stimulated about 2.1-fold by NEM. This may be due to the requirement of a hydrophobic bulky side-chain at position 142 in order to maintain the high affinity conformation of TetA(B). In contrast, the I143C mutant exhibited drastically reduced drug resistance (6.3 μg/ml), whereas it retained moderate transport activity (about one-third of the wild-type level), probably reflecting the low V max value. In any case, there are no functionally essential residues in TM5 except for the conserved glycines and prolines. Therefore, the permeability barrier and the substrate binding site or substrate-induced conformationally sensitive site in TM5 may be formed through a specific conformation of the glycine- and proline-rich polypeptide chain. Glycine residues in the transmembrane region are oriented toward helix-helix interfaces and exhibit a high occurrence at helix crossing points (37Javadpour M.M. Eilers M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1609-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This suggests that transmembrane glycine residues in TM5 comprise a critical structure functioning as a permeability barrier and a substrate binding site through helix-helix interaction with other transmembrane helices. The glycine-rich sequence and the importance of glycine residues are common to TM4, confirming the critical role of glycine residues in the TM4 and TM5 regions. Analysis of cysteine-scanning mutants of putative TM5 of 12-membrane-spanning MFS transporters has been extensively performed for lactose permease (15Weitzman C. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9374-9379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that TM5 of lactose permease does not contain functionally essential residues except for glycines (15Weitzman C. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9374-9379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Menezes M.E. Roepe P.D. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Jung K. Jung H. Colacurcio P. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of TM5 of lactose permease, only three Cys mutants, in which the mutations are located on one side of the helix, were inactivated by NEM (15Weitzman C. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9374-9379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The authors of that study did not determine whether other mutants were accessible to NEM or not. In our experiment, it was revealed that some NEM-reactive mutants as to TM5 of TetA(B), such as F138C and L142C, were not inactivated or were, on the contrary, stimulated by NEM. Therefore, the accessibility of NEM to Cys residues and the inactivation by NEM should be independently determined through a topological study on polytopic membrane proteins. On the other hand, TM4 contains the functionally essential residue Arg-101, which is conserved in MFS transporters (Fig. 2) and is the unique charged residue in TM4 (32Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Arg-101 is located on the putative channel-facing side of the helix, although it exists in the N-terminal hydrophobic half of TM4. A conformational change during the transport process may expose this residue to the substrate translocation pathway. Another possibility is that it plays some role in the proton translocation or energy coupling in combination with Asp-84 and Asp-285, which are negatively charged residues located in TM3 and TM9, respectively. TM3 and TM9 are the transmembrane segments entirely embedded in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is interesting that Arg-101 may coordinate with these functionally essential aspartic acid residues in the transport function, whereas it seems not likely that Arg-101 forms a charge-neutralizing pair with one of these transmembrane aspartic acid residues (32Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The current study revealed that the chemical modification of cysteine-scanning mutants is very useful for determining the detailed topology of membrane transporters."

Selective PKC isoform targeting may be a mechanism to achieve specificity. We used a green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) to test the hypothesis that local changes in [Ca2+]i regulate translocation of PKCα and that different modes of Ca2+ and Ca2+ release play a role in PKCα targeting. We constructed deletion mutants of PKCα to analyze the Ca2+-sensitive domains and their role in targeting. Confocal microscopy was used and [Ca2+]i was measured by fluo-3. The fusion protein PKCα-GFP was expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and showed a cytosolic distribution similar to the wildtype PKCα protein. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin induced a speckled cytosolic PKCα-GFP distribution, followed by membrane translocation, while depolarization by KCl induced primarily membrane translocation. Selective voltage-operated Ca2+ channel opening led to a localized accumulation of PKCα-GFP near the plasma membrane. Opening Ca2+ stores with InsP3, thapsigargin, or ryanodine induced a specific PKCα-GFP targeting to distinct intracellular areas. The G-protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin induced a rapid translocation of the fusion protein to focal domains. The tyrosine kinase receptor agonist PDGF induced Ca2+ influx and led to a linear PKCα-GFP membrane association. PKCα-GFP deletion mutants demonstrated that the C2 domain, but not the catalytic subunit, is necessary for Ca2+-induced PKCα targeting. Targeting was also abolished when the ATP binding site was deleted. We conclude that PKCα can rapidly be translocated to distinct intracellular or membrane domains by local increases in [Ca2+]i. The targeting mechanism is dependent on the C2 and ATP binding site of the enzyme. Localized [Ca2+]i changes determine the spatial and temporal targeting of PKCα.–Maasch, C., Wagner, S., Lindschau, C., Alexander, G., Buchner, K., Gollasch, M., Luft, F. C., Haller, H.

https://openalex.org/W2064757162,"p64 is a chloride channel of intracellular membranes which is present in regulated secretory vesicles. Mechanisms by which the p64 channel could be regulated are largely unknown. p59 fyn is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family that has been implicated in a variety of intracellular signaling events. The N-terminal portion of p64 has several potential binding sites for Src family SH2 domains. In this paper, we demonstrate that p64 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated when co-expressed with p59 fyn in HeLa cells. We show that co-expression of p64 with p59 fyn renders p64 a ligand for the SH2 domain of p59 fyn and this SH2 binding is eliminated by treating p64 with alkaline phosphatase. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we find that tyrosine 33 in the p64 sequence is necessary for SH2 binding. We also characterized p64-p59 fyn interactions using native material from bovine kidney. We found that a small fraction of native kidney p64 can bind Fyn SH2 in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of p64 from solubilized kidney membranes yields a kinase activity with the same mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as authentic bovine p59 fyn . Finally, we demonstrate that co-expression of p64 and p59 fyn in HeLa cells results in enhanced p64-associated chloride channel activity. p64 is a chloride channel of intracellular membranes which is present in regulated secretory vesicles. Mechanisms by which the p64 channel could be regulated are largely unknown. p59 fyn is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family that has been implicated in a variety of intracellular signaling events. The N-terminal portion of p64 has several potential binding sites for Src family SH2 domains. In this paper, we demonstrate that p64 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated when co-expressed with p59 fyn in HeLa cells. We show that co-expression of p64 with p59 fyn renders p64 a ligand for the SH2 domain of p59 fyn and this SH2 binding is eliminated by treating p64 with alkaline phosphatase. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we find that tyrosine 33 in the p64 sequence is necessary for SH2 binding. We also characterized p64-p59 fyn interactions using native material from bovine kidney. We found that a small fraction of native kidney p64 can bind Fyn SH2 in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of p64 from solubilized kidney membranes yields a kinase activity with the same mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as authentic bovine p59 fyn . Finally, we demonstrate that co-expression of p64 and p59 fyn in HeLa cells results in enhanced p64-associated chloride channel activity. glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Src homology domain 2 p64 is a chloride channel protein originally discovered by purification of chloride channel activity from bovine kidney microsomes (1Landry D.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p64 was found to be a 428-amino acid protein consisting of a hydrophilic N-terminal domain comprising about half the protein and a C-terminal domain containing two hydrophobic stretches. Expression of p64 in HeLa cells results in increased chloride permeability of membranes isolated from these cells and in the appearance of a novel chloride channel as detected in a planar lipid bilayer (3Edwards J.C. Tulk B. Schlesinger P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). p64 is normally expressed at high levels in intracellular vesicles of renal proximal tubule cells (4Redhead C.R. Sullivan S.K. Kosecki C. Fujiwara K. Edwards J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, p64 is expressed in the limiting membranes of intracellular dense core vesicles which redistribute to the periphery in response to phorbol ester and calcium ionophore but not forskolin. Thus, p64 is a candidate for the chloride channel activity known to be present in certain regulated secretory vesicles. The contents of the p64-associated regulated secretory vesicles are not known. P64 has subsequently been discovered to be a member of a family of related proteins which to date includes 7 members (5Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R.

Each of the CLIC family members shows high homology to the C-terminal half of p64 containing the hydrophobic domains. In contrast, none of the other CLIC family members have a region with significant homology to the long hydrophilic N-terminal domain of p64. The channel activity of CLIC family proteins must reside in the portion of the molecule which is shared among the CLIC family members, i.e. the C-terminal half. The non-conserved N-terminal domain of p64 may confer some specific regulation or targeting to the channel forming C-terminal domain (2Landry D.W. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A.

Cell. 1997; 8: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of p64 in fact contains sequences which are candidates for sites of protein-protein interaction. Within this domain lies a multiply repeated, acidic, proline-rich motif which contains the core PXXP consensus for binding to SH3 domains (14Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W.

Deletion of this motif was shown to have a dramatic effect on the subcellular distribution of p64 (4Redhead C.R. Sullivan S.K. Kosecki C. Fujiwara K. Edwards J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A binding partner for this region has not yet been identified. In addition, within the N-terminal domain of p64 are a number of tyrosine residues which lie within consensus sequences for binding by various families of SH2 domains (17Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chauudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

In this paper, we show that co-expression of p64 and p59 fyn in HeLa cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of p64 and that tyrosine-phosphorylated p64 is a ligand for the SH2 domain of Fyn. We demonstrate that tyrosine 33 in the p64 sequence is necessary for binding to the SH2 domain of Fyn. We go on to demonstrate that native bovine kidney p64 is a ligand for the SH2 domain of Fyn and that immunoprecipitation of p64 from solubilized bovine kidney membranes brings down a tyrosine kinase activity indistinguishable from Fyn. Finally, we demonstrate that co-expression of Fyn with p64 in HeLa cells leads to increased chloride channel activity compared with expression of p64 alone. Plasmid pNHΔP encoding p64 downstream of a T7 promoter has been previously described (1Landry D.W. Akabas M.H. Redhead C.R. Edelman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Al-Awqati Q.

Protein assays were performed with the BCA kit from Pierce Biochemical, Rockford IL. Fresh bovine kidney from a slaughterhouse was chilled on ice. Two grams of cortical slices were minced and suspended in 20 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmNaVO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0. The suspension was homogenized with 20 strokes in a glass tissue grinder, then 20 strokes in a Teflon Dounce homogenizer on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in an SS34 rotor. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in the same rotor. The supernatant again was collected and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman Ti70.1 rotor. The pellet was solubilized in 5 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 0.l mm NaVO4, 1.0% Triton X-100, pH 8.0. After mixing for 10 min at 4 °C, the solution was again centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as solubilized bovine kidney membrane protein. p64 and Fyn were expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia-T7 system as described previously (3Edwards J.C. Tulk B. Schlesinger P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Fuerst T.T. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Cultures on 3.5-cm dishes were transfected with a 3.75 μg of pNHΔP and 1.25 μg of pBS-Fyn. For those samples which did not receive both Fyn and p64 encoding plasmids, the missing DNA was replaced with the parent plasmid, pBluescript SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After transfection, cultures were incubated for 10 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cell lysates were prepared by solubilizing a culture in 500 μl of 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmNaVO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0 (solubilization buffer). GST, GST-Fyn SH3 fusion protein, and GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein were purified from bacteria as described (27Gauen L.T. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were immobilized on Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad) using methods recommended by the manufacturer. Five hundred micrograms of solubilized bovine kidney membrane protein or 200 μl of solubilized HeLa cell protein were mixed with 20 μl of a 50% suspension of beads carrying the appropriate fusion protein in a total volume of 750 μl of solubilization buffer. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing. Beads were then collected by centrifugation. Unbound proteins were removed by 4 washes at 4 °C in 750 μl of solubilization buffer. Samples from HeLa cells were then suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples from bovine kidney were subjected to a further wash with 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm vanadate, followed by a wash with 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm vanadate, before suspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with AP95 antibody specific for p64 (2Landry D.W. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M.

Cell. 1997; 8: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and detected on x-ray film using the SuperSignal system (Pierce Biochemical). For the alkaline phosphatase experiment, cells from a 3.5-cm dish were lysed by homogenization in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2. The sample was divided into two 250-ml aliquots. Fifteen units of alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI) were added to one of the samples and both samples incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Two-hundred fifty microliters of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to each and SH2 binding assessed as above. Two-hundred fifty micrograms of solubilized bovine kidney protein were brought to 500 μl volume with solubilization buffer. Five microliters of non-immune rabbit serum and 40 μl of 50% suspension of protein A-agarose beads were added and the sample mixed at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were removed by centrifugation. Two and one-half microliters of pre-immune rabbit serum, rabbit serum raised against p64 (2Landry D.W. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or rabbit serum raised against p59 fyn (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were added and the samples mixed at 4 °C overnight. Twenty microliters of protein A-agarose bead suspension were added, the samples incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and the beads then collected by centrifugation and washed with four 10-min exchanges of solubilization buffer. After the last wash, the supernatant was removed as completely as possible and the beads were suspended in 10 μl of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.1 mmNaVO4. One microliter of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mm, 10 mCi/ml) was added and the mixture incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Fifteen microliters of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer were added, the samples separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Mutants were generated in the p64 coding region of plasmid NHΔP using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with mutagenic primer oligonucleotides. For each mutant, a pair of overlapping sense and antisense primers were obtained which introduced the desired mutation along with a new unique restriction endonuclease site. The sense mutagenic primer was paired with an antisense primer from downstream of the end of the p64 coding region, the mutagenic antisense primer was paired with a sense primer from upstream the coding region, and PCR was carried out by standard methods. The resulting PCR products were cloned in the PCRII cloning vector (InVitrogen) and sequences determined. The separate clones encoding the two halves of the molecule were then put together using the novel restriction site generated by the mutagenic oligonucleotides. CsCl-purified plasmid DNA was used for the HeLa-vaccinia expression experiments. HeLa cells were infected/transfected as described above except the cultures were scaled up to 6-cm dishes. Ten hours after transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and then scraped into ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer for 30 strokes on ice, centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant collected and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 250 μl of the homogenization solution supplemented with 1.4% N-octylglucoside and the concentration of protein determined. One hundred micrograms of solubilized protein in 0.9 ml of 1.4% N-octylglucoside were added to 0.1 ml of 100 mg/ml asolectin, 90 mg/ml n-octylglucoside and then dialyzed against 200 mm KCl, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 36 h with three exchanges. Resulting vesicles were passed 15 times through a 200-nm pore membrane to yield a homogeneous population of unilamellar vesicles. For the alkaline phosphatase experiment, infected/transfected cells from two 6-cm culture dishes were homogenized in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Homogenates were divided into two 1-ml fractions. One fraction received 30 units of alkaline phosphatase, one fraction received EDTA (2 mm final) and NaVO4(0.1 mm final). Both were incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to isolation of membranes by centrifugation as described in the preceding paragraph. The chloride efflux assay was performed as described previously (3Edwards J.C. Tulk B. Schlesinger P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, 200 μl of vesicles were passed through a Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad) spin column that had been equilibrated with 400 mm sucrose. The effluent from the column was added to 2 ml of 400 mmsucrose and the extravesicular chloride concentration was continuously monitored with a chloride selective electrode. Valinomycin was added to 1 μm final concentration to initiate voltage-dependent chloride efflux. Triton X-100 was then added to 0.1% final concentration to release any remaining intravesicular chloride. The initial rate of fractional chloride release after addition of valinomycin is taken as the chloride permeability of the reconstituted vesicles. Efflux rates pooled from several independent expression-reconstitution experiments for each group are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were analyzed using analysis of variance (31Armitage P. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1971: 189-207Google Scholar). We initially looked for p64-Fyn interactions in a cell culture expression system. p64 and p59 fyn were expressed separately or together in HeLa cells using a vaccinia T7-driven system as we have previously reported for the functional expression of p64 (3Edwards J.C. Tulk B. Schlesinger P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using this expression system, we determined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p64 when expressed alone or with p59 fyn . Cells expressing p64 or p64 plus p59 fyn were solubilized in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1 A). There were no major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells expressing p64 alone. In cells expressing both p64 and p59 fyn , two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are apparent: one the size of p59 fyn and one the size of p64 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2). To determine whether the larger tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is indeed p64, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p64 antisera and probed with phosphotyrosine antibodies or with antibodies directed at p64. The upper tyrosine-phosphorylated band is precipitated with anti-p64 antisera and this band co-migrates with p64 itself (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–8). Thus, we conclude that co-expression of p64 with p59 fyn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p64. We determined whether p64 is a ligand for the SH2 or SH3 domains of Fyn, either when expressed in the absence or presence of p59 fyn . p64 was expressed in HeLa cells either alone or with p59 fyn . Cells were solubilized and proteins allowed to bind to immobilized GST (control), GST-Fyn SH3 fusion protein, or GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein. Bound proteins were separated, blotted, and probed with p64 antibodies (Fig. 1 B). When p64 is expressed in the absence of p59 fyn , it does not bind to either SH2 or SH3 domains of Fyn. However, when co-expressed with p59 fyn , p64 binds to GST-Fyn SH2 but not GST-Fyn SH3. Typical SH2 binding requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2 ligand (17Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chauudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

To determine whether phosphorylation state effects the ability of p64 to bind to Fyn-SH2 domain, p59 fyn and p64 were coexpressed in HeLa cells and lysates prepared. Lysates were either treated with alkaline phosphatase or kept as control prior to exposure to immobilized Fyn-SH2. Bound proteins were separated and probed as before (Fig. 1 C). Phosphatase pretreatment of the solubilized membranes from cells co-expressing p64 and p59 fyn eliminates the SH2 binding by p64. Taken together, these experiments indicate that 1) co-expression of p64 with p59 fyn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p64, and 2) tyrosine phosphorylation of p64 renders it a ligand for the SH2 domain of Fyn. There are a number of tyrosines within the p64 sequence which could serve as sites for phosphorylation and SH2 binding. A consensus for SH2 binding to Src family tyrosine kinases has been described. This consensus sequence is comprised of a phosphorylated tyrosine plus the 3 amino acids immediately C-terminal to it, the consensus sequence being Tyr(Glu, Asp, or Thr)(Glu, Asn, or Asp)(Ile, Val, Met, or Leu) (17Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chauudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Within the N-terminal half of p64, tyrosines at positions 20 (Tyr-Glu-Asp-Ser), 33 (Tyr-Asp-Glu-Val), and 56 (Tyr-Asp-Ser-Val) all show some similarity to this consensus, tyrosine 33 fitting most closely. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the codons for each of these tyrosines was changed to encode alanine in separate constructs, named p64(Y20A), p64(Y33A), and p64(Y56A), respectively. The resulting mutants were co-expressed with p59 fyn in HeLa cells and Fyn-SH2 binding was assessed (Fig. 2). We found that mutation of tyrosine 33 eliminates binding of p64 to Fyn-SH2 while mutation of tyrosines 20 and 56 have no effect on SH2 binding. Proteins from cells expressing either p64 or the p64(Y33A) mutant with or without co-expression of p59 fyn were assessed for expression of p64 and p59 fyn , for SH2 binding by p64, and for tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). In each panel of Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2 are from cells not expressing p64, lanes 3–5 are from cells expressing wild type p64, and lanes 6 and 7 are from cells expressing p64(Y33A). Lanes 1, 3, and 6 are from cells without exogenous p59 fyn , lanes 2, 4, and7 are from cells expressing normal p59 fyn , andlane 5 is from cells expressing a kinase-defective mutant of p59 fyn (28Wang L.L. Richard S. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2010-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Total protein probed for p64 (panel A) and p59 fyn (panel B) demonstrate the expected patterns of expression. In panel C, solubilized protein which bound to immobilized GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein were separated, blotted, and probed for p64. As expected, only wild type p64 expressed with active p59 fyn shows SH2 binding (lane 4).Panel D shows total proteins from each set of cells probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In these experiments, a low level of an endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was detectable in the 60,000 dalton range in cells which were not expressing exogenous p59 fyn . In cells expressing active p59 fyn , an abundant tyrosine-phosphorylated band corresponding to p59 fyn is present (lanes 2, 4, and 7). There is no increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells expressing the kinase-defective p59 fyn (lane 5). As in Fig. 1, a band corresponding to p64 is tyrosine phosphorylated when p64 and active p59 fyn are expressed together (lane 4). The p64 band is also apparent in cells expressing p64(Y33A) and p59 fyn (lane 7). Thus, although tyrosine 33 is essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation leading to Fyn SH2 binding by p64, other tyrosines within the p64 sequence become phosphorylated as well and phosphorylation of those sites was not prevented by mutation of tyrosine 33. The experiments using p64 and p59 fyn overexpressed in HeLa cells show that the interactions between p59 fyn and p64 are possible. To determine whether these interactions are relevant to the normal function of p64, we looked for evidence for p64- p59 fyn interactions using native material from bovine kidney. Bovine kidney membranes were solubilized in Triton X-100 in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and solubilized protein was allowed to bind to immobilized GST (control) or GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein. After extensive washing, protein was eluted from the beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with antibodies to p64 (Fig.4 A). We found a fraction of the total p64 in solubilized bovine kidney membranes binds to immobilized SH2 domain of Fyn. To determine whether p64 may be stably associated with p59 fyn in vivo, solubilized bovine kidney membranes were subjected to an immunoprecipitation-in vitro kinase assay as shown in Fig. 4 B. Solubilized bovine kidney membranes were immunoprecipitated with anti-p64 antisera (lane 1), non-immune sera (lane 2), or anti-Fyn antisera (lane 3). The immune complexes were collected on protein A beads, washed, and allowed to self-phosphorylate with [γ-32P]ATP. The proteins were then solubilized, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Within such immunoprecipitates, p59 fyn and other Src family tryosine kinases can phosphorylate themselves (32Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2117816631,"+1 Frame-shifted proteins such as amyloid precursor protein+1 and ubiquitin-B+1 have been identified in the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. These frameshifts are caused by dinucleotide deletions in GAGAG motifs of messenger RNA encoded by genes that have maintained the unchanged wild-type DNA sequence. This process is termed ‘molecular misreading’. A key question is whether this process is confined to neurons or whether it could also occur in non-neuronal cells. A transgenic mouse line (MV-B) carrying multiple copies of a rat vasopressin minigene as a reporter driven by the MMTV-LTR promotor was used to screen non-neuronal tissues for molecular misreading by means of detection of the rat vasopressin+1 protein and mutated mRNA. Molecular misreading was demonstrated to occur in several organs (e.g., epididymis and the parotid gland) where transgenic vasopressin expression is abundant, but its penetrance is variable both between and within tissues. This implies that non-neural tissues too..."

The sensitized response of PT cells may be an important aspect of the interpretation of the melatonin signal to initiate appropriate seasonal physiological responses. The aim of this study is to add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the sensitization of PT cells by melatonin. We demonstrate that sensitization of PT cells by melatonin is mediated via a G(i)-coupled melatonin receptor. The sensitized cAMP response is not only obtained with the pharmacological tool forskolin, but also with cholera toxin, an activator of G(salpha). Changes in the level of G(salpha) or G(ialpha) G-protein subunits are ruled out as part of the sensitization mechanism. However, changes in tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved as tyrosine kinase inhibitors sensitize ovine PT cells and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors significantly blunt adenylate cyclase activity, including the sensitized response to melatonin. The adenylate cyclase isoforms mediating the sensitized response may be broad as 7 of the 9 isoforms of adenylate cyclase are expressed in the PT."
https://openalex.org/W1973980874,"The role for nerve blood flow (NBF) vs. other factors in motor nerve conduction (MNC) slowing in short-term diabetes was assessed by evaluating α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin on NBF, MNC, as well as metabolic imbalances and oxidative stress in the neural tissue. Control and diabetic rats were treated with or without prazosin (5 mg*kg−1·d−1 for 3 wk). NBF was measured by hydrogen clearance. Both endoneurial vascular conductance and MNC velocity were decreased in diabetic rats vs. controls, and this decrease was prevented by prazosin. Free NAD+: NADH ratios in mitochondrial cristae, matrix, and cytosol assessed by metabolite indicator method, as well as phosphocreatine levels and phosphocreatine/creatine ratios, were decreased in diabetic rats, and this reduction was ameliorated by prazosin. Neither diabetes-induced accumulation of two major glycation agents, glucose and fructose, as well as sorbitol and total malondialdehyde plus 4-hydroxyalkenals nor depletion of myo-inositol, GSH, and taurine or decrease in (Na/K)-ATP-ase activity were affected by prazosin. In conclusion, decreased NBF, but not metabolic imbalances or oxidative stress in the neural tissue, is a key mechanism of MNC slowing in short-term diabetes. Further experiments are needed to estimate whether preservation of NBF is sufficient for prevention of nerve dysfunction and morphological abnormalities in long-standing diabetes or whether the aforementioned metabolic imbalances closely associated with impaired neurotropism are of greater importance in advanced than in early diabetic neuropathy.–Obrosova, I.

Members of the rab3 family function in the final steps of the secretory pathway, vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. In contrast to mammalian systems with several rab3 isoforms (rab3A-D), a single family member homologue of rab3 is present in the rapidly dividing cleavage stage sea urchin embryo that localizes to numerous vesicles enriched at the cell cortex. We hypothesized that whereas the contents of these rab3-positive vesicles may contribute to the embryonic extracellular matrix, the membrane and its constituent proteins may be important for other aspects of cell division. We tested the function of rab3 in cell division by the microinjection of either antibodies or competing effector domain peptides to interfere with its function. We found that perturbing rab3 function results in cessation of cell division, whereas cells injected with either heat-inactivated antibodies or control scrambled peptides develop as normal. Moreover, neither endocytosis nor general membrane topology are affected by rab3 perturbation. Thus, we conclude that rab3-associated vesicles and/or their contents are critical for cell division.–Conner, S. D., Wessel, G. M. A rab3 homolog in sea urchin functions in cell division.

https://openalex.org/W2073332167,"Integration host factor (IHF) is a protein that binds to the H′ site of bacteriophage λ with sequence specificity. Genetic experiments implicated amino acid residue Glu44 of the β-subunit of IHF in discrimination against substitution of A for T at position 44 of the TTR submotif of the binding site (Lee, E. C., Hales, L. M., Gumport, R. I., Gardner, J. F. (1992) EMBO J., 11, 305–313). We have extended this observation by generating all possible single-base substitutions at positions 43, 44, and 45 of the H′ site. IHF failed to bind these H′ site substitution mutants in vivo. The K d(app) value for each H′ site substitution, except for H′45A mutant, was reduced >2000-fold relative to the wild-type site. Substitution of amino acid β-Glu44with alanine prevented IHF from discriminating against the H′44A variant but not the other H′ site substitution mutants. Further analysis with other substitutions at position β44 demonstrated that both oxygens of the wild-type glutamic acid are necessary for discrimination of AT at position 44. Because the β-Glu44residue does not contact the DNA, this residue probably enforces binding specificity indirectly through interaction with amino acids that themselves contact the DNA. Integration host factor (IHF) is a protein that binds to the H′ site of bacteriophage λ with sequence specificity. Genetic experiments implicated amino acid residue Glu44 of the β-subunit of IHF in discrimination against substitution of A for T at position 44 of the TTR submotif of the binding site (Lee, E.

Robertson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9246-9253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a small (20 kDa) basic heterodimer and member of the HU-like family of DNA binding proteins. These proteins have two domains, a helix-turn-helix motif involved in protein-protein dimerization interactions and an arm composed of two antiparallel β-sheets that bind to and bend DNA (2Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 3Tanaka I. Appelt K. Dijk J. White S.W. Wilson K.S. Nature. 1984; 310: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Unlike other HU-like proteins, IHF binds to DNA with a high degree of sequence-directed specificity (4Craig N.L. Nash H.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). How IHF achieves sequence specificity has been a challenging question since its discovery. The H′ site of attP from bacteriophage λ is one of the best characterized IHF binding sites. The H′ site is defined as the 34 base pairs protected from DNase I digestion by IHF (4Craig N.L. Nash H.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Alignment of the H′ site and other known IHF binding sites revealed three conserved sequence elements (5Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The WATCAR element (where A, C, G, and T are the standard nucleotide bases, W is A or T, and R is A or G) forms the core of the consensus. It is separated from a second element to its 3′ side, TTR, by four base pairs that are not conserved among IHF binding sites. The third element, a poly(dAT) tract of 4–6 base pairs, is found in a subset of the known IHF binding sites. It is located 5′ to the WATCAR element but is separated from it by approximately eight base pairs. The bases between the poly(dAT) and the WATCAR element also appear not to be conserved among IHF binding sites. The validity of the consensus sequence was confirmed in a genetic study in which base pair substitutions that disrupt IHF binding were isolated within each of these elements (6Lee E.C. MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these mutant H′ sites, which contains a T to A change at the center position of the TTR element, H′44A, was used in a genetic selection to find substitution mutants within IHF that allow it to bind this variant (7Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The IHF mutants isolated replaced glutamic acid 44 of the β-subunit with a glycine (βE44G), lysine (βE44K), or valine (βE44V). A model based on the crystal structure of HU from Bacillus stearothermophiluspredicted that position 44 of the β-subunit was in the center of a small β-sheet, which is highly conserved among IHF proteins from different species (8Yang C.C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It connects the dimerization domain and the DNA-binding antiparallel β-sheets (3Tanaka I. Appelt K. Dijk J. White S.W. Wilson K.S. Nature. 1984; 310: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, this β-sheet is implicated in specific DNA binding to the TTR element (6Lee E.C. MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent IHF-H′ site cocrystal structure confirms the conclusions of the studies detailed above and reveals amino acid side chains that contact DNA (2Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In this structure, only one amino acid (β-Arg46) of this β-sheet makes a hydrogen bond with a DNA base of the TTR element. The majority of contacts made by IHF with the H′ site are to the phosphates and riboses of the DNA backbone. Thus, it appears that IHF recognizes the H′ site sequence largely through indirect sequence-dependent variation of the DNA backbone conformation. In this report, we examine the importance of the bases of the TTR element for IHF binding by making all of the possible single-base pair substitutions within this element of the H′ site. These variant H′ sites were examined for IHF binding in the in vivo challenge phage assay and an in vitro gel mobility shift assay. Interpreted in light of the IHF-H′ site cocrystal structure, these experiments highlight the importance of alternating pyrimidines and purines within the TTR element and of its flanking sequences in IHF binding. Of particular interest is the role of β-Glu44 in the interaction of IHF with the H′ site TTR element. The glutamic acid residue was substituted with various amino acids and tested in a series of in vivo assays of IHF function. The results indicate that IHF is exquisitely sensitive to the precise placement of β-Glu44 but that this residue is not required per se for complex formation. Assays with a challenge phage containing the mutant H′44 site demonstrate that βE44 allows IHF to discriminate between a T:A and an A:T base pair at the central position of the TTR element, although this residue does not itself directly interact with DNA. Both oxygens of the carboxyl group are necessary for specific recognition.

Ampicillin and kanamycin (Sigma) were supplemented at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml where required. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma) was supplemented at the concentrations indicated. SacII endonuclease and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Promega. All other DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies. Reaction conditions used were according to the suppliers' instructions. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for DNA amplification were purchased from Promega. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides for DNA amplification and cassette mutagenesis were purchased from Genosys. Challenge phages used in this study are derivatives of bacteriophage P22 modified so that IHF binding to the H′ site regulates expression of the reporter (ant) gene encoding antirepressor from the Pant promoter. Because IHF is the only protein capable of repressing Pant-directed transcription of ant, binding of IHF to the H′ site controls the lysis-lysogeny decision of infecting phage. Phage P22-based challenge phage assays were performed as described previously (6Lee E.C. MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various strains of JG1151, containing pEKR99a derivatives, were grown overnight in LB plus ampicillin, subcultured 1:50 into LB plus ampicillin, and grown for 3 h at 37 °C. The cultures were diluted 1:4 into LB plus ampicillin containing IPTG at concentrations ranging from 1 μm to 1 mm to induce IHF synthesis. Challenge phages were added to a multiplicity of infection of 25, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Dilutions of each mixture were plated onto LB plates containing ampicillin, kanamycin, and IPTG at the concentrations used during the induction and incubated 24 h at 37 °C. Viable cells were determined by plating dilutions of induced, uninfected cells on LB containing ampicillin and IPTG. The percentage of lysogeny was determined as the number of ampicillin- and kanamycin-resistant lysogens multiplied by 100 divided by the number of ampicillin-resistant viable cells. Negative controls were performed with JG1151 containing pTrc99a and a challenge phage lacking the H′ site. Challenge phages used in this study contain the goh1mutation that allows efficient P22 lytic growth in the absence of IHF (6Lee E.C. MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pair of complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides, d(GTGACCTGTTCGTTGCAACAAATTGATAAGCAATGCTTTTTTATAATGCCAACTTA) and d(TAAGTTGGCATTATAAAAAAGCATGCTTATCAATTTGTTGCAACGAACAGGTCAC) contain-ing the sequence of the H′ site or mutant derivatives as well as flanking DNA from λ attP were synthesized. The 5′-hydroxyl of each oligonucleotide at a final concentration of 1.6 pmol/μl was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (9Maniatis T. Fritsch E, F Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 122-124Google Scholar). The phosphorylated oligonucleotides were heated at 90 °C for 3 min and then annealed by reducing the temperature to 20 °C to give a final duplex concentration of 0.25 μm. Purified IHF (55 μm a gift from Dr. H. Nash) was diluted by 2-fold serial dilutions to yield solutions containing IHF in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 240 mm KCl. A 2-μl aliquot of diluted IHF, starting at 2.75 μm, was added to each DNA binding reaction to yield a final volume of 20 μl that contains 25 nm labeled H′ site duplex DNA, 112 μm in base pairs of salmon sperm DNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 87 mm KCl, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow equilibration. A 5-μl aliquot of each reaction was loaded onto a 7% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1) in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) that had been run at 10 V/cm for 30 min, and the sample was then subjected to electrophoresis for 2.75 h. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and the appropriate bands were quantified (10Wang S. Cosstick R. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Table I lists the plasmids used in this study. The plasmid pEKR7Zf(+) is an IHF-encoding derivative of pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega). It encodes ampicillin resistance and expresses the IHF genes ihfB and ihfA from Plac. DNA containing ihfB andihfA was amplified with the oligonucleotides d(CGGAATTCGGCCGCCCTTAATCATT) and d(GGTCTAGAGCGGCCTTTTTAGTTAG) using pHNβα (6Lee E.C. MacWilliams M.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. These oligonucleotides introduce an EcoRI site 53 base pairs 5′ to the start of ihfB and an XbaI site 10 base pairs 3′ to ihfA. The amplified fragment and the plasmid pGEM7Zf(+) were individually digested with EcoRI and XbaI, mixed, and joined with DNA ligase. Plasmid pEKR99a and its mutant derivatives were constructed by ligating the 969-base pair EcoRI-ihfB-ihfA-XbaI fragment from pEKR7Zf(+) into EcoRI–XbaI digested pTrc99a (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) downstream from Plac. Expression of IHF from pEKR99a is regulated bylacI q. A pair of complementary oligonucleotides, d(GaATTTCAATACGCTCGCCCTGCGCAAGAGTCGAGGCCA) and d(TATGGCCTCGACTCTTGCGCAGGGCGAGCGTATTGAAATtCGC), were used for each amino acid substitution introduced into ihfB. Each set comprised codons 32–46, with the underlined bases indicating codon 44. Each of the four duplexes that introduce the four different substitution mutations (alanine, aspartic acid, glutamine, and asparagine) in codon 44 (underlined) changed codon 44 to the appropriate trinucleotide sequence to generate each amino acid substitution. Each duplex also changed the third base of codon 45 from C to T (indicated in the oligonucleotide sequences by lowercase type). This disrupts a natural SacII restriction site without changing the amino acid encoded. After annealing, the oligonucleotides formed complementary duplexes with the top strand providing 5′NdeI and 3′ SacII cohesive ends. The oligonucleotide duplexes were ligated with T4 DNA ligase into pEKR7Zf(+) previously digested with NdeI andSacII and then electroporated into EM424. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were used to prepare miniprep DNA. Mutated plasmids were identified as being resistant to digestion bySacII, and the entire ihfB gene was sequenced to confirm the presence of the base substitution. IHF binding to the ihfB site of bacteriophage Mu is required for the stimulation of transcription from the early promoter Pe, expression of the lytic genes, and subsequent killing of the host through multiple transpositions and cell lysis (12Granston A.E. Nash H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficiency of killing by Mu in a cell expressing either wild type or mutant IHF proteins can be used as a measurement of IHF function. The assay was performed as described previously (10Wang S. Cosstick R. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with relevant modifications detailed below. Strain HN1506a, a Mu Cts lysogen containing derivatives of pEKR99a carrying wild type or mutantihfB genes was grown overnight at 30 °C in LB plus ampicillin. Serial dilutions of the cultures were spotted onto two LB plus ampicillin plates and allowed to dry. Both plates were incubated overnight, one at 30 °C and the other at 43 °C. The level of Mu killing is expressed as the frequency of survival and was calculated by dividing the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies at 43 °C by the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies at 30 °C. IHF is required for the stable maintenance of pSC101 replicons (13Stenzel T.T. Patel P. Bastia D. Cell. 1987; 49: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and the assay for this function was performed as described previously (14Kano Y. Yasuzawa K. Tanaka H. Imamoto F. Gene (Amst. ). 1993; 126: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Electrocompetent cells containing pEKRR99a or a mutant derivative were electroporated with a mixture of pSC101 and pET28a(+), a plasmid that does not require IHF for replication or maintenance. After 1 h of recovery incubation, an aliquot of each electroporation mixture was serially diluted and plated onto LB containing ampicillin and spectinomycin or kanamycin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the effect of IHF mutations was quantified as the number of electroporants maintaining pSC101 (spectinomycin-resistant) divided by the number maintaining pET28a (kanamycin-resistant). The IHF-H′ site cocystral structural coordinates reported by Rice et al. (2Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), 1IHF.pdb, were obtained from the protein data base (available on the World Wide Web). The coordinates were modeled with the program Swiss-pdViewer PPC version 3.5, and amino acid substitutions were generated with the mutate function of the programs (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Challenge phages containing all nine possible variants that produce single-base substitutions at positions 43–45 in the TTR element of the H′ site were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With 1 mm IPTG induction, P22-H′(II) containing a wild-type H′ site formed lysogens at a frequency of 20% (Fig. 1). All of the variant phages failed to form lysogens at 1 mm IPTG, suggesting a significant reduction in the affinity of IHF for these sites. The H′ site DNA (0.25 μm) and salmon sperm DNA (75 μg/ml) were mixed with a series of 2-fold dilutions of IHF and subjected to gel shift analysis. The K d(app) was defined as the IHF concentration at which 50% of the labeled DNA fragments were shifted into a bound complex when the IHF/DNA concentration ratios were large. IHF had a K d(app) of 1 nm for the wild-type site (TableII), which is comparable with the 1.5 and 1.9 nm values reported previously (10Wang S. Cosstick R. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Yang S.W. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6292-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The H′45A duplex was bound by IHF with a K d(app) of 10 nm, an approximately 10-fold reduction relative to the wild-type H′ site. IHF failed to shift 50% of the fragment of each of the remaining H′ site mutants, and thus these sites have aK d(app) greater than 2.7 μm.Table IIIn vitro IHF gel mobility shift assaySiteSequence (5′ to 3′)K d(app)SourcenmH′TAAAAAAGCATTGCTTATCAATTTGTTGCAACGA1Ref.4Craig N.L.

Open table in a new tab Underlined sequences indicate the highly conserved elements of known IHF binding sites, which include the poly(dAT) tract (AAAAAA), the WATCAR (TATCAA), and the TTR (TTG). Previous methylation interference studies of the H′ site suggested that the composition of the minor groove at positions 43 and 44 was important for IHF binding (8Yang C.C. Nash H.A. Cell. 1989; 57: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of the H′ site with the base analogs 2-aminopurine and 2,6-diaminopurine, which place an N2 amino group in the center of the minor groove, confirmed the importance of the minor groove of these positions in IHF binding (10Wang S. Cosstick R. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The experiments using base analogs suggested that it is the N2 amino group of guanine in the center of the minor groove that causes the reduction of affinity of IHF for H′ sites containing C:G or G:C base pairs at these positions. In the IHF-H′ cocrystal structure, the center of the minor groove of positions 43 and 44 is occupied by β-Arg46 (Fig.2 a). Thus, the N2 amino group of guanine in either a C:G or G:C base pair is predicted to clash with β-Arg46. The effect of the H′43A and H′44A mutations upon IHF binding cannot be explained by the presence of a disruptive N2 amino group in the minor groove. In fact, the hydrogen bond accepting groups in the minor groove of the A:T base pair are formally indistinguishable from those of a T:A base pair because they appear to occupy equivalent positions relative to its pseudodyad axis of symmetry (19Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). However, the H′43A and H′44A mutants have an altered sequence of pyrimidine and purine bases within the consensus strand of the TTR element, and this may change the geometry of the bases and backbone of the bases neighboring the changed base. This effect could account for the ability of a protein to distinguish A:T from T:A base pairs because the different nearest neighboring bases alter the precise positioning of hydrogen-bonding groups of the two configurations of the A:T base pair in the minor groove. Upon IHF binding, these alterations in the DNA geometry could disrupt a necessary contact or introduce steric clashes between the TTR element and IHF. A previous genetic study (7Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicated that glutamic acid 44 might be involved in sequence-specific interactions with the H′ site because single amino acid substitutions to glycine, lysine, or valine allow the mutant proteins to repress the P22-H′44A challenge phage. This phage contains a T to A change at the center position of the TTR element of the H′ site. However, the mutants also continued to repress the challenge phage containing the wild-type H′ site. It is possible that β-Glu44 prevents stable IHF-H′44A site complex formation because the negative charge of the carboxyl group clashes with some portion of the TTR element and that the β-Glu44substitution mutants allow complex formation with the mutant site by removing this charge. In order to understand how β-Glu44is involved in the DNA binding specificity, additional amino acid substitutions at position 44 were tested in a series of assays. The glutamic acid was substituted with alanine (βE44A), aspartic acid (βE44D), asparagine (βE44N), and glutamine (βE44Q) through site-directed mutagenesis. A specific prediction was that only the βE44D protein would prevent repression of P22-H′44A(II), because it, like the wild-type glutamic acid, carries a negative charge. The βE44N and βE44Q mutants were constructed to test directly the effect of the negative charge by converting the carboxylate to the uncharged amide. The βE44D and βE44N changes shortened the side chains by a methylene group, and the βE44A mutation further shortened the side chain. Most of the mutants had reduced IHF binding activity relative to wild-type IHF with a challenge phage containing the wild-type H′ site (Fig. 1 a). The βE44A protein lysogeny curve did not differ significantly from the wild-type IHF lysogeny curve. At an induction concentration of 1 μm IPTG, the βE44G protein has 50-fold lower lysogeny frequency than the wild type and βE44A proteins. The difference in binding between the βE44A and βE44G proteins may be due to the greater conformational freedom of the peptide backbone in glycine-substituted mutant. At 1 μmIPTG, the βE44D, βE44N, and βE44Q proteins promoted only background levels of lysogeny. At an induction concentration of 10 μm IPTG, the reduction in percentage lysogeny of these mutants relative to the wild-type protein was less dramatic. With the exception of the βE44D protein, all the mutants tested reached a maximum percentage of lysogeny at 100 μm IPTG induction. The percentage of lysogeny of βE44D was 5000-fold lower than wild-type IHF at 100 μm IPTG but eventually reached a maximum at 1 mm IPTG that was similar to the levels achieved by other IHF mutants at 100 μm IPTG. The reduction in binding of these mutants (βE44D, βE44G, βE44N, and βE44Q) relative to the wild-type IHF indicates that IHF is a less efficient repressor of Pant transcription when amino acid β44 is not glutamic acid or alanine. Substitution mutants of glutamic acid β44 to glycine, lysine, and valine were originally isolated as mutants capable of repressing the P22-H′44A(II) challenge phage mutant DNA binding site (7Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These amino acids have such chemically dissimilar side chains that we reasoned that it must be the negative charge of β-Glu44 that prevents IHF from stably binding the H′44A site. Both the βE44G (one of the original suppressors) and the βE44A proteins repress P22-H′44A(II) at levels comparable with those seen with the wild-type P22-H′(II) (Fig. 1 b). The βE44N and βE44Q mutants do not repress the P22-H′44A(II) phage as effectively as the P22-H′(II) phage. Both fail to form lysogens at 1 and 10 μm IPTG induction. At higher levels of induction, the percentage of lysogeny increases but remains significantly below the levels seen with P22-H′(II). Both the wild-type (βE44) and βE44D fail to repress the P22-H′44A(II) phage at the highest induction concentration (1 mm IPTG). This result confirms the initial hypothesis that amino acids carrying a negative charge at β44 prevent stable IHF-H′44A complex formation. As mentioned, Lee et al. (7Lee E.C. Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the proteins with glycine, lysine, or valine substitutions at position β44 could repress the P22-H′(II) phage but could not repress H′ site challenge phages containing mutations in the poly(dAT) tract, the N8 spacer, or the WATCAR element. This finding suggested that substitution at β44 does not compensate for deleterious interactions with distant portions of the H′ site. Except for the P22-H′44A phage, no substitution mutations within this element were available for testing then, so the effects of changes within the TTR element were determined. Here we tested the β-Glu44 substitution mutants to determine if the loss of specificity with the H′44A site extended to any of the variants with base substitutions in the TTR element. As was observed for the wild-type protein, none of the mutants formed lysogens with challenge phages containing the altered TTR elements (data not shown). This lack of repression suggests that other amino acids are responsible for the specificity at these positions in the H′ site and that any deleterious interactions introduced by other TTR substitutions cannot be suppressed by altering β-Glu44. Mutants with amino acid substitutions at residues near β-Glu44 such as βR42A, βR46C, and βR46H exhibit a significant reduction in IHF function as measured by the plating efficiency of bacteriophage Mu (17Mengeritsky G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17902-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The β-Glu44 mutants constructed in this study were tested for their ability to promote Mu induction and maintenance of the plasmid pSC101 to determine if IHF function was disrupted. Both Mu induction and pSC101 maintenance require IHF binding to unique DNA sites, theihfB site in Mu and pSC101 ori, respectively (Table III). These two sites have an A at the third position of the TTR element that differs from the G found in the H′ site and also differ from each other in the sequence of the bases surrounding their TTR elements. In addition, the pSC101ori and ihfB sites differ from the H′ site and each other at the permissively variable bases within the WATCAR element as well as in the composition of the poly(dAT) element and the N8 spacer. We found that the A, D, G, N, and Q substitution mutants functioned as efficiently as wild type for Mu induction and pSC101 maintenance. These results demonstrate that the substitutions we tested do not alter IHF structure enough to result in a mutant phenotype by these assays and suggest that they do not dramatically alter the conformation or stability of the proteins (Table III). They also suggest that the substitutions do not affect the ability of IHF to recognize the TTR element in different IHF binding sites.Table IIIIn vivo assays of IHF-dependent phenotypesIHF plasmidMucTs induction 3-aThe ratio of colony-forming units at 43 °C (induced) and at 30 °C (uninduced).pSC101 maintenance 3-bThe ratio of pSC101 and pET28a(+) transformants.Controls pTrc99a1.05.0e − 6 pEKR99a2.5 e − 50.94Supressor pEKR99a-βE44G4.6 e − 50.70Site-directed mutants pEKR99a-βE44A1.7 e − 50.37 pEKR99a-βE44D2.0 e − 50.95 pEKR99a-βE44N4.4 e − 51.04 pEKR99a-βE44Q1.1 e − 41.203-a The ratio of colony-forming units at 43 °C (induced) and at 30 °C (uninduced).3-b The ratio of pSC101 and pET28a(+) transformants. Open table in a new tab In this study, we constructed site-directed mutants to examine the role of β-Glu44 in IHF binding to the TTR element in one of its specific DNA sites. The behavior of these mutants indicates that the wild-type β-Glu44 bestows specificity in the IHF-H′ site complex by buttressing β-Arg42 and β-Arg46. In light of the IHF-H′ site cocrystal, we attribute these effects primarily to the hydrogen bonds to β-Arg46 and β-Arg42 made by β-Glu44. In the absence of either interaction, the β1–β2 turn portion of the protein-clamp collapses and β-Arg46 gains the conformational freedom to adapt to the H′44A mutant site but not to other TTR mutant derivatives. The details of our proposal are presented below. In the IHF-H′ site cocrystal (2Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), β-Glu44 is inserted into the minor groove of the TTR element but does not contact the DNA (Fig. 2 a). The carboxyl group of β-Glu44 interacts with β-Arg42 and β-Arg46. One of the oxygens of β-Glu44interacts with the charged ureido amine groups of β-Arg42, and the β-Arg42 makes a salt bridge to the phosphate group of Ala41 (not shown). The other oxygen of β-Glu44 makes hydrogen bonds to both ureido amine groups of β-Arg46. In turn, β-Arg46 makes hydrogen bonds to the O2 of Thr44 through both its terminal ureido amine groups. The aliphatic portion of β-Arg46 also makes van der Waals contacts with the deoxyribose of Gly45 (not shown). This network of bonds between β-Arg42, β-Glu44, β-Arg46, and the minor groove of the TTR element form the center of a protein clamp that holds the H′ site in its bent conformation. The periphery of this protein clamp is composed of amide nitrogen contacts from the β1–β2 turn and the N terminus of α-helices 1 and 3 to the phosphates of the TTR element. Rice et al. (2Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) suggested that the βE44G, βE44V, and βE44K suppressors allow the binding of the H′44A(II) site by conferring increased conformational freedom to the side chain β-Arg46 so that it does not disrupt the interaction with the TTR element. The ability of IHF to discriminate against binding to the H′44A site TTR element appears to depend upon the bonds β-Glu44makes with both β-Arg42 and β-Arg46. Of the mutants tested, only IHF molecules with glutamic acid or aspartic acid at position β44 are unable to repress P22-H′44A(II) (Fig.1 b). This finding supports the initial supposition that the removal of the negative charge allows IHF to bind the mutant H′44A site. The reduced lysogeny of P22-H′(II), when tested with the aspartic acid substitution mutant, indicates that disruptive interactions have been introduced (see below), and the negative charge must be precisely placed to allow optimal IHF function. Computer modeling indicates that the aspartic acid continues to make a hydrogen bond to the secondary amino group of β-Arg46 (Fig. 2 b). Binding affinity to wild type is lowered but not abolished, because interactions between β-Arg46 and β-Asp44force a clash between β-Arg46 and the ribose of Gly45 or Thr44. Additional support for the hypothesis derives from the intermediate levels of lysogeny promoted by the polar amino acid substitution mutations in the βE44N and βE44Q proteins (Fig. 1 b). Neither the βE44N nor βE44Q residues are predicted to make hydrogen bonds with β-Arg42, because the oxygen acceptor has been replaced with an amide donor (Fig.2 c). Yet the βE44N and βE44Q mutants do promote lysogeny with P22-H′44A(II) but at levels well beneath that of the βE44A mutant with P22-H′44A(II). This result suggests that the hydrogen bonds from the β44 residue to β-Arg42 control part of the specificity for binding to the TTR element. Indeed, in mutants containing substitutions of β-Glu44 such as alanine, glycine, valine, or lysine, these hydrogen bonds cannot form because these amino acids do not have oxygens in their side chains. Lack of the interactions would confer conformational freedom on both the β-Arg46 and β-Arg42 residues to bind the H′44A site without steric clashes. This assertion is supported by the fact that P22-H′44A(II) forms lysogens at levels comparable with those seen with the P22-H′(II) phage. Based on the behavior of the substitution mutants and the cocrystal structure, we propose the following model. The β-Glu44residue imposes specificity on the binding at the central base pair of the TTR element through hydrogen bonds from an oxygen that holds β-Arg46 in a position that prevents it from adapting to the disruptive alterations introduced in the H′44A site. These hydrogen bonds between the oxygen of β-Glu44 and the ureido amines of β-Arg46 are further stabilized by an additional bond between the oxygen of β-Glu44 and an amino group of β-Arg42 and as a result limit the conformational freedom of β-Glu44. In turn, β-Arg42 is held in place by an electrostatic bond with the phosphate group of the adenine at position base pair 41 of the H′ site (not shown). Thus, all three amino acids are necessary for the achievement of full discrimination against the P22-H′44A(II) variant. It remains unclear which portion of the H′44A site clashes with β-Arg46 in wild-type IHF. One possibility is that the hydrogen bonds from both of the ureido amine groups of β-Arg46 to the O2 of the thymine at base pair 44 of the H′ sites are disrupted by steric clashes with the N3 of adenine in the H′44A site. The transversion from T:A to A:T found in the H′44A site should formally place the N3 of adenine 44 in the position previously occupied by O2 of the thymine in the H′ site. The N3 of adenine at base pair 44 in the H′44A site might accept hydrogen bonds from β-Arg46 even if the roll, twist, or propeller twist angles were exaggerated to their possible extremes. It seems likely that any changes in the roll, twist, or propeller twist caused by the substitution within the TTR element would also result in a distortion of the DNA backbone. Such changes could disrupt stable binding by IHF by causing the van der Waals interaction between β-Arg46 and the deoxyribose at guanine at base pair 45 seen in the cocrystal to clash. The removal of the hydrogen bonds bracing β-Arg46 could allow it to move toward the center of the minor groove to alleviate the steric hindrance. In summary, the wild-type βE44 residue confers binding specificity “obliquely” (indirectly) by forming hydrogen bonds to β-Arg42 and β-Arg46. These results show how interactions not directly at the protein-DNA interface can confer sequence specificity by affecting the positioning of amino acids that themselves contact the nucleic acid. Such oblique but specific effects suggest the difficulties inherent in attempting to engineer sequence specificity changes in proteins that interact with DNA. The genetic methods employed here allow specific predictions concerning the detailed chemical interactions of amino acid side changes critical to site-specific interactions. We thank A. Granston, S. Maloy, P. Rice, L. Hager, and R. Weisberg for providing strains and helpful suggestions and an anonymous reviewer for helpful suggestions that improved the presentation."
https://openalex.org/W4244669731,"Rabs are monomeric GTP binding proteins belonging to the ras superfamily that function throughout the secretory pathway. Members of the rab3 family function in the final steps of the secretory pathway, vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. In contrast to mammalian systems with several rab3 isoforms (rab3A-D), a single family member homologue of rab3 is present in the rapidly dividing cleavage stage sea urchin embryo that localizes to numerous vesicles enriched at the cell cortex. We hypothesized that whereas the contents of these rab3-positive vesicles may contribute to the embryonic extracellular matrix, the membrane and its constituent proteins may be important for other aspects of cell division. We tested the function of rab3 in cell division by the microinjection of either antibodies or competing effector domain peptides to interfere with its function. We found that perturbing rab3 function results in cessation of cell division, whereas cells injected with either heat-inactivated antibodies or control scrambled peptides develop as normal. Moreover, neither endocytosis nor general membrane topology are affected by rab3 perturbation. Thus, we conclude that rab3-associated vesicles and/or their contents are critical for cell division."
https://openalex.org/W4239031538,"+1 Frame-shifted proteins such as amyloid precursor protein(+1) and ubiquitin-B(+1) have been identified in the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. These frameshifts are caused by dinucleotide deletions in GAGAG motifs of messenger RNA encoded by genes that have maintained the unchanged wild-type DNA sequence. This process is termed 'molecular misreading'. A key question is whether this process is confined to neurons or whether it could also occur in non-neuronal cells. A transgenic mouse line (MV-B) carrying multiple copies of a rat vasopressin minigene as a reporter driven by the MMTV-LTR promotor was used to screen non-neuronal tissues for molecular misreading by means of detection of the rat vasopressin(+1) protein and mutated mRNA. Molecular misreading was demonstrated to occur in several organs (e.g., epididymis and the parotid gland) where transgenic vasopressin expression is abundant, but its penetrance is variable both between and within tissues. This implies that non-neural tissues too, could be affected by cellular derangements caused by molecular misreading."
