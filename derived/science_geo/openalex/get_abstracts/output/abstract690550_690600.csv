With a microscope weight below 3 g and a highly flexible connection cable, MINI2P allowed stable imaging with no impediment of behavior in a variety of assays compared to untethered, unimplanted animals. The improved cell yield was achieved through a optical system design featuring an enlarged field of view (FOV) and a microtunable lens with increased z-scanning range and speed that allows fast and stable imaging of multiple interleaved planes, as well as 3D functional imaging. Successive imaging across multiple, adjacent FOVs enabled recordings from more than 10,000 neurons in the same animal. Large-scale proof-of-principle data were obtained from cell populations in visual cortex, medial entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, revealing spatial tuning of cells in all areas."
https://openalex.org/W4221041063,"The tumor microenvironment hosts antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) associated with a favorable prognosis in several types of cancer. Patient-derived antibodies have diagnostic and therapeutic potential; yet, it remains unclear how antibodies gain autoreactivity and target tumors. Here, we found that somatic hypermutations (SHMs) promote antibody antitumor reactivity against surface autoantigens in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Patient-derived tumor cells were frequently coated with IgGs. Intratumoral ASCs in HGSOC were both mutated and clonally expanded and produced tumor-reactive antibodies that targeted MMP14, which is abundantly expressed on the tumor cell surface. The reversion of monoclonal antibodies to their germline configuration revealed two types of classes: one dependent on SHMs for tumor binding and a second with germline-encoded autoreactivity. Thus, tumor-reactive autoantibodies are either naturally occurring or evolve through an antigen-driven selection process. These findings highlight the origin and potential applicability of autoantibodies directed at surface antigens for tumor targeting in cancer patients."

How the host controls mucus barrier integrity and commensalism is unclear. We show that terminal sialylation of glycans on intestinal mucus by ST6GALNAC1 (ST6), the dominant sialyltransferase specifically expressed in goblet cells and induced by microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, is essential for mucus integrity and protecting against excessive bacterial proteolytic degradation. Glycoproteomic profiling and biochemical analysis of ST6 mutations identified in patients show that decreased sialylation causes defective mucus proteins and congenital inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mice harboring a patient ST6 mutation have compromised mucus barriers, dysbiosis, and susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. Based on our understanding of the ST6 regulatory network, we show that treatment with sialylated mucin or a Foxo3 inhibitor can ameliorate IBD."
https://openalex.org/W4221042127,"Several ebolaviruses cause outbreaks of severe disease. Vaccines and monoclonal antibody cocktails are available to treat Ebola virus (EBOV) infections, but not Sudan virus (SUDV) or other ebolaviruses. Current cocktails contain antibodies that cross-react with the secreted soluble glycoprotein (sGP) that absorbs virus-neutralizing antibodies. By sorting memory B cells from EBOV infection survivors, we isolated two broadly reactive anti-GP monoclonal antibodies, 1C3 and 1C11, that potently neutralize, protect rodents from disease, and lack sGP cross-reactivity. Both antibodies recognize quaternary epitopes in trimeric ebolavirus GP. 1C11 bridges adjacent protomers via the fusion loop. 1C3 has a tripartite epitope in the center of the trimer apex. One 1C3 antigen-binding fragment anchors simultaneously to the three receptor-binding sites in the GP trimer, and separate 1C3 paratope regions interact differently with identical residues on the three protomers. A cocktail of both antibodies completely protected nonhuman primates from EBOV and SUDV infections, indicating their potential clinical value."
https://openalex.org/W4220682700,"The emergence of hypervirulent clade 2 Clostridioides difficile is associated with severe symptoms and accounts for >20% of global infections. TcdB is a dominant virulence factor of C. difficile, and clade 2 strains exclusively express two TcdB variants (TcdB2 and TcdB4) that use unknown receptors distinct from the classic TcdB. Here, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 screens for TcdB4 and identified tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as its receptor. Using cryo-EM, we determined a complex structure of the full-length TcdB4 with TFPI, defining a common receptor-binding region for TcdB. Residue variations within this region divide major TcdB variants into 2 classes: one recognizes Frizzled (FZD), and the other recognizes TFPI. TFPI is highly expressed in the intestinal glands, and recombinant TFPI protects the colonic epithelium from TcdB2/4. These findings establish TFPI as a colonic crypt receptor for TcdB from clade 2 C. difficile and reveal new mechanisms for CDI pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4220758451,"Background COVID-19 is a new pandemic that poses a threat to people globally. In Ethiopia, where classrooms are limited, students are at higher risk for COVID-19 unless they take consistent preventative actions. However, there is a lack of evidence in the study area regarding student compliance with COVID-19 preventive behavior (CPB) and its predictors. Objective This study aimed to assess CPB and its predictors among students based on the perspective of the Health Belief Model (HBM). Method and materials A school-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from November to December 2020 to evaluate the determinants of CPB among high school students using a self-administered structured questionnaire. 370 participants were selected using stratified simple random sampling. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data, and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses to evaluate the measurement and structural models proposed by the HBM and to identify associations between HBM variables. A T-value of &gt; 1.96 with 95% CI and a P-value of &lt; 0.05 were used to declare the statistical significance of path coefficients. Result A total of 370 students participated with a response rate of 92%. The median (interquartile range) age of the participants (51.9% females) was 18 (2) years. Only 97 (26.2%), 121 (32.7%), and 108 (29.2%) of the students had good practice in keeping physical distance, frequent hand washing, and facemask use respectively. The HBM explained 43% of the variance in CPB. Perceived barrier (β = - 0.15, p &lt; 0.001) and self-efficacy (β = 0.51, p &lt;0.001) were significant predictors of student compliance to CPB. Moreover, the measurement model demonstrated that the instrument had acceptable reliability and validity. Conclusion and recommendations COVID-19 prevention practice is quite low among students. HBM demonstrated adequate predictive utility in predicting CPBs among students, where perceived barriers and self-efficacy emerged as significant predictors of CPBs. According to the findings of this study, theory-based behavioral change interventions are urgently required for students to improve their prevention practice. Furthermore, these interventions will be effective if they are designed to remove barriers to CPBs and improve students’ self-efficacy in taking preventive measures."

However, the methods of determining the axial load capacity of the pile in the field are often costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid machine-learning to predict the axial load capacity of the pile. In particular, two powerful optimization algorithms named Herd Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were used to evolve the Random Forest (RF) model architecture. For the research, the data set including 472 results of pile load tests in Ha Nam province-Vietnam was used to build and test the machine-learning models. The data set was divided into training and testing parts with ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. Various performance indicators, namely absolute mean error (MAE), mean square root error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are used to evaluate the performance of RF models. The results showed that, between the two optimization algorithms, GA gave superior performance compared to PSO in finding the best RF model architecture. In addition, the RF-GA model is also compared with the default RF model, the results show that the RF-GA model gives the best performance, with the balance on training and testing set, meaning avoiding the phenomenon of overfitting. The results of the study suggest a potential direction in the development of machine learning models in engineering in general and geotechnical engineering in particular."
https://openalex.org/W4221117288,"The purpose of this study is to present the numerical investigations of an infection-based fractional-order nonlinear prey-predator system (FONPPS) using the stochastic procedures of the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) along with the artificial neuron networks (ANNs), i.e., SCGNNs. The infection FONPPS is classified into three dynamics, susceptible density, infected prey, and predator population density. Three cases based on the fractional-order derivative have been numerically tested to solve the nonlinear infection-based disease. The data proportions are applied 75%, 10%, and 15% for training, validation, and testing to solve the infection FONPPS. The numerical representations are obtained through the stochastic SCGNNs to solve the infection FONPPS, and the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton scheme is implemented to compare the results. The infection FONPPS is numerically treated using the stochastic SCGNNs procedures to reduce the mean square error (MSE). To check the validity, consistency, exactness, competence, and capability of the proposed stochastic SCGNNs, the numerical performances using the error histograms (EHs), correlation, MSE, regression, and state transitions (STs) are also performed."
https://openalex.org/W4220668939,"Enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway spatially organize into dynamic intracellular assemblies called purinosomes. The formation of purinosomes has been correlated with growth conditions resulting in high purine demand, and therefore, the cellular advantage of complexation has been hypothesized to enhance metabolite flux through the pathway. However, the properties of this cellular structure are unclear. Here, we define the purinosome in a transient expression system as a biomolecular condensate using fluorescence microscopy. We show that purinosomes, as denoted by formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase granules in purine-depleted HeLa cells, are spherical and appear to coalesce when two come into contact, all liquid-like characteristics that are consistent with previously reported condensates. We further explored the biophysical and biochemical means that drive the liquid–liquid phase separation of these structures. We found that the process of enzyme condensation into purinosomes is likely driven by the oligomeric state of the pathway enzymes and not a result of intrinsic disorder, the presence of low-complexity domains, the assistance of RNA scaffolds, or changes in intracellular pH. Finally, we demonstrate that the heat shock protein 90 KDa helps to regulate the physical properties of the condensate and maintain their liquid-like state inside HeLa cells. We show that disruption of heat shock protein 90 KDa activity induced the transformation of formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase clusters into more irregularly shaped condensates, suggesting that its chaperone activity is essential for purinosomes to retain their liquid-like properties. This refined view of the purinosome offers new insight into how metabolic enzymes spatially organize into dynamic condensates within human cells.

This refined view of the purinosome offers new insight into how metabolic enzymes spatially organize into dynamic condensates within human cells. Purine production is met through the coordinated actions of two complementary pathways in order to maintain cellular homeostasis and promote cell growth. The purine salvage pathway recycles degraded bases back into their corresponding nucleotide and is commonly employed during normal physiological growth conditions (1Murray A.W. The biological significance of purine salvage.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1971; 40: 811-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, when demand is elevated, the de novo purine biosynthetic (DNPB) pathway becomes activated and converts phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate into inosine 5′-monophosphate (2Mayer D. Natsumeda Y.

Using fluorescence microscopy, the state of the DNPB pathway has largely been reflected in the behavior of formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (FGAMS). FGAMS transitions from a diffuse state into multienzyme assemblies called purinosomes upon changes in growth conditions that increase purine demand (5An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J.

The purinosome is hypothesized to exist as a metabolon, a complex of sequential metabolic enzymes to enhance metabolite flux through a given pathway (7Srere P.A. The metabolon.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and has been further substantiated by identifying intracellular hotspots of purine biosynthesis through mass spectral imaging (8Pareek V. Tian H. Winograd N. Benkovic S.J. Metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging reveal channeled de novo purine synthesis in cells.Science. 2020; 368: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Components of the purinosome exist beyond the six enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway and include downstream enzymes and regulatory proteins such as molecular chaperones and kinases (6Pedley A.M.

The collective actions of these regulatory proteins are likely what governs the formation and, in part, the function of the complex. The function of the complex is also reliant on the availability of substrates and cofactors derived from mitochondrial processes (11Doigneaux C. Pedley A.M. Mistry I.N. Papayova M. Benkovic S.J. Tavassoli A. Hypoxia drives the assembly of the multienzyme purinosome complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 9551-9566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), further supporting our conclusions that purinosomes and mitochondria have a symbiotic relationship (12Chan C.Y. Pedley A.M. Kim D. Xia C. Zhuang X. Benkovic S.J. Microtubule-directed transport of purine metabolons drives their cytosolic transit to mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The compartmentalization of purine biosynthetic enzymes into these intracellular organizations has hinted that these bodies might be an example in the growing list of biomolecular condensates (e.g., nucleoli, P-bodies, stress granules, RNA transport granules). Biomolecular condensates are highly heterogeneous complexes that undergo a liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) driven by weak and transient interactions among its constitutive components, commonly referred to as multivalency (14Alberti S.

The multivalency can be achieved as a product of interactions between folded protein domains, such as highly ordered oligomers, and/or self-associating intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). With the advancements in fluorescence microscopy, we have greatly advanced our understanding of the biophysical properties of these membrane-less organelles. The process of LLPS has been observed within DNA repair (17Altmeyer M. Neelsen K.J. Teloni F. Pozdnyakova I. Pellegrino S. Grofte M. Rask M.D. Streicher W. Jungmichel S. Nielsen M.L. Lukas J.

Loewith R. Regulation of cellular metabolism through phase separation of enzymes.Biomolecules. 2018; 8: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Changes in a cell’s microenvironment and intracellular needs often modify the attractive forces within condensates and impact their formation and stability. Therefore, identifying the mechanism that triggers and regulates the dynamic process might provide insights into their function and the overall cellular advantage of forming condensates over more traditional macromolecular complexes. In this report, we build on our previous biophysical and biochemical characterizations of the purinosome in purine-depleted HeLa cells to demonstrate its ability to behave similar to other reported biomolecular condensates. Purine depletion of HeLa cells results in activation of the DNPB and has been correlated with purinosome formation (8Pareek V. Tian H. Winograd N. Benkovic S.J. Metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging reveal channeled de novo purine synthesis in cells.Science. 2020; 368: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Zhao H. Chiaro C.R. Zhang L. Smith P.B. Chan C.Y. Pedley A.M. Pugh R.J. French J.B. Patterson A.D. Benkovic S.J. Quantitative analysis of purine nucleotides indicates that purinosomes increase de novo purine biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 6705-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We show that purinosomes exist as uniformly spherical intracellular assemblies and readily fuse with one another when they come in close contact. The mechanism that drives the LLPS is likely because of the oligomerization of pathway enzymes into higher ordered structures and not a consequence of intrinsic disorder. Last, we propose a mechanism by which regulation of the condensate’s liquid-like properties is achieved by the assistance of molecular chaperones. Together, these results help us further understand the nature of this assembly and provide further clues into how the purinosome is organized and regulated in cells. To probe whether the purinosome exhibits liquid-like properties, we first sought out whether an enzyme concentration–dependent threshold exists that might promote an LLPS. For this, we used a modified HeLa Tet-Off cell line (HeTOFLI) that stably expresses LacI-NLS to allow for the IPTG induction of protein expression (27Matsumoto G. Kim S. Morimoto R.I. Huntingtin and mutant SOD1 form aggregate structures with distinct molecular properties in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with an inducible construct encoding FGAMS-enhanced YFP (EYFP), and the induced expression was monitored over time by fluorescence microscopy (Figs. 1 and S1). Previously, we have used FGAMS as a marker to study the intracellular dynamics of the purinosome, and we infer that most assemblies of FGAMS under purine-depleted growth conditions likely also contain other enzymes in the DNPB pathway (5An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 12Chan C.Y. Pedley A.M. Kim D. Xia C.

Benkovic S.J. Spatial colocalization and functional link of purinosomes with mitochondria.Science. 2016; 351: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At early time points, purine-depleted HeTOFLI cells expressing FGAMS-EYFP displayed a diffuse phenotype that transitioned into discrete granules as time progressed. Figure 1 shows the condensation of FGAMS-EYFP in a representative cell at 12 h post-IPTG induction. Intensity values across a defined region within the same cell before and after triggering condensation verified that the FGAMS-EYFP within the cell was being concentrated into these assemblies (Fig. 1B) further implying that the purinosome is capable of undergoing an LLPS. Three properties are widely shared amongst commonly reported liquid-like condensates: the free exchange of molecules in and out of the condensate, the spherical nature of the protein assembly, and the ability of condensates to fuse when in close contact (15Banani S.F. Lee H.O. Hyman A.A. Rosen M.K. Biomolecular condensates: Organizers of cellular biochemistry.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). We asked whether the purinosome exhibits these characteristics. Previously, enzymes within the DNPB pathway have been shown to freely exchange between the bulk solvent and the purinosome by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (5An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28Kyoung M. Russell S.J. Kohnhorst C.L. Esemoto N.N. An S. Dynamic architecture of the purinosome involved in human de novo purine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The calculated diffusion coefficients for the various enzymes as they assemble into purinosomes suggest that the complex is formed through several multivalent interactions in a step-wise manner (28Kyoung M. Russell S.J. Kohnhorst C.L. Esemoto N.N. An S. Dynamic architecture of the purinosome involved in human de novo purine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We continued our investigation by exploring the spherical nature of purinosomes in purine-depleted HeLa cells by lattice light sheet microscopy (29An S. Jeon M. Kennedy E.L. Kyoung M. Phase-separated condensates of metabolic complexes in living cells: Purinosome and glucosome.Methods Enzymol. 2019; 628: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A characterization of 41 purinosomes demonstrated that those segmented FGAMS-mCherry assemblies were spherical with an average sphericity of 0.97 ± 0.03 (Figs. 2, A and B and S2). Last, we monitored the movement of purinosomes over a 5 min time course (one image every 5 s) using instantaneous structured illumination high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. In several instances, purinosomes, as denoted by FGAMS-enhanced GFP puncta, appear to merge with one another to form larger punctate structures. Figure 2 shows one such event in which purinosome 1 fuses with purinosome 2 at 365 s (Figs. 2, C–E and S3A, Movie S1). The area of the coalesced purinosome was roughly the sum of the two purinosomes combined (Fig. 2F). Together, these data provide overwhelming support that the purinosome is an example of a liquid condensate, and the process of enzyme condensation is likely a regulatory mechanism leveraged in purine metabolism. The multivalency observed in biomolecular condensates can be induced through a variety of mechanisms including protein oligomerization and self-assembly via IDRs or nucleic acid scaffolds. Physicochemical features, as identified by amino acid sequence, within proteins shown to phase transition have given insight into other proteins within the human proteome that might also drive biomolecular condensate formation by self-assembly. A classical characteristic that differentiates a protein that phase transitions from one that does not is the presence of long IDRs and/or low-complexity domains (15Banani S.F. Lee H.O. Hyman A.A.

Therefore, bioinformatic analyses were conducted to predict the likelihood that any of the enzymes in the DNPB pathway have such propensity to drive the observed LLPS.

In addition, we also queried whether any of these enzymes had stretches of low complexity using the SEG algorithm (36Wootton J.C. Non-globular domains in protein sequences: Automated segmentation using complexity measures.Comput. Chem. 1994; 18: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Low-complexity domains were identified in all enzymes except for phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS) and aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) (Fig. S4); however, the length in any of these regions is relatively very short compared with reported phase-separated proteins (37Kato M.

Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Prediction of sequence-dependent and mutational effects on the aggregation of peptides and proteins.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) and Waltz algorithms (40Maurer-Stroh S. Debulpaep M. Kuemmerer N. Lopez de la Paz M. Martins I.C. Reumers J. Morris K.L.

Methods. 2010; 7: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The TANGO algorithm accounts for the general physicochemical determinants of protein β-aggregation, whereas Waltz algorithm identifies sequences that promote amyloid structures over amorphous aggregates. Results from the TANGO algorithm predicted that all the pathway enzymes have some degree of aggregation as noted by more than five consecutive amino acids with an aggregation tendency greater than 5% (Fig. S5). The purinosome core proteins (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase [PPAT], glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase [GART], and FGAMS) were more aggregation prone, and several of these stretches also predicted to contribute to the formation of amyloid-like assemblies by the Waltz algorithm (Fig. S5). These results are consistent with the overall tendency of globular proteins to have a high degree of β-aggregation nucleating regions when compared with intrinsically disordered proteins (41Linding R. Schymkowitz J. Rousseau F. Diella F. Serrano L. A comparative study of the relationship between protein structure and beta-aggregation in globular and intrinsically disordered proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar); however, this does necessarily suggest that these proteins form aggregates. These identified stretches likely are critical for the overall proper folding, stability, and activity of the protein. Extended nutrient starvation of human cells has been known to induce a stress response to inhibit protein translation and trigger the phase separation of proteins into stress granules (42Reineke L.C. Cheema S.A. Dubrulle J. Neilson J.R. Chronic starvation induces noncanonical pro-death stress granules.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs220244PubMed Google Scholar). We have long prescribed that this is not the case with the purinosome because of its lack of association with the stress granule–nucleating protein G3BP1 (Ras-GAP SH3 binding protein 1) and to differences in their defining characteristics with the purinosome (6Pedley A.M.

Recent work has suggested that a stress granule might not be comprised of all the traditional protein markers and that the composition is dependent on the type and duration of the stress (44Aulas A. Fay M.M. Lyons S.M. Achorn C.A. Kedersha N. Anderson P. Ivanov P. Stress-specific differences in assembly and composition of stress granules and related foci.J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether poly(A)+ mRNA is present within the purinosome suggesting that these condensates are part of the RNA granule family void of G3BP1. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, the colocalization of poly(A)+ mRNAs with purinosomes was assessed. Consistent with this body being distinct from stress granules and P-bodies, no colocalization was observed (Fig. S6A). We also investigated whether the purinosome might be a result of nutrient-deprived stalled translational initiation complexes, a known phenomenon giving rise to early stage stress granule formation (42Reineke L.C. Cheema S.A. Dubrulle J. Neilson J.R. Chronic starvation induces noncanonical pro-death stress granules.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs220244PubMed Google Scholar). Purine-depleted HeLa cells were grown in the presence or the absence of purines, and the repression of translation analyzed by the induction of Ser51 phosphorylation on eurkaryotic translation initiation factor 2α. Using a 1 h arsenite treatment as a positive control, we show that purine-depleted HeLa cells do not have repressed translation and are consistent with HeLa cells grown in the presence of purines (Fig. S6B). We also investigated whether overexpression of FGAMS by transient transfection might repress translation. Similar to the untransfected HeLa cells, no increase in the phosphorylation of eurkaryotic translation initiation factor 2α was observed (Fig. S6B). Together, all these data would suggest that despite the chronic starvation of HeLa cells for purines, the purinosome is not an example of a stress granule and that condensate formation is not driven by the presence of an RNA scaffold. Nutrient starvation can also lead to changes in intracellular pH previously shown to promote an LLPS in eukaryotes (45Kroschwald S. Munder M.C. Maharana S. Franzmann T.M. Richter D. Ruer M.

https://openalex.org/W4220682359,"Many patients with rare diseases experience a diagnostic delay. Although several quantitative studies have been reported, few studies have used a qualitative approach to directly examine how patients with rare disease obtain a diagnosis and why it takes many years. In this study, we focused on hereditary angioedema (HAE), which has been reported to have long diagnostic delays, despite the knowledge that not having an accurate diagnosis can cause life-threatening problems.The objective of this study was to analyze patients' experiences and elucidate why it takes a long time to reach a diagnosis of HAE. We also aimed to propose possible solutions for the problem.A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted. Nine patients who took over 5 years from the presentation of initial symptoms to an HAE diagnosis participated. The contents of the interviews were subjected to an inductive contents analysis.By analyzing the patients' struggles that were experienced during the undiagnosed period, three themes were generated: (1) acceptance and resignation towards their conditions, (2) proactive search for a cause, and (3) independent efforts outside of the hospital. While a few patients continued to seek out a diagnosis during the undiagnosed period, many had become accustomed to their health condition without suspecting a rare disease.We found that one of the most important factors related to the prolonged undiagnosed period is the lack of suspicion of a rare disease by patients and their medical professionals. While current policies tend to focus on the period from suspecting rare diseases to the time of a clear diagnosis, our results strongly suggest that measures are needed to facilitate patients and clinicians to become aware of rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4220808161,"Phosphate homeostasis, mediated by dietary intake, renal absorption, and bone deposition, is incompletely understood because of the uncharacterized roles of numerous implicated protein factors. Here, we identified a novel role for one such element, regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14), suggested by genome-wide association studies to associate with dysregulated Pi levels. We show that human RGS14 possesses a carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand required for sodium phosphate cotransporter 2a (NPT2A) and sodium hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1)-mediated renal Pi transport. In addition, we found using isotope uptake measurements combined with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays, siRNA knockdown, pull-down and overlay assays, and molecular modeling that secreted proteins parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 inhibited Pi uptake by inducing dissociation of the NPT2A-NHERF1 complex. PTH failed to affect Pi transport in cells expressing RGS14, suggesting that it suppresses hormone-sensitive but not basal Pi uptake. Interestingly, RGS14 did not affect PTH-directed G protein activation or cAMP formation, implying a postreceptor site of action. Further pull-down experiments and direct binding assays indicated that NPT2A and RGS14 bind distinct PDZ domains on NHERF1. We showed that RGS14 expression in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells blocked the effects of PTH and fibroblast growth factor 23 and stabilized the NPT2A-NHERF1 complex. In contrast, RGS14 genetic variants bearing mutations in the PDZ ligand disrupted RGS14 binding to NHERF1 and subsequent PTH-sensitive Pi transport. In conclusion, these findings identify RGS14 as a novel regulator of hormone-sensitive Pi transport. The results suggest that changes in RGS14 function or abundance may contribute to the hormone resistance and hyperphosphatemia observed in kidney diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4220837416,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) persist in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus into adulthood and are essential for both neurogenesis and neural circuit integration. Exosomes have also been shown to play vital roles in regulating biological processes of receptor cells as a medium for cell-to-cell communication signaling molecules. The precise molecular mechanisms of exosome-mediated signaling, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we found that exosomes produced by denervated hippocampi following fimbria-fornix transection could promote the differentiation of hippocampal neural precursor cells into cholinergic neurons in coculture with NSCs. Furthermore, we found that 14 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were upregulated in hippocampal exosomes after fimbria-fornix transection using high-throughput RNA-Seq technology. We further characterized the function and mechanism by which the upregulated circRNA Acbd6 (acyl-CoA-binding domain-containing 6) promoted the differentiation of NSCs into cholinergic neurons using RT-quantitative PCR, Western blot, ELISA, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence assay. By luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that circAcbd6 functioned as an endogenous miR-320-5p sponge to inhibit miR-320-5p activity, resulting in increased oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 2 expression with subsequent facilitation of NSC differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest that circAcbd6 promotes differentiation of NSCs into cholinergic neurons via miR-320-5p/oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 2 axis, which contribute important insights to our understanding of how circRNAs regulate neurogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W4226257974,"Neuronal apoptosis is one of the main pathological processes of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) and is involved in the development of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in neonates. Atorvastatin has been found to have neuroprotective effects in some nervous system diseases, but its role in regulating the pathogenesis of neonatal HIBD remains elusive. Thus, this study aimed to explore the effects and related mechanisms of atorvastatin on the regulation of neuronal apoptosis after HIBD in newborn rats. The rat HIBD model and the neuronal oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model were established routinely. Atorvastatin, cAMP inhibitor (SQ22536), and BDNF inhibitor (ANA-12) were used to treat HIBD rats and OGD neurons. Cerebral infarction, learning and memory ability, cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF signaling molecules, and apoptosis-related indicators (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl2) were then examined. In vivo, atorvastatin reduced cerebral infarction, improved learning and memory ability, decreased the number of TUNEL-positive neurons, inhibited the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2, and activated the cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway in the cerebral cortex after HIBD. In vitro, atorvastatin also decreased the apoptosis-related indicators and activated the cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway in neurons after OGD. Furthermore, inhibition of cAMP or BDNF attenuated the effect of atorvastatin on the reduction of neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that atorvastatin inhibits HIBD-induced neuronal apoptosis and alleviates brain injury in neonatal rats mainly by activating the cAMP/PKA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway. In conclusion, atorvastatin may be developed as a potential drug for the treatment of neonatal HIE."
https://openalex.org/W4220844631,"Understanding the effect of anthropogenic disturbance, and its interaction with carnivores and their prey, is crucial to support the conservation of threatened carnivores, particularly in rapidly changing landscapes. Based on systematic camera-trap sampling of four protected areas in Riau Province of central Sumatra, we assessed the habitat occupancy and spatiotemporal overlap between people, potential carnivore prey, and four threatened species of medium-sized or large carnivores: Sumatran tigers ( Panthera tigris sumatrae ), Malayan sun bears ( Helarctos malayanus ), dholes ( Cuon alpinus ), and Sunda clouded leopards ( Neofelis diardi ). To assess spatial overlap of target species, we used single-species occupancy models and applied a Species Interaction Factor (SIF) to conditional two-species occupancy models. We also used kernel density estimation (KDE) to assess temporal overlap among these species. Our habitat use models showed that altitude (elevation) strongly influenced the occupancy of all large carnivores and potential prey species. Except for Sunda clouded leopards, the occurrence of large carnivore species was positively related to the spatial co-occurrence of humans (SIF &gt; 1). In addition, we found that sun bears and dholes both exhibited high spatial overlap with tigers, and that sun bears alone exhibited high temporal overlap with people. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the contemporary ecology of carnivores and their prey in rapidly changing, southeast Asian landscapes. Such knowledge is important to the conservation and recovery of large carnivores in conservation hotspots that are increasingly dominated by humans across Sumatra, as well as globally."
https://openalex.org/W4220885928,"Cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) of non-enzymatic origin are mainly found in meat, fish, eggs and milk, mostly originating from the type of feeding, processing and storage. To verify the significance of COPs as biomarkers of cholesterol autoxidation and milk freshness, we quantified them in chocolates containing whole milk powders (WMPs) of increasing shelf-lives (i.e. 20, 120, and 180 days). Non-enzymatic total COPs (both free and esterified) ranged from 256.57 ± 11.97 to 445.82 ± 11.88 ng/g, increasing proportionally to the shelf-life of the WMPs, thus reflecting the ingredients’ freshness. Based on the expected theoretical COPs, the effect of processing was quantitatively less significant in the generation of oxysterols (41–44%) than the contribution of the autoxidation of the WMPs over time (56–59%), pointing to the shelf-life as the primary determinant of COPs. Lastly, we quantified COPs of major commercial milk chocolates on the Italian market, which followed a similar distribution (from 240.79 ± 11.74 to 475.12 ± 12.58 ng/g). Although further replications of this work are needed, this study reports preliminary results and a practical example of a first application of non-enzymatic COPs as markers to further quantify and characterize the nutritional quality and freshness, not only of ingredients but also of composite products."

The rankings obtained from this index have a high degree of association with those provided by the WEF. The main benefit of this index over the WEF index is that it does not include valuations from opinion surveys given to business executives and/or entrepreneurs of the countries included in the index (soft data). Consequently, the rankings from this alternative index are not affected by political biases or individual interests as it is elaborated only including officially published objective data."
https://openalex.org/W4220725068,"Cell-free transcription and translation systems promise to accelerate and simplify the engineering of proteins, biological circuits and metabolic pathways. Their encapsulation on microfluidic platforms can generate millions of cell-free reactions in picoliter volume droplets. However, current methods struggle to create DNA diversity between droplets while also reaching sufficient protein expression levels. In particular, efficient multi-gene expression has remained elusive. We here demonstrate that co-encapsulation of DNA-coated beads with a defined cell-free system allows high protein expression while also supporting genetic diversity between individual droplets. We optimize DNA loading on commercially available microbeads through direct binding as well as through the sequential coupling of up to three genes via a solid-phase Golden Gate assembly or BxB1 integrase-based recombineering. Encapsulation with an off-the-shelf microfluidics device allows for single or multiple protein expression from a single DNA-coated bead per 14 pL droplet. We envision that this approach will help to scale up and parallelize the rapid prototyping of more complex biological systems."

The microbiological aetiology of the infection was correlated with patients' demographic characteristics and their clinical course.There were 725 cases of CNS infection during the study period, meningitis (77.4%) was the most common, followed by brain abscess (11.6%), encephalitis (9.9%) and spinal infection (1.1%). Infants (24.3%, p<0.0001) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians (175/666 local residents, 26.3%, p<0.0001) were over-represented in the cohort. A pathogen was identified in 513 cases (70.8%); this was viral in 299 (41.2%), bacterial in 175 (24.1%) and fungal in 35 (4.8%). Cryptococcal meningitis (24 cases) was diagnosed as frequently as pneumococcal meningitis (24 cases). There were only 2 CNS infections with a S. pneumoniae serotype in the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine after its addition to the National Immunisation schedule in 2011. Tropical pathogens-including Cryptococcus species (9/84, 11%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (7/84, 8%) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (5/84, 6%)-were among the most common causes of brain abscess. However, arboviral CNS infections were rare, with only one locally acquired case-a dengue infection in 2009-diagnosed in the entire study period. Intensive Care Unit admission was necessary in 14.3%; the overall case fatality rate was 4.4%.Tropical pathogens cause CNS infections as commonly as traditional bacterial pathogens in this region of tropical Australia. However, despite being highlighted in the national consensus guidelines, arboviruses were identified very rarely. Prompt access to sophisticated diagnostic and supportive care in Australia's well-resourced public health system is likely to have contributed to the cohort's low case-fatality rate."
https://openalex.org/W4220810648,"As a new transportation tool, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), has a broad application prospect in logistics distribution, especially for mountainous cities with complex terrain. Due to the limited delivery conditions of UAV, considering the advantages of traditional vehicle delivery, this paper proposes a joint delivery mode of UAV and vehicle, and designs three steps for the joint delivery problem of single UAV and single vehicle: first, mark all special nodes; Secondly, the route of UAV and vehicle is planned; Finally, the total delivery route is optimized to minimize the total delivery distance. Genetic algorithm and single distribution terminal optimization are used to solve the problem, and the joint delivery in this paper is compared with the traditional vehicle delivery and the independent delivery of UAV and vehicle. The results show that UAV and vehicle can cooperate with each other to complete the delivery of all customer demand nodes, and the joint delivery of UAV and vehicle can effectively reduce the total delivery distance. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of UAV's maximum load, maximum flight distance, relative speed between UAV and vehicle, and road impedance coefficient is carried out. By relaxing the restrictions of UAV, the UAV can deliver more customers at a single time, and it complete the delivery task with vehicles efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W4220918018,"The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. The current research priority is to provide viable treatments for patients who have drug-resistant EGFR mutations. We evaluated the drug sensitivity of various EGFR mutants to monotherapies and combination therapies of EGFR-TKIs. In vitro, the transforming potential and drug sensitivity of 357 EGFR variants were assessed. In vivo, we tested the sensitivity of EGFR variants to different regimens of EGFR-TKIs by examining changes in the proportion of each variant within the tumor. Out of 357 variants thoroughly examined for transforming activities, 144 (40.3%) and 282 (79.0%) transformed 3T3 and Ba/F3 cells, respectively. Among the latter variants, 50 (17.7%) were found to be resistant or only partly resistant to osimertinib or afatinib. Four of 25 afatinib-resistant variants (16%) were sensitive to osimertinib, whereas 25 of 46 osimertinib-resistant variants (54.3%) were sensitive to afatinib. Despite the lack of a synergistic impact, TKI combination treatment effectively reduced in vivo the heterogeneous tumors composed of 3T3 cells with different EGFR variants. Regimens starting with afatinib and subsequently switched to osimertinib suppressed tumor development more efficiently than the opposite combination. Combination EGFR-TKI treatment may decrease tumor growth and prevent the development of resistant variants. This work created an experimental model of a heterogeneous tumor to find the best combination therapy regimen and proposes a basic notion of EGFR-TKI combination therapy to enhance the prognosis of NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4221020540,"Protein lysine carbamylation is an irreversible post-translational modification resulting in generation of homocitrulline (N-ε-carbamyllysine), which no longer possesses a charged ε-amino moiety. Two distinct pathways can promote protein carbamylation. One results from urea decomposition, forming an equilibrium mixture of cyanate (CNO-) and the reactive electrophile isocyanate. The second pathway involves myeloperoxidase (MPO)-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate (SCN-), yielding CNO- and isocyanate. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is a known target for MPO-catalyzed modification in vivo, converting the cardioprotective lipoprotein into a proatherogenic and proapoptotic one. We hypothesized that monitoring site-specific carbamylation patterns of apoA-I recovered from human atherosclerotic aorta could provide insights into the chemical environment within the artery wall. To test this, we first mapped carbamyllysine obtained from in vitro carbamylation of apoA-I by both the urea-driven (nonenzymatic) and inflammatory-driven (enzymatic) pathways in lipid-poor and lipidated apoA-I (reconstituted HDL). Our results suggest that lysine residues within proximity of the known MPO-binding sites on HDL are preferentially targeted by the enzymatic (MPO) carbamylation pathway, whereas the nonenzymatic pathway leads to nearly uniform distribution of carbamylated lysine residues along the apoA-I polypeptide chain. Quantitative proteomic analyses of apoA-I from human aortic atheroma identified 16 of the 21 lysine residues as carbamylated and suggested that the majority of apoA-I carbamylation in vivo occurs on ""lipid-poor"" apoA-I forms via the nonenzymatic CNO- pathway. Monitoring patterns of apoA-I carbamylation recovered from arterial tissues can provide insights into both apoA-I structure and the chemical environment within human atheroma."

https://openalex.org/W3198256995,"We propose a general model of unweighted and undirected networks having the scale-free property and fractal nature. Unlike the existing models of fractal scale-free networks (FSFNs), the present model can systematically and widely change the network structure. In this model, an FSFN is iteratively formed by replacing each edge in the previous generation network with a small graph called a generator. The choice of generators enables us to control the scale-free property, fractality, and other structural properties of hierarchical FSFNs. We calculate theoretically various characteristic quantities of networks, such as the exponent of the power-law degree distribution, fractal dimension, average clustering coefficient, global clustering coefficient, and joint probability describing the nearest-neighbor degree correlation. As an example of analyses of phenomena occurring on FSFNs, we also present the critical point and critical exponents of the bond-percolation transition on infinite FSFNs, which is related to the robustness of networks against edge removal. By comparing the percolation critical points of FSFNs whose structural properties are the same as each other except for the clustering nature, we clarify the effect of the clustering on the robustness of FSFNs. As demonstrated by this example, the present model makes it possible to elucidate how a specific structural property influences a phenomenon occurring on FSFNs by varying systematically the structures of FSFNs. Finally, we extend our model for deterministic FSFNs to a model of non-deterministic ones by introducing asymmetric generators and reexamine all characteristic quantities and the percolation problem for such non-deterministic FSFNs."
https://openalex.org/W4220698810,"The Hippo signaling pathway regulates tissue growth and cell fate, and its dysregulation can induce tumorigenesis. When Hippo is activated by cell-cell contact, extracellular signals, or cell polarity among others, the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) kinase catalyzes inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) to maintain YAP in the cytoplasm or promote its degradation. Separately, calmodulin is a Ca2+-dependent protein that modulates the activity of target proteins and regulates several signaling cascades; however, its potential role in the Hippo pathway has not been identified. Here, using diverse experimental approaches, including in vitro binding analyses, kinase assays, RT-PCR, and confocal microscopy, we reveal that calmodulin promotes Hippo signaling. We show that purified YAP and LATS1 bind directly to calmodulin and form a Ca2+-dependent ternary complex in vitro. Importantly, Ca2+/calmodulin directly stimulated the activity of LATS1 kinase. In cultured mammalian cells, we demonstrated that endogenous YAP and LATS1 coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous calmodulin. In cells with activated Hippo signaling, we show that calmodulin antagonism significantly (i) decreases YAP phosphorylation, (ii) increases expression of two Hippo target genes (connective tissue growth factor [CTGF] and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 [CYR61]) that regulate cell proliferation and tumor progression, and (iii) enhances the interaction of YAP with its major transcription factor, thereby facilitating transcription of target genes. Collectively, our data demonstrate that calmodulin activates the Hippo kinase cascade and inhibits YAP activity via a direct interaction with LATS1 and YAP, thereby uncovering previously unidentified crosstalk between the Ca2+/calmodulin and Hippo signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4220706874,"The microbial communities of lake sediments have the potential to serve as valuable bioindicators and integrators of watershed land-use and water quality; however, the relative sensitivity of these communities to physio-chemical and geographical parameters must be demonstrated at taxonomic resolutions that are feasible by current sequencing and bioinformatic approaches. The geologically diverse and lake-rich state of Minnesota (USA) is uniquely situated to address this potential because of its variability in ecological region, lake type, and watershed land-use. In this study, we selected twenty lakes with varying physio-chemical properties across four ecological regions of Minnesota. Our objectives were to (i) evaluate the diversity and composition of the bacterial community at the sediment-water interface and (ii) determine how lake location and watershed land-use impact aqueous chemistry and influence bacterial community structure. Our 16S rRNA amplicon data from lake sediment cores, at two depth intervals, data indicate that sediment communities are more likely to cluster by ecological region rather than any individual lake properties (e.g., trophic status, total phosphorous concentration, lake depth). However, composition is tied to a given lake, wherein samples from the same core were more alike than samples collected at similar depths across lakes. Our results illustrate the diversity within lake sediment microbial communities and provide insight into relationships between taxonomy, physicochemical, and geographic properties of north temperate lakes."

This study aimed to examine the effect of mode of conception on breastfeeding outcomes during the first two months postpartum and identify the potential mediating pathways for this relationship.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a sample of 3,565 women with live births. Participants were classified by mode of conception as follows: fertile women who conceived naturally (fertile women; n = 2,857), women with infertility who conceived naturally (sub-fertile women; n = 483), and women with infertility who conceived through ART (women with infertility; n = 310). The infant-feeding patterns were assessed with four-time points before two months postpartum. Binary and multinomial logistic regression and causal mediation analyses were performed.The rates of breastfeeding initiation and discontinuation across modes of conception were similar. However, infertile and sub-fertile women had 37% (95% CI 1.02, 1.83) and 56% (95% CI 1.06, 2.27) increased risks of introducing formula before the first week postpartum, respectively, and 35% (95% CI 1.01, 1.82) and 52% (95% CI 1.04, 2.24) higher risks of exclusive breastfeeding for less than one week, respectively, compared to fertile women. The relationships were mainly mediated through multiple gestation and admission to neonatal/pediatric intensive care units (NICU/PICU; proportions of mediation were over 50%). The effects of mode of conception on breastfeeding outcomes became not significant in cases of singleton birth.Sub-fertile women and women with infertility intended to breastfeed but experienced higher perinatal risks in the early postpartum period. Multiple gestation and admission to NICU/PICU forced them to introduce formula earlier than preferred, thus leading to a shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Single embryo transfer policy and breastfeeding support in NICU/PICU could help those women achieve positive early breastfeeding outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220795306,"Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) can cause lethal hemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD) in Asian elephants and is the largest cause of death in captive juvenile Asian elephants in North America and Europe. EEHV-HD also has been documented in captive and wild elephants in their natural range countries. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent lethal EEHV infection would significantly improve conservation efforts for this endangered species. Recent studies from our laboratory suggest that EEHV morbidity and mortality are often associated with primary infection. Therefore, we aim to generate a vaccine, particularly for EEHV1 naïve animals, with the goal of preventing lethal EEHV-HD. To address this goal, we generated a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) recombinant virus expressing a truncated form of glycoprotein B (gBΔfur731) from EEHV1A, the strain associated with the majority of lethal EEHV cases. Vaccination of CD-1 mice with this recombinant virus induced robust antibody and polyfunctional T cell responses significantly above mice inoculated with wild-type MVA. Although the vaccine-induced T cell response was mainly observed in CD8+ T cell populations, the CD4+ T cell response was also polyfunctional. No adverse responses to vaccination were observed. Overall, our data demonstrates that MVA-gBΔfur731 stimulates robust humoral and cell-mediated responses, supporting its potential translation for use in elephants."
https://openalex.org/W4220834332,"Invasive fungal infections, which kill more than 1.6 million patients each year worldwide, are difficult to treat due to the limited number of antifungal drugs (azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes) and the emergence of antifungal resistance. The transcription factor Crz1, a key regulator of cellular stress responses and virulence, is an attractive therapeutic target because this protein is absent in human cells. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 approach to generate isogenic crz1Δ strains in two clinical isolates of caspofungin-resistant C. glabrata to analyze the role of this transcription factor in susceptibility to echinocandins, stress tolerance, biofilm formation, and pathogenicity in both non-vertebrate (Galleria mellonella) and vertebrate (mice) models of candidiasis. In these clinical isolates, CRZ1 disruption restores the susceptibility to echinocandins in both in vitro and in vivo models, and affects their oxidative stress response, biofilm formation, cell size, and pathogenicity. These results strongly suggest that Crz1 inhibitors may play an important role in the development of novel therapeutic agents against fungal infections considering the emergence of antifungal resistance and the low number of available antifungal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4220909821,"Posttranslational addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) moiety (SUMOylation) has been implicated in pathologies such as brain ischemia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and neurodegeneration. However, nuclear enrichment of SUMO pathway proteins has made it difficult to ascertain how ion channels, proteins that are typically localized to and function at the plasma membrane, and mitochondria are SUMOylated. Here, we report that the trophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates SUMO proteins both spatially and temporally in neurons. We show that BDNF signaling via the receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B facilitates nuclear exodus of SUMO proteins and subsequent enrichment within dendrites. Of the various SUMO E3 ligases, we found that PIAS-3 dendrite enrichment in response to BDNF signaling specifically modulates subsequent ERK1/2 kinase pathway signaling. In addition, we found the PIAS-3 RING and Ser/Thr domains, albeit in opposing manners, functionally inhibit GABA-mediated inhibition. Finally, using oxygen-glucose deprivation as an in vitro model for ischemia, we show that BDNF-tropomyosin-related kinase B signaling negatively impairs clustering of the main scaffolding protein at GABAergic postsynapse, gephyrin, whereby reducing GABAergic neurotransmission postischemia. SUMOylation-defective gephyrin K148R/K724R mutant transgene expression reversed these ischemia-induced changes in gephyrin cluster density. Taken together, these data suggest that BDNF signaling facilitates the temporal relocation of nuclear-enriched SUMO proteins to dendrites to influence postsynaptic protein SUMOylation."
https://openalex.org/W4220925821,"In two same-different matching experiments we investigated whether transposed-character effects can be modulated by the horizontal displacement or inter-character spacing of target stimuli (strings of 6 consonants, digits, or symbols). Reference and target stimuli could be identical or differed either by transposing or substituting two characters. Transposition costs (greater difficulty in detecting a difference with transpositions compared with substitutions) were greater for letter stimuli compared to both digit and symbol stimuli in both experiments. In Experiment 1, half of the targets were displayed at the center of the screen and the other half were shifted by two character-positions to the left or to the right, whereas the reference was always presented at the center of the screen. Target displacement made the task harder and caused an increase in transposition costs whatever the type of stimulus. In Experiment 2, all stimuli were presented at the center of the screen and the inter-character spacing of target stimuli was increased by one character space on half of the trials. Increased spacing made the task harder and paradoxically caused an increase in transposition costs, but only significantly so for letter stimuli, and only in the discriminability (d') measure. These results suggest that target location and inter-character spacing manipulations caused an increase in positional uncertainty during the processing of location-specific complex features prior to activation of a location-invariant representation of character-in-string order. The hypothesized existence of a letter-specific order encoding mechanism accounts for the greater transposition costs seen with letter stimuli, as well as the greater modulation of these effects by an increase in inter-character spacing seen in discriminability (d')."
https://openalex.org/W4220964172,"Longitudinal and behavioral preclinical animal studies generate complex data, which may not be well matched to statistical approaches common in this literature. Analyses that do not adequately account for complexity may result in overly optimistic study conclusions, with consequences for reproducibility and translational decision-making. Recent work interrogating methodological shortcomings in animal research has not yet comprehensively investigated statistical shortcomings in the analysis of complex longitudinal and behavioral data. To this end, the current cross-sectional meta-research study rigorously reviewed published mouse or rat controlled experiments for motor rehabilitation in three neurologic conditions to evaluate statistical choices and reporting. Medline via PubMed was queried in February 2020 for English-language articles published January 1, 2017- December 31, 2019. Included were articles that used rat or mouse models of stroke, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain injury, employed a therapeutic controlled experimental design to determine efficacy, and assessed at least one functional behavioral assessment or global evaluation of function. 241 articles from 99 journals were evaluated independently by a team of nine raters. Articles were assessed for statistical handling of non-independence, animal attrition, outliers, ordinal data, and multiplicity. Exploratory analyses evaluated whether transparency or statistical choices differed as a function of journal factors. A majority of articles failed to account for sources of non-independence in the data (74-93%) and/or did not analytically account for mid-treatment animal attrition (78%). Ordinal variables were often treated as continuous (37%), outliers were predominantly not mentioned (83%), and plots often concealed the distribution of the data (51%) Statistical choices and transparency did not differ with regards to journal rank or reporting requirements. Statistical misapplication can result in invalid experimental findings and inadequate reporting obscures errors. Clinician-scientists evaluating preclinical work for translational promise should be mindful of commonplace errors. Interventions are needed to improve statistical decision-making in preclinical behavioral neurosciences research."
https://openalex.org/W4221114939,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, melanoma and prostate cancer. Men face BRCA-related cancer risks as women do. However, there is considerably less research on the psychological determinants of men engaging in BRCA1/2-related cancer prevention compared to women. The present research aimed to study the determinants of men's motivations to engage in genetic screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 through the lens of the Health Action Process Approach. One hundred and twenty-five men (mean age = 58.53 y/o, SD = 10.37) completed an online survey. The intention to undergo genetic screening for BRCA1/2 mutations in men was significantly and positively associated with self-efficacy and risk perception. Moreover, having offspring positively affected intention as well. The relationships between intention (and planning) and positive outcome expectancies, age, and family history of breast-related cancer were not statistically significant. Most information on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is tailored to women due to the availability of effective surgical risk reduction procedures for women's breast and ovarian cancer. Future research should focus on the best methods of communicating informed decision-making for men facing the risk of such mutations."

We aimed to determine if there was a transcriptomic signature of AIH in the peripheral blood and investigate underlying biologic pathways revealed by gene expression analysis. Whole blood RNA from 75 AIH patients and 25 healthy volunteers was extracted and sequenced. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 249 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in AIH patients compared to controls. Using a random forest algorithm, we determined that less than 10 genes were sufficient to differentiate the two groups in our cohort. Interferon signaling was more active in AIH samples compared to controls, regardless of treatment status. Pegivirus sequences were detected in five AIH samples and 1 healthy sample. The gene expression data and clinical metadata were used to determine 12 genes that were significantly associated with advanced fibrosis in AIH. AIH patients with a partial response to therapy demonstrated decreased evidence of a CD8+ T cell gene expression signal. These findings represent progress in understanding a disease in need of better tests, therapies, and biomarkers."

https://openalex.org/W4220964228,"Anticipating the increase in water demand in an urban area requires us to properly understand daily human movement driven by population size, land use, and amenity types among others. Mobility data from phones can capture human movement, but not only is this hard to obtain, but it also does not tell where the population is going. Previous studies have shown that amenity types can be used to predict people's movement patterns; thus, we propose using crowd-sourced amenity data and other open data sources as reasonable proxies for human mobility. Here we present a framework for predicting water consumption in areas with established service water connections and generalize it to underserved areas. Our work used features such as geography, population, and domestic consumption ratio and compared the prediction performance of various machine learning algorithms. We used 44 months of monthly water consumption data from January 2018 to July 2021, aggregated across 1790 district metering areas (DMAs) in the east service zone of Metro Manila. Results show that amenity counts reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) of predictions by 1,440 m3/month or as much as 5.73% compared to just using population and topology features. Predicted consumption during the pandemic also improved by as much as 1,447 m3/month or nearly 16% compared to just using population and topology features. We find that Gradient Boosting Trees are the best models to handle the data and feature set used in this work. Finally, the developed model is robust to disruptions in human mobility, such as lockdowns, indicating that amenities are sufficient to predict water consumption."

We aimed to compare six DNA extraction techniques applied to Loa loa microfilariae in order to evaluate the purity and integrity of extracts in terms of quality and quantity.The microfilariae were purified via a Percoll gradient procedure with blood from hyper-microfilaremic individuals (> 30,000 microfilaria [mf]/ml). DNA extraction was carried out in duplicate at a rate of 350,000 mf/tube for each technique: phenol/chloroform, commercial Qiagen kit, salting out, Tris-EDTA, methanol, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The integrity, purity, concentration, and quality of the DNA extracts were successively verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry (A260/A280 and A260/A230 wavelength ratio), Qubit fluorometry, and endonuclease and polymerase activity. The six techniques were compared on the basis of the following parameters: concentration, purity, efficiency, effectiveness, integrity, safety of the technique, as well as cost and duration of the protocol.The ratios of the optical densities of the extracts A260/A280 and A260/A230 were, respectively: phenol/chloroform (1.82; 1.11), Qiagen (1.93; 1.36), salting-out (1.9; 2.04), Tris-EDTA (1.99; 1.183), methanol (2.126; 1.343), and CTAB (2.01; 2.426). The DNA yield was: phenol/chloroform (3.920 μg), Qiagen (10.280 μg), salting-out (10.390 μg), Tris-EDTA (0.5528 μg), methanol (0.1036 μg), and CTAB (1.115 μg). Endonuclease and polymerase activity was demonstrated by digestion of DNA and through amplicons obtained via polymerase chain reaction assays with phenol/chloroform, Qiagen, and salting-out extracts.The phenol/chloroform, Qiagen, and salting-out DNA extracts were all of good quality. Salting out had the best yield followed by Qiagen and then phenol/chloroform. Endonuclease and polymerase activity was effective in all three extracts despite the presence of some contaminants. These methods are therefore suitable for the extraction of DNA from Loa loa microfilariae. Tris-EDTA and methanol did not show adequate sensitivity, while CTAB was found to be unsuitable."
https://openalex.org/W4221061999,"Chronic inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are complex syndromes with diverse clinical symptoms due to multiple pathophysiological conditions. In this study, using common and shared risk factors for the exacerbation of asthma and COPD, we sought to clarify the exacerbation-prone phenotypes beyond disease labels, and to specifically investigate the role of the IL4RA gene polymorphism, which is related to type 2 inflammation, in these exacerbation-prone phenotypes.The study population comprised patients with asthma (n = 117), asthma-COPD overlap (ACO; n = 37) or COPD (n = 48) and a history of exacerbation within the previous year. Cluster analyses were performed using factors associated with both asthma and COPD exacerbation. The association of the IL4RA gene polymorphism rs8832 with each exacerbation-prone phenotype was evaluated by multinomial logistic analyses using non-asthma non-COPD healthy adults as controls (n = 1,529). In addition, the genetic influence of rs8832 was also examined in asthma patients with allergic rhinitis and no history of exacerbation (n = 130).Two-step cluster analyses identified five clusters that did not necessarily correspond to the diagnostic disease labels. Cluster 1 was characterized by high eosinophil counts, cluster 2 was characterized by smokers with impaired lung function, cluster 3 was characterized by the presence of gastroesophageal reflux, cluster 4 was characterized by non-allergic females, and cluster 5 was characterized by allergic rhinitis and elevated total immunoglobulin E levels. A significant association with rs8832 was observed for cluster 5 (odds ratio, 3.88 (1.34-11.26), p = 0.013) and also for the type 2 exacerbation-prone phenotypes (clusters 1 and 5: odds ratio, 2.73 (1.45-5.15), p = 1.9 × 10-3).Our results indicated that the clinical heterogeneity of disease exacerbation may reflect the presence of common exacerbation-prone endotypes across asthma and COPD, and may support the use of the treatable traits approach for the prevention of exacerbations in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4221101353,"Eukaryotic mRNAs possess a poly(A) tail at their 3'-end, to which poly(A)-binding protein C1 (PABPC1) binds and recruits other proteins that regulate translation. Enhanced poly(A)-dependent translation, which is also PABPC1 dependent, promotes cellular and viral proliferation. PABP-interacting protein 2A (Paip2A) effectively represses poly(A)-dependent translation by causing the dissociation of PABPC1 from the poly(A) tail; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the functional mechanisms of Paip2A action by characterizing the PABPC1-poly(A) and PABPC1-Paip2A interactions. Isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR analyses indicated that both interactions predominantly occurred at the RNA recognition motif (RRM)2-RRM3 regions of PABPC1, which have comparable affinities for poly(A) and Paip2A (dissociation constant, Kd = 1 nM). However, the Kd values of isolated RRM2 were 200 and 4 μM in their interactions with poly(A) and Paip2A, respectively; Kd values of 5 and 1 μM were observed for the interactions of isolated RRM3 with poly(A) and Paip2A, respectively. NMR analyses also revealed that Paip2A can bind to the poly(A)-binding interfaces of the RRM2 and RRM3 regions of PABPC1. Based on these results, we propose the following functional mechanism for Paip2A: Paip2A initially binds to the RRM2 region of poly(A)-bound PABPC1, and RRM2-anchored Paip2A effectively displaces the RRM3 region from poly(A), resulting in dissociation of the whole PABPC1 molecule. Together, our findings provide insight into the translation repression effect of Paip2A and may aid in the development of novel anticancer and/or antiviral drugs."

However, in some cases, a subpopulation of treated cells can exhibit a sublethal response, termed “minority MOMP.” In this phenomenon, the affected cells survive, despite a low level of caspase activation and subsequent limited activation of the endonuclease caspase-activated DNase (DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta). Consequently, these cells can experience DNA damage, increasing the probability of oncogenesis. However, little is known about the minority MOMP response. To discover genes that affect the MOMP response in individual cells, we conducted an imaging-based phenotypic siRNA screen. We identified multiple candidate genes whose downregulation increased the heterogeneity of MOMP within single cells, among which were genes related to mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy that participate in the mitochondrial quality control (MQC) system. Furthermore, to test the hypothesis that functional MQC is important for reducing the frequency of minority MOMP, we developed an assay to measure the clonogenic survival of caspase-engaged cells.

Apoptosis is a ubiquitous cellular self-elimination process that is critical for the homeostasis of various cell populations. Dysregulated apoptosis is integral to cancer progression and contributes to multiple diseases, including immune and neurodegenerative disorders. Many cancer therapies rely on the enhanced apoptotic death of tumor cells. Apoptosis frequently involves a “cell-intrinsic” pathway involving mitochondria. The central event in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is induced by B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)–associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK), the key proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (1Chipuk J.E.

BAK is constitutively located on the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), whereas BAX is mostly soluble in the cytoplasm. When cells receive an apoptotic stress signal, molecules belonging to a subset of the BCL-2 family termed “Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)–only proteins” activate BAX and BAK. Consequently, BAX translocates to the MOM, and both BAX and BAK integrate into the outer membrane and trigger MOMP by inducing the formation of large membrane pores (3Gillies L.A. Du H. Peters B.

Certain of these proteins are apoptogenic, including cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC)/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low pI, and OMI/high-temperature requirement factor A1.

This low-level caspase activation leads to a correspondingly limited activation of the apoptotic caspase-activated DNase (DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta) endonuclease, which enters the cell nucleus and produces a degree of DNA damage. The surviving cells exhibit genome instability and an increased propensity to become oncogenic (17Ichim G. Lopez J. Ahmed S.U. Muthalagu N. Giampazolias E. Delgado M.E. Haller M. Riley J.S. Mason S.M. Athineos D. Parsons M.J. van de Kooij B. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chalmers A.J.

Cell. 2015; 57: 860-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling the uniformity of MOMP in cells, and hence the frequency of minority MOMP, are unclear. To discover genes that affect MOMP, we conducted a focused high-content siRNA screen that analyzed 1318 genes that had been annotated in databases as having some relationship to mitochondria. A novel aspect of our screen was the identification of genes whose silencing produced a heterogeneous MOMP phenotype in which some mitochondria within the cell were permeabilized, whereas others remained intact. Our screen yielded functionally diverse candidate genes, including a significant group of genes associated with mitophagy, autophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics, the processes constituting the system of mitochondrial quality control (MQC) (18Ni H.M. Williams J.A. Ding W.X. Mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial quality control.Redox Biol. 2015; 4: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pickles S. Vigie P. Youle R.J. Mitophagy and quality control mechanisms in mitochondrial maintenance.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: R170-R185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that an increased heterogeneity of MOMP observed in MQC-compromised cells could increase the frequency of minority MOMP (17Ichim G. Lopez J. Ahmed S.U. Muthalagu N. Giampazolias E. Delgado M.E. Haller M. Riley J.S. Mason S.M. Athineos D. Parsons M.J. van de Kooij B. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chalmers A.J.

Cell. 2015; 57: 860-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). If so, downregulation of MQC-related genes would tend to allow cells to survive stresses that produce a degree of caspase activation, as a result of limited MOMP. To test this hypothesis, we developed a single-cell assay to measure the long-term clonogenic cell survival of cells that had exhibited a measurable degree of caspase activation, in response to treatment with a BH3-mimetic drug. Our results confirmed that deficiencies in various MQC proteins enhanced the survival of caspase-engaged cells. We conclude that mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy play a critical role in limiting the frequency of minority MOMP. Thus, proper functioning of the MQC system can be important to prevent oncogenesis that results from an incomplete execution of the mitochondrial apoptosis program. To identify novel cell-intrinsic regulators of MOMP, we designed a high-content image-based siRNA screen. As we were primarily interested in mitochondrial function, we carried out a focused siRNA screen targeting genes with annotated relationships to mitochondria (Table S1). Our strategy took advantage of a HeLa cell line expressing two fluorescent reporter proteins (described previously by Llambi et al. (20Llambi F. Moldoveanu T. Tait S.W. Bouchier-Hayes L. Temirov J.

Cell. 2011; 44: 517-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar)) that enabled us to simultaneously interrogate both BAX activation and MOMP. In living cells, Venus-BAX is cytoplasmic (diffuse), and OMI-mCherry is localized to mitochondria. When apoptosis is induced, Venus-BAX is translocated to mitochondria and OMI-mCherry is released into the cytoplasm and degraded. Normally, once apoptotic BAX translocation is initiated in a given cell, mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins (including cytochrome c or OMI) are released in a synchronous and rapid fashion (14Tait S.W.

However, in some cells, the release of intermembrane proteins is not an all-or-none event, and mitochondria within the same cell display heterogeneity in MOMP response (16Tait S.W. Parsons M.J.

We hypothesized that downregulation of certain genes could increase MOMP heterogeneity and promote post-MOMP cell survival, even in caspase-proficient cells. To begin to test our hypothesis, we analyzed punctate mitochondrial distribution of Venus-BAX and OMI-mCherry in cells treated with the apoptosis inducer, etoposide. The caspase inhibitor quinoline-Val-Asp-difluorophenoxymethylketone (Q-VD) was included in these experiments to decrease premature cell loss and detachment. Previous studies have demonstrated that caspase inhibition does not affect the kinetics of the release of intermembrane space proteins (12Lartigue L. Kushnareva Y. Seong Y. Lin H. Faustin B.

We configured our automated image analysis to quantify three cellular phenotypes: (1) apoptotic cells with mitochondria that have undergone MOMP-containing translocated BAX and lacking intramitochondrial OMI (BAX puncta positive), (2) nonapoptotic cells with intact mitochondria lacking BAX and containing OMI (BAX puncta negative), and (3) atypical cells with mitochondria containing BAX but which have not released OMI (BAX/OMI puncta double-positive cells) (Fig. 1. A and B). Untreated (no etoposide) cells transfected with control siRNA were nonapoptotic and showed normal mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 1, A and E) indicating that our optimized transfection conditions produced minimal toxicity. As expected, most etoposide-treated cells fell into either of the first two categories, whereas BAX/OMI double-positive cells were minimally present (Fig. 1, A and E). In assay validation experiments, we tested the effect of OPA1 siRNA. OPA1 mediates mitochondrial fusion in conjunction with its cleavage by the mitochondrial protease OMA1 (28Ehses S. Raschke I.

Knockdown of OPA1 protein increased the number of BAX/OMI double-positive cells compared with cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, high-resolution confocal imaging of OMA1 siRNA-treated cells revealed mitochondrial heterogeneity in the MOMP response: in individual BAX/OMI double-positive cells, some mitochondria contained translocated BAX (green puncta) and lost OMI, whereas other mitochondria lacked BAX and retained OMI (red puncta) (Fig. 1D). A BAX siRNA pool (which targets both endogenous BAX and ectopic Venus-BAX expression) potently inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis and markedly reduced Venus-BAX fluorescence (Fig. 1, C and F). However, knockdown of BAK did not inhibit apoptosis, indicating that in these etoposide-treated cells, MOMP was predominantly BAX dependent. Transfection efficiency in high-throughput screening experiments was verified using a cell death–inducing transfection marker (siTOX) that consistently produced ∼90% loss of cells within 2 days post-transfection (not shown). Efficient knockdown of other proteins produced by siRNA pools was confirmed in supporting experiments (Fig. S1A). The image-based assay was used to screen 1318 gene-specific siRNA pools. We ranked gene scores in three groups corresponding to the cell phenotype categories noted previously: genes whose knockdown (I) increased the percentage of Venus-BAX puncta, (II) decreased the percentage of cells with Venus-BAX puncta, or (III) increased the percentage of BAX/OMI double-positive cells. When we applied a 10% cutoff in the score distribution range, we identified ∼200 initial “hits” (with scores approximately threefold to fivefold above or below controls for the categories I and II). Hits in category III were from the top 10% tail of the score distribution (Fig. 1G). For a secondary screen, we chose to reassay 95 of the primary screen hits, based on their effect scores and our judgment concerning their biological interest (we decided not to pursue some “housekeeping” genes). In this secondary screen, we tested the four siRNAs from each siRNA pool individually. To reduce the likelihood of off-target effects, we required at least three of the four individual siRNAs to give concordant results (34Sigoillot F.D. King R.W. Vigilance and validation: Keys to success in RNAi screening.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Applying this more stringent criterion yielded a final list of 63 candidate genes (Table S2). Several hits in categories I and II were consistent with previous reports. For example, the effect of siRNA targeting Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) (category II) is consistent with the known cell death–promoting activity of this protein (35Chinnadurai G. Vijayalingam S. Gibson S.B. BNIP3 subfamily BH3-only proteins: Mitochondrial stress sensors in normal and pathological functions.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S114-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Acting in the opposite manner, the siRNAs scoring in category I increased the percentage of cells undergoing MOMP. For example, several candidate genes in this group are required for metabolism of the mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin (phospholipid scramblase 3 [PLSCR3], PRELI domain–containing protein 1 [PRELIDI], and TP53-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 [TRIAP1]). Although cardiolipin is important for BAX pore formation (6Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Potential novel regulators of MOMP include metabolic enzymes, long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, which catalyzes one of the early steps in the circle of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids, and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain–containing protein 1 with putative oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity in mitochondria. The roles of these proteins in mitochondrial metabolism and cell senescence are emerging (39Etemad S. Petit M. Weiss A.K.H. Schrattenholz A. Baraldo G. Jansen-Dürr P.

In this study, we did not further pursue the hits in categories I and II but focused on the unique phenotype produced by the hits in category III. Of note, in nearly all cells containing both BAX and OMI puncta, BAX and OMI were not colocalized, implying that some mitochondria within a cell had undergone MOMP, whereas others had not (similar to the phenotype shown in Fig. 1D). Perhaps the most striking outcome of our screen is that a majority of hits in category III are related to the MQC system. The concept of MQC is that mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) work in tandem with mitophagy (the autophagic elimination of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments) to maintain mitochondrial structural and functional integrity. If defective mitochondria cannot be repaired through fusion with functional organelles, they are prone to excessive fragmentation and elimination by mitophagy. It is postulated that asymmetrical fission segregates defective mitochondria, making the mitochondrial population inherently heterogeneous. These isolated small mitochondria are then redirected into a preautophagic pool (41Twig G. Elorza A. Molina A.J. Mohamed H. Wikstrom J.D. Walzer G. Stiles L. Haigh S.E. Katz S. Las G. Alroy J. Wu M.

Past studies have found that hospital financial performance is a significant determinant of CEO pay but nonprofit performance, including quality and charity care, are not. Using post-ACA data, we re-examine whether a variety of hospital performance measures are important determinants of nonprofit hospital CEO compensation. We found mixed evidence with respect to the significance of the association between financial performance and uncompensated care and CEO compensation. Among the other nonprofit performance measures, patient satisfaction was significantly associated with CEO compensation, but other measures were not significant determinants of CEO compensation. Our results suggest nonprofit hospitals balance their financial health against their mission when setting CEO incentives. Additional policy targeting transparency in hospital CEO compensation may be warranted to help policymakers understand the specific factors used by hospital boards to incentivize CEOs."
https://openalex.org/W4220804860,"Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx-2) is a critical antioxidant protein in red blood cells (RBC). Prx-2 is oxidized to a disulfide covalently-bound dimer by H2 O2 , and then reduced back by the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system. The reduction of oxidized Prx-2 is relatively slow in RBCs. Since Prx-2 is highly abundant, Prx-2s' peroxidase catalytic cycle is not considered to be limiting under normal conditions. However, whether Prx-2 recycling becomes limiting when RBCs are exposed to stress is not known. Using three different model systems characterized by increased oxidative damage to RBCs spanning the physiologic (endogenous RBCs of different ages), therapeutic (cold-stored RBCs in blood banks) and pathologic (RBCs from sickle cell disease (SCD) patients and humanized SCD mice) spectrum, basal levels of Prx-2 oxidation and Prx-2 recycling kinetics after addition of H2 O2 were determined. The reduction of oxidized Prx-2 was significantly slower in older versuin older versus younger RBCs, in RBCs stored for 4-5 weeks compared to 1 week, and in RBC from pediatric SCD patients compared to RBCs from control non-SCD patients. Similarly, the rate of Prx-2 recycling was slower in humanized SCD mice compared to WT mice. Treatment of RBC with carbon monoxide (CO) to limit heme-peroxidase activity had no effect on Prx-2 recycling kinetics. Treatment with glucose attenuated slowed Prx-2 recycling in older RBCs and SCD RBCs, but not stored RBCs. In conclusion, the reduction of oxidized Prx-2 can be further slowed in RBCs, which may limit the protection afforded by this antioxidant protein in settings associated with erythrocyte stress."
https://openalex.org/W4220827005,"5-Methylcytosine is one of the major epigenetic marks of DNA in living organisms. Some bacterial species possess DNA methyltransferases that modify cytosines on both strands to produce fully-methylated sites or on either strand to produce hemi-methylated sites. In this study, we characterized a DNA methyltransferase that produces two sequences with different methylation patterns: one methylated on both strands and another on one strand. M.BatI is the orphan DNA methyltransferase of Bacillus anthracis coded in one of the prophages on the chromosome. Analysis of M.BatI modified DNA by bisulfite sequencing revealed that the enzyme methylates the first cytosine in sequences of 5'-GCAGC-3', 5'-GCTGC-3', and 5'-GCGGC-3', but not of 5'-GCCGC-3'. This resulted in the production of fully-methylated 5'-GCWGC-3' and hemi-methylated 5'-GCSGC-3'. M.BatI also showed toxicity when expressed in E. coli, which was caused by a mechanism other than DNA modification activity. Homologs of M.BatI were found in other Bacillus species on different prophage like regions, suggesting the spread of the gene by several different phages. The discovery of the DNA methyltransferase with unique modification target specificity suggested unrevealed diversity of target sequences of bacterial cytosine DNA methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W4220926455,"Bone marrow development and endochondral bone formation occur simultaneously. During endochondral ossification, periosteal vasculatures and stromal progenitors invade the primary avascular cartilaginous anlage, which induces primitive marrow development. We previously determined that bone marrow podoplanin (PDPN)-expressing stromal cells exist in the perivascular microenvironment and promote megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis. In this study, we aimed to examine the involvement of PDPN-expressing stromal cells in postnatal bone marrow generation. Using histological analysis, we observed that periosteum-derived PDPN-expressing stromal cells infiltrated the cartilaginous anlage of the postnatal epiphysis and populated on the primitive vasculature of secondary ossification center. Furthermore, immunophenotyping and cellular characteristic analyses indicated that the PDPN-expressing stromal cells constituted a subpopulation of the skeletal stem cell lineage. In vitro xenovascular model cocultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and PDPN-expressing skeletal stem cell progenies showed that PDPN-expressing stromal cells maintained vascular integrity via the release of angiogenic factors and vascular basement membrane-related extracellular matrices. We show that in this process, Notch signal activation committed the PDPN-expressing stromal cells into a dominant state with basement membrane-related extracellular matrices, especially type IV collagens. Our findings suggest that the PDPN-expressing stromal cells regulate the integrity of the primitive vasculatures in the epiphyseal nascent marrow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine how PDPN-expressing stromal cells contribute to marrow development and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4220960158,"Despite major advances made in malaria treatment and control over recent decades, the development of new models for studying disease pathogenesis remains a vital part of malaria research efforts. The study of malaria infection during pregnancy is particularly reliant on mouse models, as a means of circumventing many challenges and costs associated with pregnancy studies in endemic human populations. Here, we introduce a novel murine model that will further our understanding of how malaria infection affects pregnancy outcome. When C57BL/6J (B6) mice are infected with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS on either embryonic day (E) 6.5, 8.5, or 10.5, preterm birth occurs in all animals by E16.5, E17.5, or E18.5 respectively, with no evidence of intrauterine growth restriction. Despite having the same outcome, we found that the time to delivery, placental inflammatory and antioxidant transcript upregulation, and the relationships between parasitemia and transcript expression prior to preterm birth differed based on the embryonic day of infection. On the day before preterm delivery, E6.5 infected mice did not experience significant upregulation of the inflammatory or antioxidant gene transcripts examined; however, peripheral and placental parasitemia correlated positively with Il1β, Cox1, Cat, and Hmox1 placental transcript abundance. E8.5 infected mice had elevated transcripts for Ifnγ, Tnf, Il10, Cox1, Cox2, Sod1, Sod2, Cat, and Nrf2, while Sod3 was the only transcript that correlated with parasitemia. Finally, E10.5 infected mice had elevated transcripts for Ifnγ only, with a tendency for Tnf transcripts to correlate with peripheral parasitemia. Tumor necrosis factor deficient (TNF-/-) and TNF receptor 1 deficient (TNFR1-/-) mice infected on E8.5 experienced preterm birth at the same time as B6 controls. Further characterization of this model is necessary to discover the mechanism(s) and/or trigger(s) responsible for malaria-driven preterm birth caused by maternal infection during early pregnancy."

Prions can manifest as distinct strains that can influence disease pathology and transmission. CWD is profoundly lymphotropic, and most infected cervids likely shed peripheral prions replicated in lymphoid organs.

In this study, we compared prions from the obex and lymph nodes of naturally exposed white-tailed deer to identify potential biochemical strain differences. Here, we report biochemical evidence of strain differences between the brain and lymph node from these animals. Conformational stability assays, glycoform ratio analyses, and immunoreactivity scanning across the structured domain of the prion protein that refolds into the amyloid aggregate of the infectious prion reveal significantly more structural and glycoform variation in lymphogenic prions than neurogenic prions. Surprisingly, we observed greater biochemical differences among neurogenic prions than lymphogenic prions across individuals. We propose that the lymphoreticular system propagates a diverse array of prions from which the brain selects a more restricted pool of prions that may be quite different than those from another individual of the same species. Future work should examine the biological and zoonotic impact of these biochemical differences and examine more cervids from multiple locations to determine if these differences are conserved across species and locations.

While CWD causes a neurological disease, CWD prions are profoundly lymphotropic, and these peripheral prions are the most likely to shed into the environment and contribute to horizontal and vertical disease transmission (13Sigurdson C.J.

Thus, it is critical to determine if any unique characteristics of extraneural prions exist that affect CWD pathogenesis and transmission. While all prion diseases result from a misfolding of the normal host protein, PrPC, to a misfolded form, PrPSc, different biochemical characteristics and disease phenotypes suggest a phenomenon of prion strains transmitting distinct disease characteristics epigenetically enciphered within unique prion structures (18Bartz J.C.

The prion strain phenomenon: Molecular basis and unprecedented features.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, different prion strains sometimes have significant strain differences. There are multiple CWD strains that have been identified from North American isolates, including CWD-1, CWD-2, H95+, and Wisc-1 (21Angers R.C. Kang H.E. Napier D. Browning S. Seward T. Mathiason C.

Dis. 2017; 23: 1598-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Importantly, the H95+ strain has been shown to emerge from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) that have the more resistant genotype, 96SS, and this strain has been demonstrated to have an expanded host range, highlighting the importance of continued strain characterization (22Herbst A.

Dis. 2017; 23: 1598-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CWD-resistant PRNP polymorphisms have emerged in wild elk populations, like Rocky Mountain Elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni), but it is unclear how these polymorphisms may affect novel and/or atypical prion strain emergence in these population (23Monello R.J. Galloway N.L. Powers J.G. Madsen-Bouterse S.A. Edwards W.H. Wood M.E. O'Rourke K.I. Wild M.A. Pathogen-mediated selection in free-ranging elk populations infected by chronic wasting disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 12208-12212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); as happened with the emergence of the Nor98 scrapie strain in sheep expressing classical scrapie-resistant genotypes (24Benestad S.L. Sarradin P. Thu B. Schönheit J. Tranulis M.A. Bratberg B. Cases of scrapie with unusual features in Norway and designation of a new type, Nor98.Vet. Rec. 2003; 153: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Selection of CWD-resistant genotypes in white-tailed deer may also be occurring (25Chafin T.K. Douglas M.R. Martin B.T. Zbinden Z.D. Middaugh C.R. Ballard J.R. Gray M.C. Don White Jr., Douglas M.E. Age structuring and spatial heterogeneity in prion protein gene (PRNP) polymorphism in white-tailed deer.Prion. 2020; 14: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These data highlight the necessity of continued strain identification and characterization from multiple sources. Understanding strain differences and potentially different transmission dynamics is of critical importance to understand CWD and control its spread. Of particular concern, extraneural prions have been shown to have increased zoonotic potential (26Béringue V. Herzog L. Jaumain E. Reine F. Sibille P. Le Dur A. Vilotte J.L. Laude H. Facilitated cross-species transmission of prions in extraneural tissue.Science. 2012; 335: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This has important implications for cross species transmission and risk for humans potentially contracting CWD from eating infected skeletal muscle or while cleaning a deer in the field (27Angers R.C. Browning S.R. Seward T.S. Sigurdson C.J. Miller M.W. Hoover E.A. Telling G.C. Prions in skeletal muscles of deer with chronic wasting disease.Science. 2006; 311: 1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). While no evidence currently supports natural xenotransmission of CWD prions from cervids to other animal species, CWD prions are infectious to cattle (28Greenlee J.J. Nicholson E.M. Smith J.D.

Virol. 2017; 91e00926-17Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and cats (31Mathiason C.K. Nalls A.v. Seelig D.M. Kraft S.L. Carnes K. Anderson K.R. Hayes-Klug J. Hoover E.A. Susceptibility of domestic cats to chronic wasting disease.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 1947-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) when experimentally inoculated intracerebrally. Cattle and cats were resistant to CWD infection after oral exposure, but pigs were susceptible at low levels (30Moore S.J. West Greenlee M.H. Kondru N. Manne S. Smith J.D. Kunkle R.A. Kanthasamy A. Greenlee J.J. Experimental transmission of the chronic wasting disease agent to swine after oral or intracranial inoculation.J. Virol. 2017; 91e00926-17Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data suggest that there is a risk of transmission to additional species and populations, warranting continued monitoring and surveillance of CWD prion strains. Most of the CWD and prion research completed to date focused on brain-derived prions, likely because prion diseases are neurodegenerative, brain samples are easy to work with and contain the highest titers of prions in infected animals. However, prions shed into the environment likely are extraneural prions, such as those replicated within lymph nodes (LNs). Far less is known about the transmissibility of these peripheral prions, but research suggests LN-derived prions have similar titers to brain-derived prion titers on transgenic mouse bioassay (32Davenport K.A.

Furthermore, numerous immune receptors and different proteins involved in the complement cascade have been shown to influence prion strain selection, implicating the immune system as an important player in prion strain selection (33Michel B.

This research suggests that lymphogenic prions likely exhibit more strain diversity than neurogenic prions (40Barria M.A. Telling G.C. Gambetti P. Mastrianni J.A. Soto C.

Molecular barriers to zoonotic transmission of prions.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2014; 20: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific differences in strain heterogeneity, as reflected in the prion cloud hypothesis, predict different prion strains with different biochemical and structural characteristics in LNs than in the brain (40Barria M.A. Telling G.C. Gambetti P. Mastrianni J.A. Soto C. Generation of a new form of human PrPSc in vitro by interspecies transmission from cervid prions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7490-7495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, any differences between the brain-derived and LN-derived prions must be investigated to aid our understanding of intrahost and interspecies prion dynamics. Based on current knowledge of CWD transmission, prion strain selection, and differential interspecies transmission, we hypothesize that LNs replicate more diverse CWD prion strains than the brain within and among individuals. While extensive research has focused on brain samples from cervid and transgenic mouse brains, less research has been dedicated to studying and characterizing peripheral prions, leaving a critical knowledge gap that this work addresses. Furthermore, very little work has characterized structural differences between brain- and LN-derived prions from a natural host prior to passage to transgenic mice or other model organisms. While bioassay is a central pillar to prion biology and strain characterization, there are other host factors and transgene expression level differences that influence strain emergence, emphasizing the importance of assessing strain characteristics of prions isolated from the natural host (42Crowell J. Hughson A. Caughey B. Bessen R.A. Host determinants of prion strain diversity independent of prion protein genotype.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 10427-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43le Dur A. Laï T.L. Stinnakre M.G. Laisné A. Chenais N. Rakotobe S. Passet B. Reine F. Soulier S. Herzog L. Tilly G. Rézaei H.

For this study, we assessed biochemical strain differences between paired obex and LN samples from naturally exposed white-tailed deer from Arkansas, USA. These analyses reveal significant differences between brain-derived and LN-derived prion isolates in some of our biochemical assays. While we observed no conformational stability differences between brain- and the LN-derived prions, we observed electrophoretic differences and statistically significant differences in the glycoform ratio of PrPSc from brain compared to LN samples. Lymphogenic prions exhibited greater overall variance in mean glycoform ratios and conformational stability than neurogenic prions. Surprisingly, we observed greater biochemical differences among brain-derived prions than LN-derived prions across individuals. These data lead us to propose a mechanism whereby the lymphoreticular system propagates a diverse array of prions from which the brain selects a more restricted pool of prions that may be quite different than those from another individual of the same species. Assessing differences in biochemical signatures between prions from brain and LNs among individuals will inform future studies poised to assess biological differences, including zoonotic potential, between neurogenic and lymphogenic prions using bioassay and other traditional prion assays. Samples used in this study were all collected from naturally exposed white-tailed deer in the state of Arkansas and shared with us from our collaborators from the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission. PRNP gene sequencing revealed that all deer shared the same amino acid sequences at known CWD susceptibility loci (95QQ, 96GG, 116AA, 132MM, 225SS, 226QQ). All deer also harbor similar prion titers as determined by two distinct in vitro assays [(44Kang H.E. Bian J. Kane S.J. Kim S. Selwyn V. Crowell J. Bartz J.C. Telling G.C.

We optimized our assays to obtain the clearest, most reproducible data possible. If we employed the same proteinase K (PK) digestion and Western Blot methods for brain/obex samples and LN samples, brain-derived PrPSc signals were indistinguishable from PrPC signals. We therefore optimized digestion conditions for each tissue type. Brain samples required PK digestion in the presence of 1% Triton-X 100, with a higher concentration of PK (100 μg/ml), and less starting total protein (5% w/v homogenate before PK digestion) electrophoresed through the gel (data not shown). LN samples ran well when more protein was loaded onto the gel (10% w/v starting homogenate) and digested with less PK (50 μg/ml) than obex samples. Of the nine animals that had paired obex and LN samples, only four of the animals gave us interpretable data from both the tissues that enabled us to compare intrahost variation (Table 1). Samples were prepared for analysis by conformational stability and glycoform ratio as described in the methods section. Samples were then run on a Western blot to collect densitometric and electrophoretic mobility data. Differences in electrophoretic mobility of a prion sample reveal structural differences that dictate PK accessibility, resulting in different PK-resistant core fragments of PrPSc. These heritable structural differences are reliable biochemical indicators of different prion strains (46Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F.

Obex samples that were incubated in 2.5 M GdnHCl and greater migrated faster than samples exposed to lower concentrations of GdnHCl (Fig. 1). One LN sample may have exhibited this 17 kD band (Fig. 1L), but this was not consistently observable, and the lower migrating band may be due simply to a slight tilt in the WB image. This 17 kD band was only observed consistently in obex samples, and these data were consistent among all four individuals. Distinct prion strains can have different conformational stability in the presence of chaotropic denaturing agents like GdnHCl. We compared conformational stability of prions isolated from LN to prions isolated from brain samples to determine if this strain characteristic would reveal potentially different strains from different tissues within the same animal. We treated samples with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl and determined their [GdnHCl]1/2 values, which is the [GdnHCl] that eliminates half of the PrPSc compared to the untreated sample. While one animal trended toward statistical significance, we detected no statistical differences in conformational stability measured between paired obex-derived and LN–derived prions in any of the four individuals examined (unpaired t test, p < 0.05, Fig. 2). However, we did observe a statistical difference in the variance of mean [GdnHCl]1/2 values between the obex and LN-derived prion samples from animal 10083 (F-test, p < 0.05). Also, brain denaturation curves fit the data better (R2 range from 0.8272–0.9242) than the denaturation curves for LN samples (0.1991–0.6113). Differences in mean [GdnHCl]1/2 variances for animal 10023 trended toward significance (F-test, p = 0.07). The other two samples did not exhibit significant difference in conformational stability variance (F-test, p > 0.05). To assess potential differences in conformational stability among individuals in either the brain or the LN, we compared prions isolated from the same tissue across a"

However, the functionality of that motif is unknown. We now report that deleting this motif prevents agonist-induced ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 (β-arr2) and blocks its association with activated G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). Within the ART motif, we have identified a conserved phenylalanine residue, Phe116, that is critical for the formation of β-arr2–GPCR complexes. β-arr2 Phe116Ala mutant has negligible effect on blunting β2-adrenergic receptor–induced cAMP generation unlike β-arr2, which promotes rapid desensitization. Furthermore, available structures for inactive and inositol hexakisphosphate 6–activated forms of bovine β-arr2 revealed that Phe116 is ensconced in a hydrophobic pocket, whereas the adjacent Phe117 and Phe118 residues are not. Mutagenesis of Phe117 and Phe118, but not Phe116, preserves GPCR interaction of β-arr2. Surprisingly, Phe116 is dispensable for the association of β-arr2 with its non-GPCR partners. β-arr2 Phe116Ala mutant presents a significantly reduced protein half-life compared with β-arr2 and undergoes constitutive Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination, which tags proteins for proteasomal degradation. We also found that Phe116 is critical for agonist-dependent β-arr2 ubiquitination with Lys-63-polyubiquitin linkages that are known mediators of protein scaffolding and signal transduction. Finally, we have shown that β-arr2 Phe116Ala interaction with activated β2-adrenergic receptor can be rescued with an in-frame fusion of ubiquitin. Taken together, we conclude that Phe116 preserves structural stability of β-arr2, regulates the formation of β-arr2–GPCR complexes that inhibit G protein signaling, and promotes subsequent ubiquitin-dependent β-arr2 localization and trafficking. Arrestins and their yeast homologs, arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ARTs), share a stretch of 29 amino acids called the ART motif. However, the functionality of that motif is unknown.

Arrestins, which include visual arrestins (arrestin 1 and arrestin 4 in rods and cones, respectively) and ubiquitously expressed nonvisual arrestins (arrestin 2 and arrestin 3, also termed β-arrestin1 or β-arr1 and β-arr2, correspondingly) are polyfunctional cytosolic adaptor proteins, typically known for their ability to inhibit cellular increase in second messengers resulting from the agonist stimulation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) (1Lefkowitz R.J.

GPCRs, also called seven transmembrane receptors, are a diverse group of heptahelical membrane proteins that couple to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding proteins (G proteins) to initiate cellular response to ligand stimulation (3Lefkowitz R.J.

Arrestin inhibition of GPCR signaling requires two mechanisms: (1) phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the stimulated receptors by GPCR kinases and (2) recruitment and binding of arrestin to the phosphorylated tail and transmembrane core of the receptor for steric hindrance of G protein coupling and activation (1Lefkowitz R.J.

In addition to inhibiting G protein coupling (a process termed receptor desensitization), β-arrs regulate other aspects of the fate and activity of GPCRs such as (1) receptor internalization by recruiting components of the endocytic machinery, clathrin, and β-adaptin subunits, (2) receptor ubiquitination by serving as adaptors for ubiquitin (Ub) ligases and/or deubiquitinases, and (3) signal transduction by scaffolding various kinases and nonkinase proteins into signaling modules (1Lefkowitz R.J.

While the core conformation is essential for steric hindrance of G protein coupling, the tail conformation is sufficient for β-arr-mediated receptor endocytosis, β-arr scaffolding of various components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades such as extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, as well as enabling GPCR, G protein, and β-arr supercomplex formation for sustained signaling in endosomes (17Cahill 3rd, T.J.

The arrestin fold: Variations on a theme.Curr. Genomics. 2009; 10: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This structure known as the “arrestin fold” is conserved between arrestin isoforms and between species. The arrestin fold is also present in other cytosolic proteins that share functional kinship with arrestins, notably in regulating trafficking processes and/or in mediating receptor ubiquitination (26Kang D.S. Tian X. Benovic J.L. Role of beta-arrestins and arrestin domain-containing proteins in G protein-coupled receptor trafficking.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 27: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The arrestin fold–containing proteins found in humans include arrestin domain–containing proteins 1 to 5 and thioredoxin-interacting protein, which are collectively known as α-arrestins. Additional proteins distantly related to arrestins that possess the arrestin fold include vacuolar protein sorting–associated protein 26 (Vps26), Vps26-related protein Down syndrome critical region gene 3, and retrograde Golgi transport protein 1 (27Aubry L. Klein G. True arrestins and arrestin-fold proteins: A structure-based appraisal.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2013; 118: 21-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the arrestin fold is present in a family of proteins termed arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ARTs). Yeast arrestin-like proteins include Art 1 to 10 as well as the fungus-specific Art variants, Bul 1 to 3 (27Aubry L. Klein G.

Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 2660-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite presenting structural and some functional similarities with β-arrs, arrestin fold–containing proteins share minimal sequence homology with arrestins and lack several characteristic features of arrestins. For example, Vps26 lacks GPCR, clathrin, and phosphatidylinositol phospholipid-binding sites that are typically present in the visual arrestins and β-arrs (27Aubry L. Klein G. True arrestins and arrestin-fold proteins: A structure-based appraisal.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2013; 118: 21-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, ART proteins and α-arrestins lack the N domain helix that is found in arrestins, whereas their C-tails, which do not contain clathrin-binding site, present PPxY motifs (except for arrestin domain–containing protein 5), which allow binding to WW domain–containing proteins, such as E3 Ub ligases of the Rsp5p/Nedd4 family (27Aubry L.

Distinct roles for beta-arrestin2 and arrestin-domain-containing proteins in beta2 adrenergic receptor trafficking.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, β-arrs and their yeast homologs do share a short stretch of 29 amino acid sequence called arrestin/ART motif (28Lin C.H. MacGurn J.A. Chu T. Stefan C.J. Emr S.D. Arrestin-related ubiquitin-ligase adaptors regulate endocytosis and protein turnover at the cell surface.Cell. 2008; 135: 714-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The ART motif is highly conserved, which suggests that it plays an important role in the function of these proteins. However, the role of the ART motif in β-arrs has not been investigated yet. Using site-directed mutagenesis and cell-based assays, we have determined the significance and functional contribution of the ART motif in β-arr2. To define the characteristics of the ART motif, we examined conservation of amino acid residues in that region by performing sequence alignments of β-arr2 and yeast arrestin–related trafficking protein 1 (Art1) (Fig. 1A). While the ART motif in rat β-arr2 was not identical with that of yeast Art1, a substantial number of conserved residues were identified in rat, bovine, human, and mouse β-arr2 and include Gly110, His112, Pro115, Phe116, Ile120, Pro121, Pro125, Cys126, Ser127, Leu130, and Glu135 (Figs. 1A and 3A). The ART motif (green, Fig. 1, A and B) is located in the N domain of β-arr2, traversing across the β-arr2 molecule and linking both N and C domains of β-arr2 (Fig. 1B). We next determined if the ART motif affects the interaction of β-arr2 with its binding partners. β-arr2 is a multifunctional adaptor protein that not only regulates GPCR signaling but also associates with other types of membrane receptors, as well as nuclear receptors, ions channels, and various cytosolic signaling mediators to regulate a variety of cellular activities (1Lefkowitz R.J.

Arrestins as regulators of kinases and phosphatases.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2013; 118: 115-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the binding partners of β-arrs are diverse and, besides GPCRs, include kinases and Ub pathway enzymes such as the E3 Ub ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 20 (USP20), which form a tripartite complex with β-arr2 (34Jean-Charles P.Y.

The interaction of β-arr2 with USP20 and TRAF6 prevents autoubiquitination of TRAF6, inhibiting NF-κB activation and inflammatory signaling downstream the Toll-like receptor 4 (34Jean-Charles P.Y.

Deletion of the entire ART motif did not prevent expression of exogenous β-arr2 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. Nonetheless equivalent DNA transfection in our cell-based assays yielded lesser expression of the ART motif–deleted mutant protein β-arr2ΔART compared with overexpressed WT β-arr2. In our pull-down assays, we observed that as for the WT β-arr2, both TRAF6 and USP20 coimmunoprecipitated with the β-arr2ΔART mutant (Fig. 1, C–E). Moreover, while USP20 showed an increasing trend of protein association with β-arr2ΔART, TRAF6 binding to β-arr2ΔART was significantly higher when compared with WT β-arr2 (Fig. 1, D and E). Accordingly, the ART motif might be dispensable for the protein interactions of β-arr2, and the scaffolding properties of β-arr2 may be negatively regulated by the ART motif. Next, we determined the effect of the ART motif on β-arr2 ubiquitination. Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification in which the 76-amino acid protein Ub is appended to substrate proteins, tagging them for various cellular activities, such as degradation, vesicular trafficking, protein scaffolding, and cell signaling (16Jean-Charles P.Y.

Using HEK-293 cells stably expressing either β-arr2 WT or β-arr2ΔART mutant, we stimulated β2AR with the agonist isoproterenol and monitored β-arr2 ubiquitination using an antibody that recognizes total polyubiquitin chains. In cells expressing exogenous WT β-arr2, 1 min stimulation with isoproterenol induced a significant increase in ubiquitination of β-arr2 than at the basal state (Fig. 1, F and G, Ub:β-arr2, 0.15 ± 0.03 at basal versus 0.57 ± 0.05 at 1′ iso treatment). On the other hand, the β-arr2ΔART mutant was constitutively ubiquitinated at a higher level than WT β-arr2, and agonist stimulation of the β2AR failed to increase the ubiquitination status of β-arr2ΔART mutant (Fig. 1, F and G). Notably, the association of MDM2 and β-arr2 was mostly unaffected by the ART motif deletion (Fig. 1F). Our results reveal that the ART motif is not required for protein interaction with MDM2 but essential for agonist-dependent ubiquitination of β-arr2 upon β2AR activation. Since β-arr2 ubiquitination by MDM2 is dependent on the binding of β-arrs to activated β2AR, we investigated whether deletion of the ART motif affected the recruitment of β-arr2 to the activated β2AR. To assess this, we transfected HEK-293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged β2AR with either YFP-β-arr2 or YFP-β-arr2ΔART mutant and tested effects of agonist stimulation on β-arr2 translocation. Confocal imaging showed homogenous cytoplasmic distribution of β-arrs (green) in quiescent cells, whereas agonist activation of β2AR (red) provoked translocation of exogenous WT β-arr2 to the cell membrane and colocalization with the stimulated β2AR (yellow) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, exogenous mutant YFP-β-arr2ΔART failed to either translocate to the cell membrane or colocalize with the stimulated β2AR and instead remained diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, the ART motif is essential for the translocation of β-arr2 to the plasma membrane and its recruitment to the stimulated β2AR, enabling subsequent activities of β-arr2 when bound to the activated receptor such as its ubiquitination by MDM2. While the β2AR is a class A GPCR that forms a transient complex with β-arr, class B GPCRs promote sustained GPCR/β-arr complex, as well as durable β-arr ubiquitination (41Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A.

To discern if the stronger binding provoked by class B receptors might overcome the defect from the deletion of ART motif, we next investigated by confocal imaging (WT and ART deletion mutant) the recruitment of β-arr2 for class B GPCRs, angiotensin II (AngII) type 1a receptor (AT1aR) and vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R). As expected, stimulation of the AT1aR by the agonist AngII promoted persistent interaction of exogenous YFP-β-arr2 (green) with the AT1aR (red), resulting in the internalization of the receptor–β-arr complex and its location in endocytic vesicles, seen as yellow puncta in the merged images (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, YFP-β-arr2ΔART mutant (green) failed to be recruited to the activated AT1aR but remained uniformly distributed in the cytosol despite agonist stimulation of the receptor (Fig. 2D). As in the case of the AT1aR, we detected no colocalization of YFP-β-arr2ΔART with activated V2R, whereas WT β-arr2 cointernalized with the agonist-activated V2R (Fig. 2, E and F). Our confocal assays further confirm that the deletion of ART motif prevents the translocation of β-arr2 to the plasma membrane and its association with activated GPCRs. Since the ART motif plays an essential role in the binding of β-arr2 to GPCRs and its subsequent ubiquitination, we looked for the residues in that motif that accounted for its function. Amino acid sequence alignment of β-arr2 homologs and yeast Art1 showed conserved residues in the A"

BCR signaling plays key roles in autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative disorders, yet, despite the clinical significance of this protein complex, key regions (i.e., the transmembrane domains) have yet to be structurally characterized. The mechanism for BCR signaling also remains unclear and has been variously described by the mutually exclusive cross-linking and dissociation activation models. Common to these models is the significance of local plasma membrane composition, which implies that interactions between BCR transmembrane domains (TMDs) play a role in receptor functionality. Here we used an in vivo assay of TMD oligomerization called GALLEX alongside spectroscopic and computational methods to characterize the structures and interactions of human Igα and Igβ TMDs in detergent micelles and natural membranes. We observed weak self-association of the Igβ TMD and strong self-association of the Igα TMD, which scanning mutagenesis revealed was entirely stabilized by an E-X10-P motif. We also demonstrated strong heterotypic interactions between the Igα and Igβ TMDs both in vitro and in vivo, which scanning mutagenesis and computational models suggest is multiconfigurational but can accommodate distinct interaction sites for self-interactions and heterotypic interactions of the Igα TMD. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the TMDs of the human BCR are sites of strong protein-protein interactions that may direct BCR assembly, endoplasmic reticulum retention, and immune signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4220768572,"We investigate the problem of interest rate risk transforming into default risk of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the EU. Bank regulation is strikingly not neutral in this aspect, it explicitly favors short-duration adjustable-rate loans over long-duration fixed-rate loans in the framework of the gap management. This asymmetry in the regulation creates perverse incentives both for banks and households, which can lead to aggressive risk-taking, over-indebtedness of unhedged households, high procyclicality of mortgage markets, and increased systemic risks. We present a stress test model to quantify potential losses stemming from this specific risk from the perspective of lender institutions. We estimate the average extra capital that is needed to cover the additional risk of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the EU to be 0.53% of the value of the total mortgage portfolio and 1.97% of the value of the adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio. We propose introducing a stress test model as a new mandatory element into banks’ risk management framework."
https://openalex.org/W4220886757,"Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating several forms of cancer. Adoptive cell transfer of immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, provides a powerful therapeutic potential against tumor cells. In the past decades, two-dimensional (2D) tumor models have been used to investigate the effectiveness of immune cell killing. However, the 2D tumor models exhibit less structural complexity and cannot recapitulate the physiological condition of the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the effectiveness of immune cells against tumor cells using these models cannot fully be translated to clinical studies. In order to gain a deeper insight into immune cell-tumor interaction, more physiologically relevant in vivo -like three-dimensional (3D) tumor models have been developed. These 3D tumor models can mimic the dynamic cellular activities, making them a much closer representation of the in vivo tumor profiles. Here, we describe a simple and effective protocol to study the cytotoxic activity of primary human NK cells toward the 3D tumor spheroids. Our protocol includes isolation and expansion of human NK cells, labeling and formation of tumor spheroids, co-culture of NK cells and tumor spheroids, and evaluation of cytotoxic activity using a confocal microscope. This protocol is also applicable to other types of tumors and immune cells."
