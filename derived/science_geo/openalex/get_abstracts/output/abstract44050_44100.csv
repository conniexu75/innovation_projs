https://openalex.org/W2076407459,"A crucial question in the study of immunological reactions in the central nervous system (CNS) concerns the identity of the parenchymal cells that function as the antigen-presenting cells in that organ. Rat bone marrow chimeras and encephalitogenic, major histocompatability-restricted T-helper lymphocytes were used to show that a subset of endogenous CNS cells, commonly termed ""perivascular microglial cells,"" is bone marrow-derived. In addition, these perivascular cells are fully competent to present antigen to lymphocytes in an appropriately restricted manner. These findings are important for bone marrow transplantation and for neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2063960509,"Identification of genes that function to protect cells from radiation damage is an essential step in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which mammalian cells cope with ionizing radiation. The intrinsic radiation resistance (D0) of NIH 3T3 cells was markedly and significantly increased by transformation with ras oncogenes activated by missense mutations. This radiobiologic activity appeared to be a specific consequence of the ras mutations rather than of transformation, since revertant cells that contained functional ras genes (but were no longer phenotypically transformed) retained their increased D0's."
https://openalex.org/W1532205945,"Peptide antigens used to generate site-specific antibodies to proteins are of interest in the development of vaccines. The need to conjugate them to a carrier protein for optimal immunogenicity results in a number of problems including a possible immune response to the carrier. Here we describe a new method of synthesizing an immunogenic peptide antigen, referred to as multiple antigenic peptide (MAP), which may render the need for a carrier protein obsolete. A 14-residue sequence derived from the human T cell antigen receptor beta-chain constant region was selected, and the peptide was synthesized directly onto a branching lysine core with 8 copies of the 14-residue peptide linked to the core by the COOH-terminal amino acid. The molecular weight of this structure was 13,422 of which only 7% represents the lysine residues of the core. The octameric MAP was highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits, allowing production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The majority of these antibodies reacted with the peptide in its monomeric form as well as its octameric form. Moreover, the antibodies reacted with the intact beta-chain protein. The antigenic determinants of the peptide that were recognized by the antibodies included continuous determinants and conformational determinants. The NH2-terminal residues of the octameric MAP appeared to be most immunogenic. There were no antibodies to the central lysine core. This method of direct synthesis of a polymeric peptide provides accurate knowledge of the conformation and quantity of the peptide prior to immunization, which is usually not the case when peptides are conjugated to carriers. The method is versatile because the possibility exists to synthesize MAP with 16 or 32 peptide arms or to synthesize polymers containing two different peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1568755186,"A 42-base pair sequence from the 5' flanking region of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene was shown previously to confer sensitivity to sterol-mediated repression when inserted into the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. This sequence contains two contiguous 16-base pair repeats, designated repeats 2 and 3, which differ from each other at four positions. In the current study we have analyzed separately the functions of repeats 2 and 3 by altering their sequences, inserting them into the -60 position of the thymidine kinase promoter, and introducing the hybrid promoters into hamster cells by transfection. These studies show that repeat 3 is a constitutive positive transcriptional element that acts in the absence or presence of sterols. Repeat 2 confers strong repression upon repeat 3 when sterols are present. In vitro DNase footprinting and gel retardation assays show that repeat 3, but not repeat 2, binds purified Sp1, a positive transcription factor. Mutants of repeat 3 that abolish transcriptional activity in vivo abolish Sp1 binding in vitro. We suggest that the low density lipoprotein receptor is regulated by a push-pull mechanism in which sterol-regulated binding of a protein to repeat 2 silences the activity of the adjacent Sp1-binding site in repeat 3."
https://openalex.org/W2088357331,"In Aspergillus nidulans the temperature-sensitive cell cycle mutation bimE7 causes chromosome condensation and pre-anaphase spindle formation to occur at restrictive temperature. By constructing double mutants between bimE7 and S phase or G2 phase mutants and blocking DNA replication with hydroxyurea, we demonstrate that bimE7 can cause chromatin condensation and spindle formation in cells held in S or G2. Thus bimE7 overrides normal control systems that prevent mitosis from prematurely occurring during S or G2. We show that bimE7 is a loss of function mutation and propose that bimE normally functions to negatively control a positive mitotic inducing factor, possibly the cell cycle gene nimA."

https://openalex.org/W1578752381,"The intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol was examined during 24 h of low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake in normal and Niemann-Pick C fibroblasts by fluorescence microscopy with filipin staining and immunocytochemistry. Perinuclear fluorescence derived from filipin-sterol complexes was observed in both normal and mutant cells by 2 h. This perinuclear cholesterol staining reached its peak in normal cells at 6 h. Subsequent development of fluorescence during the remaining 18 h of LDL incubation was primarily limited to the plasma membrane region of normal cells. In contrast, mutant cells developed a much more intense perinuclear fluorescence throughout the entire 24 h of LDL uptake with little enhancement of cholesterol fluorescence staining in the plasma membranes. Direct mass measurements confirmed that internalized LDL cholesterol more readily replenishes the plasma membrane cholesterol of normal than of mutant fibroblasts. Perinuclear filipin-cholesterol fluorescence of both normal and mutant cells was colocalized with lysosomes by indirect immunocytochemical staining of lysosomal membrane protein. Abnormal sequestration of LDL cholesterol in mutant cells within a metabolically latent pool is supported by the finding that in vitro esterification of cellular cholesterol could be stimulated in mutant but not in normal cell homogenates by extensive disruption of the intracellular membranous structures of cells previously cultured with LDL. Deficient translocation of exogenously derived cholesterol from lysosomes to other intracellular membrane sites may be responsible for the delayed homeostatic responses associated with LDL uptake by mutant Niemann-Pick Type C fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2088749364,"Point mutations were introduced into the overlapping trans-regulatory genes (tat-III and trs) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and the mutants were evaluated for virus expression. The results showed that tat-III has a positive transacting role and is required for transcriptional activation. A chain terminating mutation early in the trs gene resulted in an increase in transcription of viral messenger RNA as measured by nuclear transcription experiments, but only one major species of viral messenger RNA (1.8 kilobases) was detected, and little or no viral structural proteins were made. Thus, the trs gene product is essential for expression of virus structural proteins but, at the same time, may have a negative trans-regulatory role in transcription. Cotransfection of the point mutant proviruses defective in tat or trs with each other or with a complementary DNA clone containing tat and trs sequences restored the normal transcription pattern and subsequent virus production."
https://openalex.org/W1564906738,"We evaluated the mechanism of insulin and phorbol ester induction of the proto-oncogene c-fos in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts stably transformed with high levels of genes expressing normal or truncated human insulin receptors. Both insulin and the tumor-promoting phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced c-fos mRNA accumulation in cells expressing high numbers of normal human insulin receptors; PMA but not insulin was effective in the cells expressing the mutant receptor. Transient expression studies with plasmid constructions containing c-fos 5'-flanking sequences ligated to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that sequences corresponding to the serum response element were required for induction of c-fos transcription by both insulin and PMA. The insulin-sensitive cells contained a nuclear factor, presumably a protein, which bound specifically to this sequence of the c-fos gene; the apparent affinity of this factor to the normal serum response element was not affected by prior treatment of the cells with insulin or PMA. This c-fos binding factor may prove to be important in the regulation of c-fos expression by insulin and activators of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2024772298,"The Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) of maize carries the cytoplasmically inherited trait of male sterility. Mitochondria isolated from cms-T maize are specifically sensitive to a toxin (BmT-toxin) produced by the fungal pathogen Bipolaris maydis, race T, and the carbamate insecticide methomyl. A mitochondrial gene unique to cms-T maize, which produces a 13-kilodalton polypeptide associated with cytoplasmic male sterility, was expressed in Escherichia coli. After addition of BmT-toxin or methomyl, inhibition of whole cell respiration and swelling of spheroplasts were observed in Escherichia coli cultures producing the novel mitochondrial protein; these effects are similar to those observed with isolated cms-T mitochondria. The amino-terminal region of the 13-kilodalton polypeptide appears to be essential for proper interaction with the BmT-toxin and methomyl. These results implicate the 13-kilodalton polypeptide in conferring toxin sensitivity to mitochondria of cms-T maize."
https://openalex.org/W2032594763,"The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is an animal model of type I diabetes and develops a characteristic autoimmune lesion in the islets of Langerhans with lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The result is hypoinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and death. Diabetes usually begins by the sixth month of age but can occur earlier when young NOD mice are infused with lymphocytes from older NOD donors. When newborn or adult NOD mice were infected with a lymphotropic virus they did not become diabetic. The interaction between viruses and lymphocytes is pivotal in aborting diabetes, as established by experiments in which lymphocytes from virus-infected donors failed to transfer diabetes. In contrast, lymphocytes from age- and sex-matched uninfected donors caused disease. Therefore, viruses and, presumably, their products can be developed to be beneficial and may have potential as a component for treatment of human diseases. Further, these results point to the utility of viruses as probes for dissecting the pathogenesis of a nonviral disease."
https://openalex.org/W2137818336,"Mammalian brain tubulin consists of several isotypes of alpha and beta subunits that separate on polyacrylamide gels into three electrophoretic classes, designated alpha, beta 1, and beta 2. It has not been possible hitherto to resolve the different isotypes in a functional form. To this end, we have now isolated a monoclonal antibody, using as an immunogen a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the major tubulin isotype (type II) found in the beta 1-tubulin electrophoretic fraction. The antibody binds to beta 1 but not to alpha or beta 2. When pure tubulin from bovine brain is passed through an immunoaffinity column made from the anti-type II antibody, the tubulin that elutes in the unbound fraction is enriched greatly for the beta 2 electrophoretic variant. The tubulin that binds to the column appears to contain only alpha and beta 1, not beta 2. When these tubulin fractions are characterized by immunoblotting using the anti-type II antibody, the antibody binds only to the beta 1 band in the bound fraction, not to the beta 1 band in the unbound fraction. Using polyclonal antibodies generated against the carboxyl-termini of types I, III, and IV, we demonstrate that the beta 1 electrophoretic species is comprised of isotypes I, II, and IV, whereas the beta 2 variant is comprised exclusively of type III beta-tubulin. Further, we calculate that beta-tubulin in purified bovine brain tubulin is comprised of 3% type I, 58% type II, 25% type III, and 13% type IV tubulins."
https://openalex.org/W2001304403,"To investigate the relation between protein stability and the predicted stabilities of individual secondary structural elements, residue Pro86 in an alpha-helix in phage T4 lysozyme was replaced by ten different amino acids. The x-ray crystal structures of seven of the mutant lysozymes were determined at high resolution. In each case, replacement of the proline resulted in the formation of an extended alpha-helix. This involves a large conformational change in residues 81 to 83 and smaller shifts that extend 20 angstroms across the protein surface. Unexpectedly, all ten amino acid substitutions marginally reduce protein thermostability. This insensitivity of stability to the amino acid at position 86 is not simply explained by statistical and thermodynamic criteria for helical propensity. The observed conformational changes illustrate a general mechanism by which proteins can tolerate mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1597054855,"The RNA modification enzyme, tRNA pseudouridine synthase I has been isolated in 95% purity from an Escherichia coli strain harboring a multicopy plasmid with a 2.3-kilobase pair insert from the hisT operon. Its molecular size, amino acid composition, and amino-terminal sequence correspond to those predicted by the structure and expression of the hisT gene. Enzyme activity, as measured by a 3H release assay, is unaffected by pretreatment of tRNA pseudouridine synthase I with micrococcal nuclease and is optimized by the addition of a monovalent cation and thiol reductant. The activity is inhibited by all tRNA species tested, including substrates, modified tRNAs, nonsubstrates, or tRNAs containing 5-fluorouridine. Binding of tRNA pseudouridine synthase I occurs with both substrate and nonsubstrate tRNAs and does not require a monovalent cation. Our findings are consistent with a multistep mechanism whereby tRNA pseudouridine synthase I first binds nonspecifically and then forms transient covalent adducts with tRNA substrates. In the absence of other proteins, purified tRNA pseudouridine synthase I forms psi at all three modification sites known to be affected in hisT mutants. The 36.4-kDa polypeptide product of the gene adjacent to hisT, whose translation is linked to that of tRNA pseudouridine synthase I, is not a functional subunit for tRNA pseudouridine synthase I activity, nor is it a separate synthase acting at one of the three loci."
https://openalex.org/W1582854101,"The Tsx protein from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli is known to be involved in the permeation of nucleosides across the outer membrane under limiting substrate conditions. We purified Tsx from an E. coli strain that overproduces Tsx. The purified protein was still functional since it could neutralize the Tsx-specific bacteriophage T6 in vitro. When the purified Tsx was reconstituted into a lipid bilayer, there was a large increase of the membrane conductance, indicating pore-forming activity of Tsx in vitro. This increase could be strongly blocked with adenosine and to a much lesser extent with cytidine. Titration of the pore conductance with adenosine or cytidine suggested the presence of a binding site for nucleosides in the Tsx pore, with a Ks of 6 X 10(-4) and 2 X 10(-2) M for adenosine and cytidine, respectively. We propose that the Tsx protein functions in vivo as a pore that specifically facilitates the permeation of nucleosides across the outer membrane due to its binding site for nucleosides."
https://openalex.org/W1534343559,"The homogeneous dihydrodiol dehydrogenase of rat liver cytosol catalyzes the NADP-dependent oxidation of polycyclic aromatic trans-dihydrodiols, a reaction that may suppress their carcinogenicity provided the products of the reaction are noncarcinogenic. This report demonstrates that the products of naphthalene and benzo[a]pyrene trans-dihydrodiol oxidation are electrophilic o-quinones, which arise via autoxidation of catechols produced from the dihydrodiols by the action of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. Oxidation of the trans-1,2-dihydrodiol of naphthalene or the 7,8-dihydrodiol of benzo[a]pyrene by the homogeneous rat liver dehydrogenase in 50 mM glycine at pH 9.0 led to the formation of multiple products by TLC, none of which co-migrated with the corresponding o-quinone standards. An identical result was obtained when these standards were incubated with buffer alone, suggesting that o-quinones were formed enzymatically from the dihydrodiols, and then underwent addition reactions with the glycine buffer. In subsequent reactions, the o-quinones formed from the enzymatic oxidation of the trans-dihydrodiols of naphthalene and benzo[a]pyrene were trapped by conducting the reactions in phosphate buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. The products of these reactions were identified by 500 MHz nmr and electron impact mass spectrometry as adducts of the 1,2-quinone of naphthalene (m/e M+ = 234) and the 7,8-quinone of benzo[a]pyrene (m/e M+ = 358), which contained mercaptoethanol as a thioether at C-4 and C-10, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the reactivity of the 1,2-quinone of naphthalene showed that the cellular nucleophiles, cysteine and glutathione, react very rapidly with the quinone. The 7,8-quinone of benzo[a]pyrene also reacted with glutathione and cysteine to form water-soluble metabolites, but did not react with adenosine or guanosine. These results suggest that o-quinones formed by enzymatic dihydrodiol oxidation may be effectively scavenged by cellular nucleophiles, resulting in their detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W2009418752,"It has been proposed that the initiator protein RepA is rate limiting for mini-P1 plasmid replication, and that the role of the plasmid copy number control locus is to sequester the initiator and thus reduce replication. This proposal appears inconsistent with the observation that RepA is autoregulated, since the protein lost by sequestration should be replenished. A resolution of this autoregulation-sequestration paradox is possible if the sequestered RepA, unavailable for replication, is still available for promoter repression. We demonstrate that RepA binds to the control locus and to the promoter region simultaneously, causing the intervening DNA to loop. DNA looping could provide the requisite mechanism by which RepA bound to the control locus might exert repression."

https://openalex.org/W2143427122,"The enzymatic mechanisms for insulin breakdown by hepatocytes have not been established, nor have the degradation products been identified. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the enzyme insulin protease is involved in insulin degradation by hepatocytes. To identify the products of insulin generated by insulin protease and to compare them with those produced by hepatocytes, we have incubated insulin specifically iodinated at either the B-16 or the B-26 tyrosines with insulin protease and with isolated hepatocytes, separated the products on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and identified the B-chain cleavages. Insulin-sized products were obtained by Sephadex G-50 filtration. These insulin-sized products were injected on reverse-phase HPLC, and the peaks of radioactivity were identified. The product patterns generated by the enzyme and by hepatocytes were essentially identical with both isomers. The products were also sulfitolized to prepare the S-sulfonate derivatives of the B-chain and B-chain peptides. Again, the patterns on HPLC generated by the enzyme and by hepatocytes with both isomers were identical. Each of the original product peaks was also sulfitolized and injected separately on HPLC to relate B-chain peptides with product peaks. Again, the peptide compositions of the product peaks for both enzyme and hepatocytes were essentially identical. To identify the cleavage sites in the B-chain of insulin produced by insulin protease, the peptides from the degradation of [125I]iodo(B-26)insulin were purified and submitted to automated Edman degradation to identify the cycle in which radioactivity appeared. Seven peptides with cleavages on the amino side of the B26 residue were identified, and the cleavage sites were determined. Cleavages were found between B-9 and B-10 (Ser-His), B-10 and B-11 (His-Leu), B-14 and B-15 (Ala-Leu), B-13 and B-14 (Glu-Ala), B-16 and B-17 (Tyr-Leu), B-24 and B-25 (Phe-Phe), and B-25 and B-26 (Phe-Tyr). Peptides were also isolated from [125I]iodoinsulin incubated with isolated hepatocytes, and the cleavage sites in several of these were determined. These agreed exactly with the cleavage sites identified generated by the enzyme. The major peptides generated by the degradation of [125I]iodo(B-16)insulin were also isolated and sequenced, again showing identical cleavage sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1609819787,"We have previously described a novel mutant of human preproapolipoprotein A-II (pre(delta pro)apoA-II) in which the wild-type 18-amino acid-long signal sequence (Gly18 decreases) was functionally redefined to 20 amino acids in length (Ala 20 decreases). We have used this mutant as a model preprotein to probe the substrate specificity of eukaryotic signal peptidase. Site-saturation mutagenesis was performed resulting in the substitution of 13 different amino acids (acidic, basic, aromatic, hydrophobic, and small-neutral) for Ala20 (or position -1). The effects of these substitutions were assessed using an in vitro transcription/translation/microsomal membrane processing system. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the 13 mutant proteins demonstrated that amino acids which occupy position -1 in a signal peptide are critical in establishing a good context for signal peptidase cleavage and that two or more potential sites of cleavage may compete for recognition by signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1488100710,"Insulin stimulates autophosphorylation of the beta subunit of its receptor and activates the associated tyrosine kinase. This kinase, in turn, phosphorylates a number of specific protein substrates; however, the functional and structural identity of these substrates is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin also stimulates the phosphorylation of calmodulin by rat hepatocyte insulin receptors partially purified by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. Phosphorylation occurred predominantly on tyrosine residues and had an absolute requirement for insulin receptors, divalent cations, and certain basic proteins. Maximal 32P incorporation was observed at an insulin concentration of 5 X 10(-9) M, and the K0.5 for insulin was approximately 4 X 10(-10) M. Phosphorylation of calmodulin was dependent upon ATP, saturating at 100 microM ATP with a K0.5 of 30 microM. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin was also dependent upon Mg2+ or Mn2+, but was approximately 12-fold greater in the presence of Mg2+. Maximal phosphorylation was observed in the absence of Ca2+ and was inhibited at Ca2+:EGTA ratios greater than 0.8 (0.16 microM free Ca2+). Certain basic proteins, such as polylysine, histone Hf2b, and protamine sulfate, were necessary to observe insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin. The relative amount of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin observed in the presence of each of these proteins differed. Maximal insulin-stimulated phosphorylation was observed in the presence of polylysine. These data suggest that both Ca2+ and calmodulin may participate in the early post-receptor events in the cellular mechanism of insulin action in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1514929729,"The 5'-terminal guanylate residue (G-1) of mature Escherichia coli tRNA(His) is generated as a result of an unusual cleavage by RNase P (Orellana, O., Cooley, L., and Soll, D. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 525-529). We have examined the importance of the unique acceptor stem structure of E. coli tRNA(His) in determining the specificity of RNase P cleavage. Mutant tRNA(His) precursors bearing substitutions of the normal base G-1 or the opposing, potentially paired base, C73, can be cleaved at the +1 position, in contrast to wild-type precursors which are cut exclusively at the -1 position. These data indicate that the nature of the base at position -1 is of greater importance in determining the site of RNase P cleavage than potential base pairing between nucleotides -1 and 73. In addition, processing of the mutant precursors by M1-RNA or P RNA under conditions of ribozyme catalysis yields a higher proportion of +1-cleaved products in comparison to the reaction catalyzed by the RNase P holoenzyme. This lower sensitivity of the holoenzyme to alterations in acceptor stem structure suggests that the protein moiety of RNase P may play a role in determining the specificity of the reaction and implies that recognition of the substrate involves additional regions of the tRNA. We have also shown that the RNase P holoenzyme and tRNA(His) precursor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, unlike their prokaryotic counterparts, do not possess these abilities to carry out this unusual reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1556728189,"Abstract The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the reversible accumulation of nonhelical, underhydroxylated procollagen in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) remain obscure. To clarify these mechanisms, we isolated chondrocytes from chick vertebral cartilage and kept them in scorbutic monolayer cultures. By Day 9 of culture, the chondrocytes had accumulated a large amount of underhydroxylated Type II procollagen in their RER. Within 1 h of ascorbate treatment, the accumulated procollagen was hydroxylated; this was accompanied by a slight stimulation of procollagen secretion and was followed by a marked stimulation starting between 2 and 3 h of treatment. Secretion of the accumulated procollagen was completed by about 24 h of treatment. Strikingly, the marked stimulation of procollagen secretion at 2-3 h of treatment was associated with marked remodeling of the RER. This organelle came to consist of a few, unusually large cisternae (sacs) and many flat cisternae while the RER in untreated cells consisted of uniform, oval cisternae. The RER remodeling was accompanied by a comparable redistribution of the accumulated Type II procollagen stored in it. The RER sacs and flat cisternae invariably communicated directly and were still detectable by 8 h but not by 24 h of treatment. RER remodeling and procollagen redistribution also occurred in untreated chondrocytes that had been shifted to 23 degrees C for 2-3 h. Together, the data indicate that folding of the accumulated procollagen molecules into their normal helical configuration is followed by procollagen redistribution within, and remodeling of, the RER. These processes may have a role in stimulating procollagen export from the RER and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1572708571,"Escherichia coli isocitrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.1.) can be phosphorylated in vitro by an ATP-dependent reaction. The enzyme becomes phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase when partially purified sonic extracts are incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. Treatment of isocitrate lyase with diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine-modifying reagent, blocked incorporation of [32P]phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was altered by treatment with phosphoramidate, a histidine phosphorylating agent, which suggests that isocitrate lyase can be phosphorylated at a histidine residue(s). Immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled isocitrate lyase was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis, mixed with chemically synthesized phosphohistidine standards, and analyzed by anion exchange chromatography. Characterization of the phosphoamino acid was based on the demonstration that the 32P-labeled product from alkali-hydrolyzed isocitrate lyase comigrated with synthetic 1-phosphohistidine. In addition, loss of catalytic activity after treatment with potato acid phosphatase indicates that catalytically active isocitrate lyase is the phosphorylated form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1491504635,"Permeabilized rat hepatocytes were used to study the effects of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and GTP on Ca2+ uptake and release by ATP-dependent intracellular Ca2+ storage pools. Under conditions where these Ca2+ pools were completely filled, maximal doses of Ins(1,4,5)P3 released only 25-30% of the sequestered Ca2+. The residual Ca2+ was freely releasable with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Addition of GTP in the absence of Ins(1,4,5)P3 did not cause Ca2+ release and had no effect on the steady-state level of Ca2+ accumulation by intracellular storage pools. However, after a 3-4-min treatment with GTP the size of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-releasable Ca2+ pool was increased by about 2-fold, with a proportional decrease in the residual Ca2+ available for release by ionomycin. In contrast to the situation with freshly permeabilized cells, permeabilized hepatocytes from which cytosolic components had been washed out exhibited direct Ca2+ release in response to GTP addition. The potentiation of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release by GTP in permeabilized hepatocytes was concentration-dependent with half-maximal effects at about 5 microM GTP. The dose response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 was not shifted by GTP; instead GTP increased the amount of Ca2+ released at all Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations. The effects of GTP were not mimicked by other nucleotides or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues. In fact, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) inhibited the actions of GTP. However, this inhibition only occurred when GTP gamma S was added prior to GTP, suggesting that the GTP effect is not readily reversible once the cells have been permeabilized. Experiments using vanadate to inhibit the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake pump showed that Ins(1,4,5)P3 releases all of the Ca2+ within the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool even in the absence of GTP. The increase of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release brought about by GTP was also unaffected by vanadate. It is concluded that GTP increases the proportion of the sequestered Ca2+ which is available for release by Ins(1,4,5)P3, either by unmasking latent Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ release sites or by allowing direct Ca2+ movement between Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive and Ins(1,4,5)P3-insensitive Ca2+ storage pools."
https://openalex.org/W1533205371,"Reaction of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase of Escherichia coli with the thiol reagent 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) leads to a modification of only 2 of the 6 cysteines of the enzyme, with a significant loss of its enzymatic activity. Under denaturing conditions, however, all 6 cysteines of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase react with DTNB, indicating the absence of disulfide bridges in the native protein. In the presence of shikimate 3-phosphate and glyphosate, only 1 of the 2 cysteines reacts with the reagent, with no loss of activity, suggesting that only 1 of these cysteines is at or near the active site of the enzyme. Cyanolysis of the DTNB-inactivated enzyme with KCN leads to elimination of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate, with formation of the thiocyano-enzyme. The thiocyano-enzyme is fully active; it exhibits a small increase in its I50 for glyphosate (6-fold) and apparent Km for phosphoenolpyruvate (4-fold) compared to the unmodified enzyme. Its apparent Km for shikimate 3-phosphate is, however, unaltered. These results clearly establish the nonessentiality of the active site-reactive cysteine of E. coli 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase for either catalysis or substrate binding. Perturbations in the kinetic constants for phosphoenolpyruvate and glyphosate suggest that the cysteine thiol is proximal to the binding site for these ligands. By N-[14C]ethylmaleimide labeling, tryptic mapping, and N-terminal sequencing, the 2 reactive cysteines have been identified as Cys408 and Cys288. The cysteine residue protected by glyphosate and shikimate 3-phosphate from its reaction with DTNB was found to be Cys408."
https://openalex.org/W1538704784,"Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) was expressed in Escherichia coli harboring a plasmid containing a synthetic human parathyroid hormone gene under the control of the E. coli lac promoter. Three major forms of the hormone were isolated by acid extraction and purified to homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography. By amino acid analysis and NH2-terminal sequencing, these were identified as hPTH-(1-84), formyl-methionyl-hPTH-(1-84), and hPTH-(8-84). The recombinant hPTH-(1-84) was immunologically indistinguishable from a World Health Organization standard of extracted native hPTH-(1-84). Recombinant hPTH-(1-84) was also bioactive in renal and skeletal adenylate cyclase assays. In the skeletal bioassay performed in UMR 108 osteosarcoma cells its activity was identical to that of an hPTH-(1-84) standard. In this bioassay, formyl-methionyl-hPTH-(1-84) had 10% of the activity of hPTH-(1-84) and hPTH-(8-84) was inactive. The results demonstrate the importance of isolating hPTH-(1-84) from other recombinant forms and metabolites to achieve full hormonal bioactivity and indicate that purified recombinant hPTH-(1-84) can thereby be obtained which should be a useful source of hormone for both basic and clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W1575669412,"We report here the DNA sequence of the entire coding region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA ligase gene. tRNA ligase is one of two enzymes required for tRNA splicing in yeast, and the enzyme is likely a single polypeptide with multiple activities. We find that tRNA ligase is a basic protein of 827 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 95,400. The inferred amino acid sequence for tRNA ligase is not significantly homologous to that of other known proteins of similar activity. In addition to the tRNA ligase reading frame and several other unidentified open reading frames, we have found two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, near the 5'-end of the ligase structural gene. One of these, ORF2, produces a divergent transcript which initiates only 125 nucleotides upstream of the tRNA ligase transcript, and is present in approximately the same relative abundance as the transcript for tRNA ligase."
https://openalex.org/W1567678817,"Soluble, truncated mutant and wild-type forms of penicillin-binding protein 5 (sPBP 5) from Escherichia coli were produced in large amounts by placing the dacA gene that encodes PBP 5 under the control of the trp-lac fusion promoter. The 3' end of the dacA gene used in this study contains a stop codon that results in the deletion of 15 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus and the production of a soluble protein. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, the role of cysteine 115 in the mechanism of sPBP 5 was investigated. Alkylation of cysteine 115 with sulfhydryl reagents has previously been shown to inhibit severely the D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity of PBP 5. Alkylation also inhibits the hydrolysis of bound penicillin G, with only a slight effect on its binding. Cysteine 115 in sPBP 5 was changed to either a serine (sPBP 5C-S) or an alanine (sPBP 5C-A) residue. The wild-type and mutant sPBPs were purified in milligram amounts from induced cultures by ampicillin affinity chromatography. The mutant PBPs showed only a 2-fold increase in the half-life of the penicilloyl-PBP complex, and had a binding affinity for penicillin G identical to wild-type PBP 5. The Km for the release of D-alanine from the peptide L-Ala-D-gamma-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala was 5.0, 3.5, and 7.8 mM for PBP 5, PBP 5C-S, and PBP 5C-A, respectively, while the values for Vmax were 2.5, 3.3, and 5.1 mumol/min/mg. From these data it was concluded that the cysteine residue does not directly participate in the enzymatic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1493396799,"We have reported previously (Horowitz, J. A., Toeg, H., and Orr, G. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 832-838) that most of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases in rat sperm are associated with the flagellum. We have now identified flagellar polypeptides which are capable of forming tight complexes with the regulatory subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RII). Flagellar RII-binding polypeptides were identified using an RII overlay/immunoblot procedure and had apparent subunit Mr of 120,000, 80,000, and 57,000 in rat and 120,000 and 57,000 in bovine flagella. RII is released from the flagellum by disulfide reducing agents, e.g. 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining of the DTT-released material shows that a limited subpopulation of flagellar polypeptides are solubilized by disulfide-reducing agents. Neither tubulin, the dynein ATPase, or any of the RII-binding proteins are released by 1 mM DTT, and thin section electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of the flagellum is unaltered by reducing conditions. Our data established that RII is not linked to the flagellum via a direct disulfide bridge. We propose that RII is released from the flagellum, a highly disulfide cross-linked structure, due to structural changes in the flagellum which disrupts the interaction between RII and its binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1561801055,"The enzyme N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase from Escherichia coli has been purified 7,100-fold to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme is part of the diaminopimelic acid-lysine pathway in bacteria and catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelic acid to produce L-diaminopimelic acid and succinate. The enzyme exists as a mixture of dimeric and tetrameric species of identical subunits of molecular weight approximately 40,000. Activity was completely abolished following dialysis of the enzyme against metal chelators. Cobalt(II) and zinc were effective in restoring the activity. The apparent affinities of the apoenzyme for cobalt and zinc were similar (Kd values near 1 microM) and the cobalt enzyme was 2.2-fold more active than the zinc enzyme. The Km and turnover number for the hydrolysis of the natural substrate, N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelic acid, were 0.4 mM and 16,000 min-1, respectively. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was defined by preparing a number of substrate analogues that systematically lack the various functional groups present in the molecule. These studies show that the enzyme is highly specific for the natural substrate. These properties of N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase and the fact that the enzyme is essential for bacterial growth make it an ideal target for the development of inhibitors with potential antibacterial activity."
https://openalex.org/W2140846648,"Holliday junctions, in which two double-stranded DNA molecules are linked by single-stranded crossovers, are thought to be central intermediates in genetic recombination. We report here the in vitro specificity of a yeast endonuclease for structures analogous to Holliday junctions. Plasmids that extrude inverted repeat sequences into cruciform junctions are cleaved by the introduction of nicks into strands of like polarity, approximately 4-8 nucleotides from the base of the junction. In all cases, cleavage occurs within homologous sequences, and with precise symmetry across the junction. In contrast, a junction containing four arms of unrelated sequence is cleaved asymmetrically. The dependence upon homology for symmetrical cleavage is not found with T4 endonuclease VII, which cleaves branched structures in vitro. Holliday junction resolution appears to occur in a concerted manner by the introduction of nicks into two homologous DNA helices held in alignment."
https://openalex.org/W1492006655,"The yeast CUP1 gene product, copper metallothionein, acts to repress the basal transcription of its own structural gene. By creating a series of truncation and amino acid substitutions in CUP1, we show that the ability of the protein to autoregulate is directly correlated to its ability to bind and detoxify copper. These results support a model in which metallothionein controls the level of free intracellular copper available to interact with positive transcription factors. In addition, mutations in chemically equivalent cysteine residues were functionally dissimilar, suggesting that partial sites in the molecule are critical for the formation of the sulfur-metal cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1586227234,"Jel 42 is a monoclonal antibody specific for histidine-containing protein, a small phosphocarrier protein required for sugar transport in Escherichia coli. Fab fragments prepared from this antibody by papain digestion consisted of three major isoelectric forms which were separated on a chromatofocusing column. Two of these forms produced large crystals in space group P21 and unit cell dimensions a = 117.48 A, b = 66.56 A, c = 67.31 A, and beta = 118.7 degrees, with two Fab fragments per asymmetric unit. Data were collected to 3.5-A resolution. The structure of Fab Jel 42 was solved by the Molecular Replacement method (least-squares refined to R = 0.282) using the known structure of Fab HED 10 (12) as the search model; the amino acid residues of the hypervariable and elbow regions of Fab HED 10 were omitted from the starting model. A Fourier map calculated at this stage revealed electron density which corresponded to the hypervariable loops forming the antigen-binding crevice and the elbow region of Fab Jel 42. The elbow angles for the two independent Fab molecules are 159 and 167 degrees, similar to that of the Fab HED 10 search model which has an elbow angle of 162 degrees. There is no local noncrystallographic axis of symmetry relating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit."
https://openalex.org/W1481233353,"We have characterized the functional attributes of a 211-base pair region containing the Escherichia coli tryptophan operon rho-dependent terminator trp t', utilizing a series of constructs that alter the orientation, location, or extent of the trp t' sequences with respect to the trp promoter. In each instance, the extent of the rho-dependent response was monitored in vivo by read-through expression into a distal galactokinase gene and was compared with the results of transcription assays in vitro. As expected, transcription termination in vivo is dependent on the proper orientation of the terminator, and a tandem repeat of the terminator increases termination proportionally. Placing the terminator fragment only 14 nucleotides from the promoter does not affect termination significantly, supporting the belief that sequences outside of the 211-base pair fragment itself are dispensable. One construct, which lacks 116 base pairs, including the region encoding the normal RNA end points, still reduces galK activity in vivo and terminates transcription in vitro. Our results indicate that the rho response depends primarily on sequences in this 95-base pair segment, causing RNA polymerase to terminate transcription in a region 15-45 nucleotides further downstream."
https://openalex.org/W1496938093,"Abstract In vitro mutagenesis techniques have been used to investigate two structure-function questions relating to the allosteric citrate synthase of Escherichia coli. The first question concerns the binding site of alpha-keto-glutarate, which is a structural analogue of the substrate oxaloacetate and yet has been suggested to be an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the cloned E. coli citrate synthase gene, we prepared missense mutants, designated CS226H----Q and CS229H----Q, in which histidine residues at positions 226 and 229, respectively, were replaced by glutamine. In the homologous pig heart citrate synthase it is known (Wiegand, G., and Remington, S. J. (1986) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 15, 97-117) that the equivalent of His-229 helps to bind oxaloacetate, while the equivalent of His-226 is nearby. Kinetic and ligand binding measurements showed that CS226H----Q had a reduced affinity for oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate, while CS229H----Q bound oxaloacetate even less effectively, and was not inhibited by alpha-ketoglutarate at all under our conditions. This parallel loss of binding affinities for oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate, in two mutants altered in residues at the active site of E. coli citrate synthase, strongly suggests that inhibition of this enzyme by alpha-ketoglutarate is not allosteric but occurs by competitive inhibition at the active site. The second question investigated was whether the known inhibition by acetyl-CoA of binding of NADH, an allosteric inhibitor of E. coli citrate synthase, occurs heterotropically, as an indirect result of acetyl-CoA binding at the active site, or directly, by competition at the allosteric NADH binding site. Using existing restriction sites in the cloned E. coli citrate synthase gene, we prepared a deletion mutant which lacked 24 amino acids near what is predicted to the acetyl-CoA-binding portion of the active site. The mutant protein was inactive, and acetyl-CoA did not bind to the active site but still inhibited NADH binding. Thus acetyl-CoA can interact with both the allosteric and the active sites of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1521007432,"Abstract Conformational changes of duck ovostatin (ovomacroglobulin) upon complexing with thermolysin have been studied by electron microscopy. Both free and thermolysin-bound ovostatin preparations were negatively stained with uranyl acetate, a series of three pictures were taken at 10 degrees specimen tilt intervals (+10 degrees, 0 degrees, and -10 degrees), and images of the inhibitor molecules were observed in three dimensions. Four approximately cylindrical subunits were observed in free ovostatin. Two subunits associated approximately midway from both ends to form a dimer of four arms. Two dimers associated with each other at the midpoint to form a tetramer. The proteinase susceptible regions were located near the center of the molecule. Eight arms of the tetramer take various configurations. The orthogonal extent of free tetrameric ovostatin in a two-dimensional micrograph averages 26.0 +/- 4.7 x 34.0 +/- 5.0 nm. Upon complexing with thermolysin, all eight arms curl toward the center of the molecule, having four arms upward and the other four downward. Thus, proteinase-bound ovostatin has a uniform structure with a 2-fold axis of symmetry. The overall structure of the complex is more compact with average dimensions of 16.9 +/- 0.6 x 16.9 +/- 0.6 x 19.9 +/- 0.4 nm. From these electron microscopic studies we propose that a proteinase reaches to the center of the free ovostatin molecule and attacks the bait region. Subsequent to proteolysis the subunit arms curl and entrap the enzyme within the ovostatin molecule. The results support the unique mechanism of inhibition of proteinases by alpha 2-macroglobulin and ovostatin postulated from biochemical observations (Barrett, A. J., and Starkey, P. M. (1973) Biochem. J. 133, 709-724; Nagase, H., and Harris, E. D., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7490-7498)."
https://openalex.org/W1600481207,"In order to determine the mechanism and enzyme(s) responsible for 3' processing of tRNA precursors, we have developed an in vitro processing system that uses as substrates two SP6 RNA polymerase-generated transcripts of the gene for tRNA(Tyrsu3)+ that contain 49 extra 5'-nucleotides and either 5 or 25 extra 3'-nucleotides. A high speed supernatant fraction from an Escherichia coli strain deficient in five ribonucleases was found to accurately process both tRNA precursors in this system to the size of mature tRNA(Tyr). Final 3' end processing of each precursor occurs in an exonucleolytic manner to generate the correct 3' terminus; however, a prior endonucleolytic cleavage also is observed in processing of the longer precursor. The system requires Mg2+ and works optimally at about 50 mM KCl and pH 8-9. Dialysis of the supernatant fraction leads to loss of processing activity but can be restored to normal by the addition of inorganic phosphate or arsenate. Furthermore, nucleoside diphosphates are a product of the processing reaction. These data indicate that 3' processing in RNase-deficient extracts involves a phosphorolytic reaction. On the other hand, phosphate is not required for processing in RNase+ extracts, although it does aid in processing of the longer precursor. The usefulness of this in vitro system for studies of tRNA processing and the identity of the phosphate-requiring enzyme are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1572157273,"Neutron activation analysis of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from Escherichia coli for 53 metals shows that the enzyme does not contain any of these metals at significant levels. The substrate analog P1-5'-uridine-P2-glucose-6-yl pyrophosphate (UGP), a structural isomer of UDP-glucose with the sugar linked to UDP through the C-6 hydroxyl group, is an inactivator that irreversibly reduces epimerase.NAD+ to epimerase.NADH. The pH dependence of kobs reveals the essential involvement of an acidic group, kinetically measured pKa = 5.48 +/- 0.08, in unprotonated form and two weakly acidic or basic groups, apparent pKa values of 10.03 +/- 0.43, in protonated forms. Measurements of kobs as a function of [UGP] show that it is given by kobs = k[UGP]/(K + [UGP]) at a given pH, where K = 0.19 +/- 0.04 mM throughout the pH range 4.8-10.4. The pH-dependent first order rate constants range from 0.28 to 1.94 s-1, with the maximum value at pH 7.6 and decreasing at acidic and basic pH values. Reaction of [glucose-1-2H]UGP proceeds with kinetic isotope effects of 5.0, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, and 3.5 at pH values 5.0, 6.2, 7.6, 9.0, and 10.0, respectively. Therefore, hydride transfer becomes rate-limiting at pH extremes but is not limiting at neutral pH, although deuteride transfer is significantly limiting at all pH values. The isotope effects facilitated correction of the kinetic pK values to the thermodynamic values 6.1-6.2 on the acid side and 9.0-9.6 on the alkaline side. We postulate that the group with pK1 = 5.5 (6.1-6.2 corrected) functions as an enzymic general base that abstracts the glucosyl C-1 hydroxyl proton in concert with transfer of the C-1 hydrogen and two electrons to NAD+. The pH dependence on the alkaline side may be related to the uridine nucleotide-dependent conformational transition that is an essential step in the reduction of epimerase.NAD+ to epimerase.NADH by sugars."
https://openalex.org/W1516038587,"Polypeptides responsible for activities of chick embryo DNA primase and DNA polymerase alpha were identified using monoclonal antibodies specific to these two enzymes. The 4-8H antibody neutralized DNA polymerase alpha activity measured on activated DNA template and also ribonucleoside triphosphate-dependent DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA template (DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha combined activity) to a partial extent (about 30%), but did not affect DNA primase activity. The 4-2D antibody, although it did not affect DNA polymerase alpha activity, did neutralize both DNA primase activity and DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha combined activity extensively (up to 70%). Immunoblotting analysis of the DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha complex showed that 4-2D and 4-8H antibodies recognize 60-kDa and 160-180-kDa polypeptides, respectively. An immunoaffinity column made of either of these antibodies retained DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha complex. When the enzyme was eluted from the 4-8H column with alkaline solution, DNA primase was eluted prior to DNA polymerase alpha. In the case of 4-2D antibody column chromatography, the elution order of two enzymes was reversed. Results indicate that two enzymes in the complex which was retained in the antibody column were dissociated by lower alkaline pH than that dissociated the antigenic enzymes from the corresponding antibodies. In both cases, the fractions with DNA primase activity contained exclusively 60-kDa polypeptide, while those with DNA polymerase alpha contained 160-180-kDa polypeptides. Thus, DNA primase resided in 60-kDa polypeptide and was recognized by 4-2D antibody while DNA polymerase alpha resided in 160-180-kDa polypeptides and was recognized by 4-8H antibody. Immunofluorescence made with the DNA primase-specific 4-2D antibody as well as with 4-8H antibody appeared in granular structures which were tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. These nuclear fluorescences were much reduced in quiescent cells. Furthermore, since the fluorescence made by these antibodies was induced by adding serum to the quiescent cells in serum-deprived cultures, the expression of DNA primase and its organization in the structures on the nuclear matrix are regulated in correlation to the proliferating stage of cells, as observed with DNA polymerase alpha."

https://openalex.org/W1559538274,"We have investigated the responsiveness to growth factors (GFs) of primary baby rat kidney (BRK) cells transformed by the E1 region of adenovirus 5 or 12. The in vitro growth of non-oncogenic adenovirus 5-transformed BRK cells is largely independent of serum GFs, whereas growth of highly oncogenic adenovirus 12-transformed cells is strictly dependent on GFs present in serum. For the growth of adenovirus 12 E1-transformed BRK cells serum can be replaced by insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I but not by epidermal growth factor. To maintain the in vitro growth of adenovirus 12-transformed cells physiological levels of insulin-like growth factor-I, but not of insulin, are sufficient. Similar results have been found with adenovirus-transformed primary murine cells and with transformants of an established rat cell line, NRK 49F. This indicates that the observed GF responsiveness is not dependent of the cell type used but is determined by the serotype of the adenovirus-transforming region. Using hybrid E1 regions consisting of E1A of one serotype and E1B of the other, we show that the pattern of GF-responsiveness correlates with the origin of the E1A region. The differences in the GF-responsiveness of the adenovirus 5-transformed and adenovirus 12-transformed cells will be discussed in terms of the oncogenicity of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524405744,The former head of Japans Ministry of Health and Welfares Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) research group has admitted to delaying approval for clinical trials and marketing of heat-treated blood coagulants for hemophiliacs so that a Japanese blood product manufacturer could catch up with foreign competitors. The Tokyo branch of the National Association of Hemophiliacs began a campaign in 1983 to urge the government to introduce the use of these blood coagulants which were already being marketed in the US and West Germany. However the Japanese Government stalled 2 years before handling applications for these products. In this 2-year period hundreds of Japanese hemophiliacs are believed to have been infected with AIDS. In Japan hemophiliacs are the predominant victims of AIDS; they comprised 34 of the 59 officially confirmed cases of AIDS as of October 1987. An estimated 2000 (40%) of Japans 5000 hemophiliacs are believed to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The primary infection route is suspected to be blood plasma imported from the US for manufacture of blood coagulants. The head of the AIDS research group Dr Takeshi Abe claims he delayed giving approval to the coagulants to prevent arousing suspicions about the safety of existing products. However an investigation revealed that Abe received a large donation from Midori Juji--which dominates Japans blood product market--to set up a nonprofit corporation under Abes leadership to promote research on hemophilia. Members of the National Association of Hemophiliacs plan to demand compensation from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical companies that sold the non-heat-treated blood coagulants.
https://openalex.org/W1608626798,"The transition between the native and denatured states of the tetrameric succinyl-CoA synthetase from Escherichia coli has been investigated by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, cross-linking by glutaraldehyde and activity measurements. At pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C, both denaturation of succinyl-CoA synthetase by guanidine hydrochloride and refolding of the denatured enzyme have been characterized as reversible reactions. In the presence of its substrate ATP, the denatured enzyme could be successfully reconstituted into the active enzyme with a yield of 71-100%. Kinetically, reacquisition of secondary structure by the denatured enzyme was rapid and occurred within 1 min after refolding was initiated. On the other hand, its reactivation was a slow process which continued up to 25 min before 90% of the native activity could be restored. Both secondary and quaternary structures of the enzyme, reconstituted in the absence of ATP, were indistinguishable from those of the native enzyme but the renatured protein was catalytically inactive. This observation indicates the presence of catalytically inactive tetramer as an intermediate in the reconstitution process. The reconstituted protein could be reactivated by ATP even 10 min after the reacquisition of the native secondary structure by the refolding protein. However, reactivation of the protein by ATP 60 min after the regain of secondary structure was significantly less, suggesting that rapid refolding and reassociation of the monomers into a native-like tetramer and reactivation of the tetramer are sequential events; the latter involving slow and small conformational rearrangements in the refolded enzyme that are likely to be associated with phosphorylation."
