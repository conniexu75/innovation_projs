https://openalex.org/W2070464377,"Phthalate ester plasticizers have been detected in the open-ocean environment. Samples consisting of water, sediment, air, and biota from the Gulf of Mexico and of water and air from the North Atlantic were analyzed and found to contain two phthalate esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-dibutyl phthalate (DBP): the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) and DDT's (p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE) were also determined. Like the ubiquitous PCB's and DDT's, the phthalate plasticizers were found in almost all samples analyzed; DEHP was present at higher concentrations than the PCB's or DDT's in water and sediment. The environmental impact of the concentrations found in these studies, coupled with the continued high production and wise use of these plasticizers, requires assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2058632547,"During development of Drosophila melanogaster, sequential commitment to alternative development programs occurs in neighboring groups of cells. These commitments appear to be reflected by lines of clonal restriction, called compartmental boundaries, which progressively subdivide the early embryo, and later the imaginal discs, which give rise to different adult appendages. We propose that a reaction-diffusion system acts throughout development and generates a sequence of differently shaped chemical patterns. These patterns account for the sequence and geometries of compartmental boundaries, and predict that each terminal compartment is specified by a unique combination of binary choices made during its formation. This binary ""code"" interprets coherently the patterned metaplasia seen in transdetermination and homeotic mutations."

The structural gene for larval serum protein 2 (LSP 2) lies at 68E3 or 4, and that for salivary glue secretion protein 3 between 68A8 and 68C11, coincident with a major intermoult puff active in the salivary gland at the time of glue synthesis. The structural genes for esterase 6 and four visible recessive loci lie within the same region."

Biol. 1973; 78: 453-471 Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar ) and the ampicillin-resistant plasmid pSF2124 ( So et al., 1975 So M. Gill R. Falkow S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 142: 239-249 Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar ) as a cloning vehicle. Two clones, containing hybrid plasmids with sequences complementary to a 5S RNA probe isolated from Drosophila tissue culture cells, were identified by the Grunstein and Hogness, 1975 Grunstein M. Hogness D.S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 72. 1975: 3961-3965 Google Scholar colony hybridization procedure. One hybrid plasmid has a Drosophila insert which is comprised solely of tandem repeats of the 5S gene plus spacer sequences. The other plasmid contains an insert which has about 20 tandem 5S repeat units plus an additional 4 kilobases of adjacent sequences. The size of the 5S repeat unit was determined by gel electrophoresis and was found to be approximately 375 base pairs. We present a restriction map of both plasmids, and a detailed map of the 5S repeat unit. The 5S repeat unit shows slight length and sequence heterogeneity. We present evidence suggesting that the 5S genes in Drosophila melanogaster may be arranged in a single continuous cluster."

Aggressive behavior was engendered in all three species by confronting a resident animal with an intruder conspecific. The present results contrast with the widely held belief that marihuana increases aggressive behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1563999032,"The action of different effectors, glycosides, and alcohols on the reactions catalyzed by beta-galactosidase is analyzed in this paper. Effectors as large as tri- and tetrasaccharides have no effect on the enzyme activity, suggesting that the binding site has rather small size. Most of the beta-galactosides produce a competitive inhibition. The other compounds assayed behave either as noncompetitive inhibitors, and they are deadened inhibitors, or as uncompetitive inhibitors which exhibit a better affinity for the chemical intermediate than for free enzyme; nearly all of them give transfer products. The analysis of the data indicates that the active center of beta-galactosidase is made up of two subsites: a galactose and a glucose subsite. This latter site is in a more favorable conformation in the galactosylenzyme than in free enzyme; possibly it might even by generated by the galactose binding. Conformational rearrangements of the active center deduced from the inhibition data have been directly observed by differential spectroscopy. The conformational adaptability of the enzyme and its consequence for the functional properties of beta-galactosidase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2038139201,"A study has been made of the hybridization of mouse light chain cDNA to restriction enzyme digests of DNA. DNA was digested with B. st (specificity GGATCC) and fractionated on preparative agarose gels for hybridization analysis. Experiments with liver or kidney DNA yielded two peaks of hybridization with V+C cDNA corresponding to the Cκ gene and to the germ line V gene homologous to the MOPC21 V gene. Since there is no site for digestion by B. st within the MOPC21 V or C genes, this result shows that the germ line DNA carries separately the V21 and Cκ genes. The hybridization profiles of two different myeloma DNAs (MOPC21 and AdjPC5) differed from those of the germ line DNA. In both myelomas, only one hybridization peak was observed and no peaks corresponding to the germ line pattern were seen. The new pattern of hybridization implies that the events involved in maturation of antibody-producing cells includes rearrangement of the V and C genes. To study whether this proposed rearrangement of DNA results in contiguous V and C genes in producing cells, discrete V+C cDNA size classes (prepared with MOPC21 mRNA) were hybridized to both unfractionated restriction digested MOPC21 DNA and to the partially purified L chain gene of MOPC21 DNA. The length of the cDNA rendered resistant to single-strand-specific S1 nuclease was determined. In no case was the full length of V+C cDNA protected from nuclease; instead, a fragment of about 290 bases (C region length) plus smaller fragments were generated. These results indicate that the rearrangement of L chain genes, which seems to occur in myeloma cells, may well not produce contiguous V and C genes in the DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1975659694,"Squirrel monkeys synchronized to a 24-hour light-dark cycle show a prominent circadian rhythm in body temperature which is regulated against mild environmental cold exposures throughout the 24-hour day. However, cold exposures produce significant decreases in core body temperature when the circadian rhythms of the animal are free-running in the absence of environmental time cues. Effective thermoregulation appears to require the precise internal synchronization of the circadian timekeeping system."

https://openalex.org/W2070120305,"EXAMPLES of control mutations are rare in eukaryotes. Indeed, the only well-documented examples are in Aspergillus1,2 and a mutant affecting xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) activity and mapping adjacent to, but separable from, rosy, the structural gene for XDH in Drosophila melanogaster3,4. Control of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), particularly in Drosophila has recently been studied. In examining ADH activity in selection lines and in samples from natural populations, a line was found to be Adhs and to have half the activity of a normal slow-migrating allele. To test the hypothesis that the low activity Adhs line contains a control mutation, we have attempted to separate the activity phenotype from the electrophoretic (structural gene) phenotype by recombination. We have succeeded in doing this, and in the process have obtained a very accurate position for Adh based on its recombination with closely-linked marker loci."

https://openalex.org/W1502474396,"DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Bacillus subtilis contains a 21,000 molecular weight (21K) peptide subunit. This subunit was purified and added to 21K-depleted polymerase isolated from both uninfected and SP85-infected B. subtilis. The effect of the subunit on total RNA synthesis, on enzyme-DNA binding, on RNA chain initiation and elongation, and on enzymatic specificity were examined. A comparison was made of the effects of the 21K peptide and NaCl on polymerase activity, RNA chain elongation, and symmetry of transcription of SP82 DNA. The addition of the 21K peptide to enzyme preparations lacking this subunit stimulated total polymerase activity 20 to 40%. In contrast, addition of NaCl at concentrations greater than 0.1 M significantly reduced polymerase activity. The 21K peptide appeared to alter the general affinity of the polymerase for DNA. The rate of RNA chain initiation was not affected by the 21K peptide, but RNA chain elongation was stimulated. Both the 21K peptide and NaCl increased the asymmetry of transcription of SP82 DNA by phage-modified polymerase. The 21K effect was related to the stimulation of elongation while high concentrations of NCl appeared to act at RNA chain initiation. RNAs synthesized in vitro by polymerase lacking and supplemented with the 21K peptide were translated by a Escherichia coli cell-free system. The 21K peptide had little direct effect on the selection of promoters in vitro as measured by this technique, but it dramatically increased the translatability of the product."

https://openalex.org/W2061198695,"Three adult male rhesus monkeys were tested daily with intact adult female partners over the course of four or five mentstrual cycles. The males were made permanently anosmic by chemical ablation of the olfactory epithelium after the second or fourth cycle was completed. All males continued to display typical cycles of copulation with their partners after the anosmia procedures, with the shortest latencies to ejaculation occurring during the periovulatory phase of the partner's ovulatory cycle. Hence, female attractivity and cyclic copulatory performance of rhesus monkeys are not dependent upon olfactory signals."

https://openalex.org/W2092092639,"Abstract 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) suppresses pigmentation in Syrian hamster melanoma cells in vitro, and this suppression is reversed by the addition of deoxycytidine (dCyd) to the culture medium. Exogenous dCyd also decreases the incorporation of BrdUrd into nuclear DNA. Over a certain range of dCyd concentrations, however, increasing the concentration of dCyd does not lead to any significant further decrease in the level of BrdUrd incorporation. With 0.5 μM BrdUrd in the medium, increasing the dCyd concentration from 0.4 mM to 1.0 mM produces essentially no detectable change in the amount of BrdUrd incorporated. This is the range of dCyd concentrations, however, in which the addition of dCyd has the greatest effect in reversing the suppression of pigmentation caused by BrdUrd. The effects of dCyd on pigmentation are prevented by aminopterin, which blocks the conversion of dCyd to thymidine nucleotides. The results suggest that dCyd reverses the suppression of pigmentation caused by BrdUrd through a mechanism that does not involve changes in the amount of BrdUrd in nuclear DNA, and that the effect of dCyd on pigmentation depends upon the conversion of the exogenously supplied dCyd to thymidine nucleotides."

The genes coding for these two antigens are present in only 37 and 24 percent of normal controls. In animal models Ia antigen genes are closely linked to immune response genes. Our findings suggest that two such genes may be required for the development of sicca syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1581567568,"The 7- to 10-fold increase in the rat liver serine:pyruvate aminotransferase activity after glucagon administration was shown to occur mainly in the mitochondrial matrix of parenchymal cells. The enzyme was purified from glucagon-treated rat liver mitochondria to apparent homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A specific rabbit antibody was prepared against the purified enzyme. Upon Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis, the mitochondrial extracts of glucagon-treated rat liver produced a single and fused precipitin line between the purified enzyme against the antibody. The supernatant fraction of glucagon-treated rat liver and the mitochondrial extracts of normal liver were also shown to make a single and fused precipitin line with the purified enzyme, when applied in large quantities. The quantitative immunotitration demonstrated that the glucagon-induced increase in the activity of liver serine:pyruvate aminotransferase were accompanied by the parallel increase in the amount of the enzyme antigen. Isotopic leucine incorporation studies showed that the relative rate of synthesis of the enzyme was increased approximately 10-fold by glucagon administration under the conditions employed. The rate of the degradation of the aminotransferase in the normal rat liver was a relatively slow process with a half-life of approximately 30 h. Thus the accumulation of serine:pyruvate aminotransferase in rat liver mitochondria by glucagon treatment can be ascribed mainly to the rise in the rate of enzyme synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2001641514,"Patterns of polypeptide synthesis in wing, leg and eye-antenna imaginal discs and in whole larvae of wild-type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster have been examined using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. After 2 hr of labeling with 35S during the third larval instar, the synthesis of more than 318 polypeptides has been detected in imaginal discs. Of these, 268 are present in similar amounts in all three disc types. The remaining polypeptides detected in the three imaginal disc types fall into two categories: those unique to a particular disc type, and those specific for a particular pair of disc types. These results are discussed in relation to the spectrum of gene expression in imaginal discs."

(1973) Biochemistry 12, 5127-5134), using (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, agarose, and DEAE-Sephadex. The enzyme so obtained was homogeneous by criteria of both standard and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and of constant specific activity throughout the elution profile on DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The enzyme has an apparent Mr of 212,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, a Mr of 26,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, and each of the subunits contains approximately 1 g atom of zinc. These data and the excellent correlation between the number of lysine and arginine residues per subunit, and the number of tryptic peptides obtained by peptide mapping, suggest that spinach carbonic anhydrase is an octamer consisting of identical or very similar subunits. Its amino acid composition is similar to parsley carbonic anhydrase; both contain large numbers of half-cystine residues relative to erythrocyte carbonic anhydrases. The spinach enzyme is devoid of disulfide bonds. The enzyme is stable around neutrality at -14 degrees, as a suspension in saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution."

https://openalex.org/W1521611856,"Two sets of anti-glycosyl antibodies have been isolated by affinity chromatography methods from the antisera of rabbits immunized with a vaccine of nonviable cells of Streptococcus faecalis, strain N. Both types of antibodies are directed against a dineteroglycan of glucose and galactose present in the cell wall of this organism. The members of one set, anti-galactose antibodies, combine with the terminal lactose residues of the glycan and the member of the other set, anti-lactose antibodies, combine with terminal lactose residues of the same glycan. Each set of antibodies is composed of multiprotein components. The electrofocusing method had been used to isolate the individual antibody proteins in homogeneous states as shown by both electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation techniques. Since the components of each set combine with the same structural unit of the antigen, they have been designated as isoantibodies. The sedimentation constants, electrophoretic properties, carbohydrate constituents, and amino acid compositions of the two sets of antibodies are recorded."
